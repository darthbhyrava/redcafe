Di Maria makes his debut against Burnley. Let's see some of your magic Angel

2~~~
I am so fecking excited.

3~~~
Starting in a midfield 2 alongside Fletcher, Mata further up.

4~~~
Lets not expect magic from the get go. Hope he has a great game though, we need to start picking up points.

5~~~
A Di Maria hat trick is just what we need.

6~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's starting in a 2 man midfield with Fletcher, Good luck Angel, you're gonna need it!

7~~~
Whats the XI?  Hoping he hits the ground running!

8~~~
I hoped I will never see him in midfield two for us(especially not alongside Fletcher) and it will happen in the first game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9~~~
Going from Modric/Alonso to Fletcher, Young and Valencia... poor guy. You need to be a bit good, Angel.

10~~~
He's better in midfield than on the wings, seeing as we broke the British transfer record to get him it makes sense to play him in his best position and not on the wing.

The biggest question was whether he could play that central role in a 3-5-2 which we will get an indication of today.

11~~~
Midfield two alongside Fletcher is obviously far from position he played for Madrid in midfield. I actually think that he would be more comfortable as a wingback than in this position. Let's wait and see but I think he won't be playing this position anymore apart from today(or if he does it will be very rarely) considering we are thin in the midfield at the moment.

12~~~
He's playing in central midfield which is his best position. The question is how that position suits a 3-5-2 which is what we'll see now. It's also not something we have seen before, so I wouldn't be too hasty making predictions.

There's certainly nothing indicating that he'll play some sort of double pivot holding role with Fletcher and he could well play with the same freedom he had centrally for Madrid. 

With three centre backs in a 3-5-2 the two midfielders can play the position differently. He won't be as restricted as you think.

13~~~
We'll switch to 4-3-3 later in the game, I'd like to think.

14~~~
Playing him in the middle is going to expose him to a lot of tackles today, it is not the best match to have your debut in but bloody hell it is exciting to see him play.

15~~~
Is there a chance it's Rooney in midfield and Di Maria up top? Would make more sense IMO.

16~~~
This isn't the type of midfield job he had in Madrid. I can see him struggling today, but I'm hopeful he'll have a great start to his career here, always important.

17~~~
So exciting to see him play. He's not a midfielder who can be part of a midfield 2 I think but he'll be a huge improvement on cleverley or whoever else we planned on putting there so it's not a big deal. The game against qpr will look completely different with everyone back and the signings in the team.

18~~~
How would it make more sense when Rooney's best position is up top and Di Maria's is in midfield?

19~~~
I never thought of that. That's actually quite a good idea. Worth a try.

20~~~
Because he trained for 2 days with the team, so IMO shouldn't be given so important role in midfield (with Fletcher, remember), and RVP-Di Maria makes more sense than Rooney-RVP. 
This is NOT his natural position, trust me, I have seen a lot of him last season.

21~~~
Very excited to see him play.

22~~~
It's hard to say because we haven't seen it yet. How the 3-5-2 works with him is new territory.

For example if we pushed Jones up into midfield to make a trio of Jones/Fletcher/Di Maria then I'm sure you would say that gives him a similarly attacking role he had at Madrid and that he could play freely in that line up.

In the 3-5-2 Jones is just playing 10 yards further back as a CB as opposed to a DM. There's still three defensive players there. It's a minor difference. If we can get to grips with it and the defenders can play the roles properly - big question right now - then it could work fine for him IMO.

Its certainly not a sure thing but I'm not surprised it's being tried. If it doesn't work then I think Van Gaal will buy another midfielder and move to a diamond, as in the example above where Jones is moved to midfield except with a bigger name. Either way I think the intention will be to play him centrally.

23~~~
What odds can I get that he'll limp off injured after half an hour?

24~~~
That interview on BT Sport just now was great.

25~~~
People expecting to see him with his magic feet and flying pace, I think the general consensus after the game will be surprise at the fact he can play such a hard working central midfield role.

26~~~
But that's not his best position in midfield. I agree that his best position is in midfield but with two more defensive player than him alongside him, and I am quite sure we won't see that with Mata there.
If it's 352 he'll be playing double pivot pairing Fletcher IMO, or you are expecting Fletcher to play that holding role with pair of Mata and di Maria ahead of him?

27~~~
That's too much pessimism, even for me.

28~~~
I was rewatching the champions league final earlier, this time specifically watching Di Maria. When Madrid didnt have the ball he looked like any other winger playing in a midfield 3, he switched off with his marking of opponents and walked back into position when moves broke down. We could be in big trouble today if he does the same

On the other side of the coin, he looked to get the ball into the box every second touch he took, with the occasional dribble past 2 players from deep

29~~~
That's not cool.

30~~~
Well I partially address that here in the post below. 

The point is that we don't know how it will work in a 3-5-2. I agree that he plays better with two behind him, which is effectively four as it consists of two midfielders and two centre backs. Here he has three centre backs and one midfielder behind him which is still four players. If the system is played properly then it won't be a huge difference. 

The biggest danger is that we start to see huge holes in front of the defence behind Di Maria - but you can get around that by 1. Pushing up and squeezing the  space, 2. Having defenders who step out of the back line and make a challenge. 

It won't definitely work and no body knows because it's not been tried before. It has a chance of working though so I'm not surprised it's being tried.

31~~~
I didn't expect him to be great defensively. But I expect him to chase and harry fantastically. Hopefully we get away with playing him in a two today, I doubt it will happen again.

32~~~
Just surreal seeing him in that shirt <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

33~~~
Doesn't seem like a position well suited for ADM in a midfield two, but if it works it will be absolutely genius. I think most great sides are created thanks to some original ideas which went the right way. ADM in the central midfield last season for Real for example which I think was a big reason to their CL success. 

Will have to wait and see, it will either be a stupid or brilliant move from LVG.

34~~~
Yea but he was part of a midfield 3 sometimes, and he did have the likes of alonzo khedira ronaldo bale and benzema to play with, which fletcher mata rooney and RVP are not exactly flexible in their mobility, so di maria was still only has good as the players around him

35~~~
Excellent start so far.

36~~~
Pace and quality <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Has started well.

37~~~
Having a player stretch his legs and go through the gears <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

38~~~
ADM already showing some of his magic
Too bad the rest of the lot aren't following him

39~~~
On a different level from the other 21 players on the pitch and it shows.

40~~~
I mean, that move that Mata just cocked up… He nods it behind him to Young, then takes Young's return pass and flicks it behind him. Then takes the other return pass, accelerates then puts it on a plate for Mata. So smooth

41~~~
It's obvious he's so used to playing with Ronnie. He's playing with players half as fast as that Madrid side. Still, he looks glorious in our shirt.

He'll get an assist before the game is done.

42~~~
already love'em

43~~~
Notice how he is trying to go through the middle, yet when the others receive the ball their default function is to ping it out wide to two of the worst wingers in the PL. No wonder our play is so shit.

44~~~
Yeah it's a noticeable difference isn't it? The Manchester United way

45~~~
Please god, make it so that the rest of the team starts to play more like him than the other way round.

46~~~
In a good long while we've got actually got a player worthy of that #7.

47~~~
Yeah, I just read that, so fair enough, but I still think that would end up couple of meters deeper on the pitch than he should be used, he could be much more useful bit higher up the pitch.

48~~~
Already our best player by a distance in that first half.

49~~~
Wow, hes been here like two-three days? And already he looks miles ahead of the rest in the first game. Makes me exited and pissed at the same time. Excited, because we have got quite a player on our hands and pissed because he can come inn and show the others up like this.

50~~~
Quality wise he's standing out like a sore thumb there today, playing lovely through balls, whipping in decent crosses and making surging runs through the middle. If we could only click in the final third now.

51~~~
Took 10 minutes before he established himself as our best player.

52~~~
It's scary how much better than our other players he looks already. Just pray to god we don't bring him down to our current level.

53~~~
Solid enough debut, could and should have had about 3 assists if we could finish our chances. So much quicker and sharper than the rest of the team, it's a tragedy seeing him having to play with our dross.

54~~~
Great debut in a shockingly bad team. Shows how even in a midfield role, he likes to drift around and carry the ball...to put an end to the myth that he only shined as a central midfielder at Madrid.

55~~~
He had an excellent debut.

56~~~
Poor guy. Great footballer in a diabotical team.

57~~~
He is just a class above the others.

58~~~
He looked superb at times today, actually as if he was going to create something which is more than can be said for a lot of them.

59~~~
Better to sit on Madrid's bench than to be part of this team IMHO but I'm so fecking glad he's joined us. A real footballer in a shower of shit.

60~~~
Not a bad start. Just a shame some of them out there were clearly not on the same wavelength.

61~~~
God I'm praying that he doesn't adjust his level to the level of dross we're witnessing from rest of our 'players'. Please Angel, keep your swagger.

62~~~
The question is will he make the rest of the attack rise to a higher level or will they drag him down?

63~~~
"I've made a huge mistake."

64~~~
He showed his individual class in moments today but of course he still lacks familiarity with the other players which showed itself in some misunderstandings on the pitch today.

65~~~
With the amount of dross around him, it will be hard not to get infected.

66~~~
A diamond in a sea full of shit.

Poor lad.

67~~~
It is more likely they drag him down than him lifting that toothless bunch by himself. There is only so much one player can do.

68~~~
Yep, pleased with his debut, but still I don't think he'll be playing there.

69~~~
Played well.Did better than the other players , but the comments in the match day thread were a bit dramatic.

70~~~
He looked by far and away your best player, but will he be able to play alongside this calibre of player?  It seemed like he was expecting players to be making runs and they weren't.

71~~~
If the system changes then it's because of issues unrelated to Di Maria - specifically the wingbacks and defence. 

Di Maria is absolutely fine there and looked great.

72~~~
What the 2 pages  based purely on one pass to RVP?<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

It's allowed considering you havent had such quality in a long time.

73~~~
From winning the CL to getting rugby tackled at Burnley.

74~~~
Yes, several of his passes went out because our statue players just weren't moving.

75~~~
Echo this sentiment. It's a genuine concern because he could easily get dragged down rather than the others step up and meet the bar he's set in his debut.

76~~~
He must have been looking around at the likes of Fletcher, Young, Valencia, Anderson and wondering if he's joined the right club. Going from Alonso, Modric, Ronaldo et al to that is a drastic step down

77~~~
Easy, he did look good at times but he was far from great.

78~~~
I could tell his passes were intended for movers and not just bad passes (Mata Fletcher Rooney RVP) because they would have been absolutely abysmal passes otherwise and he wasnt doing that.

79~~~
Decent first game for him, some great balls, but plenty of miss hit ones aswell. Will take him time to get used to playing with our players, but it looks like he is settling quickly.

80~~~
Can see what he brings to the side.

We need to open the chequebook again beyond Blind though as he seems to be the only one we have currently able to drive forward and create.

81~~~
The new "good" is "great".

82~~~
He's the best player in the team hands down.  His quality makes the claims of Rooney being World Class™ hilarious.

83~~~
feck, I missed that.

84~~~
Some Twitter chatter that he is injured. Hopefully nonsense.

85~~~
Chose the wrong pass occasionally, or he'd overhit it a bit, but he's been here two days, so it's to be expected. He still looked the most threatening for us. His work to get the ball off the full back in the 2nd half was excellent. Made some good runs with the ball to drive forwards. Looking forward to seeing more of that.

86~~~
I'd love to see Wilson on the end of the passes he was putting through today. Think they'll link up well given the chance.

87~~~
We've signed him? Woo-hoo!

And Blind?

Who cares about the draw? 

Just got off a sailing boat I've been on for a week and I like the news. Perspective bitches (or maybe I just aven't seen the games yet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>).

88~~~
He's been here two days and was our best player in system he's never played in before. 

But no, please continue telling us how he can't play this position <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

89~~~
Calling Rooney world class is just embarassing..

90~~~
The worrying thing is that given enough time, Di Maria's value might drop as his confidence wanes. 

United needs to be turned around ASAP.

91~~~
Although CM is our Achilles heel, and he did impress me today, i feel like he is wasted there.

I would like to see a 433 with ADM and Januzaj out wide and RvP/Rooney in the middle. 

---------------DDG----------------
Rafael---Jones-----Evans-----Shaw
--------Herrera----Blindt----------
--------------Mata---------------
Januzaj-----RvP/Rooney------ADM

92~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Welcome to the real world!

93~~~
Looked decent. Making his debut against Burnley was never going to do him justice as they are physical and he's only been here 2 days. If I was LVG I would have brought him on at either half time or 70 mins plus when they were tired. He should not have started at all.
He will still be amazing for us despite that pile of shit we were forced to watch today.

94~~~
I wish Valencia, Young and Anderson would be on a sailing boat. Somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle.

95~~~
He's far better deeper and centrally than on the wings IMO. Most certainly he is not wasted playing that role.

If we move to four at the back I suspect it will be a diamond and look like this,

---------------DDG----------------
Rafael --- Jones ---- Rojo ---- Shaw
----- Herrera - Blind - Di Maria ------
-------------- Mata ---------------
------ Van Persie - Rooney ------

96~~~
Rooney and RvP must have thought they are seeing things there today with some of the through balls and crosses he was delivering in. No wonder they and RvP in particular didn't know what to do with them as it's been a while since they've gotten service like that. The sooner they all click now the better.

97~~~
I agree. Hopefully the purchase of Blind and the return of both Herrera and Carrick will see him move further up the field. That being said, wasted or not, he is a hell of a lot better at CM than Fletcher, Cleverley or Anderson.

98~~~
I hope with the return of Carrick and Herrera and with Blind coming I hope we'll see him on the wing cause seein Young and especially Valencia on the wings is fu.king depressing. So is Januzaj sitting on the bench with those 2 turds playing.

99~~~
To be fair these claims about him stopped a long time ago. ADM  and DDG  are your world class players.

100~~~
Don't forget Evans.

101~~~
ADM is class.

We'll soon get that out of him.

102~~~
Our best central midfielder today, and he's not even a central midfielder. 

His debut was relatively standard and completely expected. Some great movement, vision and technique accompanied by some misplaced and overhit passes, which is fine for a debutant, especially one that left a quick moving Real Madrid side to our slow static football. 

Hopefully he isn't injured and with the return of Hererra he can be pushed up field closer to the back line of the opposition.

103~~~
As a central midfielder he reminds me a lot of Giggs. Before his legs went.

104~~~
So we bought a world class winger and then played him in the centre of midfield?

105~~~
Thankfully.  He's not even close to being a top class player anymore.  Occasionally he's very good; occasionally he'd fit in a sunday league team.

106~~~
Because  we had no other midfielder and he's at least experienced playing there.

107~~~
He's absolutely class.

108~~~
He played there in Madrid last season and was one of the best if not the best Madrid player overall.

Plus our horrible midfield situation.

109~~~
Aye, that's the exact comparison my mate made.  

He's a better midfielder than winger.

110~~~
He was ridiculously better than anyone on the pitch today.

111~~~
It's kind of depressing to see just how much better he is than his team mates.

112~~~
Just shows how many overrated players we have in the team when a 70% fit Di Maria comes in his first EPL game and easily looks our best player.

113~~~
To accomodate Bale and it was one season. That's the same as saying Jones is a right back because he played there last season.

I doubt that.

114~~~
It's amazing that he signed for us really. Woodward is a genius. 

On the evidence of the past three games, we're not going to be back in the CL any time soon.

115~~~
We need him on the wing, he is a match winner. Mata and Herrera in front of Blind. But yea, one of RvP or Rooney has to sit on the bench.

116~~~
Doubt it all you want. He is though. 

And it wasn't one season either as he played in midfield for Benfica.

117~~~
Such a classy player.. Can't wait until he's a 100%!

118~~~
If he stayed on, I think we would have snatched it, unfortunate he isn't 100% fit.

Oh well at least we had Ando to bring on.

119~~~
Says a lot about Giggs.

120~~~
It was one season and he was great there. 
Comparing Jones at RB and Di Maria in midfield is a bit.. Wrong..

121~~~
Why? It's the same situation, they're better in their preferred position. The difference is Di Maria is just a more competent player.

122~~~
Give di Maria time and he will regress into his shell, with the likes of mata, rooney and van persie. One of us, One of us, One of us.

a class above right now.

123~~~
Still pissed off at that refree, we didn't play well, but that were 2 stonewall penalties and he didn't even blink eye, ahole ! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

124~~~
Same situation but Jones isnt very good at RB, is he?

125~~~
The others must feel like shit, in one match (well 63 min was it ? ) he's showed he's comfortably better than the rest.

126~~~
Di Maria was on a different level to all our other players....was a delight to see him in a Utd shirt...Hard to believe that Rooney is probably on a much higher salary than him

127~~~
Where's the evidence that he's better on the wing? The comparison makes no sense. Di Maria has looked best in midfield, as that's where he played in his best season to date. Jones has looked better at CB than when he had to play right back.

128~~~
It isn't his preferred position. He played centrally at Benfica and also for Argentina, then when he was moved centrally for Madrid he had his best season at the club. His form on the wings was not at the level it has been in midfield.

129~~~
Yup, he was far more patchy as an out and out winger at Madrid. Easily his best season from the middle of midfield.

130~~~
Did you watch Madrid at all last year? He was excellent in midfield and while he was good on the wings in his previous years, he was much better in midfield.

131~~~
Any news on his injury?

132~~~
I agreed that he was our best player and I never said he can't <i>play</i> that position. Rooney picked MOTM in his first game there(and couple of other times too), but he never proved that he can play there.

133~~~
Di Maria is better in the role he played today than he is as a winger, getting the ball in those deep central areas gives him the option to drive at the heart of the defense, cut out wide or exploit his quality passing to pick out forward runners, you lose a lot of his best qualities if you play him purely as a winger. Him and Herrera in front of Blind/Carrick will be our midfield three this season IMO.

134~~~
Must say I was surprised with him today. I didn't expect him to be so comfortable without a midfield three, so well done LVG and ADM.

135~~~
Hopefully it's just cramp. As Michael Owen said, he was trying to stretch it out, and you wouldn't want to do that if it was a pull.

136~~~
My God what a talent!! As others have said - he's a class above everyone else! I actually feel sorry for him swapping Real to play with this shower of shite

137~~~
Thank God he has already won every title with RM so he can hopefully live with some shiteness for a while without losing patience!

138~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ej-1kK9ig8A?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

139~~~
Was great today, not world class but far better than anybody on the pitch and he only 70% fit, which shows frankly how much do we over-rate our strikers and Mata, he didn't need 4 matches to get his match fitness back like Rooney and Van persie seem to do.

140~~~
Adds pace to the team which has definitely been sorely missed. That and quality.

141~~~
No reasons to play him as a CM

142~~~
He played as part of a midfield 3, it would be better if he played the Mata role instead if he was playing in the centre.  It would all be better if we played 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 with him on the wing.

143~~~
Love him already

144~~~
We need a midfield 3 with a holding midfielder to bring out the best of him from last season. In a midfield two together with Herrara is a disaster waiting to happen. His work-rate is terrific and he has excellent ball-control, but he is not the kind of player who can dictate the play and sit in midfield like a CM. His best position is an attacking midfielder who can drift out wide to overload the flanks.

145~~~
Going from one of the quickest counter attacking team in football to one of slowest team in the bpl is capable of having a negative effect on his football ability.  Hopefully, Van Gaal makes some changes to our style of play before Di Maria adopts our zombie philosophy.

Nevertheless, good debut. He was easily our best player. Not surprised he came off when he showed signs of fatigue. We need to be wrapped him up in cotton wool if we want to make it into the cpl next season.

146~~~
He is brilliant at football. We're in for some exciting football this season.

147~~~
Yeah, I remember that being the case when Mata(?) came in at first too.

148~~~
And look whats happened. Not that I think the same will happen to ADM, hes a different class, but forgetting about the defence and midfield for a second there is still noone making  runs that will suit him very often.

149~~~
That's what he was doing today though. He drifted wide, got on the ball and broke forward. 

He'll never be asked to be a holding midfielder. In a 3-5-2 with a Herrera/Di Maria midfield then I imagine it will be Herrera playing more reserved.

150~~~
Exciting second half of the season. Dire first half. That's my guess.

151~~~
It's not fair to compare the other players on the team to Di Maria. He's absolute class. 

Poor guy is surrounded by shit.

152~~~
At least he'll enjoy the appreciation he'll get as our best player and not being in the shadow of Ronaldo and Bale at RM!

153~~~
Great watching him play today. Was incredible how easily he slotted in, looked like he'd been playing in that team for years.

Seems he'll have no trouble adapting to the Premier League, either. Was being rugby-tackled for most of the game, with zero protection from the ref, but he just got on with it.

154~~~
He's better than our other CMs?

155~~~
I felt bad for ADM at several points today.
I hope the rest of the team can raise their game as the season progresses, he cannot do it alone.

156~~~
I'd be delighted with that to be honest.

157~~~
He has pace and ability on the ball.  No one else really does except young Januzaj.

158~~~
Played ok today, could only do what he could really.
Watching him was weird though, it just felt he was always one step ahead of the rest of our players today. He was seeing things before they happened. Very direct also, which we need

159~~~
I just hope his level doesn't drop to the levels Rooney and RVP are playing at.

160~~~
He joins De Gea and RVP/Rooney when they're a lone striker on the list of players good enough to be really top-class:

--------RVP/Rooney-----
LW---------------------RW
----DiMaria-----CM------
-----------DM------------
LB----------------------RB
------CB------CB---------

so hopefully Van Gaal can develop Januzaj, some other winger or Mata can get his groove back, Herrera, a new DM, Shaw, Rafael, Jones and maybe Rojo or another CB in to starters of that quality.

161~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaMg_wj_FsQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Match comp is up.

162~~~
De Gea is good too.

I bet that Di Maria was excited that we obviously wanted him so bad (the massive fee is the evidence for that) after Madrid jerked him around and he figured it was safe to sign for us even with how poor we've been post-Fergie since we have Rooney, Van Persie, Mata, Herrera, Rojo and De Gea who he's played with or against, but that our current standard of football is shocking.

163~~~
DDG isn't included as a GK is such a different player to the rest.

164~~~
The moment he went off - our chance to get a goal in the game disappeared! That just shows the difference in class between di maria and the rest of shite out there.

165~~~
He will get dragged down to the rest of their levels after a few games, it happened with Mata, it'll happen with him.

166~~~
I missed the first half. Some of those passes are just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> He just has that RVP circa 2012 quality look about him.

167~~~
I am afraid of this aswell. Which is why, I stated that Van gaal needs to make some changes to our starting eleven and makes last minutes quality midfield buys. I do not care much about blind, but we should have panic bought William Carvalho and Vidal or kovacic.

168~~~
It is a certainty sadly, the style won't happen that quickly for Angel not to be contaminated.

169~~~
I can't stress how much he needs to be a wide plaeyr for us.. Mata and RVP would be so much more effective with a player of Di Maria on the wing, players know he's dangerous so he drags defenders out of position. Right now everybody knows our wide players are fecking dog shite, no need to defend them, just flood the middle.

170~~~
Di Maria looked pretty decent in the first half, but he must be worried about what he has gotten himself into.

171~~~
He is a superb player.

We have to play him further up though in my opinion.

172~~~
This worries me.

173~~~
I don't . He doesn't speak English, it's  an advantage now.  Just keep Valencia away from him.

174~~~
Imagine Valencia doing everything to become his best buddy and everyone notices it at the club and this allows Valencia to stay at the club and play more as his understanding with ADM would be optimal.

175~~~
That just is not going to happen, considering we spent the enormous sum of £60million buying him. You don't buy someone for that amount of money and then not play him in his best position. We've pissed away money in recent years but this would take some beating. 

He is absolutely world class as an attacking central midfielder and probably the best in that role in the world. As a winger he was very frustrating and not on the same level, it was unsurprising that he was dropped. He can play on the wings but you're not getting what you paid for and you're not getting a £60million player.

176~~~
He is going to be our best player (if he isn't already). It is was nice to see some pace in midfield and a player who actually tried to get the ball forward instead of pissing about with it then passing back to the centre backs.

177~~~
Only thing I'm worried about Di Maria is if his ability degenerates along with confidence if we don't improve as a team.

178~~~
It won't happen. It would have happened last season but it won't this time, we've signed some players who are capable of playing good football and that's why he won't flop like kagawa/mata. Those 2 didn't have players who play a similar brand of football to them  and that's why they 'stooped' down a level.

179~~~
He looked quality, can't wait till we see him at his best.

180~~~
He's a great winger... <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> We already have Juan Mata as a number 10, we don't need another. Jesus Christ LVG has stated this before, our squad is insanely imbalanced, another number 10 is not what's needed. I fully expect him to be played wide sooner rather than later, probably when we get our midfield back.

181~~~
Had a few beers but how about.

Angel Di Mariaaaaa
Comes from Ar-gen-tt-iiinna

In the tune of the Don't you want me baby chorus.

I've been signing in for the last 20 mins and I like it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

182~~~
Now he thinks Burnley are a good team, hopefully when we come to play a non-relegation team he'll treat it as though its a Classico.

183~~~
Shitty music, too many replies and half the screen cropped. Why has it become a trend on football videos?

184~~~
You can expect what you want I guess. 

He didn't play as a #10 today and didn't for Madrid either last season, or at Benfica where he played in midfield. It's a different position. He can play with Mata as he did today.

185~~~
The moment that happened it seemed we lost any interest in trying anything through the center and kept passing the for Valencia to cross it.

Di Maria wasn't brilliant or anything like that, but he did OK for a debut just a few days after joining, in a mediocre team playing dire stuff. He was certainly the one trying to play the right way and created the only two real chances we've had. He'll be big for us, but we need to make things right around him.

186~~~
The crop thing is because of copyright I think

187~~~
And apart from a couple of good passes, his most dangerous plays came when he bombed down the left hand side and ran at the defence.

188~~~
I think Mata could play as the LW. He could drift inside and have di Maria occupy some of that space with his good runs. With Shaw on the overlap too, I think we'd be okay having Mata, or maybe even Rooney there because Shaw and di Maria could make up for their lack of width.

189~~~
This. Flank Rooney/RvP with Januzaj and Welbeck with him as the third midfielder with a hunting license, his passing was sensational today and it will be lethal with players that actually bother to move around and attack through balls at pace.

190~~~

191~~~
Once Herrera and Blind are in midfield I think it will help. Then we can play Di Maria in a more advanced attacking role.

192~~~
You have someone better than him in his best position. We don't.

193~~~
Yeah, good point.

194~~~
Yep. BT logo still shows a few times so will probably get pulled at some point. Nice watch though.

195~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sadly, this is so true.

196~~~
Looks like he going to be great, just one thing concerns me, does anyone think the non CL next season clause in his contract is true?

197~~~
What clause?

198~~~
No idea tbh, there was talk of it on twitter before he signed, no idea if it's true, or just a wind up, can only assume the latter with the fee we paid.

199~~~
Thankfully when he talks to Aguero or Zabaleta at City they will tell him how hard it is to play at home against Stoke on a Saturday afternoon <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

200~~~
Superb!
Fearless and pragmatic.

201~~~
Thought he did very well. Tough place to make your debut but he did his job very well.

202~~~
What's Bale's best position and who is better than him there at Madrid?

203~~~
He was probably suggesting Bale's best position is actually on the left (where Ronaldo plays), which is fair as he has always put in his best performances on the left wing prior to his Madrid move. Even for Madrid in Ronaldo's absence, he excelled when on the left.

204~~~
Ah, fair enough. I think Bale's just as effective on the right, though. The difference between LW and RW is marginal, most players would be as good on one as the other (except Valencia). Plus, being on the right allows Bale to cut in onto his stronger foot.

205~~~
Yeah, while I don't disagree with Amol (Bale is more proven on the left, having been Spurs' best player there & having given some of his best Real performances from that side), I also feel that Bale is just as good on the right, or is nearing that stage (on a slightly unrelated note, mind), like you said. I think with his improved shooting and decision making, he's become a genuine weapon on the right (as you said once more, down to cutting in on his left). Another year or so of consistent playing time there & we should see a bigger transformation. I'm sure he'll be much better on the right in a few years than he ever was on the left.

That said, though, i'm not sure if the difference in LW & RW is really marginal. Perhaps with many modern wingers it is (Ribery, Bale, Ronaldo, Nani, Di Maria etc), where they are very capable of playing on either side because the modern winger is quite close to an attacking midfielder (they have essentially removed the need for an AM, as they drift inside so much, such has been the surge of wingers playing on their opposite side in the last decade or so), but I don't think it applies to all the wingers, though - i'd say only the top quality ones or the regular ones who are extremely two-footed (with good shooting on the other foot). I'd say that the rest of the wingers are all clearly better on one side. I feel like (see Bale) playing on your opposite side (as in, left footed on RW) allows you to develop more as a player if you have a very wide skill-set and certain individual/goal-scoring traits (eg Ronaldo, Robben), but not all wingers are like that (eg a young Giggs, Valencia, Lennon, Robben, young Robinho, Overmars, Navas, Beckham). I agree, however, that it is becoming more of a trend to see wingers that are capable on both sides. A while ago, you were either a left or right winger. Nowadays, you are a winger, perhaps with a 'preferred' side if any at all.

Sorry to detract from the thread!

206~~~
He did well. But it looked like he didn't realise how average the rest of the team were compared to him. They weren't on his level.

207~~~
Different class.  20 minutes in he was already our best player.

208~~~
Haha, rules on responsible spending don't apply to Madrid Vato. You should know that by now! 

There are some suggestions that it could be the same with James as well. Ancelotti has a tough task juggling him into the side.

209~~~
Even more impressive on second viewing.

It's astonishing how much of a cut above he is on his teammates. Completely on a different level and it'll take time for the team to adjust to him and vice versa, but he is still able to perform at a high standard like he did. Excellent team player too. Pressed quite well from the front and covered plenty of ground. Can't wait till he's fully bedded in and key players return from injury.

210~~~
The UCL clause bollocks was started by IndyKaila so wouldn't pay much attention to that.

211~~~
Christ, we have someone who can run at the opposition.

212~~~
Great début for Angel. Apart from Jones, who I also thought had a good game, Di Maria was a class above everyone else. Promising signs.

213~~~
Should have had two assists from a top quality pass to RVP and a great move to set it up for Mata on a plate.

214~~~
simply class. our team needs to get to his level...and we will. lots of change coming.

215~~~
If he has dribbling, pace and a great shot he has to play in another role.

216~~~
He had his best season as a cm. Granted he was the left sided midfielder in a 3 man midfield, but he was a midfielder. I think he played in a 2 man midfield vs Burnley due to LVG preferring a back 3. Without the injuries, there would be no worry of either Young or Valencia playing as a fb so he would use Di Maria in a 3 man midfield rather than the role he had vs Burnley.

217~~~
He also has fantastic work rate and good passing which are key traits in midfield. Being a good dribbler doesn't automatically mean you should be a winger or forward. Look at Iniesta, being able to dribble up the centre of the pitch is extremely valuable and a great weapon in a centre mid's arsenal. Same with Di Maria. I think in a vacuum we're better off with him in the centre, should be able to get involved more and less chance of him being isolated. Where he will ultimately play most of his football for us will depend on the other options available in terms of players and the tactics we settle on.

218~~~
He looked fantastic today, pace power and skill. I really enjoyed watching one of the Burnley players have 4 attempts to foul him, couldn't stop him and resorted to tripping him over with his hands.

219~~~
I blame you for the video being blocked, but I put it back up:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaMg_wj_FsQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

220~~~
Maria seemed super human compared to everyone on the field. You can just imagine what a front three of ronaldo, bale and maria would do in the premiership.

What annoys me with transfers like this is that, when he was linked to a move to Madrid, we all knew he was going to be class. Just sign him there and then. This has happened with a number of players, and teams.

221~~~
Can't wait to see him along side Herrera and Blind. Plus Shaw and Rafael back in the team. We are building a very good team again another couple of key buys and we are up there again imo.

222~~~
Any news on his injury?

223~~~
He wasn't injured just had cramp. LVG said he took him off as he was tired and didnt want to take any risks.

224~~~
Really like him in his new midfield role. Almost Iniesta esque at times.

225~~~
He was so superior to the other players it was scary

226~~~
Ramos almost with his second.

Sorry, wrong thread.

227~~~
I think Angel Di Maria would be wasted in CM in a midfield three. At Real Madrid they could afford to play him there because they had the quick and explosive Ronaldo and Bale up front. We don't have enough pace in the attacking areas. I think he should be played as a winger or the attack midfielder in the 4-2-3-1.

228~~~
Wasn't sure where else to put this:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/angel-di-maria-carlo-ancelotti-says-former-player-moved-to-manchester-united-for-money-9704552.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...d-to-manchester-united-for-money-9704552.html</a>

Anchelotti can do one <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

229~~~
Almost forgot we signed Di Maria in all the drama today.

230~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Clearly annoyed he lost his most important player after Ronaldo and got beat by Real Sociadad soon after!

231~~~
Vela with the 4th now...

Sorry, couldn't resist

232~~~
And just a tad rich coming from Real Madrid, the main culprit in inflating prices and egos! Plus he was undervalued there.

From an ESPN interview, transcript and translation from AS

<b>Di María: "I stayed at Madrid because of Cristiano"</b>
Manchester United midfielder reveals how Portuguese fought his corner at Madrid when it appeared he would be forced to leave.
  by  JESUS AGUILERA

Ángel di María granted an interview to ESPN in which he spoke about his departure from Real Madrid, and said that he stayed as long as he did largely because of his friendship with Cristiano Ronaldo. "The Noodle" is however happy with the moment he chose to leave the club, immediately after winning the Décima.

"The truth is I have a great friendship with Cristiano Ronaldo. He always supported me at every moment and when it looked like I was going to leave he fought my corner and the truth is thanks to him I was at Real Madrid last season. I ended up winning the Champions League in the year when it seemed I would leave; I left in the best way possible, with the Décima," Di María said.

Manchester United: "I'm very excited to come to such a big club, I never thought things would happen like this. I have to adapt as quickly as possible to help the team."

The number 7: "It's a nice thing to wear a shirt that so many great players have worn. For the club, the number 7 is very important. It's the number the best players have worn. It's great, but it doesn't add any pressure for me."

Premier League's most expensive: "You don't think about those things, you think about working hard and doing the best you can. I am grateful to Manchester United for paying what Real Madrid wanted, and for wanting me as much as I wanted to come here. They didn't try and knock Madrid down by a single pound and that means a lot to me. I will try to give everything for this club."

Differences: "Training sessions are more physical than in Spain. In football terms, the players are very strong, very fast and I have to adapt to that as quickly as possible to improve all the time."

Van Persie and Rooney: "It's great. For me it was a dream to play in the Premier League with Manchester United and I'm more than happy to play with such important players, with some that I watched on television as a kid."

Messi and Ronaldo: "Playing alongside the two best players in the world is amazing and I'm really happy that I have been able to do so."

Martino: "From what Leo and Mascherano have told me he is a great person. He likes hard work and he likes to have a content and united squad. I hope it goes well for us."

234~~~
Has anyone got that youtube video which shows his amazing volley cross to Ronaldo (who missed the header?)

235~~~
I am surprised this thread is only 6 pages, why are we forgetting him because of Falcao. 

Anyway, his recent comments 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/international-friendly/story/2017745/angel-di-maria-questions-argentina-friendly-with-germany" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/international...ria-questions-argentina-friendly-with-germany</a> 

I like that part where he say , "It's true we have not won yet but we will put United where they'll belong this season. You'll see."

236~~~
Meh. Talk is cheap. How many times did Moyes and the players talk about improvements having to be made and blabla last season.

237~~~
Eh? Big difference when Moyes made that talk to when proven winners like Di Maria or LvG do it.

238~~~
I also mentioned players. Evra, Rooney etc. My point is, I'm ignoring all this big talk of us coming back. Much rather see it being proved on the pitch, instead of seeing the team amble around aimlessly on the pitch like they were against Burnley.

239~~~
Di Maria was brilliant there as he didn't remain there through the game. He moved to the wings when Ronaldo moved centrally. That gave him the space to actually exploit his pace with the markers trying to tie Ronaldo down. Not sure if we will see him have the same effectiveness here but if Falcao can rediscover his form, Di Maria would be awesome for us with his assists.

240~~~
Top class negotiating from Woodward!

241~~~
Moyes said he would try, Di Maria, Falcao, et al said they will. Key difference.

242~~~

Best player we signed this summer, still can't believe it! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

244~~~
Good read. Oh and we see here again that despite all kind of Ronaldo's ego trips and on pitch celebrations about himself, he can be such a friendly and helpful guy and really seems to fight for ppl he likes. Not the first time we have heard things like that about Ronaldo.

245~~~
“They want their team to win. I do as well. We need to try and improve how we are playing. We need to try and improve our results.

Good man, already annoyed about friendlies. Says sometimes it's better to avoid them!

PSG: "Di Maria preferred us"  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://m.skysports.com/article/football//9454423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://m.skysports.com/article/football//9454423</a>

Paris St Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi believes Angel di Maria wanted to move to his club - and not Manchester United - from Real Madrid in the summer transfer window.
The Argentina international sealed a move to Old Trafford for a record British fee of almost £60m last week.
Al-Khelaifi reckons the only reason the 26-year-old did not move to the Parc des Princes was because PSG could not agree a fee with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez.
"For two or three weeks I discussed this issue with my friend Florentino Perez, the president of Real Madrid," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We met twice, we made an offer, but we did not agree on the price. For me it was too expensive. It has nothing to do with Financial Fair Play. The player wanted to come to Paris, but this was not possible."
The French side have invested hugely in players over the past couple of years, signing the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Luiz. 
Al-Khelaifi claimed Financial Fair Play (FFP) was not a fair rule and said his club would meet with UEFA to urge them to reconsider it.
"We want to respect the rules of UEFA," he said. "But we must discuss it again in October with them to try to change the rules.
"This is very important because Financial Fair Play is not fair. It is sometimes difficult to understand, but in the end, the big clubs are big clubs and small clubs remain small. It not only represents the interests of PSG. If new investors can not invest in football, they will invest in Formula One."
PSG, along with Premier League champions Manchester City, were handed a heavy fine in May for breaching FFP regulations.

Classic case of The Fox and the grapes

250~~~
My Favourite article this year<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Feck PSG and there jealousy, they are like a spoilt rich kid at Christmas that didn't get what was on their list. Unlucky P$G and Nasser Al-Khelaifi not this time, this transfer is for Lucas Moura. I love the way they say the FFP rule is not fair. I wonder what every other team in the French league minus Monaco thinks of that. This is a team with no history and completely manufactured by an Oil sugar Daddy. The only reason any player wants to go there besides the money is Paris. What a fecking joke of a club<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

251~~~
He can be seriously rapid can't he? Wow! Once we can find a permanent position for him in the team either as a winger or a midfielder, he will become a huge asset for us. I think he's going to become an assist machine for our Goal Machine (in prospect) Falcao.

252~~~
Starting vs Germany. Not sure, but my site shows he is being played in AM position.

253~~~
great pace by our ADM there

254~~~
good turn and shot there

255~~~
Has quite a free role today. Been all over the place roaming so far.

256~~~
I love that he starts with Rojo on the left side. That is brilliant for LVG who can see how they play together. You just never know how well a winger/full back combination will perform before you see it.

257~~~
Having a really good game our Angel.

258~~~
He's absolutely top class.

259~~~
Started on the left but is switching to the right from time to time.

260~~~
Kramer pretty impressive so far, would like to have him in our team.

261~~~
He's a genuine superstar isn't he? I already think he's my favorite player at United and he's only been here two weeks

262~~~
brilliant by Di Maria

263~~~
Top class assist with the outside of his boot.

264~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Still think Valencia is the better crosser though.

265~~~
Great assist!

266~~~
What a pass. Incredible.

267~~~
What a feckin cross that was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

268~~~
That. Is word class. Feck!

273~~~
My God Di Maria!

274~~~
Brilliant.

275~~~
Been causing problems for Germany so far.

Edit: Just as I finish typing this he gets an assist.

276~~~
Great assist but given way too much time on the ball.

277~~~
Great Manchester combo there!

278~~~
Delightful.

279~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

280~~~
he can play right wing for us alright

281~~~
Nice finish from Falcao too.

282~~~
Fecking hell, missed it! Decided that the England match is not for me, despite being an Englishman.

283~~~
His dribbling has the defending players terrified so he always has enough space for a pass or a cross of quality. Takes a brilliant player to turn that situation to something dangerous. 

His cross field passes/crosses are becoming increasingly impressive.

284~~~
Great Assist, different class hope Valencia & Young are watching

285~~~

286~~~
Just imagine what kind of cross would Valencia try there and try not to cry.

287~~~

288~~~
Oh that's naughty.

289~~~
Cross? he would have smashed it over to Ashley Young on the other side of the field.

290~~~
That my dears, is a true world class player at the peak of his powers <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

291~~~
Anyone got vine/gif of the goal/assist

292~~~
DDG
Rafael Jones Rojo Shaw
Herrera Blind Mata
Di Maria Falcao Rooney/RvP

Would that work?

293~~~
He's toying with Germany. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Pity about the shot.

294~~~
Good run from him there.

295~~~
Causing Durm all sorts of problems.

296~~~
Destroying Germany so far, what could have been for them if he didnt get injured.

297~~~
Aguero wasnt really match fit too.

298~~~
Nah, he would smash it into defenders legs. Maybe even win a corner.

299~~~
Argentina would win the WC if he wouldn't get injured.

300~~~
Same amount of United players playing for Argentina as there are for England tonight.

301~~~
Few posts above.

<a class="username" data-user="64859, @Joemo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64859/">@Joemo</a>  Nice one

yeah and Reus, Gündogan, Gomez, Lars Bender, Sven Bender, Kramer, and Khedira too

oh wait

304~~~
Got it, cheers

305~~~
To be fair Germany are missing like 5 or 6 players from the World Cup final.

306~~~
Not a crazy claim at all. He's a gem.

307~~~
haha Kramer played, Gomez is crap, Khedira played too?, Reus ok, Gündogan ok, the Benders would sit on the bench

308~~~
A corner that Ando was somehow taking at the weekend. How did I watch that game? fecking hell. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

309~~~
Germany would be better off playing with 10 men than with Gomez!

310~~~
Argentina look good with Aguero as the front man flanked by two widemen, one being the amazing Di Maria. Messi who?

In fact, where is the little midget?

311~~~
Kramer played well and played for like 20 mins till he got killed
Gomez is the best German scorer in CL history
Khedira didn't play
With Gündogan Khedira and Kramer out either of the Bender would have played. They were both ahead of Kramer pre WC anyway.

312~~~
It was 0:0 after full time. It was pretty even match. Argentina lacked that something special and i think Di Maria would brought just that.

313~~~
Di Maria is a winger, so obvious. Hopefully he isn't used as a CM for us.

314~~~
Considering how tight the game was, a player like di Maria could have made the difference. You could say the same about reus though.

315~~~
Did you see him raising his hands at least 3 times while taking it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

316~~~
Why not? He's brilliant there too.

317~~~
He is, but we need his quality out wide more than in the middle in my opinion, quality on the wings will help our central players tenfold. Right now teams know we can't do anything wide, so they just defend from the middle.

318~~~
Another assist!

319~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

320~~~
And again! Brilliant.

321~~~
Assist machine

322~~~
U beauty!!!!

323~~~
Another assist <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

324~~~
superb

325~~~
What a cross!! That's all we need.

326~~~
Another good assist from him. Great to have a wide player again, who can actually cross.

Great finish from Lamela though.

327~~~
Di Maria setting it up again, terrible defending from Germany. 

Now take him off before he gets injured

328~~~
Second assist.

What a finish by lamela.

329~~~
Another assist. He's just fantastic!

330~~~
again

331~~~
He's brilliant everywhere across the front line. World class.

332~~~
He's been a nightmare for Germany so far. 2 assists.

333~~~
Now I'm really excited.

334~~~
He is brilliant everywhere and you miss a part of his talent wherever you play him. He is that talented.

335~~~
Argentina looks much better without Messi

everyone involved without the ball, and they look more fluid

336~~~
Outrageous finish to match.

337~~~
Lamela has been pretty good as well.

The front 3 of Argentina linking up.

338~~~
The feck am I watching England for.

339~~~
Hopefully LVG is watching Angel and will use him out wide, rather than partnering Darren Fletcher in the middle

340~~~
We will have Falcao at the end of those crosses instead of Lamela. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

341~~~
What a goal from Lamela. Di Maria is going to be some player for us.

342~~~
I still can't believe we got him. What were Madrid smoking?

343~~~
You can only smile when you see him play, what a fantastic signing for us <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

344~~~
We knew we were getting a gem, but this? It's incredible to watch him ripping Germany, the world champions, a new one!

345~~~

346~~~
Maybe because you are


 <span style="color: #ffffff">joke</span>

347~~~
Di Maria is genuinely on another level.

348~~~
Decent player.

349~~~
Neat finish from Lamela as well.

Valencia should take crossing lessons from Di Maria. Better late than never.

350~~~
Proves we should go for 4-2-3-1 so he can play further up the pitch.

351~~~
I wouldn't let Valencia anywhere near Di Maria. He might catch his gone to shit overnight disease.

352~~~
Just imagine a front three of Di Maria-Falcao-Reus! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

353~~~

354~~~
Gomez <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . I just enjoy when his type of players miss easy chances.

355~~~
Valencia would be writing a letter of apology and condolence to the family of someone sat in the opposite stand by now if he tried either of those crosses.

356~~~
Stop it Angel. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

357~~~
Great! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

On a side note, that Argentina away kit is beautiful.

Is Di Maria playing on the wing or in midfield?

358~~~
Di Maria is the best crosser in the game, I knew that already before this game.

359~~~
Bargain.

360~~~
Better without Messi

361~~~
And people say a player like him isn't a priority. Have they seen our crosses?

362~~~
Yeah, we definitely overpaid by 30m€ for him.

Best player in the league.

363~~~
Winger in proper 4-3-3

364~~~
Obviously still has it all to prove in the Premier League itself, but in terms of ability, he's surely the best player we've had at the club since a certain Portuguese departed (no I don't mean Bebe).

365~~~
Yet some say we bought a square peg for a round hole...madness. Time to enjoy this lad rip shite up.

366~~~
He's nothing to prove. He's clearly world class and will suit English football to a tee.

367~~~
But.. But.. We didn't need him..!

368~~~
I don't think Nani was that good. <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

369~~~
I'll admit I was worried about the price but feck me, I take it all back if he keeps performing the way he has tonight!

370~~~
Played ok but can play better.  He's on the right wing.  I agree, their away kit is very sharp

371~~~
Watching the match, he had a slow start but picked it up, he has been the best player for Argentina in the half, along with Aguero, he assisted both of the goals, but the first assist was out of this world. He should be played on the wing, he was constantly making the runs off the back of defender, Mata will find him all day, so glad we have him still can't believe it.

372~~~
No team is better without Messi.  It's a friendly without Germany's best XI, let's not get carried away.  That being said, Argentina look very motivated out there - outside of that stupid backpass from Mascherano

373~~~
Remember lads, ruining our identity. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

374~~~
Need to give him a sort of free role pretty much in a interchanging formation of some kind.

But we have sort of 3 static strikers to play now. Hmm....

375~~~
He's been ridiculous. Does anyone have a GIF or a vine of the second goal?

376~~~
Both gif and vine were already in this thread.

377~~~
World class players have failed here before, although I agree, he seems to have all the attributes to be a massive success. The fact that half our squad seem to be Spanish speakers now can't hurt with the acclimatisation either.

378~~~
Pissed off that I was watching that shower of shit England match. Didn't realise this was on BT Sport.

What position is he playing?

379~~~
I stand by my opinion that he is the best as a midfielder joining the attack from the left. To be honest right wing is probably his worst position from what I've seen for a few years.

380~~~
Right winger in 4-3-3

381~~~
Shat on identity

382~~~
Was about to laugh out loud at you and say that would never happen forgetting we already have 2/3 of them <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

383~~~
He played a lot on the right wing early on at RM but is best on the left, IMO.  It's worked well tonight, however

384~~~
Can we stop this sarcastic identity stuff in every thread ?

385~~~
Of course he did, in pre-Bale era. 

Left side feels much more natural for him, as he is very one-footed.

386~~~
The Caf's Identity Has Been Broken.

387~~~
3rd assist <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

388~~~
lol <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

389~~~
Another assist!

390~~~
3! What a player.

391~~~
Ridiculous freekick that one, beautiful.

392~~~
feck this...the boy can cross

393~~~
What the hell. Stop it, save some of the good stuff for United.

394~~~
Those crosses!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I came!!

395~~~
three assists !!!!!!!!!!!! :drools semen:
:

396~~~
Jesus

397~~~
Falcao will be ******* himself silly looking at this match.

398~~~
That's a Beckham ball that. Bangerang.

399~~~
Great delivery.

Why was Anderson taking our set pieces ?

400~~~
Assist machine.

401~~~
Doing well tonight, lets hope he doesn't translate this into the premier league!

402~~~
assist hat trick vs world champions <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

403~~~
You sexy beast.It's so nice to have a player to get really excited about.Havn't had a player so electrifing sinnce Ronnie.

'Kin 'ell!!

Shame he'll never get to take freekicks for us while Rooney is around, isn't it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

407~~~
feck me, third assist and what a cross.<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

408~~~
Jesus wept this guy is unreal.

409~~~
Stop it, Angel! Now you're just being silly!

410~~~
Well our problems with scoring goals could end if he will deliver that kind of assist. Saying that he delivered killer pass to Mata and RVP but they didn't scored.

411~~~
What position is he playing in tonight?

412~~~
Yesss lad

413~~~
Jesus christ!!!

414~~~
haahha no way

415~~~
and now he scores!!!!!!!!!!!!!

416~~~
Di Maria, have my kids!

417~~~
BPITW.

418~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Can't help but be excited, Rojo looks pretty solid too. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

419~~~
Oh my god!!He's on fire.

420~~~
Ok, I'm a little bit excited by this.

421~~~
What a  goal! Speechless.

422~~~
<3

423~~~
3 assists and 1 brilliant goal.

Like a boss. <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

424~~~
Jizz worthy.....

425~~~
Oh. My. God.

426~~~
fecking hell.

427~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this guy is outrageous!

428~~~
Been on another level tonight, thank feck it was us who signed him, can you imagine if he'd gone Chelsea or City <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

429~~~
And goal <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

430~~~
I reckon he just might make it here, just.

431~~~
Holy shi!!

432~~~
Bargain.

433~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

434~~~
Everywhere! Starting position in the first half seemed to be as a right winger, but he drifted around a lot.

435~~~
Shame the WC final lacked a healthy Kun & Di Maria

436~~~
Do they have another game or is he back to Manchester after this?

437~~~
Speechless.

438~~~
Brilliant ball by Mascherano. 

He's been great too. We should have maybe tried getting him though Barca probably won't sell.

439~~~
He looks alright.

440~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

441~~~
Such a classy finish. His runs and speed are just impressive, even if its just a friendly.

442~~~
Daylight robbery! This guy was worth every penny!

443~~~
Where the feck is <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

445~~~
Do not want.

446~~~
Wow <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

447~~~
Svhurrle! 2ndBPITW!!!

448~~~
I know our players never give a feck about friendlies but Di Maria is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> worthy tonight.

449~~~
WOW! Take him off and wrap him in something soft now!

450~~~
They only have one game, so back to Manchester I guess? Probably has to look for a house.

451~~~
Ridiculous performance. Destroyed Germany.

452~~~
1 goal and 3 assists

£60m was an absolute bargain <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

453~~~
thats how you chip Neuer Welbeck

454~~~
I switched to the game expecting to see his third assist. He scores a goal and I realise it isn't a replay of the third goal.

Ridiculous <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

455~~~
I can't take it anymore Di Maria please stop this. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

456~~~
Falcao please don't hurt yourself in excitement.

457~~~
So that's a United player, a Chelsea player, a City player, a Spurs player and a Swansea player all scoring in a Argentina versus Germany friendly.

458~~~
The run and his link up play pre goal were more amazing than the finish which itself was great.

459~~~
What a chip, the Argentinian Nani...

460~~~
Di Maria. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

461~~~
Every Argie must be wondering what could have been, if he was fit for the final...

462~~~
Another brilliant run.

463~~~
He'll be a great replacement for when Valencia is tired and we need a spark in the match

464~~~
Just ripped the fullback again. He's just taking the piss now.

465~~~
DiMaria's goal vs Germany

466~~~
Hes proved his point now, get him off.

467~~~
Nice.

Time to prepare for the QPR game.

468~~~
Rampage!

469~~~
Get Valencia to watch this performance and study it intensely immediately.

470~~~
He's ridiculous. Still hasnt sunk in that he's ours.

471~~~
you think? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>


<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

472~~~
It would be pretty nice to get him off now before Germans get him off.

473~~~
Di Maria is stunning. Absolutely stunning. 

Remember when we felt that 80kk was a bargain for Ronaldo? That's how Real fans must be feeling for Angel.

474~~~
Can they sub him off now pls <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

475~~~
Only fair after Real robbed us of Ronaldo. Hopefully he'll be to us as Ronaldo to Real as well!

476~~~
Can't believe we're losing our identity to players like this

477~~~
Except that's not Neuer.

478~~~
lol

479~~~
Why on earth would Madrid sell this player?

480~~~
How did we get this guy

481~~~
Angel Di Maria, Manchester United player.

482~~~
Falcao signing definitely put a small shadow over Di Maria signing. If LVG can get the best out of Mata, Di Maria and Falcao <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

483~~~
I don't even think that would help him.

484~~~
Absolutely ruining Germany

485~~~
Buying him was a massive mistake. The club is being run by morons

486~~~
would have gone in no matter who is in the goal. It was just too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

487~~~
well, he might return his wages

488~~~
£60m and £200k + a week. But still, feck money. He's ours.

489~~~
LVG are you watching? Take note, this is how you use Di Maria!

490~~~
Help him? I bet it was just a suggestion of a hobby he can take up as he gets benched long term.

491~~~
This is outrageous.He has absolutely ripped Germany to shreds.£60M too much?Like feck.Falcao must have jizzed allover himself at the sight of Di Maria's pure majesty.

492~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

493~~~
If not, then get shot of him in January. Literally, there is no point in him being here if he carries on putting in game after game the performances he's put in for us over the last couple of years.

If I had it my way, he'd never play a game for United again.

494~~~
Well said Rossi <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

496~~~
I'm not able to watch the game? Where is he playing for the Argies? One of the wings or in the middle?

497~~~
I agree.

498~~~
You almost forget we've signed both of them. Di Maria and Falcao. How can be possibly lose games with those two on the pitch?

On the right wing, destroying them so far.

503~~~
Why the identity talk here? Were people against ADM too? He is such a proper United type of signing, we've wanted him for a long time as well.

504~~~
Yep, have to agree, we needed Vidal and they bought us Di Maria, idiots <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> bunch of morons
<span style="color: #ffffff">I didnt mean it Woody, buy more Di Maria plz

a international friendly match changes everything! We might go back and judge Young by his preseason performances or Valencia by his performances from a couple of years ago.

So somehow LvG knew he would do well in this friendly against Germany and bought him entirely on the basis of this game that hadn't even been played yet? Your comment makes no sense. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

516~~~
Sorry....Just for a team that consists of young players, academy graduates, two academy prospects and an academy graduate as assistant manager, I think it's the biggest pile of crap I've ever read in regards to United.

517~~~
It doesn't work like that. You either have it or you don't.

521~~~
He had it. Then I don't know what the feck happened.

522~~~
His inner RAWK released itself there.

523~~~
he should take him off, the Germans going in now

524~~~
Meh, for Madrid that was usually his most inconsistent position if anything. Obviously still has the ability to play amazingly like today, but usually is more consistent on the left wing or left central midfield. Shows his versatility though and he's like Ronaldo or nani at his best in that if one side isn't working, he can switch and see if it's going better on the other side. Great option to have unlike having Valencia glued to the right.

525~~~
Add a fit Aguero and Argentina would have been favorites IMO.

526~~~
1 minute in, United 0-1 QPR. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

PR your banter is wasted here.
Germans are storming out with handbags clutched tight. No injuries please.

529~~~
They did the same to Spain 4 years ago, beat them 4-1 in Buenos Aires after the World Cup.  Pretty meaningless unfortunately.

Safe to say Di Maria is a key player for Argentina. They missed him epically in the WC final.

Not really sure if we overpaid for him that much.

535~~~
I haven't seen a performance of this quality and magnitude in a long <i>long </i>time! Absolutely world class performance. Hope he can replicate this for United.

536~~~
You still had best WC player for entire 120 minutes on.

537~~~
Imagine if we sign Reus next year....Reus and Di maria on wings instead of young and valencia...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

538~~~
Ok. It was a wee joke about the excitement following United's all conquering friendly win-a-thon in the summer.

539~~~
Uh, woosh? You do know he's a Scouser, right? And as a Manc it's my sworn duty to rip the piss? Of course I knew what he meant! Jesus.

540~~~
like having pele without garrincha

541~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/adm2pcs3v.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/adm2pcs3v.gif"/>

542~~~
Yeah, I'd say we overpaid by like 10m maybe but that's about it. He's one of the top 10, maybe 5 players in the world based on last season. The type of player Real Madrid would go all out to buy if they didn't have him basically <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

543~~~
Thank feck we didn't sign Romero. Can't catch a cold.

544~~~
He's so good, can't believe he's ours. Our next league game can't come soon enough!

545~~~
His change acceleration is remarkable. You don't know when he's going to pick it up and just bomb away.

546~~~
Romero really terrible.

547~~~
He'd be right to punch it, though.

548~~~
Rojo with a monster close-down and tackle.

549~~~
I think this has been the best performance in an international friendly since Zlatan got four against England.

550~~~
It's amazing how Real Madrid can replace such gem for the sake of a new 80 million toy. The guy also showing today that he can emulate Ronnie with his runs and cutting to the centre.

551~~~
Commentator just said that Di Maria got 4 red cards at Madrid. Never knew that..

552~~~
What the hell were Madrid thinking about?

553~~~
German commentator just said he has never seen a gk getting a cramp, he could have understood it if Angel Di Maria got one as he has been running all the time <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

554~~~
Well no I didn't know that thank you very much!! <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>




...proceed.

555~~~
Moved to United only for the money, according to Ancelotti. Yet plays like this in a meaningless friendly...

556~~~
Can those who came up with "overpaid", "not needed" etc. before please stand up and make yourself known.

Now, acknowledge that you are clueless.

557~~~
yes, and messi's three goals game against brazil

558~~~
No way, true story?

559~~~
Tata you tit. Take Di Maria off keep Aguero on.

560~~~
But he didn't scored against Burnley. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

561~~~
The kind of player that you should build a team around. Phenomenal performance

562~~~
Carlo's just bitter.

563~~~
No worries. Your comment was especially funny if you knew what I did for a living. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

564~~~
Yes. Also had one in Benfica.

565~~~
Thank feck he's off.

566~~~
A solid 85 minutes from him, hopefully that keeps him sharp until QPR.

567~~~
Di Maria comes off, wonderful performance we are a lucky lucky club to have such quality

568~~~
Its tit for tata

569~~~
Happy for Tata, already has given Argentina some spark.  A likable coach who knows Argentina football

570~~~
Where did he play tonight? Big problem with the Falcao signing is that it cements the 3-5-2, meaning he'll play central midfield permanently.

571~~~
He doesn't seem the type of player that suffers with fitness issues to be honest. He looks like he could run all day.

572~~~
He was ridiculously good tonight, 3 assists and a goal, fantastic player.

573~~~
it does not though. we can easily play 4-3-3 with the same 3 point attack. or a diamond if you prefer. van Gaal has done it a lot.

574~~~
Erm, scouses?

575~~~
van Gaal may decide to drop both Rooney and RVP having signed Blind so we can actually play with a midfield 3.

576~~~
<a class="username" data-user="66977, @united_99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66977/">@united_99</a>
<a class="username" data-user="69879, @ivaldo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69879/">@ivaldo</a> 

Di Maria's Madrid's red cards.

20.04.11 Copa del Rey Final against Barcelona 1:0, two yellows 85' and 120' + assist
24.09.11 La Liga against Rayo Vallecano 6:2, two yellows 17' and 57'
23.01.13 Copa del Rey Quarter against Valencia 1:1, straight red 88'
23.02.13 La Liga against Deportivo La Coruna 2:1, two yellows 89' and 89' + assist

577~~~
Lest we forget Di Maria, quality as he is, is exactly what we expect at United. This is the standard.

578~~~
Yeah he is like Thomas Müller in that regard. A skinny fecker that even after 120 minutes is till chasing every ball, they just don't get tired.

579~~~
he's so much more effective wide.....

if things continue the way they have started we will surely ditch it in favour of 4-3-3

580~~~
Exactly. He shouldn't look out of place - on another level - rather on par with the likes of Falcao, Mata, Rooney and van Persie.

581~~~
Yeah most of the people here seemed to have forgotten that its pretty normal to have 2-3 players like this in the squad and have gotten so used to average that we praise someone who simply had a normal match.

582~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

583~~~
Got a message from a mate(Arsenal fan), said Di Maria was single handedly embarrassing the world champs, roll on QPR.

584~~~
He's not. Look at Olly's GIF a bit above of the run he made trying to cut through the middle. He's lethal wherever he plays.

585~~~
we've sent out the U21s in 3-5-2, played it in all our league games and the cup game - and all Van Gaal has banged on about is philosophy...

I think we will see the 3-5-2 unless poor results trigger a change

586~~~
He is not though. Watch him for Madrid last season.

587~~~
Great game, he really will have the crowd on the edge of their seats whenever he gets the ball.

588~~~
yep he was great all over but I'm thinking of his time at Madrid as well....his goal tonight as well, his assist for Lamela, his crossing ability

if we enable him to take on an isolated defender he will do some damage

589~~~
Single handedly destroyed Germany. They missed him in the WC final

590~~~
I expect him to change to the diamond, which is just a slightly more attacking version of the 3-5-2.

591~~~
he was awesome for Madrid at times in that midfield 3 

I think our big issue is cutting edge...how many decent chances have we created in 4 games - maybe 7/8??

I'd prefer him in a more advanced position - it does pay testament to his ability that he could play in the engine room behind Bale/Ronaldo

592~~~
I simply can't wait to see himself and Falcao in action together hopefully starting against QPR

593~~~
Jeez, 4-2 with such an impact from Di Maria. Why did I bother with England game again?

594~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

595~~~
Proverbial United #7

596~~~
He'll be a star for us wherever he plays - he's that kind of player <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

597~~~
part of me is wondering if the 3 is designed to add numbers to a weak central defence.....with Rojo, Evans, Blind, Jones fit and available maybe you are right 

I'd prefer it to the 3-5-2 and with Carrick at the base of midfield it would free up Herrera/Di Maria

598~~~
Carlos and 99% of people who are not United fans

599~~~
Just because he's in midfield doesn't mean he won't get himself into advanced positions. He'll be deployed a bit further up and given freedom to run at the opposition, something we don't have in the middle of the park. He'll also drift out wide, look at him tonight, he was everywhere.

600~~~
Shame we overpaid for him.

601~~~
World class. He will the difference this season, not at all a "luxury" buy, he gives us thrust, directness, guile, assists, goals. Build the team around him, and we'll be grand.

602~~~
Yeah, I'm not sure if he will do it straight away as we're playing wingers at full back at the moment because of the injuries, so he will want the 3 centre backs so we're solid back there, but when everyone is fit I think he will have Blind in front of 2 defenders and Herrera and Di Maria in front of him then.

603~~~
Aye, that's what I think. 

Our signings make perfect sense for that system, Di Maria and Falcao in particular. I can't see it being anything other than a diamond in a months time. 

I think the only delay would be van Gaal's stubbornness in trying to get the 3-5-2 to work.

604~~~
Madrid will be all over him next summer, as with all our top players. Rumours already starting.

605~~~
He's good but we could have used money spent on him on other targets..

And stuff..

606~~~
Watched the game and he simply took the piss all game just because he felt like it, he's that good. He ran the whole show. If he doesn't play wide right for us, it is almost a criminal offence. He's a devastating player and will put crosses in for Falcao to put away all day long.

607~~~
Sensational performance. This guy will be the catalyst for future success in the Premiership, Champions League and Indian <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

608~~~
How is swapping di Maria for Rodriguez an upgrade? They have genuinely let go of one of the best players in the world. The worst thing is they knew it, everyone did.

609~~~
I'm sure you can guess where this is from -

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

610~~~
So I heard we bought this chap.

Nice.

611~~~
Yeah, we probably should build our team around him...

612~~~
So...

................Blind
.....Herrera........Mata

Di Maria.............Rooney
..............Falcao

Anyone?

613~~~
Di Maria was there to assist the midwife at his own birth.

614~~~

615~~~
But we've sold our soul buying this guy, wish we'd kept Welbeck <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

616~~~
It's a weird one because it doesn't seem to be a choice that Ancelotti made. Everyone knows Perez calls the shots, and Perez wanted James Rodriguez and someone had to make way. Ancelotti would not have wanted to sell him, bar Ronaldo he was their best player last season. I'm sure James will do very well for them as he is a great player, but they've lost a special player for sure.

617~~~
Good God, just seen the highlights on ITV. 3 assists and a goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

618~~~
Holy shit, does this guy really play for us? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

619~~~
And by the way
July 8th. I knew it <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Do Argentina play again this week?

620~~~
His goal was the sort of goal Bale often scores.

621~~~
Just seen the highlights. He's just so effective! Wide men taking players on and contributing to fast attacking football. That sounds strangely like Man Utd's identity to me...

622~~~
One of the best "assist hat-tricks" you'll ever see. The goal was sublime too.

623~~~
It's such a shame that we've lost our soul and are enduring an identity crisis because we acquired Di Maria and Falcao.

624~~~
aaaaand i watched england because...

625~~~
next month vs Brazil

626~~~
3 assists and a goal is all well and good but do we really need this type of player at United.

627~~~
Absolutely incredible player. 

We have to find how we can best utilize him because he's just a class above anyone else on the team.

628~~~
Ahh, right. Guess he can rest up for QPR then.

629~~~
Are you serious? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

630~~~
A player we didn't need, wasted money.

631~~~
Am I bollox <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

632~~~
Erm?

633~~~
Players showing what he did tonight have no place at Old Trafford. Disgusting and too good. The last time I saw a soul being lost this much was when Bart Simpson sold his to Millhouse.

634~~~
Although he has enough quality to play almost anywhere, it does seem a bit of a waste of his talents to not play him on the wing.
I felt the same with Ronaldo and Madrid when he started playing more upfront.

635~~~
You're a masochist.

636~~~
He's taking the piss out of the identity idiots.

637~~~
That 5 year contract feels good right about now. Cheers Woody.

638~~~
His crossing tonight was Bebe-esque <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

639~~~
Up until last season I didn't overly rate di Maria. Forgive me Angel.

640~~~
He can't be as good as this!

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHyeRiIEK0M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

641~~~
If there's a little sad face on the Welbeck thread title then surely there should be a big Cheshire grin on this one.

642~~~
Just saw the highlights <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
I really really hope we don't see the likes of Rooney taking free kicks anymore, Di Maria is a lot better at them. That outside of the foot assist <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

643~~~
Not sure if the last point is true anymore after this summer to be honest <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
He's our best player but we do have other world class players in our team like Falcao, De Gea, and then mata, Rvp and Rooney once they get form back. Not sure if its fair to say if he's on a whole other class to everyone else.

644~~~
Na we have been more like selling our soul for a dounut lol, well in Phelans eyes

645~~~
Rooney and mata for free kicks within striking range, mata when it's close to the edge of the box. Di Maria whenever we have to cross it. He's one of the best crossers of the ball around for sure.

646~~~
Worked hard and didn't Permit the opposition to create too many chances.

647~~~
We'll see about Falcao, DDG is not comparable as he's a keeper but he's clearly better and plays with more confidence than the rest easily.

648~~~
What a player.

649~~~
Indeed he does, but I was talking about match sharpness, i.e his decision making and etc. He hasn't played much this season since he got injured in the World Cup so minutes are of value to him.

650~~~
Most of our team looks awesome now APART from the defence imo which will still leak goals and will still play in that nervous way which will probably spread to the rest of the team.
I just hope to god that we get top 4 because if players like DiMaria, Falcao and even the likes of Mata and Rooney have blinders of a season BUT we miss out on top 4, i wouldn't be surprised if either they get unhappy or some top teams come in for them.

651~~~
Was he any good tonight? I missed the match.

652~~~
Didn't saw that yet. Amazing. Still haven't found what he is looking for <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

653~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fair enough. 

I think it's just because a majority of our players have been so underwhelming for so long that it's easy to say he's a better player.

654~~~
Because you didn't have access to watch the Argentina game.

I'm using that excuse, not making me feel any better though, mind you..

655~~~
No mate he was absolute dogshit!

656~~~
1 goal and 3 assists, not seen the game but assume he was good on that evidence.

657~~~
A little meh. Assists hattrick but not good enough to scored hattrick. Scored only one so you haven't missed much. If you had watched England you did the right thing because Raheem was so much better.

658~~~
Our best player.

659~~~
Of course we will. Depends where they are on the pitch. Rooney's been taking excellent free-kicks for about two years now. In wide areas, Di Maria will be a great asset though. Puts a lovely curl on the ball. Not sure he's scored many (any?) direct free-kicks though.

660~~~
No way would Ronnie let him take any at Madrid <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Or Messi in Argentina.

661~~~
Can Di Maria do this?

663~~~
Really? He lets Bale take them whenever it favours a left-footer.

664~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I wish i could do that tbh.

665~~~
Depends what you mean. Stamina? If so agreed, it's hard to think of someone with a better engine in world football. In terms of picking up injuries though he's not perfect, not injury prone but he does get the odd muscle injuries from time to time.

666~~~
Actually - I would love to re-open some of the World Cup match threads involving Argentina.  I remember clearly there was a LOT of hating on di Maria on here, calling him selfish, wasteful, overrated, etc.

667~~~
Forgive the poor attempt at a joke then! I don't claim to watch much of Madrid, just assumed Ronnie takes em all.

668~~~
Think you're throwing up a strawman there. The acclaim for Di Maria's signing was as unanimous as you get on here. It was only when we went full muppet and signed Falcao too that a minority started having mixed emotiona.

669~~~
I watch feck all myself tbh. Just seen Bale take a few free kicks and stuck in the memory because I assumed Ronaldo wouldn't let him near them!

670~~~
And besides Di Maria being a great player doesn't mean he'll have a great Utd career, it could all be very underwhelming although very unlikely. There is no need to draw conclusions as many posters so early in the season.

671~~~
Saw the highlights earlier on. A lovely pass with the outside of the foot for one goal and it looked as though he deserved his goal.

672~~~
Some good runs, couple of sharp passes. Nothing more, nothing less.

673~~~
To be honest, it was more a dig at some of the articles written on t'internet and such/opposition supporters. Like you say, the acclaim on here was overwhelming, and rightly so.

674~~~
Aye, it's early days. He's exactly what we needed, though. Gives us something different and exciting in two areas where we really needed a bit more class (wingers and central midfield). Might take him a while to settle but would be amazed if he wasn't a big success.

675~~~
Did not want <span style="color: #ffffff">Wellbeck anyway</span>

676~~~
I hope Perez was watching. He dropped a bollock the size of Jupiter on this one.

677~~~
Hopefully our players can start playing well in competitive matches at some stage, they seem to excel in friendlies.

678~~~
luxury signing. should have kept faith with the quality youth we have coming through. not the united way.

679~~~
<a class="username" data-user="67446, @MoneyMay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/67446/">@MoneyMay</a> 
Bring on the match comp and highlights <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Absolute world class.

680~~~
Anyone have the third assist?

681~~~
I said De Gea because IMO he's one of the top 3 keepers in the world, obviously you can't compare them but he's on that level of elite players in his position.

682~~~
Big dilemma for LVG. Play DM in midfield or on the wing?

683~~~
Not even sure this is true, he's got everything, even if he's playing in a side utterly devoid of confidence he's very aware of his own vast ability, I think he will drag a few players back up a level, totally agree with everything else though covers two weak areas with X factor ability.

684~~~
Third assist

Goal
/

Edit: Sorry mate, link aren't showing here but if you click them they do lead to the clips.

685~~~
Who is this guy, is he any good?
Were we in for him during the transfer window?

686~~~
With players returning from injuries he may go now for 4-3-3 and maybe finally trash somebody 4:0.

687~~~
Not what we need according to most sauces.

Cheers mate!

690~~~
Btw, as great as his assists were, the goals, especially the first two were also very well taken. Our strikers at the moment need to step up several levels to match them.

691~~~
Yeah from what I've been told he can play in a few positions so he's more of a versatile squad player but not what we need. So did we buy him?

692~~~
Na just created a thread for him, were going to pretend we did though.

693~~~
Didn't know how he'd fit in before we signed him. In reality, it's more a question of how you fit the others around him.

694~~~
60m? Daylight robbery. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

695~~~
Yep, he's genuinely our best player and someone we should look to build our team around.

696~~~
Lol kidding, just can't believe we actually signed him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

697~~~
I hope this performance makes LVG go for the 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1. But I just can't see LVG leaving out Falcao or RVP in a game.

698~~~
Thank you for that! I totally forgot that there was a friendly today.

699~~~
WOW.

700~~~
Neuer, courtois, cech, sirigu maybe even casillas/buffon are better.

701~~~
Casillas isn't even top three in the Spanish NT. Valdes and DDG are both much much better as Casillas is a liability now. 

I'd easily have DDG and Courtois in the top 3 after Neuer.

702~~~
After his shenanigans tonight, nor can anyone else <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

703~~~
Sign him up Van Gaal. Oh wait........<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

704~~~
Not a chance. Neuer and courtois OK, even though I disagree about courtois (same level for me), no chance for the other 3 though. Casillas? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fecks sake

705~~~
He is one of the top 3 keepers in the world, no one else comes close to Courtois, Neuer and DDG.

706~~~
Courtois and Neuer, yes. The rest ... I don't know maybe you edited them on Fifa or whatever because none of them come close, especially not Buffon, Casillas and Cech who are all <b>way </b>past their best.

707~~~
We've got this young fella named Falcao who could probably knock a few of those away on either foot..

708~~~
Yeah. Laughable to even mention them, they aren't on the same level. Cech is the only one close but even he isn't IMO.

709~~~
I have to agree I think as utd fans we seem to over-rate De Gea who in my opinion should be doing a lot better in some situations. He's a top class shot stopper but that's it.
Out of the 3 top class young GK, De Gea, Courtois and Ter Stegen, I know I'm going to be hated for saying this but I think it would have been better for us to go for Ter Stegen or Courtois (Id prefer Ter Stegen), I think they are more built to suit PL GK than De Gea is, he still looks suited to the la liga. Its just my opinion don't hate me for it.

710~~~
Ha! Imagine if we really did sign Falcao too...

711~~~
And upside down.

712~~~
If he performs like this forevery  3  out of 4/5 games this year I'd be satisfied!

713~~~
You don't watch much football if you think both Casillas and Buffon are superior to De Gea at the moment. Sirigu and Cech highly debatable as well.

714~~~
United. Its how we roll...

715~~~
Can't believe we broke our identity signing him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

See Welbeck tonight? Pure class. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

716~~~
That sounds like something you'd hear 3 years ago. When was the last time De Gea made a mistake or flapped at a cross or something like that? He makes less mistakes then the likes of Neuer or Courtois do, though he's not as good in other situations. Saying he's made for la liga or not suited to the prem is such a lazy stereo type that isn't true at all.

717~~~
They probably have a higher rating on Fifa and so he thinks they're better.

718~~~
Of all our players, he is the one that we have to build the team around. Left wing or more centrally I'm not sure, but he's the diamond in our side, no doubt about it.

719~~~
The zip on his crosses is delightful.

720~~~
We signed van Persie, he was our best player and someone we wanted to see the team build around.

We signed Mata, he was our best player and someone we wanted to see the team build around.

We signed di Maria, he is our best player and someone we want to see the team build around.

No bad, huh?

721~~~
We need to go all out to sign Reus in the next window. ADM on the right, Reus on the left in a 4 3 3. That would be immense!

722~~~
You forgetting the Falconator there, Moyesy.

723~~~
Ter Stegen stagnated last year, he's just simply not as good as De Gea. We don't overrate De Gea, overrating him would be saying he's the best keeper in the world by a mile. De Gea is a top 3 keeper, I can't believe this is even a debate. And if he was <b>only </b>a top class shot stopper I think we would have tried to find a replacement by now, only issue being there aren't actually many keepers better than De Gea.

724~~~
I reckon Angel is the superior player to be honest, both world class just going on the season di Maria just had...

725~~~
It's not really addressing our real issues though, plus it's going to drive us even further from our identity.

726~~~
You're on one tonight, aren't you? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

727~~~
What attacking wingers?

728~~~
Its not stereotyping, Im just not sure if he's as good as he is made out to be. He needs to get off his line and be more commanding at times, close down and make to goals smaller but he seems to stay on his line far to often. Unbelievable reflexes though.

729~~~
What attacking wingers?

730~~~
More performances like that will do nicely!

731~~~
Getting Reus over a top CB and CM would be stupid. Although we probably would be in for all 3, if that's the case I'd be all for going mental.

732~~~
Just going on tonight there's no question, we haven't seen talent like his in Old Trafford since you know who left.

733~~~
Yep, ah this is great. Roll on Sunday week.

734~~~

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

738~~~
Just like Djemba-Djemba! Not sure what happened there? Not so smartphone presumably?

739~~~
Watching him tonight made me laugh that he has just inherited a shirt that was previously worn by Antonio Valencia. 

Some player he is. We have been starved in recent years. Last season had to happen. Our squad needed this injection.

740~~~
Di maria--Falcao---Rooney
---Mata-------herrera
---------blind
Shaw--Rojo---Jones--Rafael
--------De Gea

We can start to put out some absolutely filthy lineups when these injuries bugger off, and our strength in depth in our attacking options are right up there with the best in the world now.

to think, were an injury to falcao away from being forced into playing robin van persie, and we might have the draft that rooney lad from the b side to cover as a last resort...

741~~~
'Building the team around him' is one of the most cringe worthy expressions in the game to be fair. I hate it.

742~~~
Did he play right wing today for a goal and 3 assists? Awesome!

743~~~
Hopefully he can fill MO7's boots. 
Watching his highlight tonight, building a team around him, I don't think he will give us much choice not too.

744~~~
I doubt we'll go for him really, we have januzaj who will be a starter soon. Reckon we'll get strootman in January or next summer as well making our midfield sorted as well. Just the defence now pretty much.

745~~~
Cringey? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How so? He's arguable our best player, why not play to his strengths?

746~~~
How good was Angel Di Maria tonight? All my German Bayern fans were so jealous that we have him! They are really looking for a Ribéry/robben replacement. 
And he is ours <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

How long is the contract? Please tell me 5 years?

747~~~
The simple truth.

The problem with De Gea is that he's been plagued with a dodgy back line for three seasons and now he has to deal with more dodginess.  You really can't expect him to stop shots that come in from just outside the six yard box.

Is De Gea one of the top 5 keepers on the planet?  Easily?  Top 3 on the planet?  Probably.

748~~~
One word: Falcao <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Di Marias vision with his movement/finishing will be deadly.

749~~~
I just find it silly personally. I've heard kt said that Everton is 'built around Baines'.

All it basically means is a player is very good and does his job very well. But there are others. Is City built around Toure, or is is Kompany?

750~~~
They definitely play to Toure's strengths, City. Moyes' Everton played to Baines'.

751~~~
Agreed, the reinforcements this window have been sensational. We're two players off being an elite team, no one realises how good of a team we're actually building. It leaves us very little work for the coming windows. I hope you're right about Januzaj, and even so rumour has it the next winger we'll go for is Depay anyway who van Gaal has worked with and trusts. Reus is Barca or Madrid bound.

752~~~
The Ronaldo days, the system was simple, get the ball off the opposition, give it to Ronaldo, Di Maria has the same kind of edge, Toure and Kompany are components to deliver the ball to Aguero. When you have a central player like Di Maria the components in the team should be designed to get the ball at his feet so he can create, he's that good that the managers plans center around him. It's not building a new team to accommodate his talent just utilizing it at every available chance.

753~~~
And even so he's still been fantastic. If we didn't have him last year we wouldn't have made 7th, he pulled us out of the shitter more than once.

754~~~
5 years

755~~~
And when the ball got to Baines, hid job was to then cross it for the striker to score.  Are they not therefore playing to the striker's strenghts? 

I still think it just meant Baines was very good. I don't believe you can 'build a team around a player' literally, i just think you can have a best player. He usually will have nothing to do with whether or not you have the best right back in the world or not though. 

I'm sure many would say Barca has been built around Messi in recent years, but i don't see why it wasn't built around Xavi or Busquets for instance.

756~~~
The pure truth.  

We're so used to seeing him make astonishing saves that we're setting the bar far higher for him that is justified.  

I will nitpick, however, and concede that his distribution has been a bit off this season.  But my god the man can still hit a gnat's eyebrow from 60 yards out!

757~~~
Yep 5 lusciously long years

758~~~
A key part of a midfields job is to get the ball to their wingers. The difference between Angel and Valencia is that one is just very good, so he will do better things with it. That said, if we play Valencia instead, we just give it to him all the time too. He has just been doing feck all with it.

It is still just the players doing their jobs I reckon. And even if it were the strategy, and Di Maria's job was then to create for Falcao with it, can it not be said that the team is built around Falcao instead?  After all, we got a ball winner to win it, to give it to a ball user, to give it to Di Maria, just so he can give it to Falcao. Perhaps he is the most important then?

759~~~
You could say that of course but the central player is the key, he will be creating the chances for his strikers and unless it's a backs to the wall affair there usually two. 
Di Maria looks like he's going to be our biggest threat going forward so it makes perfect sense for the team to center around him. The players will do it naturally anyway, if you've ever played a bit yourself and you have that lad who's going to create you chances you just get it to him, it's almost automatic.

760~~~
Indeed. Van Gaal also hates it. He has said himself he will never build his team around one player because what would that mean if that player was to get injured or has a poor run of form?

761~~~
No no no.

1. He doesn't need to do that. De Gea is not a sweeper keeper in vein of Lloris or Neuer. A lot of keepers have different playing styles and De Gea has forged his own identity.

2. Did you see the last 2 seasons ? De Gea is as commanding as they come. His claiming of crosses has been exceptional and he does hand out a few bollockings from time to time. Of course when you have Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice freaking Evra in front of you, it's not that easy to be a leader of the back. This season both De Gea and to a a degree Jones will take a quantum leap in leadership ability.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BnRZJWJCcAAD8WV.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BnRZJWJCcAAD8WV.jpg"/>

3. No he doesn't. He's not from the Yashin school of keeping. Many continental goalkeepers from the past decade and even more tend to stay at their lines rather than charging out like a maniac. Early Casillas is a good example of that.

There is room for improvement of course but De Gea is probably one of the Top 3 and definitely one of the Top 5 keepers in the world :

City : Hart : De Gea is better.
Arsenal : WS : De Gea is better.
Chelsea : Courtois : Debatable. Before Thibaut came along De Gea was excellent for Atletico, helping them to a UEFA Cup and Supercup at age 20, Spain to the final of the U17 World Cup, won the U17 Euro, the U21 Euro twice, has already won the league with United. He is definitely more accomplished as of now. Better ? We'll find out this season now that they're in the same leagues.
Liverpool : Mignolet : De Gea is better.
Atletico : Moya : De Gea is better.
Madrid : Casillas : De Gea is better.
Barcelona : Ter Stegen : This dude is definitely not better. Dunno why someone would say that.
Bayern : Neuer : Better tha De Gea by a wide margin as of now.
Dortmund : Nope.
Juventus : Buffon : All time great but has regressed massively. De Gea is better.
PSG : Sirigu : De Gea is better.
Monaco : Stekelenberg/ Subasic : De Gea is better.

He's also better than Handanovic, Lloris, Leno, Ochoa, Moraes etc.

762~~~
Has the De Gea thread been moved or what lads ?

763~~~
i would actually take him ahead of Bale and Robin. He's that good.

764~~~
He hasn't been able to get a game at Benfica so maybe even he's not as good as Angel.

Match comp is up. Uncropped. Hopefully the music is a bit better this time, but you can tell how awful my audio editing skills are. Still, great quality unlike the other match comps of Di María vs Germany - everyone wants to be first to release such performances, but they always miss out lots of footage. Anyway, enjoy!

767~~~
He was fantastic against Germany tonight, it's going to be exciting watching him every week for United after the last few years of Valencia and Young. His acceleration, skill and inventiveness on the ball are a joy to watch and we have him right as he's hitting his peak.

768~~~
Didn't watch the game, but I don't think he played as CM/DM

769~~~
'You can quote me on that' type of post:
ADM is going to be on the shortlist for the ballon d'or next year. At United he'll be the big man and he'll thrive on that. I somehow feel like the shackles have come off now. He'll score the most goals he's ever scored in a single season if he's played on the wing as I really think that's his best position even though he was still amazing in midfield. He's just at the peak of his powers and we saw that last night.

United have a fantastic squad that won't compete for top 4. If you can get your summer signings clicking in time you will win the league.
Di Maria will really lift the team and make everyone play better, which won't be hard considering the quality of players you just bought.

Can't believe he's gone though... This must feel like you guys felt when Ronaldo went the other way. Really gutting.
At least win the title with him, you cnuts. I genuinely wish him all the best. Let's hope you get your heads out of your arses because you have a great coach, great squad, your record buy is on top of his game and only one competition to look at now. You won't get a much better chance to win the league than you have right now.
Get United back where they belong.

770~~~
*Wipes a tear drop*
We have to win the damn thing now <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

771~~~
We felt a lot worse that's for sure.

772~~~
I hope you are right. But I very much doubt it.

We don't have a settled defence. It will take time to build one.

We have a new midfield. It will take time for it to start functioning well.

We have big names up front, including Mata, but their best performances were 18-36 months ago. They haven't performed at world class level over the last 18 months. Apart from that, they cannot all play at the same time. Maybe only 2 out of Falcao, Rooney, RvP and Mata will start in the big games, otherwise we won't be good defensively wise. Besides, no one of them is particuarly pacey.

Unlike our forwards, AdM has been genuinely world class recently and is a truly fantastic addition. But he doesn't have as good team mates here as he did at Madrid. He wasn't the main man at Madrid at it was easier for him to shine. Now every fan and his dog knows that you have to stop AdM if you want to win against United.

To sum it up, we'll do greatly to win a top 4 spot. It's far from guaranteed. On the contrary, it wil be very difficult. You can quote me on that.

773~~~
Ok, let's see which one is closer to the reality at the end of the season. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

774~~~
<a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> Great to see a far more optimistic opposition fan than some of our fans right now. I'm pretty sure LVG is looking to challenge for the title, even though he might be downplaying expectations in public a bit, to reduce the pressure on the team.

I doubt the club approached Falcao and Di maria saying, Eh we are looking to sneak into the top 4 slots and let's see what happens next season. I'm sure we are competing for the title but I personally won't mind a top 4 place, given that this is a huge transitional season where there is a possibility that things could go wrong. The absolute minimum is top 4 though

775~~~
Didn't see the match. From the highlights it looked like he was playing wide right, is that correct? I wonder if van Gaal will try him at right wingback. Something like this:

---Smalling---Evans----Rojo---
-------Rooney--Herrera--------
Di Maria------Mata-------Shaw
----------RVP-------Falcao-----

776~~~
I still stand by <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/the-i-told-you-so-thread.394776/page-4#post-16262415">this</a>. Granted, the first few games have been crap but this international break couldn't come at a better time for you.
Season just started anyway, just build some confidence in your next few games and even your worst players will receive a huge boost and will start playing better. I can't see this squad not challenging for the title tbh.

777~~~
Rooney in midfield instead of Blind?

778~~~
Yes he played mainly as a Right winger, but did swap to the left every now and again.

He played next to Aguero and Lamela in a 4-3-3. They had Perez, Mascherano and Biglia in the centre.

779~~~
For better or worse van Gaal has made Rooney undroppable when fit by making him captain.

780~~~
That first assist is ludicrous.

781~~~
I really really hope you're right!

782~~~
I watch this match yesterday on zdf and the germans just couldn't stop praising him, and went as far as saying it would have been a different final with him in the team. He was just so good, direct, quick just oozed class..
His finish was sublime and his crosses are so good. Young and Valencia must be shaking right now, he is just that good..

783~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I love you Vato.

784~~~
Best thing yesterday was how pin-point accurate his crosses were, it was crazy.

785~~~
Im starting to suspect <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> is a closet Utd fan, his words are way too kind.

786~~~
Let's win the title for Vato, lads.

787~~~
Can't wait to see him vs QPR

788~~~
Its about time that OT was lit up up again.

789~~~
He's a special talent, the kind you only watch football matches for.

790~~~
He is a special, special player - but people must not forget that this is the type of player that belongs at Old Trafford. Fergie's transfer policy I think, caused some fans to think we don't deserve real top-bracket players. I don't see why a club of our stature should have second-rates. Why on earth would we be challenging on all fronts with Young and Valencia on the wing? It isn't, and has never been, good enough.

791~~~
I really hope he plays on the wing and thrives there. He was absolutely brilliant from the centre last season, but our wing play has been dire for 4 years now since Valencia had his last really good one. Di Maria's deliveries will be greatly desired from our strikers, and I can just picture him pinging beauties to Falcao, Rooney and RvP all day whilst also <b>beating</b> his man, unlike other players I will not mention.

792~~~
I don't think Fergie bought them thinking they would turn out to be crap or a little above average at best. 
They just didn't kick on from their previous levels.

793~~~
FFS Vato, just when I thought I couldn't like you any more.....sniff sniff....love you man! (unless you're a female, then I love you a little more <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> ) 

Stop it...you're making me have a soft spot for Madrid! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> THAT CAN'T HAPPEN!

794~~~
You're a star! Thanks.

Imagine a 4-3-3 with ihm and Reus on the wider attackier positions. They would give the Ribery and Robben combo a run for their money, hell maybe even Ronaldo and Bale.

Beastly performance, if only he had played in the world cup final...

799~~~
Can you imagine if we get beat? You know some people call me a pessimist.......

800~~~
Why Arsenal made Vermaelen Captain?

801~~~
Because LvG has said previously that his captains play the majority of matches.

802~~~
Make a list of the top5/ 10/top 20 players you've seen "light up" OT. How many of them were signed under Fergie? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Yeah I'm sure Fergie's entire transfer policy limited signing exciting player

803~~~
Only one in the last 5 years.

We became so desperate for inspiration that we all flung ourselves head first into the 'Januzaj for President' camp. We had been starved. And I was referring to a recent transfer history. The fact is, I could have told you that the likes of Valencia would probably not have been as good as the likes of Robben or Ribery who we could have gone for after selling Ronaldo. We have bought players that clubs of similar stature would not, because 'we're United'. It has culminated in us needing a £200m surgery to bring us up to where 'United' should be.

804~~~
Providing there form doesnt drop off a cliff. Rooney captain or not wont be playing if his performances dont match those of the other players. Captain is just a black band to me. Should should have 11 men on the pitch who give there all and dont need the direction of a fellow pro to spur them on esp when that player is not performing. If he shouts anything at Di Maria...he'll prob get laughed at.

805~~~
I agree!

806~~~
Madrid really are muppets of the highest order. Does anyone know what the Madrid fans think about all this?.

807~~~
Have Argentina another game??

808~~~
no

809~~~
Yeah, they're not happy by all accounts.

Good point, but I just don't see him dropped.

812~~~
No, their next game is a friendly against Brazil in China (<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>) in October.

813~~~
This. The only player better than De Gea is Neuer but there is no shame in that, he will go on to be one of the greats. There is also the debate vs Courtois which in my eyes is 50/50 but we'll not know for a few years because its unfair to judge De Gea with such a bad defense in front of him.  So as it stands being 2nd/3rd in the world at 23 y/o is an immense achievement.

814~~~
Something crazy like 90%+ of them voted against selling him. They loved him and know he was a massive part in their 10th CL success, as much of a transfer muppet club they are they're also football fans so know how good players are for a team/system.

815~~~
We've got him in his peak which is amazing. His performance Vs Germany was amazing. Can't wait till he settles at United.

816~~~
Thanks.

He could destroy the Premiership in the same way Ronaldo did. He can do almost everything. Talk about bringing the fear factor back.

821~~~

822~~~
I'm not sure anybody thinks Lallana is a youngster?

823~~~
Indeed. I think people gave that impression when they were referring to England's new young core of players in the summer and including Lallana purely because he had only recently emerged despite being about 25.

824~~~

So fans dont see us switching back to a back 4 as it looks defeatest for LVG. And re Rooney fans dont ever see him dropped regardless. If either of these points is true we dont have a world class manager on our hands at all........yet the same fans who
say the above do believe in LVG. It makes zero sense.

Has there been a Youtube video yet of his highlights?

830~~~
Any chance Madrid will be back in for him for £100m if he tears the PL up? Or will Perez's ego prevent that from ever happening? 

One thing I do know is that we can tell the cnuts to do one if they do come back for El Fideo!

831~~~
Yes. MoneyMay has posted his own highlights (post #815) and there are other versions on previous pages.

I'm just watching the game myself. Gorgeous vision and technique. Falcao is surely going to have a field day with that calibre of passing coming his way.

1) Neuer
2) Courtois
3) De Gea

846~~~
Only think United fans rate him so highly tho. Think we overrate him a bit, never heard a non United fan call him top3. He is an excellent shotstopper, but further.... its not very special imo.

847~~~
I enjoyed reading this Vato, it's worth saying Ronaldo probably much more to United fans than Di Maria did to Madrid fans but that's by the by. At least we both got fantastic amounts of money for the respective deals. I think we can win the league as well, to complete the circle jerk, I fancy Madrid to finally defend the CL title.

848~~~
Personally I can't think of 3 goalkeepers that are better than him so I think he is top 3 in the world. Neuer is head and shoulders above the rest and I do rate Courtois ahead of De Gea but other than that I can't think of anyone better. Casillas and Buffon are past there best so De Gea is easily better than him. Based on Cech's form for the last few seasons De Gea would come on top between the two.

849~~~
Much love for that post Vato, well said mate.
LETS WIN IT FOR VATO!

850~~~
Starting for Spain tonight, pretty sure people outside of United rate him highly.

851~~~
Normally he is still behind Casillas, Spain are using lots of B players.

852~~~
Cech was the best PL keeper last season..

853~~~
This guy is the shit.

Lets just hope we don't remove that little "the" while he's here.

854~~~
Why because he was voted in the team of the year? That's voted on by the players themselves and there have been a few strange inclusions over the years. Besides Cech was made to look a lot better by the fact he had the best defence in the league in front of him. De Gea wasn't so lucky. Personally I thought De Gea and Lloris had better seasons.

Anyhow this is going off topic so we better leave the debate at this.

855~~~
The same non United fans who thought he was a waste of money in the first 2 years. Even though in those 2 years he was saving our arses almost every other game. He took a battering when he first came!

On Di Maria - one of the reasons I think its realistic to go for the league this year!

856~~~
His performance last night was almost Messi-esque at his best. If he can maintain that level then.....well we have an amazing signing

857~~~
Well let's see if we can get anywhere near the best out of him. Knowing us lately we are probably going to turn him into Matthew Etherington <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

858~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Im still a bit of unsure where we will use him  I did think it would be CM as we are low on quality, but after seeing him play wide last night, three assists and loads of dangerous balls into the box. Really puts the likes of Valencia and Young to shame

859~~~
I'd take Matthew Etherington over our other wingers!

860~~~
Casillas is done with Spain (or Spain done with him, he's been awful for 3 years now). Also on Cech, De Gea individually was better last season, and the year before was voted in the premier league team of the year, and won our player of the year last year. Most people rate him really highly these days, not just United fans, basically anyone who watches him a decent amount. 
Ask any Chelsea or Liverpool fans even and they'll admit to his quality, think I saw Barney even say that he was on par with Courtois the other day (which I agree with). 
Anyways, not the De Gea thread. Still a world class player though without a doubt, like Di Maria, which is how the convo started.

861~~~
Is it true that hes super inconsistent at times <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> ?

862~~~
I don't remember him being inconsistent at all tbh, at least not as obvious as someone like Benzema for example. Ofcourse he's had some less good games sometimes, but I really can't remember him being shit for a long period.

863~~~
Great post.

864~~~
Great stuff, echoes the growing feeling if we do get our shit together in the next month or so we can be very dangerous at the business end. 
Add me to the Vato love.

865~~~
This brings tears to my eyes. Need to light some candles!

866~~~
Most quoted post ever?

Anyway I'd agree with you but only IF we drop the 352, Di Maria is best on the wing as you said and if we play 352 we'll have him stuck in midfield with two strikers up top, so we'll have lack of pace and width up top. Januzaj can also thrive this season if we play 2 wingers.

Is LVG's ego too big to admit fault and drop the 352? I don't think so.

Thanks Vato

870~~~
ADM is a fantastic player but it is a bit of a wet fantasy that we will compete for the title just because we bought him.

871~~~
Sure, but no one is saying that either.

872~~~
We didnt just buy him...

873~~~
He moves us a lot closer to title challengers, that's for sure. I think Di Maria will win a couple of titles at United too.

874~~~
I don't think you understood <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> s post. He said we have a fantastic coach and squad and basically Di Maria will have his best season ever which will be important for the team because he'll spur them or/raise their confidence, no one is saying he'll individually win the title. 

I think he can challenge for 3rd.

<b>Attack:</b> We have a title winning attack no doubt.
<b>Midfield:</b> We have a good midfield with depth once players get back from injury, if they ''click'' fast enough we'll be able to defend, create and attack for midfield. The three things we've lacked for some time. 
<b>Wingers:</b> We can create and score, something we've missed since 2009, not to mention with pace.
<b>Defense:</b>  Liverpool showed last year you can challenge with a shit defense but I don't think ours is as bad as theirs. If we can stay injury free a back 4 of Rafael, Jones/Smalling, Rojo and Shaw can be a great black line with a mix of lethal attack from the full backs, calmness with a ball playing CB in Rojo and pure power in Jones. 
<b>Keeper:</b> Boss

All of the above is resting on the hope we drop the 352 and change to a wingers formation (442, 433 & 4231)

For the Spanish speakers

885~~~
He tore a muscle(in his thigh, IIRC) in the quarter finals.

886~~~

887~~~
Think he only pulled it but they probably said it so he wouldn't make it worse so they could sell him. I'm guessing that at least.

As long as it brings us back Ronaldo in January, I'll let Mendes sit on my face!

891~~~
Torn was what they were saying at the time, there was talk of using stem cell treatment on him.

892~~~
Maybe, it's just don't torn hamstrings usually take like 3-4 months to recover from? He was back playing after about a month so it was probably just a pulled muscle.
Edit: I think I remember it saying he tore a few fibres in his muscle, so wasn't as bad as a torn hamstring, just a minor one.

893~~~
Di Maria confirming we'll continue with 3 at the back?

Hmm ...

894~~~
I'm glad he's earning the wages he deserves (in comparison to other players ofcourse, as footballers' wages are ridiculous) now and is playing for a board who'll hopefully appreciate what he does.

Florentino is a class A donkey.

895~~~
Yeah, torn muscle, as you say probably a minor one, and in the end, good for us that he didn't play anyway.

896~~~
Can Modric ask for a wage increase next summer please? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

897~~~
If di maria (and maybe ozil too) have good seasons and he is impressed by what he sees perez will make 120 million bids for both of them declaring that they are "just the type of players Madrid need" and that they were "born to play for Madrid". He will then place kroos and james on the transfer list at 10 million each.

Out of interest, do you think it's worth sacking off this system when we are yet to try it with our two first choice wing backs, new centreback and two new midfielders? I'd say it's jumping the gun a little (a lot) to say it's not working because our second string players struggled with it.

901~~~
Di Maria: "Here [in England] isn't like in Spain, where you lose three games and you get sacked. Van Gaal will have time to work things out"

lol, we haven't lost 3 games yet!

902~~~
For what it's worth, I feel like van gaal long term always viewed a 4-3-3 as our main formation, just he doubted we'd bring in the players he wanted or quality like di Maria out wide. We'll see what he does now that we have everyone, but the 3-5-2 was struggling because we were missing half of our starting players (which also kind of forced us to play a 3-5-2 and no option for a 4-3-3, given we didn't have fullbacks).

903~~~
Think he was speaking hypothetically.

904~~~
I wouldn't mind it, but how will he use Di Maria in this system? I just don't want to see him as a wing back.

905~~~
You do realise Louis van Gaal is a master tactician? Don't worry about it, I'm sure his plan will work and if not, he'll correct it.

906~~~
IMO our <b>strongest </b>team (on paper, so "potentially") is:

That's my preference and it's open to a lot of changes with the players available to come in and offer something different. Also worth noting that 4 of those are yet to play for the club and two have less than 90 minutes. 

To say it's work in progress is an understatement but we have the right man to find the best team and system and with the quality available, I dot think a title challenge is out of the question.

907~~~
I think the team would look a lot better if you took out Evans and put in Rooney or Van Persie.

908~~~
Fair enough, personally I think that system would provide more width, space and protection for the attacking players and in turn, balance than a hugely attacking 4-3-3 would.

909~~~
Rooney/RVP at centre half? Come off it. <span style="color: #ffffff">I know that's not what you meant.</span>

910~~~

911~~~
I thought it was more that they didn't want him to aggravate his injury, but whatever suits his agenda. Hernandez' tweets have gotten even more negative towards Madrid in recent months, I wonder why? 10 must hurt.

912~~~
What do we think Angel feels about being at United?

Falcao has been very excited and open but he seems a little pissed at Real still

913~~~
I think both are city/Chelsea style signings. I dont believe it's either of their 1st choices

We will know in a few weeks if they have a good attitude or not. Will they be ozils or agueros?

914~~~
Yeah what on earth would Di Maria not playing have to do with Messi winning it? If anything it lowered the chances of Messi winning it.

915~~~
I am not sure. Falcao seems quite happy from what he has said. To be fair Di Maria hasn't been miserable, he just seems to be rather annoyed at Madrid and what went on.

916~~~
I suppose...maybe due to Falcao joining from Monaco which is basically like Shakhtar in a far nicer place to join 
Utd is certainly a big upgrade. But di Maria was a key player to Real Madrid and European champions, which let's not be silly is a downgrade

917~~~
Don't think there's been anything wrong with Ozil's attitude tbf.

He's just that type of player that goes missing on occasions especially played wide.

918~~~
I think he looks like he has a horrible attitude. He in my opinion is miserable with how things have turned out. 

I would say he isn't even 50% of what he is capable of if motivated

919~~~
Well leaving Real for United, Madrid for Manchester, sun for rain, Spanish for English and all that, especially after the season Real and us had can't be easy.

Plus it's also a lot of politics, RM have been trying to argue for ages that it's him who wanted to leave (to justify it to their fans who wanted him to stay) whereas he/his agent want everyone to know that Perez isn't telling the truth and Di Maria was pushed out.

920~~~

921~~~
He's putting up good numbers considering they play him wide right without any focal point most of the time. 

Always been that kind of player tbh, and was the same for Germany.


Di Maria and Falcao on the other hand have always been hard workers.

922~~~
I think that's the point of the tweet: If Di Maria played Argentina would have had a higher chance of winning the final and as a result Messi with a WC win would be the universally recognised best player ever, which RM didn't want a Barca player to be.

But as you and Raul Madrid say, it doesn't make any sense. Don't believe it.

923~~~
Di marias attitude is excellent and it is why he was kept over ozil (who is the more naturally talented player). Last year at the start of the season when the balance of the team was very bad (with isco in the team even though he was playing well in an attacking sense) and Madrid were conceding far too many goals di maria was put into the team in his place. Once di maria took his place the team became much more solid and also controlled games better. Di maria attacked through the middle and out wide on the left and also provided defensive cover on the left for Ronaldo. Di maria playing there really had many positives and it was a great move from ancelotti to put him there. Di marias ability but also his attitude made it work. He reached a level last year that ozil has yet to reach in his career and that is down to him being more versatile, hard working and possessing a better attitude.

924~~~
If he does all this for utd I will love him

I'm not doubting it by the way, I'm just waiting until he does it. Utd need top quality but also badly need top attitude.

925~~~
Agree that would definately be the best way to go in a 3-5-2. Rooney competing with Mata and RVP with Falcao. Would be interesting. Januzaj being mentored by Di Maria to play in that midfield role every now and then? Mata/Rooney are essentially second strikers in this formation as opposed to the classic no10 position that has become fashionable lately. IMO this will benefit Mata greatly as he thrived in Chelsea having a solid midfield behind him to make up for his lack of defensive work/tracking back etc. With the 3-5-2 as it was it requires the no10 to do all these things as well and is one of the reasons we have been so bad lately. As soon as the opposition get the ball, they are straight at our defence. 

With Blind, Herrera and Di Marias effective pressing in the midfield behind mata it will be a lot more solid both going forward and defensively and will allow a player such as Mata to play to his full capabilities.  As for Rooney,  I think he'd be good there because he wouldn't have the need to feel he has to drop deep to get the ball forward. He probably will anyway, but in theory with that midfield three behind them I think both would play to their best, added to the fact that they will have to fight for a place.

926~~~
Might as well go 4-4-2 diamond then. I don't see what's the benefit of putting extra attacking burden on Shaw/Rafael and CB's in that.

Hope Di Maria gets a great song. I've a feeling he is going to be THE stand-out performer this season, but "Lololoololoo Radameeel Falcaooo!" is going to be hard to top(if we go with it)

929~~~
Easily our most exciting player, I cannot wait to watch him play.

930~~~
i really hope he doesnt shoe-horn DiMaria into a wingback role just because hes got great stamina

931~~~
I think I'll break my TV if he does that. No chance IMHO.

932~~~
It will infuriate me (the entire formation already does that anyway). The fact that Robben never played at wing-back is a bit reassuring for me though.

933~~~
Why would he waste his best player? Surely ADM will get his position and then DDG etc and the team will be built around them..

934~~~
I think most people are fed up of the formation, I think he might change it though but there's always the possibility that his ego is too big to admit fault and switch. Why he might change it.

Robben never played wing back like you said so Di Maria would be taking Robben's 1 of the front 2 role in the 352 formation but with us having 3 world class strikers for those positions there's no way two of them will be dropped. 

For me I'd like 433.

---------De Gea
Rafael-Jones(?)-Rojo-Shaw
---Herrera-Blind-Rooney
Januzaj--Falcao--Di Maria

935~~~
I don't mind either being our player of the year <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

936~~~
Switch Di Maria and Rooney, with Rooney playing an inside left role not necessarily left wing because Rooney as our main creative force should not happen anymore until he gets his touch back. A midfield trio of Di Maria-Herrera-Blind will, on their day, be a match for anyone.

937~~~
I doubt he will. He already showed where he prefers to play in against Burnley in my opinion. He also made the comments about him being a great winger/midfielder so would say there is no chance he will try and shoe him in somewhere else when we are lacking in those other departments.

938~~~
I hope you're right, it would be a complete waste of his talent

939~~~
ADM in a WB role would be a huge waste of talent. No way will he play there. Either as a winger or a third CM but watching Argentina against Germany I know exactly where I want to see him play

940~~~
What is all this talk of Di Maria as a wingback? If we play 3-5-2 he will be a CM. 

I suspect we will be switching to 4-3-3 though.

941~~~
I agree with you. We've bought Shaw to play that position and Blind/Rojo to cover. There is no fecking way di Maria will play wing back.

942~~~
I was hoping for a diamond after we bought Kagawa (and before we bought RvP). It actually looks like a pretty good option now.

-- Rafael    Jones    Rojo    Shaw

Alternatively a 4-3-3 with

-- Rafael    Jones    Rojo    Shaw

which is pretty close to the 4-2-3-1 we know and love.

943~~~
Changing the 3-5-2 now wouldn't even need to be LvG admitting he got it wrong. He could just say that now the he has the players to play 4-3-3 (Di Maria) then he can change it.

944~~~
The thing is everyone is posting their 4-3-3 with players that weren't available the past few games where we were playing 3-5-2, its not even comparable. I'd like to see how amazing these 4-3-3 formations look with no recognisable fullbacks available and Fletcher and Cleverley our only midfield options, with no Falcao, Blind or Di Maria. 3-5-2 here to stay a bit longer I feel, we will see an entirely different game against QPR.

945~~~
Will we hold the Guinness records on the most left footers ever fielded with those formations?

946~~~
If I had to pick 3 out 4 fromRVP  Falcao Rooney Mata. It would be RVP 1st Rooney 2nd and since Mata has been nothing great since being here I'd go Falcao and hope to he lives up to his reputation. It would be great if LVG finds away to shoehorn all 4 in making us some force with AJ pushing for a start.

947~~~
I'd be picking Mata. He has immense creativity and his passing is superb and even though he plays in the AM role his passing success rate is in the 90's. Just imagine what he'd be like with players who actually ran around him. I'd have a forward lineup of Falcao and Rooney and give RvP time to get back to his best form.

948~~~
Some of his good moments in the Burnley match(GIFs)

949~~~
Quoted in case it does happen <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> I want proof kouroux!

But seriously, yeah, it'd be a such a waste to ever see him converted into a wing back. Either AM or Winger please.

950~~~
Is it 5 with Shaw, Rojo, Blind, Di Maria, Mata?

Januzaj and Blackett might need to be in there as well...

951~~~
While I think Di Maria could do a "job" as a left wingback on occasion, which Mourinho used him as several times during matches after making subs and moving him back there... You do not pay £60 million for someone who was man of the match in the champions league final playing left of a midfield 3 and putting cross after cross in and then stick him where he has lots of defensive responsibility. Thats not going to be where he plays week after week. We'd have got someone much cheaper to do that job.

We made him our record signing to play to his strengths, not to cover leftbacks

952~~~
The consensus is that we're (hopefully) moving towards 4-3-3.
Am I the only one who thinks it would be a waste to put Di Maria out wide?

There are barely any players who can beat men through the middle from a stand-still like Yaya Toure, but Di Maria's one of them. And he can do the other bits almost as well as any midfielder.
Whereas you can find a few obtainable wingers who'll do a very good job.

He'll probably end up as a winger in a 4-3-3 eventually, probably with Strootman in midfield, but we'll be losing a unique midfielder.
I'd rather Reus, Depay or someone else out wide with Di Maria in midfield.

Januzaj<span style="color: #ffffff">-----</span>Falcao<span style="color: #ffffff">-----</span>Di Maria

I'd play the top formation for now, with Rooney where Reus is.
Mata can cover a few positions, van Persie can cover Falcao.

953~~~
Why have we somehow forgotten how good Mata is? Lets wait and judge after he plays with class players around him like Herrera, Falcao, di Maria, Blind. Just like Ozil, you cant perform with declining players and deadwood around you, players like them are very depending on whats around them, when what's around them is good, they are the best in their positions.

954~~~
As good as Mata can be, he isn't good enough to compensate the squad balance. We could play a far more dynamic side, and play a formation that is far more flexible tactically for the team. van Gaal himself stated that it's not about creating a team of 11 best individuals, it's 11 players that make the best team.

955~~~
I don't see one position in that formation that Mata would fit well or improve, and I don't think he's that good that we should set the formation to him.
He's a very good player (more so in a Di Matteo 'system'), but I don't see how he fits into that kind of 4-3-3.
Even 4-2-3-1 is better off with Di Maria central and a more dynamic winger.
And I'm seriously hoping we don't continue with that 3-4-1-2, which I actually don't think suits Mata either.

I know he scored and assisted loads at Chelsea etc.. But it was a poor Chelsea side, with a poor 'system', and no defensive stability. He has great end product, but I don't think his overall play is all that. 
He scored lots, but I didn't think he dictated or ran anything at Chelsea, and the play was so disjointed and inconsistent anyway.

I think people who place him at Silva's level as a 'no. 10' are overrating him a bit.

956~~~
It's sad when we've come to a point when we even question Mata at his Chelsea time, for the record imo Silva is the best #10 in the world. But isnt it pure class to still perform in such a poor side (in your opinion) I think he could fit in a three mans midfield, with the hardworking Herrera and Blind next to/besides him.

957~~~
That would take him so so far away from the Mata we saw at Chelsea. Di Maria would do the role better in my opinion - for a number of reasons, and then we could get in a pacey winger.

I don't deny Mata hit great numbers at Chelsea and that he stood out, but it was more second-striker stuff for me. I've yet to see him dictate games consistently like a no. 10.
The closer to the solo striker - the better, the less defensive responsibility - the better, and the more space he has - the better. Much like Kagawa.

The weird thing about Mata is that though he isn't an athlete, he does his best on the counter or when the game is stretched.
If we were looking to play a counter-attacking system, and could allow him to not do very much off the ball, he'd be perfect behind Falcao in a 4-2-3-1. But in a more forward thinking 4-3-3, I'm not so sure.

I think he's much closer to Kagawa than Silva, and if we insist on a no.10 with a more forward-thinking approach then it's got to be someone like Silva, which is obviously not easy to find. Meanwhile, the parts of 4-3-3 are easier to bring in.

958~~~
I'm dreading the day Martin Tyler says "Angel lining up the angle for the free kick"

959~~~
People have really short memories when it comes to Mata. He's not a flashy player who has pace to burn. He's an intelligent player who depends on equally intelligentbplayers around him. Everyone's quick to defend the likes of Welbeck who has been largely below par.because he has pace and power it catches people's attention, when really he didn't do much with it. 

Mata's time will come and people will eat their words. It goes beyond reason that they can even question Rooney's quality similarly. It's not about quality, it's about how they fit in the team.

960~~~
I do agree with what <a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> says. Mata is far more of an efficient #10 than a dictative one. He doesn't neccessarily set the pace of the match and control play, but he will start and finish of plays. He can be ruthless in attacks but lacks a lot in physical and defensive duties. He's a very good player but I'd much rather see us play di Maria and another dynamic midfielder in front of a #6 than a 4231 with Mata in the hole.

961~~~
Di Maria and Falcao are the best things that could have happened to Mata. He will finally have players who he can pass to who will make runs around him.

962~~~
He <i>had </i>that in Welbeck (and did actually look good in pre-season. So hopefully Di Maria makes Mata look better.

963~~~
I think to some extent talk about Di Maria has died down a bit since signing Falcao however this is the player im most excited to watch tomorrow. Its his home debut and he was impressive in his first game for us as well as outstanding against Germany. Im hoping we see him play the full 90 minutes and see how he integrates now the team should be more stable.

964~~~
Another one shoehorning Welbeck into discussions.

965~~~
Totally agree. He's the one that we should be building the side around. Get him in his best position and work around that.

966~~~
Where do you feel that is? The issue is we are short of quality in CM (dependant on how Herrera and Blind perform) and on the Wings. Di Maria is a good answer to both those positions but I feel we need to give him a position to own and stick to it. Im thinking out wide with some license to roam as he had vs Germany. His delivery in that game was world class and we have seriously lacked creativity so far this season

967~~~
Centre in a three man midfield, and bring in a winger. Di Maria offers things in midfield that we couldn't find elsewhere.
We can find another very good winger though.

968~~~
Left wing IMO. Even though he was class last season more centrally, I feel that his pace and flair are more suited out wide. We finally have a brilliant, natural winger for the first time in ages (probably since Nani's one good season!), so let's use him.  The problem tho, is if we persist with 3-5-2, the there is no left wing!  
A front four of ; 

Di Maria Rooney/Mata Janazaj 
  ----- Falcao/Rvp----

Would be my ideal line up, with Herrera and Blind sitting deep.

969~~~
Home debut. Very excited by this

970~~~
Might as well ask here, do you prefer ADM to play in central midfield or as a winger? Not for today, but in the long term I mean.

971~~~
I can see him putting one in the top corner.

972~~~
Cant say how happy i am we dont have Young or Nani taking our freekicks now...

973~~~
He is so classy, will score another one today <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

974~~~
He's a fecking ridiculous talent.

975~~~
The pace and quality <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

976~~~
Real Madrid <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

977~~~
He really was Real Madrid best player wasn't he? He oozes quality in the same mold as Suarez, Ronaldo, Messi, etc.

978~~~
Wonderful combination of pace, skill and creativity this lad.

979~~~
Thank you Madrid.

980~~~
He's fecking quality!

981~~~
The consummate team player with top world class skills.  

Why why why would you ever part with a player like Di Maria.

Real Madrid are the most stupid football club in the universe

982~~~
Yeah he's pretty good!

983~~~
Going to become the player of the season for us. So dynamic and wonderful to watch.

984~~~
Thank you Perez.

985~~~
We have a star. A (former) Real star. Best business this summer (after getting LvG).

986~~~
Seeing him run with the ball with pace at defenders and I suddenly remember this is what seeing a proper man utd winger is all about. Not the crap stand and dummy and then turn and then keep turning infinitely by Young and the stand and pass it back to Rafael by Valencia.

987~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Thanks Pérez!

988~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

989~~~
Love him. Love him. Love him. 

That is all.

990~~~
Think he has a free role. In fact when we don't have the ball both RvP and Rooney move wide and we have the likes of Herrera and Mata pressing. Di Maria is everywhere for us today and that's the role which I think will bring out the best in him.

991~~~
Worth every pound.

Thank you Perez

992~~~
Forget his individual ability. The fact he is willing to run instantly brings out the best in all our other technical slower players. He creates the space for them to work their magic. The biggest winner in this transfer was Mata, and I stand by that. Add Herrera and maybe Falcao adding some injection and power and pace up front, and we are gonna be playing some beautiful stuff.

993~~~
Selling Di Maria shows Florentino Perez's transfer policy is insane. This guy is the class above.

994~~~

995~~~
He's exactly what we needed. A player that can run at speed with the ball.

996~~~
Madrid will try to buy him in january.. he's really really good.

997~~~
Has transformed this team. In the top 10/15 best players in the world.

998~~~
Why RM let this guy go is just unbelievable. Best player in the league?

999~~~
Just needed 45 minutes only to show that he can play anywhere in midfield. Love the way he helps the centre to build attacks.

No mistakes on the pitch... Last product is pure world class. He's gonna bang some assists in this club.

1000~~~
Ronaldo and £40 million for Di Maria.

1001~~~
He's at the heart of everything in our play. If he keeps this up he'll be worth every single penny of that record transfer sum.

1002~~~
Really can't believe Di Maria is ours!  Committed to Manchester United for the next years, a genuine playmaker we can build an era around.  

Future suddenly is very bright

1003~~~
He should play as an attacking winger

1004~~~
Gotta love Florentino...<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1005~~~
What a cracking player such an enjoyment to watch.

1006~~~
I am truly shocked by his level of quality and versatility. Speed, vision, control, assists, goals, setpieces, hardworking.

1007~~~
No 7

1008~~~
Thanks <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> . <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's amazing.

1009~~~
Was that a pass to Mata? He struck it like a shot so I'm not sure.

1010~~~
He's a tad better than Young and Kagawa.

1011~~~
He's incredible.

1012~~~
This guy is pure sex. Get him a song pronto!!

1013~~~
He is so, so, so, so, so, good.

1014~~~
Madrid <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1015~~~
So much class.

1016~~~
He is a bit good. We will win trophies.

1017~~~
Anyone else finding it difficult to watch Rooney play in the same attack as this heaven sent Angel?

1018~~~
Someone needs to gif that chipped pass to RvP, that was pure sex

1019~~~
LOL what the feck?!

1020~~~
Ronaldo just broke another TV set watching Di Maria playing at United.

1021~~~
Sorry DDG, Di Maria is our best player now<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1022~~~
Qué injusticia

1023~~~
Our new Ronaldo.

1024~~~
Really great performance from him today. That pass to van Persie was amazing.

1025~~~
Pretty amazing that we were able to perfectly replace Giggs immediately after he retired.

1026~~~
He's fecking ace, a snip at £60m if he keeps playing like this.

1027~~~
I'd say he 's perfect where he is in midfield. At the heart of everything, you wanna get your most creative players on the ball as much as possible.

1028~~~
Great performance worthy of the 7 shirt. Weak opposition, yes, but there is no doubt he can replicate it against the best sides.

1029~~~
Perez <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1030~~~
Think this is the second time after Makelele that they have sold a WC player in his prime. At least with Sneijder and Robben, you could say that they never got a proper go or worked out at Madrid but Di Maria was arguably their best player last season. Mindless decision.

1031~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that interview with Mata the translator

1032~~~
Neville seemed to think the assist for Mata's goal was a shot on goal. Do you guys think so as well?

I didn't even consider it being a shot in the first place to be honest. It would make no sense from there, with Mata being in space. Thought it was great vision and another brilliant pass.

1033~~~
Might as well give him the player of the year already. The man is pure sex <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1034~~~
Absolutely brilliant performance. Madrid fans must be pig sick.

1035~~~
Goal, assist, man of the match, creating everything for us... all well and good, but <i>that</i> pass to RVP, though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1036~~~
He clearly meant to pass to Mata, for Mata's goal. Just watching the replay, you can see he's looking up at Mata when he's calling for it.

1037~~~
What a beast he is. He's like Giggs in his latter years as a CM but with a better engine and workrate.

1038~~~
This lad is not bad!

1039~~~
Don't be ridiculous guys, no one would try a low pass like that past 3 QPR players, clearly he was shaping to shoot.

1040~~~
However, clearly he is the 1st name on the teamsheet, Herrera 2nd.

1041~~~
Can't believe we put up with Valencia and Young for so long.

1042~~~
So it's more reasonable to suggest he'd try a shot from that angle with several QPR players in the way?

1043~~~
This guy is unreal. Proper elite player. Love his work rate as well.

1044~~~
Madrid should cry at themselves,  they let such a world class player go, totally insane.

1045~~~
The guy is magic. Easily, just easily our best player. That outside of the foot pass to RvP in the second half was sublime. What did we do to go from Ashley fecking Young to Angel Di Maria. I can't believe it...

1046~~~
His line of sight to goal to goal was unobstructed.

1047~~~
But.. But.. he's a luxury buy! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1048~~~
Can we panic every transfer window?

1049~~~
For the near corner (which Green had well covered) probably.

1050~~~
Showed ambition and went out and ensured that we bought a top class footballer. Thankfully though, whereas he looked like the best player in a poor team the other week, this week he looked like one of the best players in a much improved team. It'll help him here to have those around him performing and to not have to carry the side on his own.

1051~~~
That was a Ballon d'Or performance today. Do that regularly throughout a season and he'll be among the three candidates for it.

If he stays fit and plays well throughout the season, he could be the thing that carries us back to prominence.

1052~~~
Yeah i am aware it probably not the best decision but you don't draw your kicking foot that far back to make that kind of pass, it clearly was a miskick.

1053~~~
He's the shit, isn't he?

1054~~~
You can tell he just knows that he's our best player as well.

1055~~~
Missed his interview.

1056~~~
We'll have to see what he is like on a cold January away to West Brom, but today...wow...just wow. We have signed one helluva brilliant player.

1057~~~
What a player

1058~~~
He isn't world class!!!

Calling him world class would be disrespectful because players deemed world class nowadays are not even worthy of cleaning his shoes! If Aguero, Silva are deemed world class, then what on earth is Angel? 
Unreal player, already our best imo.

1059~~~
So awesome to have a great number 7 on the field again. Just a delight to watch him play.

1060~~~
I said this to my mate.

1061~~~
For me, quickly turning into our best player, exceeded ,my expectations and very impressed.

1062~~~
Unworldly today. Absolute majestic. And he hasnt even got his feet firmly on the ground yet. Poor Leicester..

1063~~~
He's by far and away our best player.

1064~~~
He's constantly taking responsibility to be the one to make something happen, whether he's in our half or on the edge of the oppositions box. He constantly wants the ball, and isn't afraid to try something different. A bit like Ronaldo, he knows he's the main man, and he'll flourish under that. Its a fantastic trait to have

1065~~~
Silva and Aguero are in or around his level to be fair. Silva was majestic vs Arsenal yesterday.

1066~~~
He's just so confident in everything he does, he isn't affected by pressure and in fact the bigger the game the better he is. He knows he can take the piss against the likes of this standard of opposition and I expect he'll win us some games single handed this year.

1067~~~
100% shot on goal

1068~~~
It was a shot otherwise I don't think he would have used that surface of his foot to make the pass, weirdly lacing it gave the ball the most optimal pace to reach Mata.

1069~~~
If just like to sit here and drool over him. Thank you.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1070~~~
He wasn't as influential but yes Silva and Aguero are brilliant payers no point denying it.

1071~~~
This please <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1072~~~
Relax, Silva specifically, is one of the best players in the league and one of the best playmakers in the world. He's most definitely up there with the best. Aguero when injury free and fully fit is one of the best strikers in the world.

1073~~~
If you want to make a low flat cross, it's a possibility. Anyway, it's impossible to know for sure. Like I said, I didn't even think of it as being a shot on goal initially because it would make absolutely no sense to shoot from there. I haven't seen a proper replay of it (only the gif from one angle), but during the game it looked like he looked up and spotted Mata pulling into space before making the shot/pass.

1074~~~
Yep, the one that fell into Young's mouth.

1075~~~
He was immense. he was at the heart of everything.

1076~~~
He was excellent today, buzzed all across the pitch with great affect. Delighted he's a United player.

1077~~~

1078~~~
Yeah, isn't not an insult for Di Maria to be put in a bracket with players like the ones you've mentioned. He's top class. World class. Top quality. Whatever people like to say.

1079~~~
Was like watching Ronaldo again ca. 2007, constantly running at players and opposition shat their pants whenever he started another run. Unreal. Will help us immensly in bringing the fear factor back IMO.

1080~~~
70,000 raging boners in one stadium, and not one feck was given.

He gives us that directness we have lacked for some time now. Quick counter or looking for a man to make something happen. Fantastic and exciting player to have.

1081~~~
Whaddayyy playyaaaa this guy is. Real class.

1082~~~
He is Special!

In Spain it is the Messi and Ronaldo show so its hard to actually appreciate anyone else, but putting him in this United side it is obvious how much class he has.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1083~~~
Best player in the league.

1084~~~
"He says 'thank you'" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1085~~~
This. He looks on another level to anyone else.

1086~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I agree with the sentiment that he's our best player now. Such a unique player as well. Amazing work rate, great pace, great vision and passing. Brilliant.

1087~~~
Every bit a £60m player. Should be your Ronaldo/Suarez this season.

And no, not wumming. Couldn't find a weakness in any part of his game.

1088~~~
Clearly a shot.
Brilliant stuff though. On a different level to anyone on the pitch. Nice to have a player who isn't afraid to give the ball away by doing something a bit different and trickier.

1089~~~
A month ago i said that buying a world class midfielder like vidal is more important than a luxury signing like di maria, boy was i wrong.

I can see now that he isn't a luxury player at all, he's exactly what the team needed more than anything else. I haven't been this excited when a player has the ball since ronaldo.

1090~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1091~~~
I think you would have to say it's between him and Aguero. Aguero is just as devastating in what he does.

1092~~~
Is, is this real life? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

I'm trying to work out your angle here.

1093~~~
A bit speechless after that. He seems far better than I recall him at Madrid.

1094~~~
ah don't worry, he'll have many a frustrating game for us too, he's just that sort of player. Like the game for Argentina where he cocked up everything he did only to score the winner in injury time.

1095~~~
Even last season?

1096~~~
He says thank you.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1097~~~
He definitely misplaced a number of passes in the first half, but I think that was a case of settling into the game as I didn't notice him put a foot out of place in the second half. Not trying to put a dampener on his performance which was obviously class, but he can still improve even further imo. Which is a frightening thought really!

1098~~~
No, I really admire Aguero but he doesn't bring as much to the team.  This guy is immense. I can't believe some people described him like an Argentinian Nani (meaning inconsistant) when we bought him.

1099~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://media.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ronaldo.jpg" src="http://media.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ronaldo.jpg"/>

1100~~~
Yeah, he said so himself after the game.

1101~~~
Every player misplaces passes. He's asked to do everything, almost literally, so obviously his ones will be more noticeable.

I think he hit a real peak at Madrid last season and he should be able to carry that on for another season or two.

1102~~~
He's alright, I'm better.

1103~~~
So good.

1104~~~

C'mon...

1105~~~
Looked everywhere for the white text......... seriously though well done, that must have been like typing in broken glass. 
Your right mind you.

1106~~~
We know this adzz, hence why there was no hesitation signing you. ADM was more of a 'panic buy'.

1107~~~
I'm in shock that I've seen this line from a Liverpool fan, but took something to admit that, but then again we had to suffer Suarez's brilliance last year, you can suffer Angel's this year <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1108~~~
He's going to give that, he's just not afraid to make a mistake, it's a total opposite of what we've been served up.

1109~~~
Three big signings from La Liga Costa,Fabregas andDi Maria look real superstars. Real world class talent. 

Falaco will hopefully join the club.

1110~~~
That's fake pic

1111~~~
He seems to be thriving in the role of the main man. Here, he is the big man, the club record signing, he doesn't have to live in the shadow of the Bales and Ronaldos.

1112~~~
The ones I was referring too weren't particularly difficult or cutting passes. Anyway it was only really in response to someone saying there were no weaknesses in his game today. I'm not trying to be critical. Just saying that I think there is room for him to improve even further and impress even more as he is a real class act.

1113~~~
He's always been good but the switch last season into that hybrid AM/LW role at Real Madrid took him to another level and we are gonna reap the rewards I feel. He was magic today, sure he over hit one or two passes but you are gonna get that with a flair player, but his runs, his awareness and vision were just superb and when he lost the ball he was like a dog and the QPR player had a meat pie tied to his arse the way he hunted to get it back.

1114~~~
I know and I was cheaper anyway.

1115~~~
A world class display, more of the same please <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

1116~~~
That run for the second goal brought a tear to the eye. So simple yet so effective and something we have been lacking for too long. Completely made the goal by just running it up the pitch with blistering pace. Love him.

1117~~~
Has anyone got a video of the pass he made to RvP who volleyed it straight into Greens hands?

1118~~~
Exactly. Just run with the ball towards the opponents box, that's all he did. That's the most basic thing in football, but few have the confidence to do that and have the picture in their mind what to do with the ball when they get there. He's got the lot.

1119~~~
I forgot we have Juan Mata despite us signing Di Maria and Falcao. What a charming guy with a lovely voice <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1120~~~
He lifted everyone, players were enjoying the football played for the first time in a long time.

1121~~~
You can see his reflection and everything, the other pic looks so much more fake.

1122~~~
This boy just oozes class, he's gonna be up there when it comes to nominating the player of the season this year.

1123~~~
I think that performance should be enough to shut up the doubters. Cant believe people were saying he is not someone we need. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1124~~~
Absolute class, every time he got the ball he looked dangerous. Ok this was QPR but I think this guy could do it against any opposition. He is going to be a United legend.

1125~~~
I know. Just kidding mate.

1126~~~
He can, and has. For example he has torn Barcelona apart loads of times, he won't think twice about ripping the teams in this league to pieces too.

1127~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He was a joy to watch alright.

1128~~~
That pass <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1129~~~
Perfect for the system as well. This is only the start <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1130~~~
Great to see such an exciting player like him in the premier league. I remember he tore Everton apart when we played Benfica years ago in the Europa always been a big fan since.

1131~~~
That was insane <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1132~~~
It won't be. I fully expect someone on MOTD tonight to use a line similar to, "but can he do it on a rainy night away at Stoke"

1133~~~
Could be the best player in the PL over the next few years.

Superb signing given what we lacked - someone who can inject pace into the attack.

1134~~~
He's such an exciting player, which we've been desperately missing. He can change the game in an instant and he makes the opposition scared shitless. An absolute joy to watch.

1135~~~
I never doubt this type of signing because a team can never have enough world class players. When there's a world class player available you must buy him even if he isn't a priority. We need to stop questioning transfer fees because it's stupid to do so, if you want a player a club should do everything in it's power to sign him even more if he's world class. Even a fee of 80m or more shouldn't be enough to deter us from signing a player. If we did this 3 years ago, we would have Lucas, Hazard and Nasri in our team and many other top players which we kept under the radar and never signed because of financial terms.

1136~~~
Well Hansen and Shearer? They aren't exactly bright now are they? You can't blame them.

1137~~~
Can't believe Real Madrid let this guy go.

1138~~~

1139~~~
Was pure sex that. Would love to see it again too!

1140~~~
What a difference he made. He utilized his position very well. On the wings when attacking and providing cover for Rojo when defending as well. Starting counters is his speciality and with his pace I hope he can do this against bigger teams as well. What a world class player. £60m well spent.

1141~~~
Thanks a lot mate! Fantastic pass <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

RVP should be heading that in IMO

1142~~~
Bit weird of me but my absolutely favourite contribution was when he fought like hell to win the ball back on the edge of our box then released Mata with a back heel. Perfect combo of grit and imagination. Gif? Anyone?

1143~~~
That was absolutley brilliant. The back heel at the end was ridiculous under those circumstances.

1144~~~
Heading that how ?

1145~~~
He wouldnt have got enough power to beat Green if he had headed the ball.

1146~~~
Absolutely brilliant. Frightens defenders, picks out some sublime passes and chases and harries too. He's a joy to watch.

1147~~~
I loved the chip to rojo, the move reminded me of Cantona's flick to Irwin all those years ago!!

1148~~~
Ah sorry, I'm seeing it on a small screen. Looked like it was high enough to head it in like he did against Spain.

1149~~~
Enjoy:

1150~~~
Been a hallmark of his game over the years. It's what I love about this player. I don't think there's another footballer with his level of ability who can press and chase as well as he does.

1151~~~
Juan Sebastian Veron made that kind of pass to Ruud in pre season 2003. Di Maria looks a bit more complete footballer with his pace, skills and all the good jazz.

1152~~~
Heading that is even more impossible than the finish he tried.

1153~~~
Agreed, these days people have a moan because the "english" mindset of rewarding grit over technique, but when he blended both worlds like that it was brilliant.

1154~~~
How the feck could be head that?

1155~~~
Not weird at all, it was so amazing I found myself laughing out loud at the audacity following the battle. Amazing combination and a perfect summary of his showcase so far

1156~~~
He was EVERYWHERE!

Serious question: Is there another player in the world like him? Obviously I don't mean by this if there are better players than him around, but if there's another player with a world class game and technique who also happens to be great defensively and runs for the whole game? Although a different player, I can only think of Koke who also does everything from the beginning till the end every game on a world class level. Anyone else?

1157~~~
Unbelievable, wasn't it? That actually was the highlight of the game for me!

1158~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/adm5eoeu.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/adm5eoeu.gif"/>

1159~~~
Amazing

1160~~~
I can't. Awful music, awful "effects". 


I hope some fecker recorded his player cam.

1161~~~
Thanks, Olly. 

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1162~~~
Super performance from Angel today. Gives us that drive in midfield that we've been lacking for quite a while now, and compliments Blind and Herrera very well, in my opinion. 

If we continue with this diamond formation, as well as the full back overlapping, he can also give us some natural width down the left and provide some great crosses into the box like he did today.

1163~~~
What a performance from Di Maria. Apart from a couple of times where he gave the ball away in a dangerous area, he had the sort of impact that i was hoping for. It's only his 2nd game, but if he can avoid the injury curse, he will be up there for the player of the year award. He is an absolute joy to watch.

1164~~~
Wonderful bit of skill, but not sure how that was not a foul.

1165~~~
If that gif could be translated into music that would be my ringtone!

1166~~~
He was excellent. I like it when he switches through the gears when he's running forward with the ball.

Hopefully going to be a big player for us for many years to come.

1167~~~
A steal! People said we didnt need him while he's EXACTLY what we needed! 

He can be the player to make a difference in the team. He is not at 100% yet so there is a lot more to come. Truly exciting

1168~~~
To think, I was worried we'd 'waste' him in midfield and not play him on the wing <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1169~~~
Don't be too sure yet, the 3-5-2 might be back.

1170~~~
It's completely the opposite. It's a waste to play him wide.

1171~~~
Wasnt that hard to admit. Loved him at Real and great to see him in the prem. Admittedly softened by the fact that he hasn't fixed the key areas to worry me too much but that's for another thread.

Angel is a brilliant footballer.

1172~~~
Not at all. His best work today was out wide. This midfield diamond isn't as different to a 442 as a lot of people seem to think.

1173~~~
Couldn't praise our player without getting a dig in. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think Herrera, Blind and Rojo were all signed to fix key areas too, as you may have seen today. Shaw didn't even play.

1174~~~
I think there were nerves initially or maybe
Reminded me of that pre season when Veron set up Ruud. Pity this one didn't fly in

1175~~~
What, like that massive glaring issue of our shite central midfield?

You're hilarious Dumby.

1176~~~
That depends Pogue how it's played to be fair.

1177~~~
Then I shall post my thoughts there. That's all the white text I have on Angel like I said.

1178~~~
Once the team gels around ADM and he's in top form, he can be just unstoppable

1179~~~
Pure class.  I think once he comes to terms with the pace of the league, he will shine even more.

1180~~~
I never in a million years thought we would get him simply because I never thought that Real would sell him. I've admired him for a few years now and I am ecstatic that he is our no 7. He was absolutely amazing today and is exactly what we've needed! A True no 7 IMO. Can't wait for the next match.

1181~~~
Think we paid too much for him! -smug-

1182~~~
It's basically his own niche role. Central when we're defending or the ball is in our half/the middle and then you'll find him out wide when we have it in the final third. It's great too as it highlights all of his best attributes. 442 diamond is actually much closer to 352, you just have a holding midfielder instead of a ball-playing centre back (which is much better for us).

1183~~~
He pretty much played the excact same role he did last season. Shuttler on the left of a DM, with liberty to move about, go wide, dribble and float as he pleases - and with the tenacity to get back into the diamond shape when we lose the ball.

Starting him out wide in say a 4-3-3 would kill a lot of his good work and negates his ability to get into the areas he does so much of his good work I.E. the runs from deep with and without the ball straight through the middle. It's impossible to defend against. He still maintains the option to go wide.

1184~~~
Watching him and Rooney sprint the length of the pitch together then create a goal was great. I bet Rooney was getting flashbacks to playing alongside another United number 7 who also played for Madrid (no, not Michael Owen)

1185~~~

It was, but the referee gave advantage.

Rooney and Beckham never played together at Utd you senile old fecker!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You editing fecker. I had the England pic posted and all.

Aw you quoted <i>after </i>I edited it. How embarrassing for you.

Bellend.

1193~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1194~~~
Prob belongs in the unpopular opinions thread but I think this guy is a tad bit better than Ashley Young.

1195~~~
Letting this guy go will be Real Madrid's biggest mistake yet. Love him already and a serious contender to be present on the back of my new shirt<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1196~~~
I am in love with this man already. The pass he did to Van Persie was out of this world. He had us counter attacking that reminded of the Ronaldo days and what we have seen Real Madrid doing in recent years.

1197~~~
Don't see how that is unpopular mate he's considered one of the best players in the world and I think everyone admits Young should be at best a squad player.

1198~~~
He's so good it's unreal.

A tenacious ball winning box-to-box midfielder, an intelligent playmaker and a world class winger all rolled into one?

Dear God what have Perez done.

1199~~~
Amazing isn't it? the only thing I'd say is suspect is his shooting, but in every single other area, I couldn't fault him. He's almost Christiano Ronaldo. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1200~~~
feck it, even his misplaced shots ended up in goal - the assist for Mata!

He's actually really good at moving inside from the right hand side and curling it in the far corner.

You'll see soon enough.

1201~~~
Because often english ref would let defenders and midfielder rough up the new talents who are playing their trade in the league.

1202~~~
Holy shite, this guy is unbelievable! Thanks Real Madrid.

1203~~~
Great performance.

A small thing but when he went over to take the corner early in the 2nd half you could see all the fans so happy to see such a performance. It reminded me of a load of ugly blokes who have managed to pull a Worldie and can't believe their luck. It was like the start of seeing something special happening.

1204~~~
Madrid were mad to sell him.

1205~~~
It sort of feels like "Ronaldo is back" ?

1206~~~
I watched the Madrid Darby yesterday and Rodriguez is very good but Di Maria is on another level.  Madrid will regret this one.

1207~~~
Thank you so much Perez........you absolute muppet.

1208~~~
Di Maria was class today, hopefully we see many more performances like that from him.

On a side note, the players all gave it to Van Gaal's wife apparently...

1209~~~
Especially since they have lost their last three games and Alonso has got MotM for his two games for Bayern. Complete lunacy to sell your two of your best midfielders in the same window. Di Maria is pure class. EXACTLY what united have been missing (amongst others)  I hope the new boys continue to stick two fingers up to the doubters! 

A special mention needs to be made to the OT crowd today. Pure class from beginning to end, I haven't seen or felt that much energy from them for a VERY long time.

1210~~~
They owed us one for Ronaldo. Plus it helps their idiots and only like poster boys

1211~~~
fecking hell. We signed Di Maria. I couldn't believe it at times today, he's a class above any player we've had here since Ronaldo.

1212~~~
I love the media and opposition fans also some Caf posters talking about overpaying and we should of went for Sanchez at half the price but Di Maria is a league above he was the heart of the team today and has continued on from where he left off last season, I am still shocked we signed one of the best players in the world in his prime <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> don't care that it was only QPR he can do that against any team. May be a lot of money but it was so worth it <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1213~~~
First time I've been excited watching United for what seems like a very long time.  OK it was only QPR but the new fellas played some lovely stuff.  Felt like the real start of the season.

1214~~~
We've signed the exact player we need, who is in his prime, who is one of the best in the world. Incredible.

1215~~~
Every time he picked the ball up and ran....... it made me remember what having Ronaldo in the team felt like...

1216~~~
When you are daft enough to sell Makelele, you can sell Di Maria.

1217~~~
Brought the excitment back, was great to see him pick up the ball and just drive forward. Pleased to see his free kick creep him.

1218~~~
I really do hope Real Madrid sign Vidal, maybe we end up with Illarra for a cut price. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/> If you go back through the years, Real Madrid made many of these silly mistakes like Makelele, Robben, Ozil and Sneijder.

1219~~~
Great performance. He makes you realise the crap we've been treated to by Nani/Young/Valencia for the past couple of years.

1220~~~
Every time he was on the ball I couldn't stop laughing, wtf were Madrid thinking when they agree to sell him? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This fecker was top 5 in the world last year and by the way he started here it wasn't just an accident.

1221~~~
I know it's early but I think come the end of the season he'll be the best player in the league comfortably.

1222~~~
You have to ask though, why the f*ck did we spend so many of the post Ronaldo years dicking around with average players, rather then just buying proper quality players.

1223~~~
It's something I thought about with a few things he did during the match. After a bit of skill or something, I was saying to myself, wow, that is class, we haven't had that for a while, he is really playing well. But then I remembered that really, he is one of the best in the world and what he did was just his usual self. 

We will get used to many great performances this season.

1224~~~
Couldn't have put it better myself, we really aren't used to having one of the best players in the world on our side, not for a while at least. The best thing about it is that it isn't an exaggeration, he's one of the top 5 players in world football. Oh, I'm giddy <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1225~~~
We were still winning titles under the greatest manager that's ever lived. In saying that, we'd probably have one more CL title if SAF spent the money we did this summer on quality, instead of persisting with players he needed to wave his magic wand to get to perform to a certain standard.

1226~~~
SAF: There was no "value in the market".

1227~~~
I guess you can link almost every formation. But like somebody above said, that's dependant on how it's played.
But I saw many on here with 4-3-3 formations and Di Maria wide left/right, and to me that's a waste.

He's one of the best (if not the best) at going from standstill or back to goal to running past players through the centre, or from the half way line. That's a weapon that's limited when he's stuck out wide, and the rest of his game is good enough to do the other midfielder bits.

He was able to get himself inside quite a bit today. He's always going to drift outside wherever he plays.

I guess my point is less about sticking him wide being a waste, and more that sticking him high up the pitch and wide is a waste. He needs to be deeper, preferably central (in my opinion) where he can get it, accelerate, and speed up play. Teams aren't used to it, and can't stop it.

I guess this system gives the best of both, as he can come central or spread wide at different times. But a formation with genuine width and Di Maria out wide is wasting him, in my opinion.

1228~~~
In regards to where he is best used, centrally or out wide. I think in that narrow diamond, that left side suits him perfect. It gives him the chance to drift inside and play through the middle but if we have time on the ball, he can spread wide and give us width.

I'm hoping to see more of that in the weeks to come.

1229~~~
We've had three seasons of pleading our players to get the ball to one of van Persie or Mata. I now feel we're a threat if any of our front six have the ball, it's the f*cking dogs bollocks. This guy is a superstar, arguably the best in the league.

1230~~~
With a footballer of Di Maria's quality, so long as you get him on the ball the formation is almost irrelevant.

1231~~~
True.

1232~~~
Just wondering what the other lot at RAWK are saying? I mean, Di Maria is overrated and too expensive and not as good as Lallana and blah blah blah!

1233~~~
It does yeah. I think he could play a similar role in a 4-3-3 too, as long as whoever was selected on the left of the front 3 for you was given plenty of freedom to drift inside with Di María overlapping on the wing. It's only the 3-5-2 I think that would limit him a bit, so hopefully van Gaal goes back to that <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1234~~~
You start to think to yourself 'we don't deserve a player of his quality', then you realise that a player like him should be the standard at United and that we've been 'spoiled' by the likes of Young and Valencia. 

I don't think anyone was thinking of his price tag today, including those moaning about how much he cost.

1235~~~
Martin Tyler certainly was. The asshat.

1236~~~
Nothing new there.

1237~~~
Exactly, and that's the beauty of that role for him as he basically plays two positions and both very well. So we have a three man midfield, or he can go up the wing leaving Blind and Herrera in the middle which is certainly nothing to scoff at.

1238~~~
Just give him the Ballon D'or now. 
The guys just so talented it's unreal. Our other players are going to need to hit top form if they don't want to be embarrassed by Di Maria.

1239~~~
Rewatching the first half now, it's amazing how consistent and threatening his crossing is. His delivery is Beckham-esque almost. We've really missed that delivery out wide since giggsy stopped playing as a winger really, and given how we've always been big with wingers, it has hurt us.

1240~~~
Not suggesting his crossing was poor but it could have been a lot better. The goal was a perfect delivery from that angle and distance but his actual crosses from wide areas I thought didn't have enough pace and were floated a little too much. Again, not saying he was poor in that aspect but I think he can do far better.

1241~~~

1242~~~
Meh, re watching the game now and pretty much all his crosses, even though the majority didn't get to a red shirt, were all in dangerous positions. Noticed it at Madrid too though, his crossing was always great. It's just more noticeable when you go from young always hitting it out for a goal kick, Valencia into the defender or nani doing who knows what, to di Maria just being world class.

1243~~~
Goldberg! Goldberg!

1244~~~
Just seen this on youtube comments of all places:

I heard there was a secret chord,
That Woodward played and it pleased the board
But then he fecked it up with Thomas Müller
But wait, who's this,
With goals, assists?
Gave Ed a call, he could not resist
Said Woodward come and get me Di Mariaaaa!
Di Mariaaaaaaaaaaaa
Di Mariiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaa

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1245~~~
He's quite good...

1246~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> He's amazing, isn't he? Really glad for him though, hope he'll have a great season with you guys.

Florentino can do one.

1247~~~
If you want to toss us a Modric or Varane this way next Summer, that would be much appreciated <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1248~~~
He's simply awesome. Watching him running at, and beating, players from the left wing reminded me of Giggs and a bit of Ronaldo as well. The guy just oozes quality in everything he does. Attacking wise he can do it all and his stats back that up. It's also nice to see him willing to be involved at both ends of the pitch and showing confidence on the ball. He cost a lot but it looks like this is a great investment.

We've suffered through some appalling wing play for long enough. Now our attack is well on it's way to being feared again.

1249~~~
He's amazing, even better than I expected. Amazing control at high speed, such great passing for someone who's been a midfielder for one season.

1250~~~
What's Goldberg doing in Manchester?
I thought you(not you personally) were silly ditching Ozil, but the team moved from strength to strength.

This is still completely baffling.

1251~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck off!
Yeah, I was hoping the same scenario would repeat itself again but we've turned into a shower of shite.

Altough I do think that we might have survived selling only Di Maria, but selling both him <i>and</i> Alonso has destroyed our team. We lack any sort of cohesion right now.

1252~~~
I was certain when Alsonso left that you were binging in a younger player who could do what he done for the team.

1253~~~
We should have brought in Koke, I feel he would be pretty perfect for us right now. Altough playing for AM he'll probably make a stop gap somewhere else for a season or two before considering us. 

I'm sure we'll be looking for an established CM/DM in Januari. But that's for another thread.

1254~~~
Assist for Mata was a cross,  his body shape look like he meant to cross it. He just hit it hard so that the defenders don't have much time to intercept it

1255~~~
? You seriously think he will join you guys? I know loyalty doesn't mean much in football these days but he really seems to be Atletico through and through. Even rejected Barca this season, will probably end up with them anyway, but I would be willing to bet my house he won't play for you.

1256~~~
Been saying this aswell. I'm pretty sure if you'd play him on the wing he'd put on performances like that on a weekly basis, which his game against Germany sort of proved.

The area you need him in the most right now is midfield though.

1257~~~
His jersey is on the way thanks to DHL.  Can't wait to wear it this week!

1258~~~
"But for that amount of money we could have bought a bunch of youngsters who might go on to be good in a few years time. Our identity!!!!"


A performance that justified the reasons for spending big on him.

1259~~~
Meh, you're probably right, money talks though. Wouldn't be the first player to change his mind seeing a big fat cheque with his name on it.

1260~~~
Just have to say that I love this guy. Thank you Real Madrid!

1261~~~
It's about time we get to say that.

It's criminal they want Rodriguez over Di Maria.

1262~~~
Yes, indeed.

Thank You Madrid and send us more !

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You'd probably have been able to pull it off with our previous presi, Calderon. He was an incredible tool.

It was surreal seeing him celebrate his goal in united colours. He's actually ours <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

He was a bit special.

If Januzaj can fulfill his potential, I'm almost 100% sure that the league is ours to lose next year. Two incredible dribblers on both sides <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1274~~~
Shit celebration. Sell him.

1275~~~
His pass to Mata was superb - didn't see his goal or his other assists, but that pass was brilliant.

Some quality players have been brought into the PL this season - Fabregas, Costa, Di Maria and Sanchez are all going to take the league by storm.

1276~~~
What about we up our offer by 10m and you keep both? Seems a fair deal to me.

1277~~~
Really? I loved the celebration personally, he was clearly delighted it went in and all. Much rather those then when a player just stand there and acts tough (only cantona can pull this off).

1278~~~
Yeah, absolutely loved the celebration. He celebrated the shit out of that goal.

1279~~~
*strokes chin*

It'd cover Andersons pie bill, for a few weeks...

1280~~~
Very good game from him. You can easily tell he is a world class player, and watching his work rate is great. The man appears everywhere on the pitch. Best bit about it is really there is far more to come. At the moment he still isn't playing at his best I feel. Quite a few simple mistakes at times that do take away from his game. I think LVG did mention this as well. Once he has fully settled in those should go though. Very happy we have him here.

1281~~~
Van Gaal was spot on about him. He said even though Di Maria set up the goals and scored one himself, he could do a lot better than this because he gave the ball away far too much. That will come with more practice and familiarity with the team.

1282~~~
Yep, you can see the class is there. Once he has settled, those losses of possession will drop right down

1283~~~
So was that a shot or a cross? I kinda remember Di Maria lifting his head up and having a glance at Mata before hitting the ball. It could have been him trying to trick the goalie and he also used his laces instead of side footing the ball which is indicative of a shot most of the time. 

However, he seems to heavily prefer using his laces more often than not when it comes to crosses and deliveries. A low drilled ball also looked more suitable than a side footed one in that scenario. Also think Herrera asked him during the goal celebration if he meant it or not, to which Di Maria nodded. 

Meh, at the end of the day, it's irrelevant and I am just delighted we have a gem of a player.

1284~~~
Definitely believe it was a pass, just drilled it to Mata quickly. When he looked up, Mata was calling for it, too.

1285~~~
Perez is a goddamn lunatic for letting Di Maria go. 

What an amazing player.

1286~~~
That outfoot pass to Van Persie was sex, his vision and unpredictability will make us difficult to defend against.

1287~~~
Good point. We have unpredictability again. A point highlighted even more when Valencia came on (fact he doesn't have it) and rio's comments on Moyes (he didn't have if tactically).

1291~~~
James Rodriguez having a fantastic tournament was the best thing that could have happened to United over the summer.

1292~~~
Does anyone else just stop themselves during the day and think 'holy crap we have Di Maria playing for us'? Out of all our signings he excites me most. Love him.

1293~~~
So, we've this world class centre midfield player now...

1294~~~
Yes. Great point.

I remember we were heavily linked with him the summer of his Benfica exit. As I recall most people on here didn't want United to sign him. Has he just improved immensely during his time at Real, or was he always made out to be a top class player at Benfica?

1295~~~
Can't believe the commentator (Dixon?) said that his assist to Mata was "absolutely, no doubt" a shot.

You this he's that bad at shooting? Just happened to turn into a top shelf pass?

Small world in that guys mind, where Argentinean is different from Spanish.

1296~~~
I want to know what United supporter doesn't love him, he's sensational.

1297~~~
All match yesterday I felt like, holy hell this isn't real is it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I still don't quite see him as our player yet, more like someone we've just borrowed for a bit.

1298~~~
His body shape would suggest it was a shot, he was laughing about it after with Herrera and Mata.

1299~~~
Me too, in just two matches he's already our best player.

1300~~~
I disagree. For one he clearly takes a look at Mata just before playing it, and secondly from the position he was in a shot makes very little sense. It never looked like a shot in a million years to me. Jenas called it right on motd, it was intended to be a cross. However it ended up being more like a pin point pass and that's what they were laughing about afterwards.

1301~~~
It was 100% a shot, it's not in doubt. Nobody passes the ball in that way.

1302~~~
Guys. I still can't believe we have Di Maria in our team.

1303~~~
Mata also took to twitter to have a laugh about it after, it was a shot.

1304~~~
Fair enough. Absolutely shocking attempt in that case! Genuinely thought it must have been a mishit cross.

1305~~~
It was a shot. Every one looking at the game with me (6 of us) acknowledged that when we watched the replay. Jenas is talking nonsense.

1306~~~
How long until our rivals start saying we're a one man team? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1307~~~
Thats the thing about Madrid, they have amazing offensive players, who are forced to play in roles which limit their skills, due to the next big galactico coming in

I mean if you had ronaldo, bale, rodriguez, isco etc, all in different teams, where the team is built around those players, thats when those players truly shine, at madrid most flair players are wasted

1308~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://teamwinning.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/smile.jpg" src="https://teamwinning.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/smile.jpg"/>

1309~~~
Herrera, Blind? 

Too soon..?

1310~~~
Guys, that was a pass, no doubt in my mind!

1311~~~
Even when he completely mishits a shot from a ridiculous area, it still goes on to become a perfect assist. He was that good. He always has these typical moments in matches, few crazy deliveries, dazzling runs, lovely work ethic. I just keep remembering that first half against barca last season when he ripped apart barca's right.

1312~~~
Where would people rank Di Maria in relation to the best players in the world, top10?

Think it's fair to say he's behind Bale and possibly Neymar, id say he's ahead of James Rodriguez though.

1313~~~
I'd say on current/recent form only behind the big 2 and on par with the likes of Neymar, Silva, Aguero, Bale

1314~~~
I'd place Bale ahead of him, but yeah that's pretty fair as things stand. He's certainly above his replacement, James.

1315~~~
It was a dangerous ball, whipped in at pace and directed towards goal with the design that any flick from an attacker would likely beat the goalkeeper. The fact it went in without a touch was due to him intentionally aiming it at the goal and the goalkeeper having to position himself mindfully of any touch changing it's course. So while it wasn't a shot as such, it was still more than just a cross.

1316~~~
Going off of last season, I'd say he is better than Bale. Same with Neymar, the two just a little behind. In and around that level below Ronaldo and Messi - as 'just below' the big 2 is Suarez. 
Ronaldo/Messi>Suarez>Robben>Zlatan/di Maria/Falcao/Aguero/Silva etc...

1317~~~
A Di Maria in the form of his life as well. Still shocks me that Madrid let him go, no matter how much they got from him.

1318~~~
Well yes, but James is a great player and he might reach Di Maria's level in a couple of years. He is also (much) younger than all the other players mentioned above, bar Neymar. Ofc RM made a mistake to let Di Maria go, but let's not pretend James is some kind of average player.

1319~~~
I'm still getting over seeing Juan Mata playing for us.

1320~~~
I never said he was.

1321~~~
Oh it wasn't directed at you <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> but yeah, one could read it like that I admit!

1322~~~
"Value"... Not much we can blame Fergie for, but the way he let the squad fall into disrepute after the sale of Ronaldo is a pretty big one. Still, we can't blame him too much. It was only because of his genius man-management that we got those titles after all.

That run in the lead-up to Herrera's goal was prime Ronnie. Another pacey outlet for the other side, or give Januzaj his due and we will be set. Mata will be in heaven picking up the spaces created by the pace on either wing and playing through everyone ahead of him.

1323~~~
He has slotted nicely to the league. No bed in period for him. Yesterday felt like we were watching a team that has played together for years.

1324~~~
Agreed. We had our zip and pace in the passing. The movement was excellent. It all started when ADM picked up the ball. He wanted to run at players and commit them. A joy to watch, which is something I haven't said at OT for at least 3 seasons.

1325~~~
I'm certain it was a mishit shot but quite a few people seem to think it was a pass, so I've made a homepage poll to settle this once and for all <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1326~~~
I don't think we did. 

Di Maria was the only one who injected any pace into the play, otherwise we were neat and tidy but still very, very slow in build up.

It didn't matter because QPR were genuinely one of the worst teams to come to OT for a long while and never got near us pressing wise but we weren't quick by any stretch of the imagination.

It was the lack of pace in the build up that meant we almost went into half time at 0-0. Obviously Di Maria's free kick meant the pressure was off a bit but we didn't look like scoring until that happened.

1327~~~
Lol at the poll. I think it was a miss-hit cross-shot.

1328~~~
It was a shot, no question about it.  You don't crank up your standing leg like that for a "pass".

1329~~~
The one thing I love about him is that he simply has so many ways to produce a pass. He'll see a player (like that RVP run) an produce whatever pass - inside our outside of the foot - needed to pick him up. Artistic, in a way.

1330~~~
Even if it's a pass that has to cover 30/40 yards very quickly to ensure that Mata still has space to receive the ball and not have it intercepted? The more I look at it, the more I think he might have meant it.

1331~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1332~~~
I had to have another look after this debate. I found this vine which seems to show it from the best angle:
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OapVgeK5EwT/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>
At the time I thought it was an intentional ball weighted to perfection and I stand by it. You can even see him glance up at Mata before he plays it. The only reason it seems like a shot is because of the technique he uses imo, which is more conventionally used for shooting.

1333~~~
No way man. He looks at the goal, shapes his body for the shot, gives it a good whack with his laces and mishits it. I don't see how people can think otherwise.

You can see the gap he's aiming for between the three defenders in front of him. Nobody passes like that, not even Di Maria.

1334~~~
...but so far the majority in the poll are saying 'Pass'. Madness, I say!

1335~~~
Herrera's laugh and Mata's tweet basically confirmed it was a shot. I just voted pass for the lolzy's.

1336~~~
It was a shot.

1337~~~
Mata took the piss out of the assist on Twitter, the two and Herrera could be seen laughing about it after the goal, his body is shaped to shoot, it definitely wasn't a pass. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1338~~~
I think it's pretty clear that it was an intentional pass <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1339~~~
At the time i wondered if he ment it or not, but looking at that vine, a QPR defender was right in front of him, so why would he shoot? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

His assist for Lamela last week against Germany and the chance he set up for RVP it wouldn't surprise me if he ment it.

1340~~~
I hope he starts regularly passing like that, just to prove me right!

Apologies spamming the thread with vines, but this one shows it with an extra half second of build up. I'm convinced his little glance up before hitting it is a little look at Mata!
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OapVrquI6uM/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1341~~~
Can we also take a second to appreciate Mata's touch and finish. He made it look incredibly simple but it was straight out the top draw.

1342~~~
We need player cam, with a high def super slow-mo shot of his face as he's about to <span style="text-decoration: underline">shoot</span>. That'll settle it <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1343~~~
Yep, we actually haven't spoken enough about the first touch, it's absolutely incredible.

1344~~~
Yeah Mata signals, Di Maria looks up and picks him out, looks more clear-cut from that last vine.

1345~~~
Unfortunately I've been through every reply of it on the internet (or so it feels) and there isn't one <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

We'll have to resign to the outcome of the poll settling it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1346~~~
It's such a shot, some of you are mad. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1347~~~
And then we can start debating about the one Mata fluffed inside the 6 yards area, was <i>that</i> a shot or a pass to Rooney?

1348~~~
The poll doesn't lie!!
That would be a much shorter debate

1349~~~
You would think.

1350~~~
It was a shot! It's clear as day. Their reactions after confirmed it.

1351~~~
It really looks like a mishit cross to me. Include that option and redo the poll. Mata's reaction on twitter suggest he thinks it was a shot though (although it could still mean a botched cross). I assumed he meant to drill a curled cross in front of the defenders but he mishit it a bit and it actually fell to mata behind them.

1352~~~
Didn't Mata joke about it being a 'nice assist' after the game?

1353~~~
Had Mata not made that smiley in his tweet where he thanks Di Maria for the assist, I would say that it was an intended pass. Let's just pretend that it was.

1354~~~
Do people seriously think it was a pass? I suppose it's understandable really as he's an assist king, but I personally feel it was a shot.

1355~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> People are dreaming, so they just pretend it was a pass. Clearly a shot though, havent seen anyone passing the ball like that, even Di Maria isnt that good. He clearly wants to smash it in the net. When Mata and Herrera, 2 players who know the difference between shooting and passing and close to him and on the pitch laugh about it, you know it wasnt meant. I dont know why people say he looked at Mata, he just looked in front of him to see who is there, but decided to try his luck. Just like Ramires the other day with his shot and Costa anticipated it.

1356~~~
You think you can build up quick against a team defending in their own half? you are a hard one to please.


Rooney was the only player I thought was slowing us down, he played safe backwards passes every time the ball got to him.

1357~~~
Isn't it a usual thing at the highest level to pretend to do something else (like to shoot) while in reality you are looking for a pass to confuse defenders? I remember Ronaldinho, Deco and Henry doing that - why can't Di Maria?

1358~~~
I'm just trying to be realistic. It wasn't like we'd gone all guns blazing at them and yet people think we were.

We genuinely struggled to carve out openings, despite all the new talent out on display until after the pressure was lifted by Di Maria's free kick. Had we not gotten that, it probably would've been 0-0 at half time and then what would've happened?

1359~~~
Had RVP gotten a shout from Ander and left it for him to put it away when the game was 0-0 what would have happened?

1360~~~
Agreed with this. For all the positivity about the 'amazing' football, we had a lot of the ball but struggled to create proper chances until Di Maria's free kick. It was the sort of the fast start we occasionally saw under Moyes, before Rooney would score a free kick.

It's still something we really need to work on, because even when the other team's defence is deep, you still see City getting to the byline and creating really good chances inside the box early on.

The days when we consistently create good clear cut chances early on, and score from one of them to take the lead - that's when I'll be really really impressed.

Di Maria's goal came at a great time, because we were struggling to actually open them up.
Coasting in the second half was nothing special - we did that under Moyes at home a few times against relegation teams.
We're fine when we go in 3-0 up, it's creating proper chances early on that we struggle with.

And it still needs to be improved quite a bit.

1361~~~
It was a shot, you lunatics.

1362~~~
We created two good chances before the freekick (Mata's shot and Rojo's cross which RVP should have left for Herrera). I think we looked much more lively than the Moyes days. Most of the time very little happens in the first 20 minutes anyway because teams are still trying to figure each other out.

We'll see what happens on Sunday.

EDIT: Might have been three chances, I remember RVP missing a free header too, not sure though if it was before our first goal.

1363~~~
Are people taking the piss with that vote? It was so obviously a mishit shot. You can clearly see that he had the biggest possible swing trying to get a lot of power into the ball and that he didn't look for Mata at all. Plus, they way he and Mata were laughing after the goal was telling. He didn't mean that at all.

1364~~~

1365~~~
OMG, why would Di Maria shoot from that distance and from that angle? It doesn't make sense, it would be a complete waste of an opportunity and he knows it. He saw Mata and knew he needed a powerfully driven pass so the ball could reach him. It's a pass.

1366~~~
Indeed. It would have been an idiotic shot, 2 defenders in front of him to block it as well had he gotten it on target.

1367~~~
Yep.

I thought the reason he and Mata were laughing was because it was something that they practice in training and it's  actually worked in a match.

1368~~~
And he never scores from those positions. It's not his style. The poor guy is probably dumb to people thinking he tried to shoot because he doesn't understand English yet, so he just grins.

1369~~~
How can anyone think he didn't shoot there?

1370~~~
Because look at his body shape. The angle with which he twists his body suggests he's not aiming the ball at the goal.

1371~~~
Whether it was intended as a shot or a driven pass, the ball blatantly didn't end up going the direction he intended it to go.

1372~~~
How can anybody think he did shoot there?

1373~~~
He looks straight at Mata, bro. Half a second before he drives the pass in. He's that good.

1374~~~
He was looking at the goal. There was a gap between the defenders for a shot to the keeper's right.

Definite shot <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1375~~~
Looking at the goal is just a diversionary tactic, he knew where Mata was and played the pass blind he's that good
Definite pass

1376~~~
So clearly a miss-hit shot. The way he swings you would have expected the ball to move a lot faster. The reason it didn't..... a miss-hit

1377~~~
I don't actually understand how this can even be up for debate, the way him and Mata were laughing about it afterwards makes it more than obvious that it wasn't meant to be a pass.

1378~~~
Can't believe how close that poll is. 100% a mis-hit shot for me. The technique used to strike the ball and the reactions after tell the story.

1379~~~
Agreed, anyone who saw that exchange afterwards can't believe it was a pass.

1380~~~
When is the poll closing? We shall let it decide the outcome. 

Probably fans from other clubs are laughing at us right now.

1381~~~
It may well have been a shot but the technique is also very much one that could be intended as a driven cross. It was mishit either way so the reaction after isn't conclusive either. One things for sure though a shot from there for a left footer made no sense whatsoever. I also thought he looked at Mata and not the goal, is there any camera angle that shows?

1382~~~
tbh I was more happy with what I saw than if we'd had a kerazy goal fest from the off. We didn't just blitz the opposition and watch them fall apart. Up to the first goal we managed the match in quite a mature way.

One of the problems of the last 12 months is that our confidence is so low, that if we don't score in the first 10 minutes our game just falls apart and we start giving away possession cheaply, making stupid mistakes or resorting to overly ambitious long balls. On Sunday we continued to control possession after the initial buzz died down, and instead just kept probing. It was the kind of play that would have created a breakthrough at some point during the match. The timing of the goal was perfect of course, but it wasn't like it came against the run of play.

I'd much prefer winning our next few games by a small margin, but see us really manage the game properly, rather than seeing games like the topsy-turvy first half of 2012-2013. Controlling possession, probing for chances, knowing when to up the tempo or cool the game off. We've lost that aspect of our game, and we saw a little bit come back on Sunday. Not to an expert level, but better than what we've seen before.

1383~~~
Did you see Mata and Di Maria joking with other when they were walking back to their own half? I can't believe anyone who saw that clip could believe it was done on purpose.

1384~~~
It wasn't done on purpose. It was clearly mishit. But I think it was meant to be a cross across the 6 yard box that ended up being scuffed and going behind the defenders to Mata. Either way it hardly matters that much I suppose. Lets be thankful that this is the most heated debate this week and not moaning over another terrible performance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1385~~~
Sure, it's just a bit funny that it's so difficult for United fans to admit, given that it doesn't matter the least bit anyway. If you asked the question on any non-United fan board, you'd get 95 % saying it was a shot.

1386~~~
Motd said it was a mishit cross in fairness.

Still don't see it. You don't swing your leg with that force for a cross. Anyway, point is the same: he scuffed it and got lucky. It doesn't matter one bit but it's just a bit silly to make it out as if it was a genius pass.

1389~~~
Absolutely. There's no way in hell he meant it to turn out how it did. I guess when it's going for you it's going for you.

1390~~~
Frankly when I first saw it, it actually seemed he purposely hit that on the ground in Mata's direction because Rio would have gobbled up an aerial duel between Mata and himself, and I was mightily impressed at his control of such a pass. But the reactions actually make me feel that it could be a mishit shot.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I have still voted for pass </span>

1391~~~
It was a cross that ended up in the back of the net.How could anyone think it wasn't.

1392~~~
It was obviously a shot... I'm amazed this is even a discussion!

1393~~~
This is the closest poll we've ever had <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://f.cl.ly/items/1A1Z1m3e1z1t3t373N0E/di-maria-poll.png" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1A1Z1m3e1z1t3t373N0E/di-maria-poll.png"/> 

Amazing how so many people can be so wrong <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1394~~~
Of course it was a shot.

1395~~~
I'm beginning to think anyone saying it was a pass are simply on a WUM.

1396~~~
and without CL football...

1397~~~
About top 5 in the world.
Behind Ronaldo and Messi, at about same level as Robben, Suarez, Zlatan, Bale and Neymar etc.

1398~~~
People really think that was a shot? Wow, just wow! I can understand some thinking it was a mishit pass. because he maybe wanted to cross it instead of passing it like that, but not in a million years that was a misshit shot.

1399~~~
He has an eye on Mata and an eye on goal. He is that good.

1400~~~
I've just made it 50/50 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1401~~~
It's still not quite sunk in. We got Di Maria, and he's absolute class.

1402~~~
You should just let me do it, we vote at the same time

1403~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anyway, even considering the hefty pricetag, i am starting to think he might be our best buy, even as much as the other newcommers have impressed.

He the kind of player that has that x-factor about him. Someone who can create something out of nothing, someone who can tip the scales in your favour on a bad day and someone who can make the difference when you face the very best teams.  

Even though the likes of Rooney and RvP can do that from time to time, imo, we have lacked THAT kind of player since Ronnie left, and now we have a new one.

1404~~~
Can't believe half our own supporters think he's that bad a shot and that lucky too.

Was pass.

1405~~~
I'm not sure myself, but I wouldn't be surprised at all of he meant it. Just look at that ball he put on a plate for RVP's volley miss. An inch perfect ball you'd hardly even pull off playing Fifa. The guy is a genius.

1406~~~
He wanted to deflect the ball off mata's legs into the goal actually..

1407~~~
I was watching him in the Champions League final in awe and thinking how we should have bid for him last year and how there was absolutely no way we will get to see him play for us. Now that he plays for us, has even scored for us and it still hasn't quite sunk in. What a player! And he plays for us!

1408~~~
I've got the same feeling about Van Persie and Falcao. Watched both enviously at their former clubs and never imagined in my wildest dreams that they would end up here.

1409~~~
If it was a miss-hit cross I could believe that, but the ball rolled beautify with barely a hop, that would be some luck too.

1410~~~
Mata too for me. Always thought he oozed class at Chelsea. 

Jaysus, what a team we have now. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1411~~~
It's unbelievable actually. And people think it's not capable of a league challenge, it most definitely is.

1412~~~
I still think we're not going to challenge, not really.

1) There's a pretty big gap between our quality in attack and in central defence. You have to win tight games 1-0 to win the league and this isn't a team I'd trust holding on to a one goal lead for a long period. I suspect score draws will happen more often than we'd like this year and will always keep us at arms length of the title challengers.

2) Chelsea and City have <i>really</i> complete teams right now. Last season every team near the top had major flaws somewhere on the pitch, but City and Chelsea have addressed their problems this summer. If Costa stays fit and in form & Remy plays a decent support role; if Mangala turns out to be worth the money and Fernando gives Toure the platform to attack even more, then those two teams are going to be really consistent this season.

However what I would say is that there's no reason we can't think about overtaking all of Spurs, Arsenal, Liverpool and the others. None of those guys look like they've improved on last season while we most certainly have.

1413~~~
When Mata was at Chelsea, whenever the question of 'which player do you want to see play for your club' came up, my answer would always be Mata. Supremely talented footballer and a classy guy off the pitch as well. I'm still getting used to seeing him in a United kit.

1414~~~

1415~~~
I have no doubts it was a shot, can't really see how anyone can think it was a pass. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

The way he ran upto the ball, the position of his body, the power he put into hitting the ball all indicate a shot that he totally scuffed.

1416~~~
Neutrals are actually going to watch us this season because of this guy and the other star players we've got. The coach as well. We got a proper great team in the making. It's exciting times ahead.

1417~~~
A lot of people (me included) said the exact same thing back then, too. It's easy to forget that he was the best player in the PL for two years purely cause of last season. A great player, and I'm certain that with this new look team he'll hit those heights again.

1418~~~
Listening to the podcast....and this its a great idea to create a chant for Di Maria especially to the Maria - blondie track...


Di Maria, 
You gotta see him,
Goin' inside and outta your way
Di Maria, 
You gotta see him,
He'll go and blow you away...


Im really bad at this sort of stuff...someone else come up with something decent haha.

1419~~~
That's the only thing that makes a little sense to me. From that angle and distance, if that is a pass then really he's a phenomenon.

1420~~~
Through it all, he offers me perfection
A lot of goals & deflections, when he's on the ball
James wont replace thee, Im loving Angel instead

[/RAWK]

1421~~~
Rawking it doesn't excuse it.

1422~~~
I know. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1423~~~
I'd rate him ahead of Bale and Neymar. Between him and Suarez as to who is the first behind Messi/Ronaldo.

1424~~~
That's a really confusing way of putting it, but I think I get what you mean.

1425~~~
Yeah, I've worded that post terribly <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Basically...

Messi/Ronaldo
....
...
Suarez/Di Maria
...
...
The rest (Bale/Neymar/Robben etc etc)

1426~~~
Shot wouldn't please me! Blatant pass. As a fan base we've recently just not been used to such an inspired and inch perfect defence cutting ball <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1427~~~
I thought it was a phenomenal pass at first, but after watching the replays it is obvious he is shooting. He is 100% shooting there. Look at the way he lines up to strike the ball and look at the way him and Herrera interact during the celebrations. He got lucky.

I think people still saying pass just want it to be true, but they're wrong.

1428~~~
Holy shit, this is a genuine discussion?! Feck sake, get off the meds, it was a shot he fluffed and coincidently landed at Mata.

1429~~~
Is nobody capable of imagining that he might have feigned a shot and then intentionally passed it in order to trick the defense? I mean, it's not unthinkable, is it? Looking at it rationally:

In favor of it being a pass:
- Absurd area/angle to shoot from
- Looks at Mata first
- Perfectly delivered to Mata who scores
- He had been making great passes all day, not desperately trying to score
- Would have been an unrealistically awful shot if it were a shot

In favor of it being a shot:
- His posture sort of makes it look like a shot
....and nothing else.

What exactly is it that makes it such a no-brainer that it's a shot?

1430~~~
It looked like a routine Valencia-like cross to me, just smash it hard and low in the zone between the defense and keeper.

1431~~~
If you watch the goal again, he looked at Mata twice before releasing the ball. I think he was caught in two minds on whether to pass or shoot, and the end result was somehow a perfectly weighted pass. Herrera's reaction was incredulous to say the least. He was probably going like, "I know you didn't mean it that way that you cheeky fecker."

1432~~~
That sums up my feelings as well. 

Just happens to be perfectly weighted, flat along the ground with a beautiful little curl that lands right at Mata's feet?

At most I can imagine he means to get it in the air, the path of the ball doesn't look like a shot.

1433~~~
My thoughts exactly. I didn't even realise it was up for discussion until I saw the poll.

1434~~~
There is no way that was a shot.

1435~~~
I don't see why it matters, it went to Mata and he scored, shouldn't that be the end of it?

1436~~~
It seemed to me like Mata and Herrera were laughing at his "assist" though. And it most definitely didn't look like a pass <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1437~~~
It wasn't a mishit shot, it was a mishit pass. I think he was aiming to bend it round the defender in the air.

1438~~~
Not if we're discussing whether it was a shot or a pass.

1439~~~
I kind of think it was a mishit goalkick that he was aiming to hit to Ashley Young and he forgot that Ashley Young was not in fact on the pitch and he in fact was not a keeper.

1440~~~
huh? so you think the way he hit the ball that he wanted to cross it to Di Maria? No chance, he wanted to smash it in the net, but it went to Mata. He would cross it like you normally cross a ball and not pull through like he did.

1441~~~
Is this thread still getting bumps over was it a pass or shot! hehe

I was on the bus home tonight still loving the fact he is a United player...the summer has been unbelievable.

I was thinking he need to be on the ball as much as possible so the central midfield is the most advantageous position for Di Maria. That was kinda lost of me when he signed, i thought he would be an amazing attacking player who could also put a shift in! 

But he is so blooming marvelous he can play in midfield and fix nearly every problem with the squad. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

As for was it a pass or shot? who cares <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1442~~~
Someone should ask his wife on Social media!

1443~~~
If it's a pass - is di Maria really that good at passing?

If it's a shot - is di Maria really that shit at shooting?

To me, the first one seems more likely.

1444~~~
I just snapchatted her a cock shot with 8 or 9 paragraphs of reasons why he should join United written down my shaft with a Sharpie.

1445~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1446~~~
I immediately thought it was a pass when I saw it, which amazed me how accurate it was.  I don't believe it was a shot b/c if it was, he would've had to shank it very badly to miss the goal sideways.  I've never seen Nani or Young miss a shot that badly but I'm expected to believe world class Di Maria did?

1447~~~
if there is one thing di maria isnt world class at, it is shooting. I have never seen Young or Nani trying to shoot from there, plus they normally go for the safe option and use a different shooting technique. I am pretty sure Nani had similar shots, where you would say he should at least hit the target. It happens to world class players too, believe it or not.

At the request of <a class="username" data-user="92391, @George1976" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/92391/">@George1976</a> (its creator) in the newbies the bones of a new song.

<i>I haven't heard one for Di Maria yet...but think I'm on to something here. Rubbish original song by all accounts, so think it should be re-jigged especially as it's called 'No Limits' I think by techno pop band 2 Unlimited it's not 'No, No' etc as it's says in original it's..'Di Di, Di Di, Di Di...DI MARIA' !!
Repeat again, but changing 2nd verse DI MARIA for 'THERE'S NO LIMITS'..!?</i>

Heartless brutes. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We need some songs that are easy to sing on repeat, songs everyone can sing. We've never really made up for the loss of the Ronaldo songs.

As for derivative, well sure, most football chants are. It's dog eat dog in this game.

1452~~~
I agree with that, just the idea of us singing 'di di di di di di' would make us sound like a bunch of window cleaners. I think the Falcao one (that we've pinched from Madrid) will replace the Viva Ronaldo one once everyone gets a hang of the tune.

1453~~~
Lol going through the Liverpool forums <i>"Di Maria to United"</i> thread, just so many beauties.


"He won't make a difference to their midfield"


"He is being bought to boost shirt sales"


"He is no better than Coutinho or Sterling at their best form last season"


"Will be another Veron"


"Seems like another Arsenal/Ozil transfer, to me. Struggled to get their real targets, then spent big money on an available player they don't really need to appease the fans."



"United have won several league titles with "pansy" central midfielders. Di Maria was actually ultra impressive last season playing as a #8 in a 4-3-3. It's definitely something I would experiment with if I was LVG.

Di Maria - Blind - Herrera
Mata - RVP - Rooney

That might work."

Someone replying to previous quote: "That midfield will get run over. I pity the defenders that have to play behind them."


<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Then you can spot the exact moment he played a game for us</b></span> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


"I didn't want this thread to slip away quietly, unnoticed so I've brought it up again

A thread to ridicule United for buying a top quality, world class talent"


"Herrera is quality and I always hoped he would sign for us.
Blind is an upgrade on Fellaini,Cleverely etc. But noting to be worried about.
Di Maria is a world class player. Why did Real madrid get rid? Seriously they are nuts"


"Hate to say it but Di Maria looked a special talent yesterday, if he produces that week in week out added with our tendancy to throw in the odd shocker, United could actually be a threat to our top 4 hopes. That's the annoying thing about the Villa result, we needed to try maintain that cushion over them."


"Wish we had a world class player like Di Maria...i wouldn't give a toss if he can defend."


"Jesus this being the most active thread bothers me,its like a man united fan came in here to brag"


<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1454~~~
Yeah we need a proper fecking song for him, chanting "Argentina" can't be the best we have surely?

1455~~~
Theres no way it was a shot. Anyone who has ever played football in their life knows it was meant to be a cross. Doesn't make him any less a player because he is fantastic.

1456~~~
Can we stop debating whether it was a shot or a cross?

1457~~~
A very old friend came by today
and he was telling everyone around
About the greatest player in town
Di Maria's the name of Uniteds fame (?)

The fact it's already been done for the Toure's ruins it for me.

1461~~~
Pretty good actually. But, just doesn't feel like it would work at a game. The tune isn't Football chanty enough.

1462~~~
Please tell me that Coutinho better than Di Maria quote is a wum <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1463~~~
Oh shit, course. Knew it was in my head for some reason.

1464~~~
He says he came because of Van Gaal:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/18/angel-di-maria-louis-van-gaal-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/18/angel-di-maria-louis-van-gaal-manchester-united</a>

1465~~~
Yeah, but we'd still have been able to sign him and Falcao with Moyes in charge <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1466~~~
Do some people actually believe that?

1467~~~
I'm sure some of his supporters on the caf still do

1468~~~
Crazy. Because Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao would have been so inspired to play for David fecking Moyes. 

Sure.

1469~~~
I guess that depends how much they like low fat chips...

1470~~~
I'm not saying that they would. But both were kind of on the move, and as always money talks.
Certainly Falcao was always moving somewhere due to his circumstances, and there weren't many other takers at the end of the window by the looks of it.

Assuming that for Moyes to be here we'd have needed Champions League football, then the situation wouldn't have been too dissimilar to the one that brought Mata here - a top player who doesn't have tons of options at their price. Convenient for the agents, the club and for everyone else.

I don't even think Di Maria would have chosen us above PSG if they stumped up the same cash, so him saying he chose us because of van Gaal is probably a bit untrue. Who else was there to choose exactly?

1471~~~
I'd sort of like to see the team we would be lining up with now had Moyes stayed, we certainly wouldn't have Di Maria or Falcao but I wonder who else would've come.

1472~~~
I could see something like;
Januzaj - Carvalho - CM? - Mata
Rooney - Cavani

Those are the only two I think we could've really gotten that he/we were really interested in at the time.

1473~~~
Lucky escape then, compared with:

........Blind
Hererra  Di Maria
........Mata
RvP/Falcao Rooney

1474~~~
So far it's looking like van Gaal will use him as a left midfielder who can offer width rather than as a winger. Makes sense as it takes the best advantage of his abilities. He and Herrera have great engines so putting them in box to box roles works.

1475~~~
Will be interesting to see whether or not he can step up his defensive game. He runs a lot but has incredibly poor statistics at actually being the one to win the ball back - which puts an incredible pressure on Herrera, Blind and the defenders to do it instead. 

Last year for Real he had the same statistics(Interceptions and Tackles) as Mata and Nani usually have, who are heavily criticized for their defensive work.

Would be the icing on the cake if he actually improved this, considering we already have Mata and our forwards who don't do too much in the defense.

1476~~~
Did you actually watch him for Madrid last season? His defensive work was fantastic hence one of the reasons he was in the team.

1477~~~
His work-rate is undoubted, like I said he runs a lot and he does it well. But he rarely actually wins the ball back himself, so the pressure is on others to use ADM's hounding/press to win the ball back.

Last year like I said his interception/tackles statistics were the same as Nani/Mata which isn't impressive for a central midfielder. It isn't a necessity to win the ball back yourself to be good defensively, look at Khedira who also has poor statistics in that regard but is good defensively, but it requires the players around you to win the ball back.

Fellaini who is also incredibly criticized for never imposing himself defensively had two times better interceptions/tackles last season than Di Maria. 

Like I said, it doesn't mean that Di Maria is worse defensively than Nani, Mata and Fellaini - it just means exactly what it means - that he extremely rarely wins the ball back himself for a central midfielder.

1478~~~
The likes of Welbeck didn't win a lot of balls back but he put a lot of pressure on the defenders and GK which ended up with them making a mistake and giving up possession. The defensive part of a game is not just winning the ball back. The likes of Carrick are excellent at intercepting passes but je rarely harasses opponents. That is what we have genuinely missed in our midfield. The likes of di Maria, Herrera and Blind will bring that bite and energy back into our midfield which will enable us to press team more and get more mistakes out of them. It does not matter who ultimately wins the ball back as long as di Maria is actually contributing in that part of our play.

1479~~~
That's the interesting bit. We were linked with Carvalho, Kroos and Fabregas - but not really Herrera, since last season's fiasco.

Then we ended up signing Herrera - with LvG's "permission" but by all accounts, the Shaw and Herrera deal was wrapped up before LvG "sanctioned" it etc.

So was the Herrera deal always on the cards? Or did someone like, say, Giggs advise Woodward to pay that little extra for his release clause? (Moyes was willing to pay above 20m for him iirc).

1480~~~
Some absolute beauties in there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1481~~~
Yeah, possibly. I think Moyes saw the talent but didn't want to pay the whole fee, and I couldn't have seen him pay it again this year. Shaw is another one I missed, actually.

We're rambling a bit here though, maybe we should post this elsewhere?

He plays for us. I still can't believe it.

1486~~~
It's incredible. Still surreal to me.

1487~~~
I think he (and Falcao) joining us will be benficial to the club in so many ways. I believe the clubs fanbase and reputation in South America has risen which is a massive positive given most of them seem to prefer Madrid and Barca.

1488~~~
Shows how misleading statistics can be. He's as good as it gets when it comes it comes to chasing and harrying among the top attackers.

Apparently dazzling in training too. 

On a side note, interesting to see who Rafael picked for his 5 a side team.

1490~~~
Tells more about how stats can mislead than anything else. He's superb defensively. If he harries an opponent and forces a misplaced pass that Herrera intercepts, Di Maria wont get any credit for the defensive work while Herrera gets the interception stat, its nonsense.

1491~~~
Gimme a break about his poor stats, he was in a midfield 3 that won the fecking champions league alongside Alonso and Mondric, hardly defensive titans. You don't need high tackling and interception stats, positioning is more important, if you are in good positions you force players to make harder choices which lead to more mistakes.

1492~~~
We've got a genuine world class player, at his peak. We've got a chance in any game with this guy, he is a real game changer. He was the one who stepped up for Real in the CL Final when Ronaldo and Bale were struggling.

1493~~~
He just provides that outlet that we've been missing since Ronaldo left, can run at defence and will always cause problems when we counter. Teams thrive with a player like that and the opposing teams will always be on their toes because of that, much like robben, hazard and the likes.

1494~~~
The best Di Maria song for me is to the (chorus) tune of Human League 'don't you want me'

Angel Di Maria 
Comes from Arrgggenttinna

Repeat x 20

Sing it in your head, catchy as fook.

1495~~~
Yeah, suprised at Valencia to be honest.

1496~~~
Exactly! Smalling was a bit of a surprise too. 

Valencia is, according to FIFA (not the game) the fastest player in the world. He is loved by Uniteds players and kind of loved by the fans. He has so much to offer, I just wish he would show us fans in games what he obviously shows his team-mates in training.

1497~~~
Not the first time I heard Smalling is a beast in training, Danny Welbeck said the same !

1498~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://strettynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Valencia.png" src="http://strettynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Valencia.png"/>

Look at Rooney and Robben's respective positions on that list. Fair to say, that's a load of bullshit.

1499~~~
Give me an Angel from Argentina, Angel
Just give me an Angel Di Maria, Angel

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WGS9EskRXR8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1500~~~
Assist us! Der de dada de. Angel Di Maria!
(Exodus! Der de dada de. Movement of Jah people!)

Long overdue a Marley song.

1501~~~
It depends what distance the speed is measured over. Robben has incredible acceleration and is quick over a short distance, but I wouldn't be surprised if Rooney has a bit more stamina over a longer distance.

1502~~~
Always see these stats and its misleading. They are just talking about "top speeds", nothing to do with acceleration or even how long these players can maintain their top speeds

1503~~~
Might be an old record by Rooney. He looked damn fast when he was 18. On top of that what makes Robben such a thread is that he can reach a very high speed with the ball on his feet which the graph also don't really say if that was the case. So with a bit more of context such stats don't really say much.

1504~~~
Robben was clocked at 37kmh at the world cup. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZrLCraU3wI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Always take these with a pinch of salt anyway. They seem to vary way too much.

1505~~~
That whole forum is a wum. Pathetic.

1506~~~
Thing with Rooney and his pace is that I don't trust the stats at all. It might have only been preseason but the way he got chased down by Sakho against Liverpool sticks in my mind. Those stats above aside, I don't know if he's got the top speed or acceleration to compare with the fastest guys, but I'm betting he hasn't. Di Maria though, he's got speed to burn and the technique to handle the ball at speed. The difference is night and day to me,

1507~~~
Rooney used to be fast when he was younger, I still remember how fast it was he played counter attack with Ronaldo.

1508~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Byf4NYWQ9dM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1509~~~
I don't doubt Valencia is fast but I just can't see him being the fastest footballer on the planet. I mean even Giggs/RvP (not sure who it was) looks rapid in that video. Any list that has Rooney ahead of Robben and Ribery is a load of tosh. My money is on Bale or Lennon (or that Yedlin chap).
That's not an accurate judgement on how fast a player is though, is it? Why would they mislead people like that, and what would be the point in doing so, if any? If I had to guess out of Rooney, Ribery and Robben, in who would be quickest in running from one side of the pitch to the other, I'd always back Rooney to finish last out of the three.

Any distance longer than that, then I'm afraid, it's not actually telling you how fast a player is.

1510~~~
Your impression doesn't matter, before Robben this summer, Valencia was the fattest mesured player. (the stat isn't up to date).
Rooney doesn't have a great acceleration but he is fast. The problem is that we tend to juge player full speed on their acceleration.

1511~~~
Nope, Rooney isn't (or rather wasn't) 8th fastest player on the planet, by any stretch of the imagination. I'd be interested to know where FIFA got that data from because no one reputable seems to be backing it up.

In no way or definition is Rooney as fast or faster than some of the other names he's been compared to on that list. Simple as. Before, when he was 18-19, maybe. Right now, no chance. You're actually bonkers if you think he is. Robben has always been faster than Rooney (except for when they were both young) so it's not like he's magically gotten faster either.

If Rooney's on the list, then the whole list has to be deemed as unreliable.

1512~~~
It's not a classification of the fastest players, it's a picture telling you who had the 10 highest speed recorded, it may have occured only once or it's maybe a regular thing.

1513~~~
...yet titled "The fastest players in the world".

If that is the case, then it's not really a reliable indicator in deciding who actually is the fastest player in the world. That picture was in reference to the guy who claimed Valencia was just that. He isn't because 1) that 'stat' is a load of bullshit due to the reasons stated above and 2) if by the small chance it isn't, it's way out of date.

And that's just ignoring the fact that you're telling me that Rooney happened to have clocked a top speed higher than that of Robben/Ribery in the last two/three years. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I smell bullshit.

1514~~~
It's not an indicator you want to use for the wrong purpose (and the other poster is wrong too), you can't classify the fastest player with one speed, you need a bigger sample.
For instance the TGV is the fattest train but it's not the train who circulate at the highest speed.
This stat isn't BS she's just absolutely useless, and had no real purpose.

1515~~~
I have no idea what that first sentence means.

And no, it's bullshit.  Sorry but you're absolutely deluded if you think Rooney is, or at one time was, the 8th fastest player in the world. Comparing players and trains is laughable. You're saying Robben and Ribery were going slower on purpose? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Like I've said, there's no way that Rooney has been clocked at a higher speed than Robben/Ribery. If they have, they've either made it up or used a really small sample period or something similar so either way, it's bullshit.

Use the search function to see what happened when that stat was put up on here previously. Suffice to say, its been laughed out of here.

1516~~~
If Im not mistaken thats image looks about 5 years old, as it looks like vain rooney pre hair follicle transplant

And valencia maybe was the fastest in the world in the 2010-12 seasons, but ever since then I haven't seen him beat a defender for pace in ages, last time I remember was that game a few years ago against liverpool, where he sprinted the whole pitch basically and won us a penalty

1517~~~
it was 2012-13.

1518~~~
Who cares about how many balls he wins, that's not his job, is it? His talents are attacking, anything you get outside that is a bonus.

1519~~~
Of course winning the ball back is part of the job if you're playing CM.

1520~~~
Sorry if i'm not clear this stat doesn't tell you who is the fastest, it's just a useless stat who gives you the highest speed reached by these players.
Which means that Ribery is probably fastest than Rooney but didn't have the opportunity to show it, because football isn't a sprinting contest.

1521~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/9hr4FMF.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/9hr4FMF.png"/>

Looks like a weird cross between Robben, Zidane and Scholes.

1522~~~
Chicharito was the fastest player in the world according to FIFA after the 2010 World Cup. 

It's not that United have lacked pacey or fast players in recent years more a case of lacking pace and mobility throughout the team. And to be fair, up until recently our pacey players have been pretty dire. Young, Valencia, Chicharito, Welbeck all have/had bags of pace but often did very little with it.

1523~~~
We love you, We love you, We love you...
And when you play,
You're frightening, frightening, frightening...
'Cause we love
Di Maria, Di Maria, Di Maria...
And that's the way
We like it, We like it, We like it...

Oooohhhhwwwoooooaaaaoooaaaahhhhhhh.....
Oooohhhhwwwoooooaaaaoooaaaahhhhhhh.....

Always wanted us to steal this chant <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1524~~~
Nah, it's a shite small time club song. Had one for Kagawa and it was a bit shite.

1525~~~
Ok, thanks, so it was in SAF`s last season, I really wonder when will be the next time we win the PL again, under SAF we kind of always expected to win it, the man was a trophy machine, with a will to win second to none, and it expressed itself on our team somehow as well

As soon as he left we seen how the players just collapsed last season

1526~~~
No thanks. Like that other chap said, it's a shit chant I associate with small clubs.

1527~~~
How about Ave Maria? 

Angel Mariaaaaaaaa
Angel Di Maria

Would be a great laugh to hear the stretty having a go at Opera

1528~~~
To the tune of Rhythm is a dancer

Angel Di Maria, He's a source of pleasure
You can see him everywhere
Scoring and assisting
Blink and you'll have missed him 
On the ground or in the air

Oh oh From Argentina
Oh oh He does things that just aren't fair
Oh oh What a player
Angel Di Maria
Angel Di Maria

1529~~~
To the tune of Silver lady by David Soul.

Come on Di Maria take the ball
We want you to run past him again believe us
Just get the ball
And then you will score
Di Maria.

Just made this up. I think it's decent.

1530~~~
Oh my fecking days, what a player. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1531~~~
Anyone keeping an eye on <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> and <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> for suicide watch?

1532~~~
It's magic. The kind we've been missing ever since Ronaldo left and Giggsy got old. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1533~~~
What a player <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1534~~~
We look so dangerous with him in the side. I love him. What a player.

1535~~~
What on earth were Real thinking.

1536~~~
Genuine world class. You get what you pay for, as I've been saying for seasons...

1537~~~
I need to see gif of that goals from every angle imagined <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>. Di maria quality speaks for itself. I do not believe we have had a better player at United since Ronaldo

1538~~~
Our best player since Ronaldo.

He's like the wily, experienced Giggs after he converted to CM, but with the pace and explosiveness of young Giggs.

1539~~~
I always knew he was a superb player when he was at Real Madrid, but I didn't even realise he was capable of being <i>this </i>good.

1540~~~
They just scored 13 in their last 2 games, so they are probably fine for this weekend <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

But still, what a player <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1541~~~

1542~~~
Best player since Ronaldo! Always troubling the opposition!

1543~~~
Unlike Ronaldo he's a fantastic team player and all.

1544~~~
Yeah, not really the sort of weekend to boast about ADM is it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1545~~~
Still the best player SINCE Ronaldo. Ronaldo was still the better player, even if Di Maria is the better team player. 

Anyway, great he is here and great he looks happy enough here and enjoying himself!

1546~~~
The game seems to turn on its head as soon as he gets on the ball. That run and the pass for Van Persie's chance got us going before rvp scored.

1547~~~
That finish was just too filthy. Had to wash my face after watching it.

1548~~~
So much talent.. sheesh

1549~~~
Wow, I knew this guy was a great player, but he has been amazing. Madrid are insane.

1550~~~
I thought he was about to fall when he made that genius touch.

1551~~~
That goal! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1552~~~
Fine assist by Rooney

1553~~~
Amazing talent and we have him for his peak years. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1554~~~
Easier said than done, but Liverpool should've spent the Suarez money on ADM.

1555~~~
Finally a real no7

1556~~~
Amazing how much he improved and reinvented himseelf at Madrid. He was obviously good at Benfica, but didn't fight as much, dived a lot more, and was a bit predictable, if skillful. Never thought he would become THAT good at an higher level, which I think it's a testament to his mentality.

1557~~~
<span style="font-size: 16px">Why is everyone surprised? He was on this form for Madrid last season?!

I knew when i had to remind everyone on the caf who were crying 30 million and not a penny more or ''i'd rather ha e sanchez'' how good he is that most have not seen much of him or decided two months and a soso world cup is enough to brainwash them into thinking hw isn't all that...

 If we left it up to 60 percent here of the caf this summer, we would not have signed him and saved us a nice 60 million for more slow and insipid attacks.</span>

He is exactly what we needed, we needed him as much as defenders because our attacking play was unimaginative rubbish.

1558~~~
He was never nº 7 at Real.

1559~~~
I tell you what else is outrageous Gary - Di Maria cost me a mere 9.5m on fantasy football whereas Sanchez is valued at 10.5! Outrageous bargain

1560~~~
He's something else. Pace, dribbling, technique, creativity, crossing. <b>That </b>finish.

We've sorely lacked a player of his ability. What a buy from Woodward.

1561~~~
Decent player.

1562~~~
No chance we'd have got him.

He was excellent in La Liga but I think he'll be even better with the extra space he'll get in England. Sublime player.

1563~~~
So the big question: Did he mean to lob the goalkeeper or was he trying to cross bar challenge pass it to RVP?

1564~~~
I love this man... Had no idea he was such an incredibly gifted long range passer, either.

Perfect man to hand the no 7 to.

1565~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1566~~~
Insanely good goal and just one of those players that injects energy into the attacking play.

1567~~~
Still getting used to the pace of the Premiership fitness wise. Hope its just a temporary adjustment.

1568~~~
Why was he taken off?

Why?

1569~~~
We are dependable on him already

1570~~~
When he was subbed you knew we wouldn't win it, and would probably lose.

1571~~~
He <i>is</i> our team.

1572~~~
If that really is the case, then you have no chance to finish in top 3.

1573~~~
Kind of ironic, we took piss out of scousers for being a one man team with Suarez, yet we are in the exact same position too, bring him off and we go down 4 gears. 

As soon as he came off I knew we'd be in trouble.

1574~~~
He was completely tired.

1575~~~
Got subbed again for being our best player.

1576~~~
This poor man is playing for a team he is blatantly to good for.

1577~~~
why though? its not as if we had any games midweek?

1578~~~
Annoyed he was subbed but he looked exhausted.

1579~~~
It was an intense match, he made several accelerations all game long. Very knackering style of play.

1580~~~
Sad thing about today that is goal will be buried because of the nature of defeat. Great player, still cant believe we have him.

1581~~~
Have to say he's better than I thought he was. Already the key man in the team. If he gets injured I'm just not sure how well we could play the diamond without him. Any combination of Mata, Rooney, RVP, Falcao lacks pace and that'd be a lot worse with Di Maria there.

1582~~~
Why the feck does lvg keep substituting him ?

1583~~~
For you regular watchers of La Liga, does Di Maria have an issue with fatigue or is this just simply him working his way back to full fitness?

1584~~~
Can't believe he got taken off, he looked healthy enough. He's the catalyst to our attacks and his work rate is so important.

1585~~~
This.
Was a quality finish and whenever he gets the ball, he just runs with pace at the opposition. Have severely missed having a player who does this, let alone the talent he has.

1586~~~
He's brilliant. I fear this formation won't work without him. He's already so important.

1587~~~
Best player in the league from my perspective. Dearly hope the match against Clattenburg didn't dent his confidence. Absolutely fecking stellar today, can win us the league if we sort out problems at the back. 

Still feels so surreal that he's playing for us.

1588~~~
How about when Herrera scored ?

1589~~~
Crazy when some people here claimed that we don't 'need him' and should 'save the money for midfielders'. Guy's in a class of his own in this team.

I actually started clapping when he lobbed Schmikes.

1590~~~
Why indeed

1591~~~
LVG would not be dumb to take him off if his fitness levels were optimal.That would be suicidal

1592~~~
To hit the jackpot when spending 60m does feel surreal. Value anyone.

1593~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkV67-naglg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1594~~~
He makes you wonder what we were doing with Valencia, Young and Nani for all those years. He's already looking better than all three combined!

Fantastic to watch and a great signing. Needs better cover behind him, though. Get the feeling Rojo is in that spot due to nationality, but Shaw might provide a better balance of attack and defence on the left side.

1595~~~
Can't wait until AdM can play for the full 90 minutes, because we're a considerably poorer team when Mata plays instead.

1596~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This cheered me up.

1597~~~
He's blatantly too good for us.

1598~~~
That's the spirit!

1599~~~
He's an amazing player. Best in the league. Just hope he stays fit as he links everything together in our attack and midfield. Did the same for madrid though to be fair.

1600~~~
He is. Too fecking good, it only took him two or three touches against Burnley to show he is our best player.

1601~~~
Is he the only guy on our team that actually does something with the ball? I actually laughed my ass off when Rooney tried to get past players today, t'was shocking.

1602~~~
I would suggest United no longer need to play 2 CF when Di Maria is in the side.

Before his arrival the team was creating zero chances so it was an easy decision to play all the forwards and why not when the alternative was a Fletch/Clev.

It would be interesting to now try to 3 CB's (again) and play 1 CF.

Or when Carrick is fit you could play Blind/Carrick together with Di Maria in front.

What i am trying to say is the team is still very much in the early days of LVG and the balance still needs tweaking.    

But he is blooming marvelous!

1603~~~
Without him, we'd be up shit creek. Which is quite worrying in itself.

The minute he went off we looked done.

1604~~~
He was so good I was surprised Clattenburg didn't try and take him out himself. Unfortunately LvG did it instead.

1605~~~
I was with you on that all the way.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1606~~~
He's pretty much become our teams heartbeat right now.

No Di Maria and last 3 games we almost stop being creative.

1607~~~
What does this mean?  He'll be more tightly marked in the Premier League.

1608~~~
His goal was ridiculous.

We're already at a point where if we're without him, we're f*cked.

1609~~~
It's not about marking. It's about controlling space, something most teams in England are terrible at.

1610~~~
He's brilliant, I honestly would like to see him in the Robben role with Falcao up top but I doubt there is much chance of that happening. Over time I wonder if LvG will move towards him and another wide man flanking a 9 in a front 3.

1611~~~
Yep, as soon as he was subbed there was only one outcome.

1612~~~
I'd say its near impossible to mark this man.

1613~~~
What's up with his fitness? I know he had a long World Cup but he's a suitable amount of time to recover, and we're playing one game a week. He only had one game during the international break yet he's been taken off every game.

1614~~~
I'm just going to sit here and watch his goal over and over for the next 3 hours, pretending that the 70 minutes that followed never happened.

1615~~~
He picked up an injury during the world cup that kept him out for like a month. Didn't have a proper pre season because of that.

1616~~~
If he keeps this up he'll win player of the season.

1617~~~
He's stupidly good. The difference with and without is painfully noticeable.

1618~~~
What a player! What a talent! The way he runs at players, creates space for himself and his teammates is just amazing to watch. With the ball at his feet, there is no predictable outcome. His first intention is to run at players and see if he can do something. We have missed that ever since Ronaldo left.

1619~~~
Its because not everyone here saw all the Madrid games last season. But now that he plays for us, they are getting a first hand look every week at what he can do.

1620~~~
May have been answered already but never had any fitness problems at Real Madrid (some injuries, but never fatigue). He ran more than anyone for them, so probably just working his way back to fitness.

1621~~~
He's the best player we've signed in my lifetime. Rooney, Ronaldo, Rio, Ruud, Cantona etc became top players but Di Maria has been world class from the day we signed him.

Still hard to believe he's a United player.

1622~~~
I haven't been this exited about a United player since Ronaldo left he really brings back the joy of watching us play. If he can keep up this early form of his he has to be one of the "player of the season"candidates.

1623~~~
Feel a bit sorry for him. Brilliant display once again.

1624~~~
Thanks for that. Great to hear. It's already abundantly clear that he's very important for us.

1625~~~
The look on his face when on the bench told a story. He looks so far above the other players in the team its unreal, especially as he is playing with the likes of rooney, RVP, Mata and Falcao. I genuinely feel a bit sorry for him at the moment as the team around him collapsed after the penalty

1626~~~
Really? One man team with Mata, Herrera, Rooney, Falcao?

1627~~~
The proof Is there As I said in the 3 games Di Maria has played as soon as he has been brought off we turn to jelly and lack drive and urgency.

1628~~~
I really hope he doesn't catch the shit bug, but he seems too good to.

1629~~~
I'd love to know what he's thinking right now. Prob feels that this English football lark is pretty easy for him but what about his team mates <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1630~~~
Glad he has already a CL medal because we really don't look like winning it any time soon, we first have to get into it for a start! 
How times have changed. With SAF after a crap result the mood was down because we might have lost out on the league title <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Now I couldn't be happier if I knew today we'd finish 3rd/4th. 
SAF deserves some more statues, because as bad as we were in his last few years, we were still either winning the league or finishing 2nd by a grand total of 1 point or goal difference!

1631~~~
3 games- 2 goals & 2 assists.

Just a monster right now and still yet to complete 90 mins.

1632~~~
He's one of my favorite footballers out there, but even I thought he was too expensive when we bought him. So far, the doubt over his price-tag is fading rapidly.

1633~~~
That's just simplifying it. Our problem is the defense and Di Maria doesn't have too much to do with that. "One man teams" don't score 3 to 4 goals a match.

1634~~~
I love him even more. It's painful that we lost and he won't get as much credit because of that but he was brilliant. The goal was just sublime. Hopefully he is still building fitness, otherwise he just works himself into the ground on 70 minutes all the time <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1635~~~
I'd like to see this as well. Di Maria and Januzaj flanking one of Falcao/Rooney/RVP would be very interesting to watch. I guess the question would be: who do you play behind them?

1636~~~
He is an absolute gem. Come the end of this season he will be a ballon d'or candidate and considered one of the best players in the world.

1637~~~
It's safe to give him the caf player of the season award now.

1638~~~
I only see him on his own at his level, all the other players are clearly below him (at the moment at least).

1639~~~
That's the problem, you can't play Mata as part of a midfield 3 and Rooney is no CM either, so right now we don't really have the personnel to give that formation a go, which is a shame.

1640~~~
Blind/Herrera and Di Maria as the 3 CMs wouldn't work? Mata on the bench and Rooney on the bench too.

1641~~~
Best midfielder in the league going forward by a mile (great buy) if only he had a stopper type beside him like a Fernando type at City doing more of his dirty work.

1642~~~
Has been an absolute pleasure to watch so far. Long may it continue.

1643~~~
Cuts through teams with ease. This CM/AM/Winger thing he has going on is perfect for him. The slowest part of almost every team is the center midfield.

1644~~~
If only he had made that pass to RVP (which he would probably have completed perfectly 9 times out of 10)... we'd have been 4-1 up and that would have been game over.

They're the fine margins... not that I'm blaming him in any way for anything that happened yesterday. He's a fecking delight.

1645~~~
we've finally found the perfect player to fix our midfield and attacking woes and decided to let our defense deteriorate into shit now instead.

I reckon by the time we fix defense now, our three great strikers will probably all have turned to shit and we'll be fecked there instead.

1646~~~
It's bizarre how one footed he is, yet how utterly irrelevant it is when he plays. He's ridiculously good with the outside of his left foot.

1647~~~
Modric and Quaresma are similar in that respect. Their refusal to use their left-feet has caused them to just develop the outside of their right to use in its place.

1648~~~
Quaresma definitely, though I haven't noticed it with Modric. I always thought he was decent with both feet,.

1649~~~
Maybe Valencia can learn a thing or two.

1650~~~
At 29 I think he may be beyond the learning stage! In fairness to him though, as much as he's nowhere near the level of Di Maria, he's done pretty well to make it at United and be one time player of the year, given how utterly one footed he is.

1651~~~
World class. Will soon be scape-goated by those on here. Always shining through at the moment though.

1652~~~
Modric passes with the outside of his right foot more than any other player I can think of off the top of my head.

Great assist in the CL for Bale last week doing it actually.

1653~~~
Suppose that doesn't necessarily rule out two-footedness, it's just another string to his bow.

1654~~~
It is because he can dribble inside as well as go round the outside. In addition to that he has tricks to go with his dribbling and teams are so concerned with his crossing ability, when they close his crosses.. he goes past them. If you're going to be one-footed, you need to still be unpredictable with your style of play and be intelligent.. Valencia - on the other hand feck it, I've ran out of derogatory terms for him.

1655~~~
Obviously he has had a (predictably) great start to his United career but does anyone know why he keeps getting knackered / cramp after about an hour or so?  Is he not yet fully match fit or is he just always like that?  I was led to believe that stamina is one of his strengths but at the moment it looks the opposite.

1656~~~
I remember some people calling him a headless, inconsistent winger like Nani <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Great to see that he begins his season here like he ended his last at Real, on his current form (or level it's not really a form anymore^^), there are not many players, who are better than him imo.

1657~~~
the former, and adjusting to the PL. He'll be alright in time.

1658~~~
Did the whole Real Madrid imminent departure thing mean he missed out on many pre-season games?

1659~~~
He barely played for Real at all, pre-season included. Partly due to the injury he got at the WC I think.

Fully fit he is a bullet train for 90 minutes. Didn't he cover the most ground in the CL final too?

1660~~~
When did they use that Nani comparison though? I always liked Di María but he did go through phrases of playing like a headless chicken. Definitely stepped up his consistency since moving into his new role.

1661~~~
Thanks all!  Can't wait till he's actually match fit!!  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1662~~~
Well the idea we were talking about was Di Maria and Januzaj playing either side of a #9, so we'd need someone in Di Maria's midfield role.

1663~~~
Probably still not match fit enough. His stamina is insane. Dani Alves will tell you that.

1664~~~
Some people mentioned that he reminds them of Nani and that he is also as frustrating, which I really couldn't understand at all. Yeah he had also bad spells in his career, but that's imo a complete different level than the likes of Nani, Young or Valencia. Even in his worst season at Real (the third one) he was miles ahead of everything those 3 have produced in the last 2 years.

1665~~~
Yeah that's true. Like I said I always liked Di María but to be fair to whoever criticised him it's somewhat understandable if they said it a year or two ago. After last season...not so much. 

Not too relevant now anyway, he's improved a lot since then.

1666~~~

Pic of Di Maria's sock, I think this was after De Laet's challenge, one of which should have been his 2nd yellow. 
There's a photo of his wife and baby daughter on his shin pad. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1667~~~
Put him in my fantasy squad, so bound to turn crap now.

1668~~~
Well take him out then for goodness sake. If you don't and he does go crap, I shall hunt you down.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1669~~~
What the feck is that stuff made of so close to the pitch? Is that actually tarmac?!

1670~~~
Was injured at the world cup and played one half and another 15mins before he moved I think. So these games are his first proper ones since the world cup really. Take that into consideration and the fact that its much more physically demanding league = what we see now.

1671~~~
love his goal celebration in a utd shirt <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1672~~~
Can someone post the youtube video of his full match performance against LCFC?

1673~~~
And what is its point ?

1674~~~
Valencia is the anti Di Maria. One shows you how wing play is all about and the other, the exact opposite.

1675~~~
Makes hiS peformances all the more incredible.

1676~~~
He was fairly inconsistent on the wing, that’s why some people used the Nani comparisons. The difference between those two is obvious though, one stands still doing the step-overs, the second runs at the defence at will.

However, he is amazingly consistent in the Hybrid CM/AM role. In fact, the run for his goal, starting behind the half line, is exactly what I’ve imagined he will be doing for us, on the basis of his last season for Madrid.

1677~~~
Amazing player. SO glad we got him! Worth every penny.

1678~~~
It's mindblowing how just this time last year he was only an ordinary little diver. 

Funny how much of a difference the badge on his chest makes. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1679~~~
no shit! 

the same can be said about CR :smirks better than you:

1680~~~
Tbh Vato most that watch Madrid from time to time appreciated him even when he was still there. Last year he was simply amazing for you guys

1681~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9vJ_jlCCGE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1682~~~
I like the way the letterbox effect prevent you from seeing the ball on the left wing, or Di Maria all together.

1683~~~
I can't wait to get my hands on this guy on FIFA 15. Last year being stuck with Fellaini and Carrick in the middle, it didn't exactly give me much speed in there. Will be a pleasant change.

1684~~~
I tried FiFa 15 on a Xbox One and he was a class above his teammates in the game.

1685~~~
Seems to be the same in real life.

1686~~~
Not the type of performance I liked to see from him. Van Gaal should give him more attacking freedom.

1687~~~
Wasn't good today, but it was his first bad game in a United shirt, no big deal at all. Hope we will see him at his best next week against Everton, could be really a game for him, where we could get a lot of opportunites on the counter.

1688~~~
Abit rubbish today.

1689~~~
He wasn't great, but he did f*cking great to keep the ball up the other side of the pitch when we were nearing the end of the game. Knew what to do once we went down to ten men.

1690~~~
Could have been better but West Ham stuck 2 men on him all game, did well to get the ball out of tight spaces.

1691~~~
Wow, he was terrible today.

1692~~~
Could have done better by crossing it to Rooney than to tightly marked Falcao, and also squandering 2 good goalscoring chances. Other than those, his movement and ball carrying were a menace to opponent. Early days for a new player.

1693~~~
Got himself in great positions and managed to make the wrong choice almost every single time.

1694~~~
Song absolutely nailed him a couple of times early on in the match, I think that rattled him. Kinda like Gary Neville on Reyes all them years back

1695~~~
Final ball just a bit off today. On another day he would have had a goal and a few assists probably, you can see his class always its just like all wingers, they have off days occasionally. Did great at the end of the game at keeping the ball and relieving pressure though. He's very good as part of the midfield 3 of course but I want to see him behind the strikers at the tip of the diamond once, give him complete freedom going forward. In the bigger games, against Chelsea even, he could be devastating there. Di Maria behind the 2 strikers, in front of a midfield 3 of Blind, Herrera and Carrick.

1696~~~
He wasn't great today, but he showed real determination in holding on to the ball near the end (some silky skills as well,) and in all, put in a pretty gritty performance. Good to see that he didn't let his lack of attacking form, as it were, stop him from getting stuck in.

1697~~~
He will have off days by his standards, this was one and we got 3 points. He will be amazing mostly.

1698~~~
Fair assessment. I was happy to see him get stuck in and help the team when down to ten men, not only is he a class act, but a team player too. Looked delighted at full-time.

1699~~~
He ran his bollocks off after the red and I loved that. Prior to that it was a pretty average performance.

1700~~~
Yeah, he's a player who is always willing to give 110%. You don't see that much in those sort of world class players with all the flair and skill in the world.

1701~~~
I think there are some really overly harsh comments in here, not at his best attacking-wise today but he worked very hard in the midfield scrap, especially when down to ten, he protected the ball well and was constantly helping Blind and Shaw.

1702~~~
Players get overly analysed every time they kick a ball these days.

After today's game the only feeling i have is relief! 

MOTM performances can come later.

1703~~~
At least when he has a poor game in terms of attacking he still plays with that insane work rate. Got to love that about him. He was very good in closing out the win too.

1704~~~
This, I think people expect him to continue his forward-like form when he's primarily a midfielder. Did well to keep the ball when things were looking shaky, it's just his end product that was a little off.

1705~~~
I liked his performances, it just showed that even on a tough day (10 men and him not playing well offensively) he still has an important role defensively.

1706~~~
Di Maria is absolutely the most vital player in the team at present. Just being on the pitch seems to add so much to the team. His pace, and movement just terrifies the opposition enabling more space and freedom to other players. Even his worst to date is a massive upgrade from what we've witnessed with Young and Nani on that side over the last few seasons. I feel sorry for Evra having had to spend a few years with such inconsistent performers on his side of the pitch.

1707~~~
Can we ever imagine Nani and Young working so hard defensively?

1708~~~
Worked pretty hard but poor game today and his end product was particularly off.

1709~~~
Hey..even on an off day he produces, or tries to produce more than practically any of our other players did last season. He's not going to turn into an Ozil that is for sure.

1710~~~
He was absolutely terrible today, I don't think any pass, dribble or cross was successful for him. Having said that, he put in a great shift in defence when we needed him most and that makes his performance okay today. He didn't sulk on his poor form.

1711~~~

Bit harsh no?

1712~~~
Had an off day today by his standards. Still, lasted the full 90, worked hard and tried help Shaw out when we were down to 10 men.

1713~~~
Had one of those days where most of the things he did were 'nearly' perfect. Player movements could have turned those moments into golden chances too of course but a lot of times he looked to do either too much or put too much on the pass/shot. Still, this isn't a negative because he has that quality where if he over does something 10 times, you know 1 or 2 will still do well, unlike Januzaj atm or Valencia where you expect nothing and are grateful for a bonus surprise moment.

1714~~~
What twaddle. 42 out of 50 passes made it to their target. Dribbles and crosses were not up to their usual standard, but saying he was absolutely terrible is a hell of an overstatement.

Anyway, good to see he's human. And even on such a day he's made a decent contribution. His carrying of the ball going forward always helps us out, no less when we're doing nothing but clearing the ball and waiting for the next attacking wave. Even with one man less it's disturbing to see United play like that at home.

1715~~~
I didn't catch the first half but I've read we played very very well, and apparently we managed that even with Di Maria having a very poor day? I'd be relieved to know that we can still play without everything being good work by him

1716~~~
Even though it was probably his poorest outing for us so far, I think terrible is a bit harsh on him.

1717~~~
Had a bit of a shocker today, but in a werid way I'm quite pleased, for two reasons..

a) We still looked good going forward, and scored twice, despite Di Maria having an off day
b) He still put in a massive shift defensively, even though things weren't going his way down the other end

1718~~~
A quiet day, not a shocking day like some have suggested but just one of those that happens. Worked hard. That's football, can't tear it up every game, we have to be patient with him.

1719~~~
Yeah, bit of a shocker, but we still looked more than capable of putting at least 3 behind West Ham. I don't even care that our defense have the composure of a scared kitten right now, what we got going in attack is some of the most delicious stuff I've seen from United in years. Those first 30 minutes we were Dortmund esque. Quick, fluid attacks, regaining ball possession in dangerous areas. 5-1 at half time would not have been an unfair result.

1720~~~
To be fair on the lad, he was fouled pretty much every time he thought of touching the football.

1721~~~
I think if you put him in behind the two strikers, especially in high profile cramped games, his greatest quality is negated. Where he plays now is optimal, where his best qualities are empasized. He is devastating in this role.

1722~~~
Actually thought he'd gone off in the second half, that's how invisible he became. Still, did the basics right, just a bit off today. We'll need him at his best over the next month though, that's for sure.

1723~~~
Bit of a meh performance. But he's been brilliant before that and he still worked hard.

1724~~~
I think this has been his worst performance so far. But the lad is class still.

1725~~~
Can't expect him to set the world on fire every game... and whilst he didn't have a great game (though not that he was crap or anything) it was funny to see the West Ham players shit themselves everytime he got the ball...

1726~~~
Everyone is allowed a bad game now and then, particularly if they have been world class in every other game. That's why we have multiple top players.

1727~~~
Was still good, with him you just know when he has the ball he will attract 2-3 opposing players just like Ronaldo did. This way the others get more space. 

He was also still winning corners and working hard for the team.

1728~~~
Getting a win in a game where DiMaria is off the boil and Rooney sent off is good news.

1729~~~
Eh? I remember him being subbed.

1730~~~
In the 91st minute, I think.

1731~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13T6j-9xHRg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The bit at 4:09 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Taking the piss out of the defender

1733~~~
I thought west ham were poor yesterday mainly because they wanted to nullify his threat..by doing that it loosen up some of the attacking players... Looking at it from that angle I think he had a good game..

1734~~~
I was unable to watch the match and judging by this clip, although most of his passes, shots and crosses where misplaced, he has made a lot of good runs and won the ball a number of times. Very good work rate. All in all, judging by the video, he seems to have had a good game - opening spaces, making runs, terrifying defenders. We have lacked that since Ronaldo left.

1735~~~
Defenders are shitting it when this guy starts running at them.

1736~~~
And that's brilliant. Once they pile all their pressure on hindering di Maria, it frees up the right hand side with Ander and Rafael to attack, both of whom are very good at slick one touch football, instigating quick attacks on that side. Conversely, it gives Falcao and van Persie, or even Rooney/Mata breathing space through the middle, and players of this ilk will almost always capitalise. How brilliant it is to have such options, eh?

1737~~~

1738~~~
Definitely well deserved!

1739~~~
Deserved, by far our best player

1740~~~
I reckon he'll be getting a few of those.

1741~~~
How long before he gets injured.

1742~~~
I imagine he must've been the runaway winner, he's had a great start to his career here.

Definitely before the Chelsea game.

1743~~~
Great start and definitely deserved. I think Herrera wasn't majorly behind in second place, though.

1744~~~
It was very close between him and Herrera but Di Maria deserves it for me, what a class player he's proving to be at United.

1745~~~
I think its very close between him and Herrera, i thought he and Herrera both were equally good vs QPR, and it was difficult to pick one, while Herrera was MOTM for me Against Westham, while he was my MOTM against Leicester, but i can see why people would choose him as a player of the month, fantastic player really glad we have him.

1746~~~
Di Maria 68 percent, Herrera with 23 percent? joke, just because he he has the bigger name.

1747~~~
Di Maria will get a lot of these awards here, on rare occasions he doesn't get them, Herrera will!

1748~~~
The percentages aren't really representative. No one thinks Di Maria was 3x as good, obviously, but most people would think he was better (because he was) hence getting a large share.

1749~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Please don't get injured...........................ever!

1750~~~
Easily the best player we've had since Ronaldo.

1751~~~
Van Persie 2012/13 was better.

I'm basing this over a whole season btw, not just 3 games, but I have no doubt that if Di Maria carries on performing like this, then your statement will be proven correct.

Also Falcao is also in the mix for our best player since Ronaldo too.

1752~~~
I'm going by the last calendar year. I think over this time Di Maria has been the fourth best in the world behind the 2 usual and Suarez.

I don't think RVP has ever been that close to the elite but that's just my opinion.

Even when we played real a couple seasons back I thought Di Maria was more dangerous than Ronaldo and was relieved when he went off injured. He is insanely good running at defenders. The fastest I've seen since 2007 Ronaldo.

1753~~~
Rooney at his best was probably up there.

1754~~~
Yeah over this past year Di Maria has been in the top 5 in the world IMO. You can make a case for Robben, Suarez and Di Maria to all be above each other for 3rd, 4th or 5th. RvP was brilliant 2-3 years ago, maybe best striker in the world, but he still had Ronaldo, Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, Ibra, Falcao and others to compete with when they were at their best.

1755~~~
I don't know about that.

They both have 7 letters.

1756~~~
di Maria has shown, once again, that, even in bad days, he can still have a good influence on the team. The only other player in our team who's like this is Rooney. Even if his final ball, deliveries, and shots weren't that great, his movement, dribbling, and tenacity in midfield was a good contribution to our good first half and dogged second half.

It's great to have a player like him who, even on his bad days, can be useful.

1757~~~
Like Herrera has shown the Premiership is a tough league to adapt to quickly without picking up injuries along the way. So I hope United continue to limit Di Maria's football whenever possible.

1 game a week might not sound like much for a top athlete but with the likes of Januzaj/Mata and even Fletch/Valencia on the bench, i think it would be wise to replace him for the final 10 minutes or so IF the game allows it.

1758~~~
Why the long face, Mar?

1759~~~
It is impossible to predict how he'll play in my eyes. I didn't think he was this good over the course of last season at Real(even if he had his moments of this level) and knowing whether that was because he is now the star and heart of the team or because he's just in a really good patch of form is impossible.

We'll have to reserve judgment until later.

1760~~~
He played a good match, just watched the game again. West ham did a job on him but he still played well. Our attacks mainly came from right side. That was due to ander having his best game till date. I think our team has still a lot of improvement to do even in terms of attack. We will have balanced attacking and defending by christmas. Still great to have him.

1761~~~
You are forgetting the space. If you are texting your vote in, Di Maria is the bigger name. Its why I always voted Djemba-Djemba as my player of the year. These big name players just have the advantage.

1762~~~
He's the only player who makes me consider buying a shirt with a name that's not mine or my son's on the back.

1763~~~
He's my new Ronaldo.

1764~~~
I love him

1765~~~
Head and shoulders ahead of our other offensive players at the moment. Especially RvP and Falcao needs to start producing the goods.

1766~~~
Most of the best players in the world have that little bit (or lot) of arrogance such as Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez, Ibrahimovic, Robben etc. Di maria just seems so humble its unreal given how good he is

1767~~~
What a player. Love this guy.

1768~~~
The real true number 7 has been resurrected. Goalscorer, playmaker and match winner.

1769~~~
If we win a title or a CL in the next few years and he keeps on progressing I can see him with a shout for the Balon D'Or. Yes I'm serious.

1770~~~
I want to have his little rat litter

1771~~~
He's probably had one average game since he has arrived, all the others have been class.

1779~~~
Yeah agreed. A couple of times he's looked to play it short to create a bit more of an angle. His crossing from open play is unreal though.

1780~~~
Apparently he has a clause in his contract where if any of the Management team personally hand him any of his kit, he can leave on a free transfer.

1781~~~
Hope he stays on for the full 90 this week same as Falcao who has being quite poor so far.

1783~~~
What a tremendous footballer.

1784~~~
Falcao needs minutes and needs goals. You just have to leave him there until he gets 1 and the flood gates will open.

1785~~~
Another one of Di Maria's pass/shot assists <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1786~~~
3 mishit shot assists for Di Maria now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1787~~~
Doesn't matter if its intentional or not. He just makes things happen

1788~~~
Money.well.spent.

1789~~~
Even his shit shots are assists.

1790~~~
I guess this is Di Maria's version of the standing-foot-hitting-the-ball pass.

1791~~~
I actually didn't like him today at all. I hate that he just keeps ignoring Shaw even though he is constantly getting into good positions.

1792~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> genius

1793~~~
How many goals/assists he's at?

1794~~~
Fantastic when a record signing performs like it was money well spent.

1795~~~
3 each in 5 games.

1796~~~
Another great performance from Angel today. The drive he gives us from midfield is brilliant. Another goal and assist, although the assist was a bit suspect. That said, if he keeps doing it, we'll start to believe he actually meant it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1797~~~
Need a gif of that flick in the first half <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1798~~~
£60m well spent. That's 3 games now that he got a goal and assist in.

1799~~~
Showed why he's the best player in the league today when he was at his best but he was also very, very wasteful.  Very greedy today but maybe LVG was telling him to have a crack when he could, his set pieces were way off too. We had 6+  corners? We should be putting at least one in.

1800~~~
I'm starting to consider they are intentional.

1801~~~
Very impressive. 3 goals and 3 assists in 4 starts. 2nd best statistical performer in the Premier League in 2014/ 2015. Along with Ander, he's one of two United <span style="text-decoration: underline">midfielders</span> in the Top 5 statistical performers. From one of the worst to one of the best in one window. So excited. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1802~~~
Best player in the league for me. I just love the fecker.

1803~~~
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a proper no.7. Outstanding work rate for starters but the skill and end product is drool worthy. Well in Angel

1804~~~
Seemed nackered in the second half, but was outstanding again.

1805~~~
We're going to run out of things to say about him soon. He's just too good. Definitely in the top 5/6 players in the world right now.

1806~~~
I think it's actually impossible for him to not assist.

1807~~~
So if this is his settling in period, I can't wait until he's in full flow.

1808~~~
Value. For. Money.

1809~~~
As I said before, if this guy is on form, we have a chance in any game. I actually have faith going up against Chelsea because of him.

1810~~~
I wonder what odds you'll get for this lad winning player of the season?

1811~~~
I'd imagine he's one of the favourites for it right now alongside Costa and Fabregas. They've looked like the standout candidates so far.

1812~~~
very true indeed. money well spent.

1813~~~
He's a delight to watch play. He's been one of my favourite players for a while now, and I was over the moon (and incredibly surprised) when we signed him this summer. Excellent.

1814~~~
His crossing is a thing of beauty. 

Also, he really has perfected the mis-hit shot assist.

1815~~~
He's quite outrageously gifted isn't he? What a player he's turned into over the last couple of years. He's a force of nature on the pitch

1816~~~
That mishit shot/cross is dangerous! I'm for him trying those 3 - 4 times a game.

1817~~~
How have we not scored from one of his crosses yet? They're a thing of beauty.

1818~~~
Rubbish, we overplayed by 30million according to some <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1819~~~
Pete and his 50% nonsense <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1820~~~
I'm starting to get that feeling again that one of our players is just too good. Di Maria is producing moments of class that justify the money we spent on him. He's ridiculously productive and talented on the ball. With him in our team we should be competing at the top end of the table. He drives a team on with his own performances. Now if he could just get more accuracy on those corners he takes.

1821~~~
The only criticism of him today was he over hit quite a few of his crosses today. But other than that he was fantastic as always.

1822~~~
He along with De Gea were the difference today pretty much.

1823~~~
If he gets an injury god knows what we'll do.

1824~~~
He's far too good at football... it's not really fair to be honest.

1825~~~

1826~~~
For someone so amazing at crosses, his corners have been terrible, like Nani-not-passing-the-first-man standard. I guess he has to be bad at one thing.

1827~~~
He's the player we would all have loved Nani to become and even more so.

1828~~~
I remember there being a point (think it was 2010/11) when the thought of Di Maria being better than Nani was outrageous. Nani was one of, if not the, best winger in the world. 

How things have changed.

1829~~~
I said that in the match thread! In fact I am convinced that there must be some sort of curse on the corner flags at OT, because it seems that not even the world class players can take a corner!!

1830~~~
The delivery is just way too overpowered from him, if he keeps up the same trajectories with less power, they'll be ace

1831~~~
I keep thinking about what that Souness muppet said a couple of weeks ago about his final ball being disappointing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1832~~~
He is a fecking menace, haven't felt that way about anyone in our side besides Rooney or RVP in some time - maybe Januzaj at times last year. Looks like he is fully capable of being The Man (unlike, say, Ozil)

1833~~~
I still can't get used to him playing for us, he's just on another level <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1834~~~
It's brilliant having someone like him in the team who just gets you on the edge of your seat every time he gets the ball. It's something Ronaldo was superb at when he was at his best. He just makes shit happen.

1835~~~
RVP takes decent corners to be fair, as does Rooney a lot of the time... no idea why RVP didn't have a bang at one at some point.

1836~~~
When you think of him and our other purchases and compare them to liverpools....you have to almost pity them.

1837~~~
Coz he'd hardly bang his missus the ways he's playing these days...

1838~~~
So....was his assist a cross, or a shot?

1839~~~
Often times it seems like the receiving player wasn't really ready for it. Talk about di Maria being a class ahead of everyone else right now.

1840~~~
How many players are at a higher level than him at this moment? I can't imagine us winning or creating much offensively with him gone.

1841~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SiqKkvkWniU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1842~~~
De Gea looks fecking huge there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1843~~~
It's that bloody ramp! They need to level the area around the pitch, particularly at the corner flag so players can ahve a more level run up.

1844~~~
I love that every time he gets the ball he's looking to go forward pretty much no matter what.

1845~~~
He has been absolutely amazing for us thus far was the difference between winning and losing again today. I thought he was great at real, but I didn't realize he was this good. Just on a class of his own.

1846~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkHRd1mzAok?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1847~~~
I'm going to be honest, sometimes when I'm having a shit day I just think 'I get to watch Di Maria play for United this weekend' and I smile. 

I just can't help it. He's beyond brilliant.

1848~~~
Not only is he fecking brilliant but also a very lucky chap. Can't have enough of those after David Moyes.

Take him of the corner duty though. He's terrible.

1849~~~
Reminds me of a young Jimi Hendrix. Creative, unpredictable, electrifying. We must find a way to let him fully express himself and stay out of his way.

I guess that makes Wayne Rooney the Noel Redding of the band, doesn't it?

1850~~~
Another brilliant product of Argentinian football.

He's easily gonna be one of the best among United's numbers 7.

1851~~~
If it was up to some experts on here, the deal wouldn't have gone through this summer.

Luckily we have smarter football men in charge who are in charge.

1852~~~
I wouldn't have any other premier league player at United in his place. Not one. He's that good and that much of a joy to watch. That flick to falcao was simply ridiculous. Also, I don't think we've seen the bets of him in terms of pressing yet.

On another note, he's the best shot assisted ever, and is shit at corners.

1853~~~
I don't remember anyone being against the signing of Di Maria.

1854~~~
Maybe you were too busy wumming in the Vidal thread?

1855~~~
Yeah that's probably it, didn't read any other threads this summer. Care to find any examples?

1856~~~
Can't remember anyone being against signing Di Maria, maybe <a class="username" data-user="2525, @Kevin" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/2525/">@Kevin</a> got mixed up with the Fellaini thread as a few people were against signing him.

1857~~~
One more mishit shot that becomes an assist, and I'm concluding he's doing it on purpose. I mean he very obviously looked at the goal and lined it up like a shot. But it again, falls on a plate for team mate.

1858~~~
I can not believe all those ''he is too expensive'' or ''i would rather we usedbthe money on..'' or even a few ''he is good but not that good'' type of posts in his thread have been forgotten. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Find me the closed Di Maria thread from the transfer forum and I will provide some links to posts at my leisure during the next week.

1859~~~
If there was one player we could have signed this summer, having everyone to choose from (even ronaldo and messi), it would probably have still been him imo. Obviously messi and ronaldo are better, but given our needs, there is nobody better for his spot. Someone who works hard, someone with pace and dribbling ability and someone who sets up chances better then anyone else for our other top strikers to finish off. Messi and ronaldo would play too advanced and the rest of our team would be lacking, di Maria just makes it all click from further back.

1860~~~
He's just so entertaining to watch, we have missed this kind of player. My one concern is we are running him ragged by not having an extra CM next to Blind, as soon as we stop this two striker malarkey the better.

1861~~~
Don't know it this has been posted but....apparently this is a thing. <iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=soundcloud.com%2Fphoenixrip%2Fdi-maria&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I said in the match thread that if he fancied it we'd win, and he did, and we did. He's that good. We're spoiled having him in our team, we really are.

1864~~~
That song is class!

The best player in the league for me.

1865~~~
Cheesiest thing of the year

1866~~~
The key is now getting one more pacey wide-man who can speed past people from the other side.

1867~~~
I get the impression that he loves being the main man, he mentioned in an interview with the United website that he really appreciates all the chants and the little things like fans clapping him when he goes over to take a corner. I don't think he felt the love in Madrid, and was in Ronaldo's shadow somewhat.

1868~~~
He's so ugly and boney and strange looking that it almost becomes beautiful. My girlfriend nearly pissed herself this afternoon when I tried to explain that around the world, millions of (grown up) men are drooling over a very special human being: a thinly-framed man called Ángel of Mary. Guess she expected some kind of George Clooney/RVP-esque type of dude to be the reason of my excitement, and she really couldn't stop laughing when I pointed to a skinny latino dude with some cheap ass tattoos who was running around. I told her I don't care how ugly he is, I will always love him.

1869~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

F*ck off with all this ugly and boney nonsense. The man is beautiful <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1870~~~
We should be thankful that he doesn't have Ronaldo looks as if he did, Madrid would never have sold him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Crazy but it's probably true

1871~~~
No, <a class="username" data-user="2525, @Kevin" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/2525/">@Kevin</a> is right, some people were saying that he was a luxury and wanted him to go to PSG as quickly as possible in order to stop all speculation.
And I've been laughed at when i said that between Di Maria and Vidal i would choose Di Maria because he is unique. Unlike Vidal who is a great player but can be replaced by someone else.

1872~~~
Yep. As I said earlier in this thread, find me that transfer forum <span style="font-size: 16px">di maria thread and i will show you the way <a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> <a class="username" data-user="64619, @RexHamilton" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64619/">@RexHamilton</a></span>

I can find it myself but I want to be a nuisance. You do your part and you are getting your examples of posters that would not have gone through with the deal had they been in charge. Mongs.

Somewhere in the middle of the transfer saga I actually degraded myself to posting youtube compilations of di Maria and asking them how the feck they could forget his great season because people were saying 40 million and not a penny more or that he is not top top class.

1873~~~
Haven't really been following this thread and it's probably been brought up a lot already, but talking about Madrid, offloading Di Maria to bring in James (who is a bit younger than ADM and perhaps he isn't 100% 1 on 1 comparable) is insane right? Not that James isn't a great footballer, but what on earth were they smoking? The Robben/Sneijder saga is only a couple of years ago, seriously.

1874~~~
Dont call him big dave for nothing, the lads insane.

1875~~~
This would definitely be a contender of most RAWKish thing on redcafe award if there ever was one.

1876~~~
It's crazy because if our other forwards were on top form he'd have at the very least 7/8 assists already. The amount of chances he creates are ridiculous. Does anyone have an 'official stat' on it?

1877~~~
That noise when it hits the net.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1878~~~
I've probably seen this atleast 15 times and it's not because of the quality of the goal. The part where commentators go "...and it's Diii Mariaaaaa" just gives you goosebumps! Like the times Martin Tyler would go all "Roooneyyyyyy!"

1879~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I can't stand Peter Drury, I'd even take Michael Owen over that bombastic shrieking.

anybody have a gif of his flick to Falcao today?

1882~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1883~~~
Blast from the "past" (only 1 year ago, but still)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cgvSSWKQNM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1884~~~
Whoscored has him at 3.2 key passes a game this season, not sure what they count as a key pass but first place is Barton with 3.3 and then Milner and Di Maria are on 3.2, Fabregas on 3.1. Probably the closest thing to a stat as you're going to get without counting them individually while rewatching the games.

1885~~~
I'll take him over Martin Tyler's monotonous commentating every day of the week, hardly gets excited about anything these days.

1886~~~
That must be more than 1 year ago if Gundogan was playing? Fantastic strike though

1887~~~
<b>Key Pass</b>

- The final pass leading to a shot at goal from a teammate


<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Glossary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Glossary</a>

1888~~~
It was about 14 months ago, to be more precise. Gundogan wasn't injured until September of the same year, I believe.

1889~~~
Not sure what I've become involved in here! 

I was just saying that for a guy that can strike the ball as well as he can, those mishits are such horrible effort. They happen very rarely and when they do seemingly always end up at the boot of a teammate. If it happens again I'll be convinced they are intentional.

1890~~~
Ah. As <a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a> states, that does sound a bit naff. Sky Sports had a bit on Yaya before their last game, 0 assists, 0 goals, 1 chance created. Maybe they'll have one on di Maria in the next couple games.

1891~~~
Yeah my bad. Some other random guy was saying something about me saying something. Oh well.

1892~~~
So what's that, 5 games, 3 goals and 3 assists?

He'll turn out being a bargain at this rate.

1893~~~
Had De Gea not play a blinder this guy would've been man of the match yet again. Pure class.

1894~~~
Do we have any caftard cheesy Di Maria chants yet? Harking back to using classics like 'you are my sunshine' here's my one, I implore you to sing it through a couple of times and not get it stuck on the mind...

Ohhhhhhhh,
There's a Great! Big! Beautiful! Di Mariaaaa,
Shining at the end of everyday,
Oh there's Great! Big! Beautiful! Di Mariaaaa,
And he's only a dream awayyyy.

[Woody had a dream from the start,
And he followed his dream with mind and heart,
And when it became a realityyyy,
It was a dream come true for you and meeee.]

Ohhh... there's... a... Great! Big! Beautiful! Di Mariaaaa
Etc, etc....

1895~~~
From midfield too which is something that can't be forgotten. It's one thing getting those kind of stats up front or as a #10, another getting them from a deeper midfield/left wing role. Phenomenal player we have on our hands.

1896~~~
Far cry from Madrid being in Manchester, with our fans doubling their support when we concede. Seems like our new arrivals really appreciate that, and want to repay that <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1897~~~
Love his crossing ability, easily the best in the team.

1898~~~
Love the dip and curl he puts on his crosses. Just wish the forwards esp Falcao would be more aggressive and attack his crosses more often but it's still early days and once they gain a better understanding of each other's games, it will be great in this regard.

1899~~~
And Shaw and Rafael could, hopefully will, learn a lot from him about crossing.

1900~~~
He did get MOM. But Di Maria said De Gea should have got it instead of him. Guy's pure class. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/manchester-united/story/2072431/angel-di-maria-man-of-the-match-award-should-have-gone-to-david-de-gea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/manchester-uni...-match-award-should-have-gone-to-david-de-gea</a>


Man of the match Angel Di Maria said his award should have gone to Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea after his side recorded back-to-back wins for the first time under Louis van Gaal with a 2-1 win over Everton.

Di Maria put United ahead midway through the first half as he fired home from Juan Mata's cross for his third goal of the season. But the Toffees had the chance to level matters at the break after Tony Hibbert was brought down by Luke Shaw on the stroke of half-time.

Leighton Baines stepped up to take the resulting penalty and aimed for the bottom left but was thwarted by De Gea, who made a big one-handed save.

Baines made up for his mistake 10 minutes into the second half as he picked out Steven Naismith with a pinpoint cross in the centre of the penalty box and the Scot headed home from close range with the equaliser.

The hosts were back in front just after the hour mark as Di Maria turned provider for fellow summer recruit Radamel Falcao, who slotted the ball past Tim Howard from six yards out to make it 2-1 with his first United goal.

De Gea did well to keep out a two late Leon Osman strikes, one from Gareth Barry and one fantastic effort from Bryan Oviedo as the hosts held on for the three points.

Di Maria told BT Sport 1: "I think David is the guy the who deserves this reward rather than myself he saved us throughout the game and particularly towards the end and the penalty as well so not only him but the rest of the side deserve this.''

He also reserved praise for fellow newcomer Falcao and hopes the win is the start of things to come at Old Trafford, adding: "Yes, it's great for him.

"He's been looking for that first goal for a while now and he's it's very, very important for him now. I think not only him but ourselves are on the right road now and the main thing is we're fighting for victories and fighting for points.

"We've got the three points for the day and hopefully we can now move further up the table.''

While De Gea was delighted with the result and praised the United defence, saying: "I think we played a very good game. I think in the first half we had the possession and we scored a goal and I think in the last 10 minutes they pressed a lot and they had many chances, but I saved their chances and I'm happy for that, for the win.

"I think the back four defenders for the team played very well and of course it was a great match a good three points.''

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.imgur.com/R2FHDPS.jpg" src="https://i.imgur.com/R2FHDPS.jpg"/> 

What a player.

1902~~~
A bit sad that to have player like him, while not playing CL. He deserves it.

1903~~~
He'll get it next year don't worry.

1904~~~
He's such a complete player which is wonderful to see. Truly brilliant signing who will make a difference this season

1905~~~
His fecked are we if he gets injured?

1906~~~
Has he scored 2 or 3 goals for us now I foget?

1907~~~
Pretty fooked but I think but I also think we would bring Adnan in to play that attacking role and offer him more protection than ADM gets.

1908~~~
3. QPR, Leicester and Everton. Also got an assist in each of those three games.

1909~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzQQqkUIIAErvSM.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzQQqkUIIAErvSM.jpg"/>

1910~~~
There are still people who insist that his assist to Mata's goal vs QPR wasn't intended pass? He got exactly the same type assist yesterday with Falcao's goal.

1911~~~
They were both quite blatantly mishit shots.

1912~~~
No. They were both intended passes. I would never think about it as mishit shots if not you guys, because this looks like 0% shot.

1913~~~
Both were shots.

1914~~~
They were shots to his teammates. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1915~~~
I cant decide whether you're being serious...

1916~~~
They were both obviously shots, he was trying shots from long range quite a lot yesterday.

1917~~~
'drilled passes'

1918~~~
Does he have a chant yet?

1919~~~
Yesterday it was "Angel Di Maria, Do Do Do" - to the tune of 'Do The Conga' ... which is a bit crap... though if it results in a massive Conga line at an away game at some point this season, then that could be quite amusing.

1920~~~
Even though Big Dave stole the show yesterday, Di Maria again proved his class with that goal. Sprinting inn and then striking it so sweetly first time is just fantastic. It's something you see from top strikers/poachers, never mind a MF player who is also incredibly creative.

Anyone have a GIF of that backheel flick to Falcao by the way? That thing was pure sex

1921~~~
He was brilliant again yesterday and is already our most important player, when he is involved in our play we look a completely different team, the only problem for me is we are asking him to work so hard he seems to run out of steam. Maybe he is still a bit short of match fitness but with the front 3 contributing so little between them you have to wonder if we would be better sacrificing one of them to give him more freedom and let him concentrate more on attacking because he has the pace and ability to really hurt teams at the end when the game opens up

1922~~~
Think 'Great! Big! Beautiful! Di Maria' is a winner personally:

1923~~~
bit of an issue with overworking di maria in the diamond, particularly with falcao, rvp and mata not being the most defensively effective forwards. ADM is also away now to the far east to play 2 matches for argentina and then it's wba at hawthorns. He'll be knackered.

1924~~~
he is playing for manchester united, that's about enough, don't you think?

1925~~~

1926~~~
He's used to playing 2 games a week, I wouldn't be worried about any player being over worked and needing a rest this season because of us having no extra games from champions league or capital one cup.

1927~~~
I would like to see Ozil's stats too.

1928~~~
Two different discussions going on in that post(which you quoted). On one side you are right, there is no excuse for LVG if Di Maria ends up "overtrained" considering we have a lot less matches to play.

Then there is the one of Di Maria's role in the team being too straining - meaning he will tire and lose effectiveness over the course of a game. Which I think is true and one of our major issues right now. Di Maria and Herrera seems to have the most straining roles in the team and they are the only two players we have no "equal quality" substitution and rotation for. 

Our tendencies to start good and end dreadful point towards that direction as well. Our front three win the ball back less than any top team and they all average the ball wins of Cristiano Ronaldo. It is possibly the reason our defense hasn't looked as solid as we wish for and probably the reason that the rest of the team has looked tired at the end of the matches.

1929~~~
yep- spared me the need to reply

1930~~~
He's a fecking beast. I think we have the best player in the league. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1931~~~
Yeah that's true. He does tend to have great stamina but pushing him further up at the tip of the diamond would probably bring the best out of him and conserve him long term in games, and I think we might just do that in the big games and add more defensive cover in the team with carrick. Probably what we'll see long term as well if/when we get strootman.

1932~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> They were clearly shots to be fair. In fact all three of his assists so far were miss-hit shots.

1933~~~
The potential of this guy is scary. In a settled, organised side that has adapted to The LvG Way, he could be phenomenal.

Looking like our best player already, and if he continues in the vein that he's started, he'll be the best in the league or not far off it.

1934~~~
I think that will be our solution as well if we can't get the forwards to pitch in as well. It will be really interesting to see how much this will be flaunted against some of the top teams.

1935~~~

1936~~~
I'm a big fan of Juan but I'm wondering how it would be with Adnan in the Diamond along with Di Maria. For some reason I feel like their chemistry will be insane.

1937~~~
Sometimes you feel that certain players deserve to play in highest level/competition. Seeing what diMaria is capable of, can't shake this feeling that IF ONLY we added player in his class years ago when United were pretty good (and under Ferguson), when we competed and actually quite successful in CL, we could add one or two CL trophy. Then adding those years when we missed out the PL title on few points/goals.

1938~~~
That's my thought as well. Our front three is (almost) fecking useless when it comes to pressing, so our BEST player has to make up for their 'laziness'. That's why I want diMaria as one of the front two as in Robben's role with Holland at last WC.

1939~~~
When watching the Arsenal match, you could see them sticking to their "pass, pass, pass" approach to the game for the full 90mins. There was no increase in urgency, no attempt to try something different. That's what I'm loving about di Maria - he's willing to try it all. Whip in crosses, make runs, tries 1-2s, shots from distance - anything to cause havoc and put defenders on the back foot. The rest of the team benefits from how unpredictable he is, like we saw with Falcao's goal, and everyone looks eager to step their game up in response. He is the #7 we've been waiting for.

1940~~~
What a joy to see this player in a United jersey. We haven't seen anything like this since 2009, yes we won trophies when Ronaldo left but it was more about teamwork than sheer individual brilliance. Not only brilliant but always puts in a shift, brilliant signing.

1941~~~
I was just checking his stats on the Fantasy Football Scout website and apparantly he's created a chance every 26.3 minutes. That's incredible. When you think about how many times you hear a player needs time to adjust to a new league, new teammates and new country, it just sounds quite absurd that he's been so good and so fast.

1942~~~
This is the greatest part of his game in my opinion. He just has this urgency and ability about him which makes the entire team feel it is worth it to lose your marker and make a run in to space. 

His success rate will differ from match to match, but even in poor matches he'll affect the game massively this way for us.

1943~~~
Just seen this on the United official Facebook page

1944~~~
They deleted it after 5 minutes<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1945~~~
It's still there. 


Maybe we can just use Tevez song with Di Maria's name. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1946~~~
You are right, it is. I would be suprised if that chant caught on though<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1947~~~
It being an ABBA tune is the only drawback for me, it'd be darn fecking catchy though.

1948~~~
We were singing a song for him yesterday. Something like:

Do do do
Angel Di Maria
Do do do

It was shite.

1949~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/admwmuhz.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/admwmuhz.gif"/>

1950~~~
I think it's quite catchy <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1951~~~
That ABBA song for Di Maria is very good haha

1952~~~
Not sure if it was posted but Manchester United facebook page just posted this:


We’ve seen a great suggestion for a new chant to the tune of <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/ABBA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ABBA</a>’s ‘Mamma Mia’. Do you think it will catch on?

♪ Di Maria
Here he goes again
Angel, how can he assist you? ♫ ♩

(Credit: Seán O'Sullivan)

1953~~~
It was posted few posts above.

1954~~~
Cecilia by S&G. Di Mariaaaaa.. you're.. something something..

1955~~~
A song to the tune of Ave Maria is obvious.

1956~~~
Would love a lyrics because i don't know a word or two if anybody have time. Tnx

1957~~~
Take him out ad we would struggle again. Too many of our players in the final third are too slow, we need another player who can take players on and beat them one on one with pace. It creates space for the others and disorganises the opponents defence. The way we are set up it is to keep us in front of the defence. Add to that RVP's regressed level at the moment and we are struggling. I feel like we really need to make a choice between RVP and Falcao (Falcao for me at the moment) and play another midfielder so we can control the game midfield better and be less susceptible to counter attacks.

1958~~~
His touch whilst at full speed is ridiculous. Dare I say it, but better even than Ronaldo when he was here.

1959~~~
C'mon let's name it the Di Maria Driven pass shall we

1960~~~
If he does it again in the next few games, surely we can put them down as an 'intended' assist.

1961~~~
Haha! Gotta love the effort and soul he puts into that one. I can really see it being sung at OT. Would be both hilarious and fitting<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1962~~~
Beautiful <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Wish Falcao squared that off to Mata, he was trying too hard to get his first goal I guess.

1963~~~
He's like one of those players that you feck about with on FIFA making everything 99 and then everytime he gets the ball you just want him to dribble around the whole team and score.

1964~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1965~~~
Best 60M spent ever.

1966~~~
I expected him to be world class for us and he has been far better than anticipated. Truly great footballer who is very exciting to watch.

1967~~~
I could definitely live with Di Maria's song being to the tune of Hallelujah.  Just need something that isn't about Woodwood.

1968~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYH-OU4n-VU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I wouldn't even bother changing the lyrics.

1969~~~
The tune hardly strikes fear into the opposition though does it? What next? A song for Blind to the tune of Silent Night?

1970~~~
Songs don't need to be intimidating?  Do you think Viva Ronaldo made other teams quake in their boots?  12 Cantonas?  They're to express adoration or appreciation of players.

1971~~~
70,000 doing a Di Maria themed haka would be a spectacle, mind.

1972~~~
He is a lot more direct than I recall him being at Madrid and Benfica. He is so fast with the ball which is such a desired trait to have in this day and age. A lot of players are very fast without the ball but with it they simply can't generate enough speed without losing control of the ball (Rooney for one). If he carries on then he will be regarded as the best player in the league. Simple as. We may not win a lot this year but anyone who knows a fair bit about football will acknowledge just how good this motherfecker is. Real Madrid have lost a very good player and haven't replaced him with a player in the same league  imo. Perez is one stubborn and foolish man but he is very wealthy and successful so I won't say he is stupid.

1973~~~
Okay, maybe intimidating is the wrong word. I just think the tune of Hallelujah sang en mass would sound a little soft and slow. I'd prefer something that makes the atmosphere livlier. Just like the two examples you gave do.

1974~~~
his vison and awareness are even more wonderful to behold than his dribbling skills.

think we got him just as he was getting better. He has not really peaked imo.

what a footballer. Real must  think they should have asked for more.

1975~~~
There's not a better player in the league.

As for his song, Hallelujah wouldn't work on any level, way too slow.

His name over and over again to the tune of "Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ..." by The Smiths makes too much sense to ever take off.

1976~~~
Im absolutely gutted he's out 3 months with a broken ankle in my FIFA manager mode.  He plays like a video game character in real life, that's how good he is.

1977~~~
True. I love how effortlessly he can just wip in a pin point cross out of nowhere and from anywhere too. Remember when we had wingers that had to get to the byline, before they put in awful crosses. Distant memory now. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1978~~~
You scared the living daylights out of me there mate, before I got to the Fifa manager mode bit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1979~~~
Thank god we didn't lose out to PSG for this guy!

1980~~~
Oooops my bad...

1981~~~
Every game I have seen him in so far for us he has impressed big time, such a breath of fresh air and has given us another dimension in midfield that we have lacked since Ronaldo left pretty much. He is such a threat and guarantees plenty of goals and assists throughout the season. I thought he was certain to be heading to PSG in the summer, such an important signing for us. World class player who is quite simply a joy to watch.

1982~~~
He's thriving on the adulation and attention that being the main attaking outlet for Manchester United brings. Worthy of being given the number 7 shirt

1983~~~
He's absolutely fecking ridiculous. We've signed one of the greatest players in the world.

1984~~~
That's catchy as feck, hope it catches on.

1985~~~
His goal output so far has been surprising actually, even though he missed some chances against West Ham.

1986~~~
He has that swagger and arrogance about him on the pitch.

He knows he is the main man for one of the biggest clubs in the world and is enjoying every moment of it.

I fecking love him.

1987~~~
His role here is much more advanced than at Madrid IMO, he is the main creator and driving force of the team and he has thrived with new responsibilities. I thought we would use him on the wing at first but giving him a free role in the middle with licence to drift out wide as well as be the playmaker was a great decision.

1988~~~
Even his mishits are assists. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1989~~~
I heard there was a secret chord,

That Woodward played and it pleased the board

But then he fecked it up with Thomas Müller

But wait, who's this,

With goals, assists?

Gave Ed a call, he could not resist

Said Woodward come and get me, Di Mariaaaa!

Di Mariaaaaa, Di Mariaaaaa

Di Mariaaaaa, Di Mariaaaaaaaa

1990~~~
fecking brilliant! That and the ABBA one are awesome, hope both catch on. I'm a massive ABBA fan though so I'm bias.

1991~~~
Everything he touches turns to gold at the moment for us. I'm sure he will do a few more "mishit shots/drilled passes" and we will have to reconsider whether he is just incredibly lucky or he truly is meaning it!

1992~~~
Love how positive he is on the ball, and the injection of pace has given a kick up the arse to what had been the slowest United team I'd seen since the Big Ron days. Covers a lot of ground as well, and like people have said above, thrives on the extra responsibility he gets with us as opposed to being a cog in the Real machine. God help us if he gets injured - which worries me because he gets precious little protection from Premiership refs so far.

1993~~~
I love how he celebrates too, the way he runs off faster than he did to score with his little heart shape <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

I feel like a smitten teenager.

1994~~~
Six goals provided, zero dives. I like it. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1995~~~
Fe.k I was in cold sweat for 2 seconds while reading this until I got to the Fifa manager mode. Awful 2 seconds. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1996~~~
He's really elevated himself to the top tier in the last year or so. He was always very talented but the level of consistency he is playing at now puts him in the genuine superstar bracket. You just expect him to come up with the goods every game now.

1997~~~

1998~~~
Thank you.

1999~~~
All three defenders decided to go for him and he just lose them with backheel so effortless.

2000~~~
If i'm being honest, i'm more impressed by Shaw's pass, this kid impresses me all the time.

2001~~~
When ADM gets the ball, he dictates the whole pace of United's game, when he has a few yards free around him. Instantly it's lifted, as he drives forward. I'm amazed how he manages to change direction running with the ball without breaking stride. Fullbacks must already be terrified of him. THE best player I have seen at OT since Ronnie. I honestly believe like a few others on here, that we have the best player in the league already. He looks better suited without a team of Galacticos around him. Bonus: his work rate -  he chases back. I have to admit I was sceptical about his signing. Not any more. If he gets injured though, I'm scared sh*tless our current momentum will be lost and Utd will slip back in to the monotonous slow, predicatable movement of the ball. He's THAT good.

Loving the Abba chant too. The one at OT on Sunday was dreadful.

2002~~~
They're both diabolical.

2003~~~
Can he do it on a cold Wednesday night in Stoke though?

2004~~~
Shaw has been excellent but Di Maria's flick is out of this world.

2005~~~
......with Ryan Shawcross trying to snap him in two? Probably, yes. He's THAT good.

As for the chants, if anyone can come up with a better one I'd love to hear it. He needs one now, as he's involved in everything on the pitch that is good.

2006~~~
The question on everybody's lips, really. Feck the Bridge, The Etihad and The Emirates. A cold windy, rainy, stormy Monday night at Stoke will be the real test.

2007~~~
£27 million looks like a snip now doesn't it <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> and he will only get better.

2008~~~
Is that Van Persie running into Falcao's "space"? Ironic.

2009~~~
Haven't even watched that run as of yet. Diabotical movement. Good run from Mata but Persie is pretty much running into Falcao's path.

2010~~~
Cold night for sure...1st of January. Getting the chills already. BRRRRHHHHH!!

2011~~~

2012~~~
That's amazing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2013~~~
How do you do a Di Maria themed haka? Have you ever seen a haka?!

2014~~~
<a class="username" data-user="92122, @Ole Gunner Scholes" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/92122/">@Ole Gunner Scholes</a> has PMed a chant and requested it be posted here;

2015~~~
Offensively bad. Even worse than "der der der Angel Di Maria".

2016~~~
A haka with an Di Maria 7 shirt and some plastic Spock ears on?

2017~~~
This guy is one of the best players that has very played for us still can't believe we signed him, Madrid are insane for selling. This is what you get when you pay big and bring in a player close to his prime. Would love to have his babies <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2018~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2019~~~
Our attack should be centered around him. He should be our Robben at the world cup.

He is mind blowingly good.

2020~~~
I agree. Hopefully he can stay fit.

2021~~~
Di Maria is always thinking forward. Whether it comes to dribbling, seeing space, or passing. He takes responsibility.

2022~~~
Any combination of players, as long as he's in Robben position, they are look good.
Then put Blind-Carrick-Herrera in midfield. Suddenly the team just look tasty.

2023~~~
Why play him as a forward...

2024~~~
So he can have more goals and assists?

2025~~~
I'd go as far as to say he's already the best player in the league

2026~~~
who's to say he will? He is an excellent winger or midfielder and is contributed significantly from there. Playing him as a forward forces him to play a different way. He needs to get the ball from deeper positions and run at players, not hang on the defensive line or play with his back to goal.

2027~~~
I want him in the 2007 Ronaldo role. Get him the ball at every opportunity on the left and or right.

I never thought we'd get to see anyone as good as Ronaldo at running with the ball with such speed and directness.

2028~~~
He became that the second we signed him. Top 5 in the world as well, without a doubt.

2029~~~
He plays with 'balls'. I have always loved players like that, positive players.

2030~~~
The way he uses that inside left channel is amazing. Has been so dangerous there, central defenders don't know whether to slide across, fullbacks don't want to close the ball and he is able to pretty much choose what he wants to do. One of those long shots are going to come off soon.

2031~~~
He'll be like Robben at WC. Also he'll add pace to our forward line that we severely lack of. And he doesn't need to work as hard as now in midfield, but more concentrating on creating chances.

2032~~~
If you want to add pace to the forward line Januzaj should be used on the right in a 4-3-3.

2033~~~
Would love to see that. But LvG wants his 4312, and diMaria is much better than Januzaj.

2034~~~

2035~~~
I love it but my wife started to hate it because i sign it a lot <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2036~~~
I just love him. One or two more additions in defence and possibly a world class midfielder and we have a team that can win anything!

2037~~~
I seriously can't imagine some of the nutters at Stretford singing a bleedin' Abba song during a match!

2038~~~
Just what you except  from one of the best player in the world. He wins you games. But he’ll not wins us 38 games this season as a lot of players must step up in this team (Wazza, RVP and the defence)

Again, I think that for the moment he’s not used the best way. I want to see him in a wing where he has less defensive work and more focus on hurting people. I would love us to sign Vidal/Khedira in the midfield and play ADM in a 4-3-3 as a winger

2039~~~
I'm not sure why people keep saying this (and I've heard it numerous times). Di Maria is a far better and more effective player in the middle of the park than he ever was as a winger. When he was a winger he was basically a slightly superior version of Nani. Talented and capable of producing moments of magic but incredibly frustrating and inconsistent in his performances. He is far, far better utilized in a central position.

2040~~~
He is absolutely brilliant and wins us games. It was astonishing to see in his first game that he's head and shoulders above all our other players.

However, the other big boys need to step up their game as at one point he will be man marked / double marked etc so we will need options and other ways to create chances

2041~~~
I just say that because when he's higher on the pitch he can be as good as Ronaldo as destroying defense, as we saw in WC this summer, or when he plays for Argentina as a winger. At Madrid, he played in midfield, but when Ronaldo was in the box, Di Maria played left and it was a sort of 4-4-2 in attack

I just say that regarding our lack of pace and energy we need a forward like this. Our 3 number 9 (bar Wazza) are box players so that's why I say that 

If you play Di Maria with one or two static forward then you waste his pace and movments

2042~~~
Erm, he rarely plays for them as a winger. He played midfield in the WC. 

We'd be mad to use him as a winger now, clearly he's a much better midfielder, what would be the point in moving our best player out of his best position?

2043~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> He played winger before the World Cup and played winger/inside forward after the World Cup. 

And he is a great winger, it's easier to use all his qualities when he is a CM but if we sign very good midfielders, our midfield will be more balanced with Di Maria on the wings.

2044~~~
he plays as a winger at times to suit their formation because they're overloaded with attackers, but generally in the big games (i.e. the WC) they use him in midfield, his best position.

He's a great winger sometimes but he's an amazing midfielder most of the time. That's the difference. If we want to strengthen our wings, we should just buy wingers, not move him to the wing and buy midfielders who likely aren't as good as him.

2045~~~
He is the main man for us. Putting him out on the wing is going to limit his impact on the game, something that would be stupid to do.

2046~~~
Indeed. I wanted him on the wing initially but he is much better off in midfield where he can make use of all of his best attributes.

2047~~~
I think it's quite clear he's best utilised centrally. In the case of Ronaldo, he was, and is, a player who is best played out wide and drifting infield. Di Maria is the opposite - he seeks to start central and find pockets of width. He is also able to take the ball forward with far more freedom; he has no fullback trying to mark him touch-tight, he has the ability to go anywhere he pleases. It's also far easier for him to run through midfields than it is to run past fullbacks. Not to mention, his passing and shooting are a lot better than I expected - you can't just waste it as a typical winger. But, that said, the form he is in right now he could probably wreck havoc out on the wing too.

2048~~~
If he were to be a winger I would say LW because his crossing is much better than his cutting in shot.

But that is a discussion for when 4-1-2-1-2 stops working.

2049~~~
The talk of moving him to the wing is a bit daft because of how perfect he is for a midfield diamond, it would be easier to buy a winger nearly as good as him (as a winger) than replace him in the midfield. 

Only problem I can see a problem with needing wingers is when we play our diamond and our fullbacks are injured.

2050~~~
ADM should play midfield because he brings something to midfield that is gold dust, the ability to dribble like a winger through the middle. Best example of that is Iniesta, it's something really difficult to contain.  FB are better equipped to deal with this game than DM's and CB's so when a player like an ADM or an Iniesta comes along it throws a spanner in the works of the central players.

You can get good wingers , not as good as ADM sure but certainly who can do a good/great job, but you certainly can't get that other kind of AM, I can't think of any beyond Iniesta and Giggs who marry the art of winger and the art of CM play so well.

2051~~~
It's not daft at all, the reason we are "struggling" at the moment, is because we can't control a game with Herrera and Di Maria in the midfield, they are punchers they don't really care about field control they search to KO the opponents each and every time.

And at some point we will have to take care of that problem by either creating the best back 5 (back 4 + the holding midfielder) in the world or creating the most lethal attack in the world (and expect tennis-like scores every time) or we can try to balance the all team by signing one or two midfielders who will help us becoming a more mature team (if we want to win the CL), who can control a game, at all time.

2052~~~

2053~~~
Absolutely agree with both - especially the bits in bold.

You can buy a couple of wingers who can dribble out wide and assist almost as well as Di Maria.
But look at all of the top teams in Europe.. How many have a player who can not only dribble past two/three men through the middle, but dribble past two/three men through the middle from a standstill? That's without mentioning his work rate and everything else he brings to the table.

It's a unique weapon that we should be making the most of.
If we're going 4-3-3, I'd rather get two wingers in than get in Strootman (for example) and put Di Maria out wide.
If anything, that just increases the reliance on getting the ball out wide.
And it's not like playing him in midfield comes at the cost of work rate or defensive ability, as he's good in this regard.

2054~~~
I was happy when we signed him, I rated him highly but I honestly didn't think he was this good. To tell you the truth, before last season I didn't even rate him that highly.

2055~~~
I said during the transfer window that i'd take Di Maria over Vidal any day of the week. Good to see he's proving me right.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2056~~~
While Blackett has been happy to admire Di Maria’s skills, he does believe he can challenge when it comes to free kicks.

“Hopefully further on into the season, you’ll get to see me take one,” he told BBC Match of the Day magazine.

“I’d certainly be happy to if the opportunity came up.

“For now though, Angel’s the expert so I’m just looking up to him.”

Easy there, Blackett. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2057~~~
Me too. Had we signed Vidal instead, I doubt he'd be making the impact Di Maria currently is and will continue to do so. Vidal is possibly the best in his position, but Di Maria is up there with the top four players on the planet.

2058~~~
To be fair, he's got quite a lefty. Wouldn't be surprised if he scored some screamers in the future once he gains more confidence.

2059~~~
Would be a good laugh to read over the transfer thread at all the posters who compared him to Nani because apparently he loses the ball a lot and is inconsistent. Pretty sure I got laughed at my multiple posters for saying he was Madrid'd 2nd best player last season as well.

2060~~~
Anytime I'd seen di Maria as a winger, he'd been inconsistent and frustrating. He's been a revelation since moving centrally.

2061~~~
Awesome player, I remember my brother saying a couple of years ago that he'd love to see him in a United shirt. Didn't think it would actually happen mind. In fact I still can't believe that RM let him goand he is actually here! It also means that we are more attractive to future players with players like him in the side.

2062~~~
I remember you did and half the caf thought you were bonkers.

2063~~~
Lol don't do that again man haha my guy dropped after ur first line hahaha

2064~~~
Tbh I was the same. I watched Madrid quite a bit last season and was very impressed, before that I was under the impression he was very inconsistent.

2065~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2066~~~
Yup, pure vindication.

2067~~~
Nice feature on ADM in this month's Four Four Two. One of his Argentina team mates (Biglia) is quoted saying that ADM and Ronaldo are co-equal #2 players in the world behind Messi. Also highlights ADM's versalitity. Good read.

2068~~~
He's paved the way, dragged us up a level, playing around him has seen our other players stand up and be counted, even Valencia had a good game at the weekend, his impact on the attack has been utterly astonishing.

2069~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2070~~~
I doubt there were any who wpupe have disagreed that he was Madrid's best player (he can also stake a claim to have been their most important player) last season.

As for comparisons between Nani and him. Nani in his best form was as good as, if not better, than di Maria before last season. It was only when Ancelotti moved him centrally that he actually took his game up several notches. It's funny how people bring up discussions they might have had once to try and vindicate that they were right all along even though at that point in time these comparisons might have been actually true.

2071~~~
Must have been Rooney asking AdM how he manages to stay so thin and also still has a head full of hair. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2072~~~
Hererra and Blind are perfect for controlling a game from midfield. We need more depth in Herrera's position. We have controlled almost every game we have played so far after we bought di Maria. We only go to shit towards the end of the match and that could well be due to nerves.

2073~~~
This. Herrera and Blind are an excellent pair to have. What is deeply troubling is our massive drop in quality if they become unavailable. We need at least one really solid midfield signing. Some like Modric and Ramsey.

2074~~~
Modric or Ramsey to provide 'depth' in our squad? They'll demand as starter if they move in here. And rightly so, imho.

2075~~~
I didn't mean Ramsey and Modric literally. I meant players in their mould, which are admittedly hard to find.

2076~~~
di Maria would be wasted out wide. He needs to be kept in the middle, where he can run from deep.

2077~~~
Will he be playing for Argentina this week?

2078~~~
Eventually he'll be moved into the #10 role I think with Mata being moved out and RVP dropping to back up striker.

2079~~~
Will he be one of the players shortlisted for this yr balon dor?

2080~~~
I don't think he will be as effective there. He is better with space to run into, rather than having a defender stuck to him tight. Once he is turned and running is where he is best iMO.

2081~~~
He should still have that space to do that though, hes one to drift and come deeper for the ball.

2082~~~
He may aswell play midfield normally then if he is doing that. 

As a 10 you want the ball high up the field, rather than always coming deep. No doubt he could play there, but I see him better facing goal than with his back to it.

2083~~~
The same could be said when he pushes up from midfield, if you want someone to get the ball that high up play him as a #10. He's a maverick who does what he pleases, better to have him somewhere where he isn't shackled by defensive duties, then his work rate is a massive bonus.

2084~~~
I dont think his position actually matter's, he could play either midfield or wing and still do well, he drifts between wing and cm whenever he feel's like it anyways.

2085~~~
Agreed. Di Maria's best position is as the attacking midfielder in a 3 man midfield. I like the position he is playing in now.

2086~~~
Please Jesus, bring our Angel back unharmed.....

our best player since Ronaldo?

2087~~~
Plenty of people disagreed that he was Madrid's 2nd best player. Bale was getting much more credit than him after his goal vs Barca in the cup final even though his overall performances weren't on the same level as Di Maria. 

People were arguing that we shouldn't sign Di Maria this summer not 2+ seasons ago and using Nani and his inconsistency as an example. Nani at his very best was never close to being a top 5 player in the world which is the level Di Maria is at and I don't see how "Nani at his very best" which was years ago was comparable to Di Maria 2 years ago is very relevant to this summer. 

I'm not trying to vindicate anything it's patently obvious a huge portion of fans severely underrated Di Maria and making up specific time frames for when they should be compared doesn't change that.

2088~~~
Yep on Saturday against Brazil in China!

His current Argentina coach Tata Martino also said if he continues playing like he currently is with us then he was a bargain. And that he is very flexible and can occupy every position in the midfield or on the wings <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2089~~~
That's absolutely right imo. Well at least in the friendly against us (Germany) he even ripped us a new one while playing on the wing.

2090~~~
No doubts he can do well in either position. 

Just that he offers something so unique from a central position. Whereas you can find a player or two who can do something similar to him (and to a closer level) out wide. 
He's great in both roles. Just a shame we don't have two of him!

2091~~~
In the few matches he's played so far, he's showed some amazing skills, dribbling and crossing. The type, when on form, you only watch football matches for.

2092~~~
Most of the posts I have read on the caf have been of excitement at the prospect of signing di Maria. Obviously there were many who wanted, somewhat justifiably, us to sign a CB/CM before going for another attacker but that was because the team needed to strengthen in that department as well, not because they felt di Maria was inconsistent or not good enough. 

Regarding Nani, people said that di Maria, before last season, was as inconsistent as Nani has been for us and that is when he played as a winger for Madrid. There is nought wrong with that train of thought. His stats and his performance actually show the same.

2093~~~
I never brought up the argument of signing a CB over Di Maria as it would have been a valid opinion. I brought up that people didn't want to sign Di Maria because he was "similar to Nani" in levels of ability and consistency which is utter nonsense. So you're just wrong in the claim that people didn't want us to sign him because of his ability or consistency, plenty of posters felt that way.

Di Maria has been leagues above Nani for years now, you'd need to go back 3/4 seasons to find a time when Nani would be considered better or in his class.

2094~~~
I think one of the great things about Angel is that while his dribbling and pace is incredibly exciting and a huge asset right now, he's clearly going to be a player who will adapt to play without it. He's got all the footballing intelligence and technical skills to do so. 

That's a good 5 years away though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2095~~~
Was he much of a goal-scorer before this season? Have to say his goal threat has been a pleasant surprise.

Scoring some absolute pearlers in training too, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/United-Uncovered/News/2014/Oct/Issue-88/andreas-pereira-training-talk-interview.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to young Pereira</a>.

2096~~~
Not overly.

But then, when you have the likes of Bale and Ronaldo ahead of you, you don't need to be.

2097~~~
I wouldn't say it's much different to 3 of Mata/Falcao/RVP/Rooney

2098~~~
He might has more freedom to express himself instead of knowing he must feed Ronaldo and co.

2099~~~
Two of his missplaced shots turned to be assists (Mata, Falcao), he really can't do wrong and I still can't believe he's our player! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2100~~~
Buying Strootman will surely mean a change to 4-3-3 and Di Maria out on the wing. Not sure how I feel about that.

2101~~~
I hate international breaks. Don't get injured Angel.

2102~~~
Isn't he playing in fecking Beijing or somewhere else ridiculously far away?

Playing Brazil too, right? No nasty tackles flying around in <i>that</i> game, eh? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2103~~~
I'd say it's very different, so far at least.

2104~~~
Ramsey and Modric in the same sentence <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2105~~~
Not really, though he's always had it in him to have some great strikers from range. I think he just held back from shooting because you already had Ronaldo and later on, bale striker the ball every time they had space. Think he'll score a lot more goals then before as he's our main man.

2106~~~
Fernandinho worries me.

2107~~~
Di Maria thread on the madrid forum is over 880 pages. Poor feckers must be gutted.

2108~~~
Which one?

2110~~~
Can see that cock, Luiz, doing a number on him too.

2111~~~
Is there no English RM forum?

2112~~~
There is, but it's pretty much all bandwagoners.

2113~~~
Don't forget Ramires!

2114~~~

2115~~~
feck sake, you've got me worried now.

Oh no! di marìa is going to die!!!!!!!!!

those brazilians defenders will only see di marìas shirt number

2118~~~
So we can hold you accountable if anything happens to our Angel?

2119~~~
Just Pereira saying he's amazing (and Herrera is world class too).

2120~~~
Such a fantastic player still can't believe we signed him.


Arsenal could have had Di Maria, Sanchez and Fabgregas <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2121~~~
of course

2122~~~
I'll hold you to that <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2123~~~
You need to find posts to back up that claim of yours. Di Maria and Nani were on a similar level till 2-3 seasons back. Unfortunately for Nani he didn't kick on.

2124~~~
2 seasons ago Nani made 11 appearances so I'd doubt it. 3 seasons ago was his last decent showing for United but bringing up performances from 3 years ago is fairly laughable. Pogba and Cleverly were performing at the same level 3 seasons ago so we shouldn't sign Pogba. Good logic.

2125~~~
Is comprehension difficult for you? 2011-12 Nani was at par with di Maria of that season. Following two seasons Nani had suffered from a lot of injuries and hardly had a real run of games. He has been very inconsistent as well. Di Maria, until last season, was like he always was. A brilliant winger on his day who could also get things horribly wrong and was inconsistent. Last season he became part of the midfield 3 and was allowed to roam onto the wings. That is when he really kicked on to a whole new level. Now no one is claiming di Maria and Nani are on the same levels anymore. And I don't remember anyone using that logic to somehow take away the importance of this signing when it was made. People wanted a Vidal/Benatia type player over di Maria and thus were not sure if he is what we need irrespective of his brilliant talent. 
As I asked you earlier which you conveniently missed in my post while quoting, you should quote posts from this year from posters in the main forum who claim that Nani is on par with di Maria and that is the reason why we should not go for him. As of now, all this talk of how other people were against his signing based on the above reason while you were all for it is based on nothing.

2126~~~
No but comprehension must be difficult for you. My original quote which you replied to was that multiple posters didn't want to sign Di Maria as he was "inconsistent like Nani" yet you've have to shift the argument to were you're now comparing performances between the two from 2 seasons ago which had no relevance and is such a laughable argument it doesn't need to be discussed. Nani has not any any serious injuries that would cause him to play only about 10 times a season for years and you're horribly wrong about Di Maria's past since he played in a CM diamond at Benfica along with Ramires, CM isn't a new position to him. 

I also said I have no issues with people who would have prioritised a signing like Vidal/Benatia over Di Maria, that's a perfectly understandable position but my argument was specifically aimed at the people who used Nani or other inconsistent wingers as examples for not signing him. 

I haven't conveniently missed anything  actually the opinion that we shouldn't sign him because of his inconsistency and comparisons to Nani were in such volume it's hardly a myth or something I'm making up. I don't know how to access the old transfer forum threads and if I did I wouldn't go looking through hundreds of pages to see which posters made the statements and hold them accountable. I'd wager if you looked at that thread on the day of the Argentina/Switzerland game you'd see plenty of posters that mirror what I've claimed.

2127~~~
Again going off on a tangent, aren't you? I clearly said that Nani's best levels were close to what di Maria achieved prior to last season when he played primarily as a winger. Re Nani's injuries, I guess you need to check it out yourself. He was injured for most of season before last and also missed a major part of last season because of that. If you can't remember that, it's your issue.

Also, I am going off the thread dedicated to di Maria where posters had issues with the position we are buying for and not the personnel. Match day threads are hardly a good one to go off. They are mostly written in the heat of the moment.

2128~~~
I'm also going off the thread dedicated to Di Maria in the summer, I was after all the one who started it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

You can keep repeating that 3 seasons ago Nani and Di Maria were on the same level as if it had some merit all you like, it doesn't become less ridiculous. 3 seasons ago Cleverly was ahead of Pogba. 3 seasons ago Suarez only scored 11 goals in a league campaign and dempsey was the highest scoring midfielder in the league. 3 seasons ago the Chelsea side that won the Champions league was Cech-Bosingwa-luiz-cahill-bertrand-mikel-cole-lampard-mata-kalou drogba. 1 player from that group now starts for them.

2129~~~
What is this sh.t. People writing novels here. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Anyway did he play vs Brasil?

2130~~~
Yup. Solid first half, but both he and Argentina seemed to lose impetus in the second half. Messi had a bit of a stinker, trying too much and missing a penalty. Di Maria had a few pop-shots and nice dribbles, but all in all it was pretty meh.

2131~~~
Sill can't believe he's our player, he along makes me so excited to see each of our game, he looks a level above the BPL at times.  Messi and Ronaldo of course GOATs and probably the best goal scorers ever but they're not as exciting as Di Maria for me, maybe 2009-2011 Messi and 2006-2009 Ronaldo were as exciting.

2132~~~
Come on guys... Too much sexual tension bbetween the two of you! 

Get a room and sort it out.

2133~~~
He is one of those players that you just dont realise how good he is until you watch him play for you. I have to be honest I thought when we signed him we had overspent on a 35-40 milllion pound player......I was very wrong.

He has performed at an extremely high level and his number of assists could realistically be much higher at this point. Fantastic player

2134~~~
Bit OTT don't you think?

2135~~~
We've had Valencia and Young for the past few years. Di Maria looks like a god in comparison!

2136~~~
Has he got another game with Argentina before he's back in Manchester? Apologies for my ignorance!

2137~~~
They play Hong Kong on Tuesday.

2138~~~
Shit. Thanks pal.

2139~~~
There's been so much talk about reinforcing our midfield, yet in some ways Di Maria might have been what we were missing. He's brought back the excitement to our play.

Exhilarating when he gets the ball and runs at teams. Already looks to have taken over the mantle from the likes of Giggs and Ronaldo.

He's definitely a "just give him the ball" kind of player.

2140~~~
His best position is where he is right now. It baffles me when I see posters on here wanting him shifted out wide. He's our best player and he's only going to get better as the season progresses

2141~~~
One can't overstate the impact Di Maria has had on the club so far.  Pure genius and joy.  If there's one aspect of his game I'd like to see him emphasize, however, is encouraging possession play instead of pushing straight for the goal all the time.  He's the de facto leader of our starting XI (Rooney is always a heartbeat away from a red card and RvP is in decline) and Di Maria can be the player who sets the pace of the game for us.

2142~~~
Or on the other hand, nah, bollocks to that.  It's his directness that has made him such a refreshing joy.  The last thing we need is another player playing the safe sideways pass, we've got plenty of them thanks.

2143~~~
Rooney has only been sent off once for United. Di Maria's directness, and pace is what makes him the stand out player in the team.

2144~~~
Agreed, and it's best utilised from a central left position, not behind a striker where his movement is restricted and he's forced to play with his back to goal, at a slower tempo, or out on the wing with limited autonomy. It's quite clear why he completely evolved as a player last season playing this role for Madrid.

2145~~~
Our style under Van Gaal is clearly a more patient and possession oriented approach, until it gets to Di Maria. He's that player for us who injects the directness and pace, which all possession teams need. Bayern have someone like Robben or Ribery, Barca have Messi and Neymar, etc. Now we have Di Maria and he's the main creator, the player we look at to always make things happen rather then just play a possession game like everyone else.

2146~~~
We also have Herrera for this. Every time he gets the ball, it's like a shot of caffeine, everything just increases in tempo for a few minutes. Di Maria takes it to overdrive, obviously.

2147~~~
Exactly this.

2148~~~
Never really thought of it like this, good point though.

2149~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opxw-gPWXkQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This is his performance against Brazil.

2150~~~
You're right and I think LvG said it himself when we signed him. Something like - we have bought him to increase the speed of our game.

2151~~~
Ancelotti calling Di Maria greedy...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he was getting paid 60K and was obviously the most important(sometiimes best) player on that team. IF Di maria is greedy, what does that make Ronaldo? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2152~~~
How much did he play against hongkong?

2153~~~
Is it greedy to be one of the best players in the world and to want to be one of the best paid players in the world?

2154~~~
Just a tad longer than 15 minutes at the end.

2155~~~
It was basically a training game for them so he barely had anything to do. 

Really needs to learn to use his right foot though.

2156~~~
Thanks! 

Now get him home fast and safe!

2157~~~
Very good point. I reckon that signing Di Maria has improved us more than signing a non-injured Vidal would have. We'd probably be more solid but we'd still be lacking that special something in attack that makes us exciting to watch.

2158~~~
Like His goal against Everton?

2159~~~
I take it you missed his last goal for us then?

2160~~~
I don't think it's any big shock to say he's not comfortable on his right foot. Its an area it would be good to see him improve.

2161~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2162~~~
He's obviously not as strong on his right foot but his left foot is so good that it doesn't really matter. It's not like he's a left-footed Valencia is it?

2163~~~
His right foot is still better than Valencia's left. His ability with the outside of his left + him scoring one with his right is enough to not be concerned about this weakness atm.

2164~~~
To be fair, his right is probably better than Valencia's right at this stage.

2165~~~
He's shit. I thought he'd be doing rabonas all game. <span style="color: #ffffff">...</span>

2166~~~
His strikes look like crosses
His crosses look like strikes
Di Maria
He does what he likes!

2167~~~
He just seems so much better than anyone else in the squad

2168~~~
The only player who's looked good so far. It's not even that he's been overly great either - he's just casually excellent when it comes to playing football, even when he's not at his very best.

2169~~~
It feels almost like everyone else in the team hasn't got used to how good he is yet. No one is ready or on their toes every time he swings in one of these lethal balls. Everyone's still playing like it's Cleverley on the ball and he'll probably pass it backwards again.

2170~~~
The trajectories on some of his crosses are amazing. I don't understand why  the players aren't more ready to attack his passes.

2171~~~
Feel like an important part of his game is sacrificed when he's given a too wide starting position. He can't really drive up our tempo with the ball at his feet from that position.

2172~~~
Being used wrongly tonight. Needs to be moved inside so he can use the full range of his abilities and offer us more variation down the middle. When he's getting chalk on his boots there's pretty much only one way he can go. Running from the middle he can come inside or go outside and its not as easy to double up on him and show him to the corner flag. We should go back to the diamond and let him run the game.

2173~~~
Falcao would've had a hat-trick with some of those crosses tonight.

Reckon we go with Rooney and Falcao against Chelsea and let's see.

2174~~~
Shunting him out wide all night long was utter madness.

Looks like he's injured now too. What a terrific night.

2175~~~
Hope he isn't hurt too long. He was really good in the 1st half.

2176~~~
Van Persie is un-fecking-droppable.

2177~~~
Hopefully his injury is not serious or we're fecked.

2178~~~
I don't think so. The logic was there for his place today. Falcao back on Friday from round-the-world trip and Rooney suspended.

Let's see next time out with the 3 of them to choose from.

2179~~~
If it's serious, our season is over. He's that important.

2180~~~
I'd certainly have RVP in that current team, especially with Mata and Januzaj playing poorly. I'd maybe revert back to what we were doing before the suspension, with Rooney in behind RVP and Falcao.

2181~~~
Be good to see him play 90mins, we only seem to get 70mins out of him, £60m for Bobby Zamora legs and lungs.

2182~~~
He carried on and took a corner just after it so I don't think it'll be too bad.

2183~~~
Because tonight is the first game Di Maria has delivered good crosses?

2184~~~
Hoping the exact same.

2185~~~
Yeah some of those crosses were crying for Falcao to be in and around the box. He might not have scored, but he'd have made the effort to attack them.

2186~~~
Am I the only one who thinks his corners are quite often useless and that someone else should be taking them?

2187~~~
The only bright spark at times

2188~~~
I miss those from 2012/13 with Rooney and RvP taking.

2189~~~
He played the full 90 against Everton.

2190~~~
How many great crosses has he put in now since his arrival and how many have we actually scored from? The strikers need to start making better runs I think.

2191~~~
Yep, all three of Rooney, Mata and van Persie are probably better corner kick takers than him. Some of his corners are dangerous, but loads of them just end up in keeper hands or just out of play.

2192~~~
Nah, they're woeful. Mata should be taking them, or even Van Persie when they're on the field.

Di Maria had a good game otherwise, of course. Not everything comes off but it would be unfair to expect it to.

2193~~~
I hope this game proved he's so, so, so much better as a left sided central midfielder. He gets double - even triple marked and has to revert to his (whilst brilliant) predictable crossing game on the wing. Wastes so much of his ability to run at players and wreck havoc.

2194~~~
Rooney is out for Chelsea game too but yeah, I will prefer those 2 in big games and keep RvP on bench.

How serious is the injury guys? I didn't watch the game.

2195~~~
Would love to see him run at defenders a bit more. Thought he looked for the early ball in too often today. Still always looked a threat mind.

2196~~~
To be fair, his crossing game on the wing may be predictable, but it is brilliant as you admit. But yeah, I'd like to see him in a more central role regularly. Gives him room to penetrate the opposition through the middle with his pace and skill.

2197~~~
Yep. Playing him on the wing is just a waste. You basically nullify half of his attacking threat before the game even starts.

2198~~~
I think he didn't do that so much because he was out in a wider role. He was crossing a lot more today due to that.

2199~~~
Not as good on the wing

2200~~~
My MoM. Between him and Blind for me, but I'm giving it to di Maria as he's the only regular offensive threat. Like I said earlier in the game, I don't think his team mates are used to the quality of ball he provides on a regular basis.

2201~~~
Any word on his injury?

2202~~~
Without him vs Chelsea we'll be fe.ked. 

Well probably we'll be fe.ked anyway..

2203~~~
Our best player again. Somewhat wasted on the wing delivering crosses of those quality when RVp was the only one in the box. I'd play him in the middle unless we have Falcao along with RVP to aim at.

2204~~~
Yeah, if we take away just one thing from this match, it should be that AdM needs to be starting more centrally. Our entire play suffers when he starts wide, because we don't have anyone who can replace his ability to drive the ball forward with pace centrally.

2205~~~
Hopefully the injury is minor. Is easily the most creative outlet in the side.

2206~~~
He has been playing the same Winger/CM position ever since he has been here?

2207~~~
Hasn't he? From what I can recall we've been set up with him and Herrera (Valencia against Everton) ahead of Blind in a wide CM roles in all of his appearances up until today. Today he was clearly playing as a more traditional 4-3-3 / 4-5-1 winger though.

Incidentally, he was always most impressive in a similar role for Madrid when I watched him last season. A left central position with a license to roam out wide when Ronaldo went more centrally.

2208~~~
He played more as a winger today and I hope he'll start at LM vs Chelsea if he'll be fit of course.

2209~~~
Yeah thats true, today we played more of a 4-3-3 than usual. Im sure we will be back to the diamond on the weekend.

2210~~~
Didn't have his greatest gane but still did more than most, hope the thigh strain is nothing, of all the weejs to get it with the upcoming games...

2211~~~
Seemed like a bruised thigh to me? Hopefully nothing serious.

Was not as influential today probably because of the niggle he picked up, but still put in some good crosses into the box which RVP (or anyone) failed to take advantage of.

If we are nitpicking, I still think his corners are rather subpar. Not sure what he is trying to aim at really.

2212~~~
Just play him as the most advanced in a midfield trio like in Real or the left midfield diamond role that he has been playing so far. This probably was his least influential game so far at United (barring the Burnley one where he still had a great first half). Playing him exclusively on the left flank makes him more predictable and gives him less freedom to roam positionally.

2213~~~
Usually I'd agree but I thought they were excellent tonight. 

As for him being wasted on the wing I'm not sure if I agree. I thought he was excellent tonight and no worse than he has been when played centrally. I do prefer when he plays centrally as he gets on the ball more and he is more difficult to mark out of the game but he is still a world class winger. It's not like shunting Rooney out wide. He may be more effective in the middle but he is also excellent out wide.

2214~~~
Thought we looked a little toothless in attack with Di Maria playing wider. He carries a dual threat with his shooting and his crossing and when you put him out wide half of that is wasted. It didn't really help that no-one was getting on the end of the crosses he did put in either, but if we'd had Falcao in there rather than Van Persie we might have fared a bit better in that respect.

Also I agree with <a class="username" data-user="54956, @Amar__" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54956/">@Amar__</a> that he shouldn't be taking corners. He put maybe 1 or 2 decent ones in tonight and a lot of poor ones. Mata is far better at them and its not as if we miss his height in the box so it seems like a no-brainer.

2215~~~
I don't know what it is but we've brought in so many traditionally very good corner takers and they've all turned to shit here. His crossing is so good from open play and free kicks even but have we had a proper chance from his corners?

2216~~~
He was noticeably less involved today, being stuck out on the left wing, at least in the first half. Most of their attacks came down our left side as well.

2217~~~
Its such a waste having him stuck on the wing.

2218~~~
He put an ice-pack on this thigh when he was subbed. Hopefully it was just precautionary but it's rather worrying.

2219~~~
Van Gaal has said that he'll be okay for Chelsea

2220~~~
Great to hear, thanks.

2221~~~
His play seemed very restricted today, almost as if he was told not to cut in too much. Most of his dribbling play is effective when he brings the ball inside defenders and uses his agility to find gaps to work into. Him being on the wing restricted him to a straight line, and shaw. Having said that, even with restricted movement for him with the ball, he still has outstanding creativity and technique to pull them off. Some lethal crosses today, and had Falcao started with Van persie, we would have seen a few of them put in

2222~~~
Hopefully he's fit <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2223~~~
strange RvP does not take them anymore. He was great at taking corners.

2224~~~
Yeah, it's always like that with every player who used to be good at set pieces. What I hate the most is that we are strictly sticking with one player to take them during the game and no one else has the right to come even close the ball when we win the corner.

2225~~~

2226~~~
How Real let him go for James??  Holy shit thats some dumb shit for you..

2227~~~
Please please please please move him back to a central position.

Its killing me, and his game, stuck out on the toucline.

2228~~~
Take him off set piece duty please. He's so wastefully inconsistent despite us getting a couple goals off them.

2229~~~
Wasnt his best match, didnt pass Ivanovic once.

2230~~~
Didn't look fit to me. Poor performance. Need him at his best for next week.

2231~~~
He needs to play more centrally. It's not a coincidence that the best period of his career has coincided with the switch to that position. I also don't think he was helped by the lack of Rooney and Herrera who he can usually play off.

2232~~~
Played like a shie Ashley Young.

2233~~~
He's a Utd player now isn't he <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> ?

2234~~~
He'll play better next week with Rooney back.

2235~~~
Had an off day at the office. It happens.

2236~~~
Very poor today but atleast his last cross helped us get the goal.

He's better as a CM/CAM than winger though, last two matches prove it imo.

2237~~~
He didn't look unfit at all he just had a shite game. Should've been moved centrally, wasn't working for him out wide at all.

2238~~~
Poor match, but that happens.

2239~~~
Thought he had a disappointing game. Gave it away a lot and in poor areas too and didn't make anything happen.

That's the nature of those players though, so I have no real concerns with it.

What's pleasing is that without Falcao, Rooney and Di Maria underperforming I still thought we put in a good performance and looked a threat. Januzaj stepped up this week and definitely gave us some of the drive that we've been relying purely on Di Maria for.

2240~~~
It's completely obvious. He's so much better and more valuable to us when he plays more centrally and can run at defenders and link play in the middle. Out wide it's been like Nani having a bad day. I know he can do a lot better than he has done in a wide position, he can be great there, but we need his abilities much more in a more central position

2241~~~
Best delivery led to Fellaini's head which eventually resulted in a goal, should have been targeting him all game.

2242~~~
It was probably his poorest game for us this season yet he still played a part in the equalizer. I'd happily have that.

It looked like he was labouring, probably felt the thigh strain accompanied with the fact that he is still getting the feel of the premiership. Was this not his first time going a full 90 minutes for us this season?

2243~~~
Needs to be involved more centrally. He's very much one footed so when he runs down a flank, you know where he's going to go and you can narrow the angle. Put him in the middle and he's got more green to run at and isn't as tightly marked.

2244~~~
Yep, shame because on song today we could have done them.

2245~~~
I don't know why Van Gaal keeps playing him as a winger, he is amazing as a roaming midfielder and very inconsistent as a pure winger, and that's what I heard from most Madrid fans. Let's just hope Van Gaal sticks him into midfield against C$ty.

2246~~~
I really don't think its a coincidence that his worst two performances have come in the games he's out on the wing.

Put him centrally and build the team around him.

2247~~~
He should have been on the left all game.

Should not be moved around to accommodate Januzaj at all

2248~~~
Had an off day. Surprisingly it looked like he was lacking confidence, which is quite understandable when you look at the players we were missing going into the game. Hope he gets sharper and be ready for the Derby.

2249~~~
Was bad against West Ham and today. Didn't watch the WBA game so no idea about that one. Apart from those he has been fantastic.

Edit: Remembered it wrong.

2250~~~
Huh? He was amazing against Everton.

The only bad games he had was against WBA and this one, but that's because he has been played on the wing.

2251~~~
He is inconsistent out wide.

Always been more.

2252~~~
Not nearly as effective when played on the wing. He's much more dynamic when playing in midfield.

2253~~~
It was West Ham I was thinking of. Had to go back to check in this thread.

2254~~~
Really annoying that in other games Di Maria was putting in lovely crosses and there was no one getting on the end of them.Today we had Fellaini in the boxand Di Maria couldn't get a ball near him.The one time he did, we score a goal.

One of these days we're going to put it all together.Good luck to the unfortunate team up against us then.

2255~~~
This is true. Di Maria isn't one of the best players in the world when playing out wide. He never was at Madrid either. As for the hybrid position, well we know exactly how good he is there. Like you say, we need to build around him in that role.

Great cross for the goal, though.

2256~~~
This performance was a very Nani-esque at his worst performance but like most top players do, he made a telling contribution at the end.

2257~~~
He was played out of position today, just like Januzaj was on Monday, neither can play from the right, only way to fit both in would be to play Di Maria as part of the midfield 3 in a 4-3-3

2258~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OhLFWHLTght/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2259~~~
Not his day.

2260~~~
Disappointing, but he's only got City next time to make up for it.

2261~~~
Needs to play more in the middle. Also please take him off set pieces, at least when Rooney is back. Still, we can't expect him to be a world beater every week.

2262~~~
He had a poor game BUT played the full 90 for the first time and provided what was essentially the assist for the goal. One moment of quality is sometimes all you need in these games.

2263~~~
Maybe not 100% fit. I surely prefer him in a midfield 3 though

2264~~~
He's going to have to get used to playing out wide and he's more than good enough to do that. I can see us using this "play him in the middle" excuse every time he has a bad game. We can't play him in the middle in big games because we need more defensively. I don't think it's any coincidence we've looked better defensively ever since we moved him out wide.

2265~~~
Yeah, I agree we'll see this excuse thrown about a lot. He can be very effective from wide areas, so for me there is no issue with just branding it as an off day. His move the the wing has made us a bit more solid defensively and is slowly taking the defensive strain off Blind.

He was decent against West Brom, put in countless great crosses. Today he was just completely off his game with poor touches and panic passing. Not sure if he's 100% fit and how much the Chelsea athleticism had an impact. Sure he would probably play better in that midfield role (where he often drifts outwide anyway) but that is such an easy excuse. This isn't Kagawa, this is a top 10 player in the world.

2266~~~
Poor today in terms of his actual delivery, but it's positive that even in a poor game he's still getting involved as much, and also that he's doesn't do a Valencia and revert to a limited core of entirely pointless repetitive manoevres.  He still expects to be able to do whatever he likes, and this is a good thing.

2267~~~
Agree 100%

2268~~~
Shit happens.

I remember in the CL final in 99, becks had a shocker and his deliveries were generally awful. He ended up playing the 2 corners that turned the game around...

2269~~~
He's never been as effective from wide areas as he is centrally. That's where he's at his best so why on earth would we push our best player into a position where he's simply not as good? If we need more defesively then someone else should be sacrificed. Besides, I don't think he's all that much of a liability defensively anyway given his massive work rate.

2270~~~
Madrid didn't suffer defensively with Di Maria in the middle.

2271~~~
Wish he'd cut down his shots a bit though. The goals he's scored seem to make him think he can score from just about anywhere and that shows in some of his attempts.

2272~~~
At least 3 of those wayward shots have resulted in goals anyway though

2273~~~
It obviously wasn't his best game but he didn't go hiding and was still screaming for the ball near the end. He's definitely wasted on the wings though.

2274~~~
terrible stuff from him

2275~~~
Much prefer him on the left of the diamond. That system showed promise and it gets our best players in their best roles.

Di Maria's best form at Madrid came in that hybrid central role and he carried that into his early performances with us. You aren't getting the best out of Di Maria on the wing, whereas as an offensive central midfielder he's as good as they come.

2276~~~
He's always been effective wherever he plays, his actual productivity is quite consistent season after season. He offers less to the team in wide areas but it doesn't necessarily make him less effective. 

It's an odd one overall though because when he plays centrally he manages to get himself outwide quite often anyway.

2277~~~
Like I said after West Brom, he needs a more central starting position. It should be obvious to any and all people how much his impact is reduced when you shunt him out wide. He thrives when picking up the ball deeper and more centrally, launching our counter attacks and catching the opponents on the back foot.

I'm not saying he's not a good player out wide, but you lose such an important aspect of his game that it's like buying a Ferrari and never going out of second gear. Sure, you still own a Ferrari, but why on earth would you do that?

2278~~~
Not very good today but I see people saying we can't play him centrally in the big games, really? People don't think he could have played the role Mata played today in the midfield 3?

2279~~~
Won the game with the delivery, but he was crap and he has to start using his fullback more. He is trying too hard and is trying to do everything on his own.

I don't get why Mata isn't taking the corners? He's good at them and ADM is more likely to win one than him.

2280~~~
Yup. I don't agree with that argument.

2281~~~
I want him on the ball as much as possible, it is a joy to watch him in the midfield...i hope LVG hasn't decided the physicality of the premiership is too much for Di Maria and moved him wide to lighten his workload.

But with the run of games United are on it is probably not such a bad thing, but i hope he moves back inside after the City game.

2282~~~
It's not so much him specifically, it's the overall system. If we play him in the middle as part of a 3, then we either play 3 strikers or 2 and Mata behind. Unless Herrera plays as a 10. Either way, it's 2 strikers up top so that's always a more open system. Madrid had Ronaldo and Bale on the wings, and then Modric and Alonso next to Di Maria... You couldn't really hand pick better players for that system.

2283~~~
Don't like our new approach with him on the wings. He's half the player there.

2284~~~
I think he will do well at the head of a midfield trio but then we have no wingers and have too many strikers that must always start, by the looks of things. But even if he starts on the left we shouldn't confine him on the wing, he is good enough to drift inwards and fo his thing.

2285~~~
I think that it's more due to Rooney and Herrera absences, they are our engine, Di Maria is "only" the spark.
Di Maria is a better CM, he has been discovered with Benfica playing there but he is also very good on the wing.
And i will add that Di Maria is frustrating because of this kind of average games that he always had, no matter is position.

2286~~~
I thought starting him on the right was a mistake. All of our best passages of play were coming down the left and I think if he was there he would have created more than Januzaj did if he was on that side to begin with. LvG realised and played him on the left in the second half where he was more involved and had a better spell. I think he needs to do what Ronaldo was allowed to do and basically roam around and find the vulnerability in the opposition defence. Out other players like Rooney, Herrera and Januzaj are all intelligent enough to occupy whatever space he vacates.

2287~~~
Just because that's what we've done so far when AdM has played more centrally, it's not a prerequisite for doing so. The main thing for him to get that hybrid role he thrives so much in is that the space out left is open for him to drive into. Another option of not having a wide man, is playing the same system as we did today, but with a left winger who's capable of drifting inside to open up the space for Di Maria. This was obviously how Real Madrid did it, with Ronaldo moving in when attacking.

Today we could have easily put Mata out wide instead, and had Di Maria as a part of the midfield three instead. In fact, I'm a bit nonplussed as to why we didn't try it, because I think it would have gotten more out of both Mata and Di Maria. The former is more effective in and around the box, whereas Di Maria is more effective with a deeper and more central starting position, compared to where they started today.

I'm sure LVG has his reasons though.

Edit: This is obviously ignoring the fact that he started on the right, and not on the left. Januzaj would have to be shifted to the right wing from the get go for this to be an option, which could obviously be one of the reasons why we didn't do it.

2288~~~
Good that we can still create chances and take points off a team like Chelsea with him playing poorly and both Rooney and Falcao out.

2289~~~
Poor from him today . But it happens.

2290~~~
If we got a top winger then could he not play behind the striker? As he does seem better in midfield.

2291~~~
More effective dribbling from midfield than marooned out wide. I always thought, good as he was as a winger, Di Maria blossomed as part of Madrid's three man centre midfield. His last two seasons were definitely the best of his career. Really feel he'd be better served by United going back to the diamond. He doesn't seem to enjoy being shown down the line. Against, West Brom and Chelsea he hasn't really clicked into gear like when he was regularly getting inside e.g. for his goals against Leicester and Everton.

2292~~~
I think it will be too restrictive for Angel to play as a N10, he plays perfectly as a roaming midfielder who can drift wide or play through the center. He was just too inconsistent even at Madrid on the wings, but he was an absolute beast in center midfield.

2293~~~
With Rooney back and possibly Falcao next week, I imagine he'll go back to playing in midfield and hopefully will increase his influence amongst the side.

2294~~~
I concur with those calling for Di Maria to play more central.

2295~~~
Hopefully we sign Reus next summer, having him on the left, januzaj right and di maria part of a midfield 3 could be amazing, potentially.

2296~~~

2297~~~
I agree he's best in the middle but in the 4-3-3 system it's hard to see him there.

2298~~~
Not a snowball's chance in hell that RVP is getting dropped after playing a very decent first half, and getting the equalizer at the death today, and rightly so. Barring any injuries (fat chance) it will most likely be your second line-up, but with Fellaini in Herrera's spot.

2299~~~
Poor performance from him today, must have posted some pretty terrible stats.

2300~~~
Quite right too. I've been a big critic of RvP's invisible performances this season, but today he actually rose to the occasion and was physically superior to Terry and Cahill on numerous occasions. And then THAT equaliser.

He deserves to start against City.

From the looks of things Falcao hasn't really turned up fit despite passing his medical and can't be relied on at this point.

I'd like to see RvP up top on his own against City with Rooney supporting him.

2301~~~
Can't be our best player every game. His crossing wasn't great (except the fk for the goal) and his running, just looked a little lethargic.

2302~~~
I hope he tears City a new one. Rubbish today, but i'm pinning my hopes on him taking points of them. Utd are due a win as well.

2303~~~
Not been the same player since that ludicrous friendly in smoggy Beijing.

2304~~~
Not a great game by his standards but nothing to worry about.

He is our best player, so we need him in the middle on the ball, I understand that he can do quite well out there but you want your best players on the ball as much as possible.

2305~~~
Terrible performance, just one of those which you will get from him on the right wing every now and then. Nothing to worry about though, a lesson for van Gaal I guess. 

Needs to start his runs from the left midfield and he will be rocking again.

2306~~~
Not his best game but you've got to cut him some slack he's been exceptional so far.

2307~~~
Not his best game today but the main thing is that he doesn't hide.

2308~~~
Yeah wasn't very good but oh well. He won't be brilliant every game. Hopefully he is better against City though.

2309~~~
The thing with playing him out wide is that you lose two of the best things that he brings to the team..

a) His ability to bring the ball through the middle, from deep, with pace pace and purpose. We've missed some proper drive through the middle for years now (probably since Anderson's heyday about 5 years ago)

b) His vision and passing. Something that I didn't realise was so good until we signed him. He's constantly seeing things, and picking out passes that no one else would see, never mind pull off.

With him stuck on the wing, he just can't get into the game as much as we need, and he's far easier to nullify. The few times he did pick the ball in a central position and run at Chelsea, were the few times they shit themselves. I really hope he's central against City.

2310~~~
He really dropped in confidence it seemed because he was just waiting for a pass to Shaw to happen there toward the end. When he did try to make a run he gave the ball up.  Course, in hindsight I think he was double teamed quite a bit and didn't have anywhere to go.  I also think he may be at his best when he is in the center of the pitch.  I have to say...it will be quite nice when we can put out a full strength squad...whoever that may be in the end.  I'm really missing Falcao not playing.

2311~~~
Thats another thing actually, he's much easier to double up on when he's on the wing. In the middle he's a lot more unpredictable and harder to handle. 

I think it was one of the Madrid fans (possibly <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> ?) who said that Di Maria as a winger wasn't world class, but once Ancelotti moved him centrally, thats when he became world class.

2312~~~
Not a great game today but I'm not worried; even when he has looked far from his best today he still had the most key passes out of all the players and was involved in the equalizer.

2313~~~
Very poor today. Need much better performances from him in big games. Both Di Maria and Januzaj should have done better than what they delivered. When we play with 1 striker, we cannot have the wingers hugging the touchline so much. They need to do what Hazard and Willian do, play in the gap between the full backs and the central defenders.

2314~~~
Januzaj did that really well, can't complain at all about him IMO. Di maria had an off day but I wouldn't be worried, he's normally excellent in big games, mourinho and Chelsea just nullified him today.

2315~~~
It was most probably <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> or <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> who said this as I didn't see much difference. Half of the time I don't even know a player's position and other obvious stuff though... I'm not the best go to guy for an analysis.

2316~~~
Cheers for the honesty Vato <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2317~~~
Probably his worst game in a United shirt today. Though that isn't exactly hard considering how good he has been so far. Things just didn't seem to work for him at all unfortunately. I prefer him more centrally, or at least with a greater licence/ability to roam inwards than he had today. Hopefully he is back to his best against City.

2318~~~
thought the same during the game.

2319~~~
Depends on how you look at it, he was still producing loads of chances and assists, but was more inconsistent and erratic. I'd personally still call him world class as a winger, but for Real Madrid (and before that Benfica as well) and Argentina he was/is at his most influential and instrumental (Copa, CL, Arg's best or 2nd best player in WCQ) in that LCM role.

2320~~~
As a winger, i don't think he ever reached the levels Ribery or robben have. He was always a tad too inconsistent. As a midfielder he's absolutely brilliant, though. And I think wen(and he) lose something when he's out wide. For one, our threat of being able to go cut teams open through the Middle goes.

Also, I think we haven't utilised his pressing abilities yet. I hope he doesn't lose that. For me that's as much what makes him a special player and we haven't seen it much so far. I hope he doesn't turn into a pure attacker here.

2321~~~
Was he crap because he played as a winger as opposed being on the left side of the diamond? I dont think so because yesterday he simply lost the ball (more than usual) couldnt complete his dribbles and overall his touch was poor. Not sure if those factors are related to his position.

2322~~~
They are imo. He's played a lot better having more movement and options around him as opposed to being confined with the touchline to his back.

2323~~~
Van Gaal obviously thinks Mata at 10 leaves us very exposed through the middle. Will probably see the diamond again (and Di Maria at his best) when Rooney's back.

Mind you, I do agree that it's a bit too simplistic to blame his position alone for his recent form. He's just having a wee dip. Probably would have been below par centrally too.

2324~~~
They're not. This is also Di Maria, the one I've been watching for years in Madrid. You just didn't see him until yesterday. He goes from incredible to incredibly bad in one game (few posters have mentioned that during the transfer discussions), and when he goes to shit he just loses balls one after another for the whole game.
He played best football of his life from February until few weeks ago, and his run of good form never lasted that long. He was due a dip in form. He'll be back...

2325~~~
Just had a bad game I think. Nothing to do with the position although I'd rather see him at CM.

2326~~~
Still think he's better when coming from deeper but yesterday was just a bad day

2327~~~
Think the fans chanting his name is going to his head. tried to many flashy dribbles and shots from random areas. I can remember the first volley which Mata had played to him in the 4th min or so, completely unnecessary. He could have easily taken one extra touch and placed it for a goal. One more volley from outside the box which went closer to the corner flag than the goal. There was no chelsea player in front of him, Could have taken two extra touches and shot. One time he tried nutmegging Fabregas(?) just outside the box and lost the ball. Few more crucial mistakes which cost us possession. Just a bad day at the office for him. This is the second or third game where LvG has played him on the wing and he looked subdued. He was insanely good in a 3-Man-Midfield. We need that formation back.

2328~~~
I think his dip in form may have psychological roots. Watching Madrid doing so well without him may be not particulraly pleasing and confidence boosting...

2329~~~
I honestly think ADM is better when given a bit of freedom to roam and influence the game in the same way Rooney does. He picked up the ball loads on the left side last night and his touch in the second half ranged from brilliant to awful. The good news at least though is that with his pace and desire he will win lots of fouls. Had any of our other wingers been on that side and relcutant to beat a man we wouldn't have seen the move that led to the Red and resulting goal. The ball would have been knocked back to Shaw/Blind and recycled with no end product.

We don't play Chelsea every week. Get City out of the way and I think we are going to do Hull and Arsenal.

2330~~~
We're blaming his position? The guy is a natural winger. He's played CM for one season, and he was basically a half-winger in that season. Nonsense.

2331~~~
Agree with this. Nothing he did wrong yesterday related to his position.

2332~~~
He was poor yesterday because sometimes ADM blows hot and cold. Many people said this when we signed him that he has a fair few off days, which is normal for players like this.

2333~~~
ADM is human after all.

2334~~~
More to the point, when he plays in CM he naturally moves out to the left. Often when playing in CM he';s whipping in crosses from the left flank.

2335~~~
Basically yea, this.

2336~~~
He has been carrying us this season, so it's encouraging we had our best game this season when he wasn't at his best, if we can play like that every week and ADM plays like he has been we will get into the top 4.

2337~~~
I didn't even think he was too bad. Considering we were playing Chelsea.

2338~~~
I do blame his position. I could see it coming when I first saw him wide right. Offered nothing, losing ball after ball and not linking well with Rafael. You just know he will always cut on his left foot, if he’s double marked it leaves him much less space and he won’t use his speed to move away from the marker and cross with his right. He just doesn’t do that.

He was the same at Madrid, of course he did well at times against poor opposition but I still maintain it’s his worst position.

You could see a big improvement from him on the left hand side, couldn’t you?  

LCM>LW>>>RW

2339~~~
Lost count of how many times he gave the ball away yesterday, and until the very last minute his delivery into the box had been poor all game.

Realisation that he can't be scintillating in every game. Good to see other players stepping up to fill the void, though - Adnan looked impressive.

Also nice to see Di Maria last the full 90 minutes. Now expecting more from him against City.

2340~~~
This. 

Even though it was a friendly, we saw how devastating he can be on the right wing not so long ago vs Germany.

2341~~~
You could say the same thing about Robben and he manages to make it work alright. They have very much the same skillset, ADM and Robben, so there's no logic that says he shouldn't be able to perform on the right wing. It just requires more pace and movement than we had yesterday.

Though I do agree that he's better on the left than on the right. I was reacting to posts saying he shouldn't play on the wing because he's a midfielder. Basically, I disagree with this.

He just had a poor game. It happens.

2342~~~
Robben argument is obvious I guess, but he plays for much better team than us at the moment, and it’s not a given he would do much good against this Chelsea side. They did very well to keep him out of that game, but I’m sure he would do much better from the left.

I do think he’s more effective when coming from the deep, he’s more consistent in that role, that’s why I rate him higher as a midfielder than a winger (although he’s probably something in between to be precise).

2343~~~
It is true, he was a very very good winger, but a world class CM. We need to play him where he has been at his best. There is a reason why his best season at RM was at CM.

2344~~~
The reason he was at his best was that it was an extremely specialized position. He was a half-winger. You had Ronaldo starting on the left wing but constantly drifting in looking for goal opportunities, which created space for Di Maria to take that long raid down the left. Not unlike an overlapping full-back. He may have started in midfield but the danger he created was from the left-wing.

However, we don't have that Ronaldo type of player to drift in from the left. In fact, we don't have a left-winger at all so that space isn't created for Di Maria to take that long trip down the left. In theory, it shouldn't work as well for him in our 4-4-2 diamond. Plus, he has had plenty of outstanding games for both Argentina and Real as an out-and-out winger. That <i>is </i>his natural position.

2345~~~
Yeah, he just wasn't at his best yesterday, nothing really to do with his position imo and everone knows that he can be a strong winger too. That said, I also want to see him in the 3-man midfield, it's his best role for us.

2346~~~
He has had good games as a winger, I never denied that. Your theory about Ronaldo is interesting and naturally having a player like him make space makes life easier for everyone else - the same was the case for Liverpool last year.

However, Di Maria works much better centrally as he can use those dribbling skills up against midfielders or centre backs and still has options to pass. On the wings he will always be doubled up upon and will almost always be stopped in his tracks as the shut out all space. In the middle, he has passing options around him which enable him to either do a 1-2 or to use the passing options to beat a man. Either way, him playing on the wing vs. Chelsea was never going to be insanely successful as they have some of the best fullbacks in the league and have wingers who do a stupid amount of work defensively, so Di Maria was always going to be up against it.

I have no doubt that LVG bought him to play at CM, and it is not a coincidence that the best year of his career and when he had the largest impact was when he was able to dribble and pass through the middle. Being played out-wide is no excuse for his lacklustre performance, poor passing and for giving the ball away a lot yesterday though.

2347~~~
Gone off the boil a bit in the last couple of games. I dont imagine he's the sort of character to be getting carried away with the adulation he's been receiving. Hope not anyway. A few good game doesnt a legend make. TOP top quality player, but has to deliver it consistently over the season (and pretty sure he will)

2348~~~

2349~~~
His worst game in a United shirt, but that's not much of a criticism. I'm happy if he's still producing crosses like that when he isn't in form.

2350~~~
5 key passes sounds absurdly high?

His role in the team seems to be of the one who takes risks. Not many others would really. We've got a  fair few safe passers in our team.

2351~~~
I think this was important for us. Important that the burden of responsibility is shared. The likes of Van Persie, Fellaini, Januzaj all stood up yesterday when it counted. We can't be so reliant on one player.

2352~~~
He seemed to want to impress really badly yesterday but failed to realise that the Chelsea defence is a whole other proposition to QPR or West Brom. Still seemed dangerous on the ball, got Ivanovic sent off and whipped in the ball that lead to our goal so not all bad. He will learn and do better next time.

2353~~~
Dunno if it was posted already but does anyone think he shouldn't be taking corners? I actually think he's hopeless at them, if he's not finding his target he's giving it straight into the keepers hands.

2354~~~
I won't dispute too much of your post because I don't think we disagree that much in truth, but going by the logic in this highlighted part, you could say that about any winger in the world. Di Maria's skillset <i>is </i>a winger's skillset, pace, dribbling skills and good crossing, so if he isn't suited for a wide spot, who is?

That might be true but whether that's because he considers it his best position or whether it simply has to do with our midfield being a weak spot, I'm not sure. I certainly don't think he's opposed to playing him on the wing regularly, as we've seen in the last few games.

I'd like to clarify that I'm not saying we shouldn't play him in central midfield, just that he's perfectly capable of being a world-class player in both positions. He's proven already for us, as well as for Madrid and Argentina, that he can be amazing in midfield. In fact, when rumours of our interest started surfacing in the summer, I was one of the few people who said that he could easily play CM for us. Almost everyone else opposed that idea, insisting that he was a winger and only a winger. Opinions really do change quickly.

2355~~~
His worst game for us, but still created more chances then anyone else on the pitch! 

I think his carrying a injury so that's a big factor. Hope he shines against citeh...

2356~~~
Everyone seems to forget this. He has had a thigh strain for a couple of weeks now. I think he will be rested for crystal palace once Rooney,valencia,falcao and carrick are all back.

2357~~~
Just to add to that, there are more differences with a more central starting position as well. For me, the most important is that because he can pick up the ball much deeper he will far more often come up against a line of defense that's not in balance, and because he is able to bring the ball forward so quickly and effectively it causes all sorts of problems for the opposition who will generally have to reorganize on the fly as their first line of defense is bypassed.

Contrast that to when he's played out wide. In those situations he will generally receive the ball higher up on the pitch and further out wide, but more importantly, he will be receiving the ball in a situation where he's almost always coming up against a balanced defensive line. At best, a one on one against the full back who's very prepared for that situation, or even a wide midfielder / winger tracking back. In comparison, when he's played more centrally this season, he is usually getting the ball deeper, and dribbles / outruns the opposition's midfield with it. That means their defenders have to make a choice of who should step forward to press him, and who should stand off. This immediately causes unease for the defense as a whole, and much more so than compared to when an orthodox winger receives it out wide.

As someone said, this could of course be applied to all wingers. Well yes, in theory you'd want players who have pace and can dribble centrally, but the reason that it works especially well with Di Maria is because he is tenacious and has a very high work rate, and is good at picking up the ball in the right positions. Call it a combination of tactical awareness and physical capability that is necessary to play centrally. As a result, the positives outweigh the negatives that you usually would get from putting a typical winger more centrally.

If we had one or more midfielders other than Di Maria who had close to his ability of driving with the ball in midfield, I would be all for having him out wide. But because we don't, we lose a dimension in our attacking play by placing him there.

So I just want to make it clear that I am not saying Angel Di Maria is any less of a footballer if he plays out wide. But because of the composition of our squad, his impact will be lesser when he does. Ideally we should have had two of him, one to play out wide and one to play more centrally.

I'm also a hundred percent certain that LvG knows all of this, but has decided to play him out wide the past two games anyways for one reason or another. Yesterday I think the main reason was that he wanted to have Fellaini in that slightly left central midfielder role to do a job on Fabregas, and it worked quite well.

2358~~~
After years of watching him play, I believe that his best position on the pitch is left CM in a 3 man midfield, with right footed winger (who likes to cut in) on the left wing. It's the perfect combo for Di Maria and brings the best out of him.

2359~~~
Are you guys aware that putting him in midfield represented a huge risk for Real Madrid defending wise? Everytime he played on that position Real Madrid was always in the danger of conceding a goal.

Right now is not the best time to try him on that position.

2360~~~
In an attacking midfield role? He might be more attack than defensively minded, but we're not going to risk conceding a goal anymore than we are at the moment. He's our best player, and we have to try and use him to full effect.

2361~~~
Real Madrid always looked in extremis with him on that role, he brings unbalance to the team when playing as a central midfielder.

2362~~~
Yeah, but I think most are suggesting he should play a more advanced, attacking midfield role.

2363~~~
Lets get one thing straight...
He was not crap or anywhere near crap. He played fine in general play, defending, simple passes and such like things. It was when he tried his little bit of magic or what he gets the big bucks for, if you prefer. It didn't work out for him. And its was well below the form we have seen from him in all the previous games. I have suggested on another thread that it was just one of those games for Di Maria. Happens from time to time to ALL players. Not a major cause for concern or anything like it... Little backing and all will be back as it was by Sunday.

2364~~~
Last two games he hasn't been particularly impressive. Seems ineffectual in a wide role.

2365~~~
Oh he was crap, there's nothing wrong in admitting it. It's just there are obvious reasons why it went so bad, and it's not a cause for concern at all.

2366~~~
He was nowhere near his best, but he wasn't crap. He created loads of chances still and put in plenty of dangerous crosses. The stuff we saw last season, that was crap. For his very high standards he was poor, and his set pieces were poor, but general play he still got on the ball a lot and ran at defenders, drew fouls, and put in dangerous crosses.

2367~~~
Its not all about the flash. Did the bread and butter stuff really well. Just bad by his own high standards. Show me any mistake he made where it cost us yesterday? 

Yep I'd agree with this in the main.

2368~~~
Second half he was definitely crap. Aside from the ball for the equaliser I can't remember a time where he didn't give the ball away in the second half.

If Rojo wasn't a car crash he would've been our worst player on the night.

2369~~~
Thought he had a down day relative to his previous performances. Could be related to a combination of a slight knock and a bit of exhaustion after his travels. He will no doubt be back to terrorizing the opposition shortly.

2370~~~
I think we are better both attacking and defending wise with current formation than we were with the diamond, altough diamond probably suited di Maria more. I would stick with current formation and just try di Maria in different positions to see which suits him more or just give him more freedom in his wide role and play more defensive oriented players in midfield. With Rooney and Herrera back we'll probably be much better defending wise anyway.

2371~~~
Also, thought Willian did a pretty fecking good job marking him. No doubt an astute tactical move by Mourinho given his knowledge of Di Maria.

2372~~~
Brilliant player though just wished he'd stop some of his Roy of the Rover attempts on goal when other stuff on.

2373~~~
Yesterday's game was never going to be easy for our wingers. Di Maria started the game on the right wing as an inside forward and swapped positions with Januzaj at some point in the game. Well, Luis and Ivanovic aren't exactly the FBs you can dribble with ease, the strongest aspect of their game is that they are excellent in 1v1 situations. If you add to that the fact that Willian and Hazard kept Shaw and Rafael from making many runs forward you will understand why both Januzaj and Di Maria didn't have the best of games. Nevertheless, i think Di Maria worked very hard on the pitch and won enough corners and fouls in dangerous areas. I know it's not much but it's good enough considering that we didn't have many ways to get the ball into Chelsea's box.

2374~~~
True that's why they were perfect with to tremendous balanced player like Alonso and Modric. And the fact that CR7 goes always through the middle makes easier for ADM to play wide. 4-3-3 defensively and 4-4-2 offensively with Angel changing position

I think that unless we have one top CM this January, or this summer, ADM should play (the big games) on a wing, because his offensive potential would be better suited than his capacity to run after the ball. The team is still not balanced enough to play him inside.

And the biggest problem would be who will play on the wing if not him ?

2375~~~
I remember him being dispossessed a few times, there were no consequences but that’s not the point is it? That’s the kind of performance Nani would be criticized for, to be fair. Anyway I don’t think we should be discussing how crap or not he was so let’s leave it here. We won’t see a display like that from him for a long time I’m sure.

2376~~~

2377~~~
Bacca won the award for the best South American player last season over Di Maria. What the heck?

2378~~~
Something to chew on.

2379~~~
Can we change our corner kick taker, cos our current one delivery of the corner has been absolutely dreadful

2380~~~
Can't remember the last time we had a consistently decent delivery from corners. Not even good, just decent.

2381~~~
van Persie a couple of seasons ago? Rooney also takes good corners. We should have RVP take the corners again, it's not as if he is scoring many headers from the corners.

2382~~~
I personally prefer it, Ronaldo used to do the same and so did Nani (when he was on form). These players bring a level of unpredictablilty which distabalises the opposition defence, as quite frankly they don't know what to expect. That unpredictablilty has been lacking from our side for a few years and thats one of the reasons we have been so easy to defend against.

2383~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3EGiWMbRYmQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Valencia should take them.

2384~~~
Di Maria is great at taking various free kicks, but he's awful at corner.


I thought that Robin and Wazza should take it, and maybe Mata when he plays


Overall, I thought that he didn't played well on the wing the last two games. He was for sure surrounded by 3 players but he should have done better.


It will be important, vastly, hugely important that he's on top Sunday at City. The team will defend deep and we'll need his pace and his passing ability to do the job.


Don't blame me for the comparison, but 2 years ago we went to City with Young and Valencia down the wing. Valencia had his job on the right but behind Zabaleta's back, Young did a terrific job going forward and coming close to RVP when Wazza played deep.


I think that we should use that way to play, and Angel should be at his top in a big game

2385~~~
Put him back in CM please!!!!

2386~~~
I thought he was wasteful with some of his cross but I think the way we let the cm's push up bar blind/carrick really doesn't help our wingers at all (been a problem for a few seasons imo). The ball gets worked out wide when there's still a fair distance to go and then everyone piles in to the box looking for an aerial cross which if we're honest we're not prime candidates to win. Where as if the midfielder stayed a bit deeper it would draw one of the opposition away from Di Maria/Januzaj and let them advance more easier as well as making it simpler to play a one two to actually get closer to the box.

2387~~~
Nobody's any good at taking corners. The best one we've had recently is van Persie, but he needs to be in the box.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29634200" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29634200</a>

2388~~~
The only consistent element in all the United corner-takers I've ever watched is that people complain about them.

2389~~~
P-p-p-p-please!!

2390~~~
Robin took some mean corners, didn't he? I remember his deliveries being better than we've had for a while. We scored from a good number of them when we last won the league.

2391~~~
The usual pattern is their first few corners look amazing and we all go "Finally! Someone who takes a decent corner!" then it's all downhill from there.

Basically, exactly what happened/is happening with Di Maria.

2392~~~
Corners are one of those things where you remember your own side's wasted ones but only ever see any other side's successful ones. Unless your team specialise in scoring from them, they're always going to be predominantly frustrating. We've never been a big side in my lifetime, and the peak Ronaldo+Vidic years were the only time I can personally remember that we've been a consistent threat from corners.

So our corner-takers often look shit because the usual whipped ball aimed somewhere in front of either the front or back posts just won't be much good when the defenders are all bigger than you. So we seem to end up taking a lot of 'clever' corners, i.e. whipped in low for someone at the front post to flick on, or lofted long for someone beyond the back post to nod back into the danger area. Personally I'd rather we just kept it simple with the normal percentage deliveries, but it happens so often that it must be a deliberate strategy.

Anyway as I say, if you don't have lots of big guys in your side, there's not that much the corner-taker can do with it. When we play Fellaini things change a bit, because he's one of those rare one-man set-piece threats. But without him we just have to sit through all those pointless corners and score from open play instead.

2393~~~
You have a short memory then. Van Persie's delievery was exceptional when he was our first choice set piece taker. I still think he should be taking our corners.

2394~~~
Your username, that joke... That opportunity must be rarer than a solar eclipse.

2395~~~
That's not true at all, his defensive workrate for Real was excellent and we played a midfield 3 against Chelsea pretty successfully that contained Mata, a player much less defensively suited than Di Maria.

2396~~~
I agree. Di Maria will be wherever you need him to be. He's a bit wiry, but when he's defending, he has a knack of wriggling away from opponents with the ball.

2397~~~
I have a serious drug problem.

No but yeah, I forgot RVP. My bad.

2398~~~
5 key passes on an 'off day' is pretty good. 

I think RvP and Rooney (alternating) are our best corner takers. Di Maria's are a bit more miss than hit.

2399~~~
We don't have many tall players and he is one of the few who is over 6 foot. No matter how good a corner delivery is, height is important hence why RVP has to be in there. If we had more presence, particularly from midfielders able to attack corners, then sure he probably should be on corner duty.

2400~~~
We should work some cool training ground routines for our corners. Besides from Fellaini, there's nobody else to aim at.

2401~~~
It was getting-your-coat-handed-to-you stuff, but at the same time a once in a life time opportunity. I'm just glad someone picked up on it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2402~~~
sorry but that performance was borderline worst player on the field

2403~~~
Sell him.

2404~~~
You can't seriously believe that though? First you have to look at the role of Januzaj and ADM, then you see that they were supposed to hug the side line and that is how LVG nearly always sets out his wingers. It isn't very entertaining at all and usually has its victims(Ribery/Januzaj/ADM) but to say he was <b>that</b> bad is a bit ridiculous. ADM had tied most successful dribbles in the game with Hazard at eleven(According to the Chalkboard at whoscored). 

The difference is that 8 out of 11 dribbles for Hazard were made in the centre of the pitch, where being capable of going on either side of your opponent makes a successful dribble much easier. ADM only had 3 out of 11 successful dribbles, centrally which shows that he was restricted to a "out and out-winger" role. 

According to the "old" statistics on Whoscored, ADM had 3 successful dribbles out of Uniteds total of 5 and Hazard 7 out of Chelsea's 15. To that ADM had 5 key passes, as many as Cesch, Hazard and Oscar together.  Januzaj and Mata had 3 each, which put them on shared second place in that regard in the match as the fourth best was Hazard/Cesc/Drogba/Rafael on 2.

Claiming he was the worst on the pitch is just stupid I hope you realize that yourself. It is hard to see someone you expect to dominate the game, be quite invisible and just part of the team but factually he was definitely not the worst on the pitch kind of bad.

2405~~~
Well according to those "statistics" how many times did he lose the ball? I also said he was "borderline" worst player on the field not outright worst player on the field. If not him, then which other player was he better than by a considerable margin? keep in mind this is only accounting for our players, not Chelsea's. I like him, criticism must be consistent and without bias. If that was Young, Nani or even Valencia they would be getting slaughtered.

2406~~~
Dispossessed once and had one unsuccessful touch with lead to losing the ball. So two times over the course of a game which is actually quite good. The same amount as Januzaj who was said to play it really safe and smart. One less than Rafael, Fellaini and RVP. 

Hazard lost the ball 9 times during the game to put it in perspective.

2407~~~
Now now, no need to twist facts to make things seem better than they are. We all know there are many ways to lose the ball than from "being dispossessed" or "having an unsuccessful touch." Like I said it is important to stay consistent without bias when judging players. Let's just say if you watched the match, "claiming he [only lost the ball two times] is just stupid, I hope you realize that yourself."

To put it in perspective,

RVP lost it 3 times
Fellaini lost it 8 times
Rafael lost it around 9-10 times
Januzaj lost it around 11-14 times
As for Di Maria ... well you can see for yourself <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755385/player-stats/46497/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...er-stats/46497/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

2408~~~
Yes he probably was one of our worst players but who cares? He's been our bes player so far this season and Sunday was his first poor game.

2409~~~
He was still decent on Sunday, it's just because people are used to him playing at an insane level for us that this discussion even comes up.

2410~~~
You asked for statistics of losing the ball and I provided them. Yours includes missed passes as well, which is the only difference. That is usually spoken about in terms of passing accuracy rather than losing the ball though. He had the second worst passing accuracy for the team, after Januzaj who was the worst but both of them had above 80 percent. It is pretty standard that the striker or wingers has the worst passing percentage though and I'd say both of them had a good percentage for wingers. Hazard, ADM and Januzaj all had roughly the same passing percentage.

Failed dribbles are counted in the "dispossessed" and "unsuccessful touch". They are supposed to depict all kinds of loss of possession, except missed passes of course.

Also I myself considered his performance to be too bad to continue him in that role. But he was average, not worse than so.

2411~~~
They are <i>supposed</i> to depict all kinds of loss of possession you say except they don't. Is it so hard to say that he was "borderline worst player," that losing the ball 25+ times has to be considered "average" now? Like I said at the beginning, can you name one player that was significantly worse than him?

2412~~~
Di Maria will lose more balls playing in midfield then RVP will lose playing in attack. His duels/aerial duels stats are awful and he makes a lot of bad passes in a game. His take on's are below 50% and that is dangerous for a guy playing in midfield.
He can't tackle and his overall defensive contribution is not to be admired.
These are facts, but they're not that relevant, because in the end, he'll make up for all of it with key passes, chances created, assists and goals.

2413~~~
Looking at that 442 graphic, most of those "lost" balls are crosses. Which comes with the territory really.

2414~~~
Passing stats are utterly pointless for wingers as crosses obviously distort them. If Di Maria is regularly putting crosses in of the quality we've seen then I couldn't give a monkeys.

2415~~~
True but the problem with Di Maria is more in his propension to miss easy passes in his own half. 
Di Maria can provoke dangerous turnovers for both teams.

2416~~~
This is why stats are pointless without context.

2417~~~
He's like Giggs in the sense that he'll almost always go for the killer pass or take someone on. That's obviously a risky approach and will obviously backfire every now and then but I don't see the point in worrying about it because that's not going to change. It's who he is and it's what we bought him for, and it's one of the main things our team is lacking. He'll lose the ball carelessly every now and then but he'll also create countless chances.

2418~~~
Stats are boring. A few seasons ago, Joe Allen and Leon Britton had the best passing stats in Europe's top flights. Wigan under Martinez had some of the best possession stats, despite being mostly shit. It's meaningless. There's only one stat that means anything, and that's the score.

I'd rather see daring players lose the ball through the means of invention and creativity, than watch Tom Cleverley have a 90%+ successful pass rate from passing it back to the defence for 90 minutes.

2419~~~
Well, the fact that he is making that many crosses is not good.

2420~~~
Indeed. And Mata is a good example of what happens when a player you need to be creative errs to the opposite extreme. Something like 93% pass completion on average but can only think of one decent chance he's set up all season.

2421~~~
Its what Nani got slaughtered for even when his end product was pretty good in his first few seasons.

Di Maria is obviously a better player than Nani ever was, but that shouldnt be an excuse for double standards. Di Maria does mess up at times when he really shouldnt with mishit passes. Its not just the killer balls and crosses, which tend to be very good attempts even when he gets them wrong. He will usually mess up one or two simple straightforward passes with inaccuracy or getting the wrong contact on the ball.

And that goes for Ander too, he's also shown that he will pop up with a poorly executed simple pass now and again as well.

There are plenty of central midfielders who will mess up a simple pass only once in a blue moon, Di Maria and Ander aren't among them

2422~~~
I think it's time to hand over corner kick duties to rvp

2423~~~
Looking at losses of possession is stupid, especially for players like januzaj and di Maria. Those are the players who are supposed to take risks, put in crosses, take players on, make things happen. The fact that has ability to try so many things is a quality in itself. Just like Ronaldo's quality of always getting many of shots off. 

In no way was di Maria poor, let alone the worst player. He wasn't at his very best, but he still caused them endless problems, made quite a few chances with his crossing and was the reason they got so many yellows, and a red in the end, along with playing the vital cross in the end. 

The type of player he is, sometimes he'll have games where things don't come off. The fact that he keeps on going is great though because it's constantly making chances and one of them tends to come off.

2424~~~
Or Mata, who is really wasted in set piece situations otherwise

2425~~~
Needs to have at least an 8/10 game for me if we are to get something from the game. That doesn't necessarily mean assists and goals, it may mean just hugging the touchline and helping shaw out....the finer details of the philosophy which I only see when scrutinised on MNF but whatever...a fine game needed.

2426~~~
Yeh he's so bad at corners. Defo needs to be given to mata.

2427~~~
Need a big game from him on sunday, he could dominate the match with Silva out.

2428~~~
I was coming to say the same thing but, with our lack of good headers of the ball we need RVP. But, someone other than Di Maria needs to take corners if he doesn't start putting in better balls soon.

2429~~~
Odd how much he sucks at corners when his crosses are usually fantastic.

2430~~~
Marta's crosses are loopy rubbish.

2431~~~
Might as well have Mata take the corners seeing as he is little use at the end of crosses anyway. Di Maria should be on the edge of the box if anything spills out.

2432~~~
Ah poor City..

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2014/11/01/5683371/pellegrini-ffp-stopped-manchester-city-signing-di-maria?ICID=HP_BN_1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/tran...manchester-city-signing-di-maria?ICID=HP_BN_1</a>

2433~~~
He does look nervy/twitchy in the big games doesn't he?

I remember a few examples of this in the World Cup as well - making bad decisions at odd times.

Just needs to keep it calm on his final ball today.

2434~~~
Couldn't help but notice him making no effort to get back behind the ball a couple of times after the red.

2435~~~
For amount of shit Januzaj gets on here, he gets away based on reputation.

Been poor again this half and has lost possession in some stupid ways.

As was said when we signed him he's not worth 60 million as a wide player certainly.

2436~~~
Two big games and he's hiding again.

2437~~~
Much better player when he plays centrally. Ghost again so far.

2438~~~
He's been poor again today.

Presuming we go for a more counter attack based approach in the second half, he'll have to up his game since he'll be central to that.

2439~~~
He needs to step the feck up and show that he can rise to the top. He needs to sense that this is his moment!

2440~~~
Unlike Januzaj though, Di Maria has already put in numerous superb performances. Not to mention that if the problem is that he's being played wide, that's surely not his own fault?

2441~~~
He was the ultimate big game player for Madrid so it isn't nerves or lack of guts.

2442~~~
He's a proper Utd player in the way he's turned into shit.

2443~~~
Unlike Januzaj he isn't a 19 year old improving player though.

He is a player in his peak whose been bought for 60 million.

2444~~~
He hasnt passed Zabaleta/Kolarov once, and his corners, just terrible.

2445~~~
Second game in a row, very poor. Can't make a cross to save his life...

2446~~~
Dogshite corners

2447~~~
You wont see the best of him when hes stuck out on the wing, we all know that

2448~~~
Put this guy off corner duty. Unacceptable.

2449~~~
Third, was very poor/average vs West Brom too.

2450~~~
Hopeless against Chelsea and City. But he'll probably get an assist next week against Palace and everyone on here will be calling him the best player in the league.

2451~~~
That's nonsense.

2452~~~
It's not. He's far better when played in a more central role.

2453~~~
For the last game and a half he's looked a very average player. If Nani or Zaha put in performances like that they'd certainly be getting slated.

He also has absolutely no capacity to defend

2454~~~
It's true. Absolutely wasted stuck out wide.

2455~~~
He's had plenty of great games at the wing. The guy is a natural winger. Equally good at both positions.

2456~~~
Are you trying to say he isn't a big game player? He's been great against the likes of us (in the CL), Bayern, Atletico, Barca and countless more. He wasn't good in these two big games but it does nothing to his status as an amazing footballer.

2457~~~
Why do so many players' corners turn to shit once they've joined us? Nani's corners used to be brilliant when he first came too for instance

2458~~~
Move him back to where he was so brilliant for us to start the season.

2459~~~
He seems limited whenever he plays on the wing here. I think he'd be much better in a more inverted winger role, but it's not working for him at the moment.

2460~~~
He didn't really have any great games on the wing for us though. So far he's looked ten times the player when in dimond for us.

2461~~~
62m. Our two biggest games of the season and he absolutely and totally disappears. Still won't be harsh on him because he's been fantastic before that but he needs to be taken off set pieces. He's far worse than Nani ever was. Every single corner doesn't go past the first man.

2462~~~
Ashley Young used to get lots of assists from them too. I believe Carrick took them for Spurs

My guess is that we dont practice them as often as smaller teams.

2463~~~
I thought he was quite good. It was just his corners that got to me and his misplaced passes which he was doing in the diamond anyway.

If one of those free kicks had been headed in we'd be talking about a bargain at £60m or something.

2464~~~
Not really. He was like Nani on a bad day today, to be honest. Messed up for the goal, gave the ball away endlessly and his corners are appalling.

This guy cost £60 million and that performance was simply unacceptable. The player we bought from Madrid was one of the most unique attacking midfielders in the world, not your standard winger.

2465~~~
Was just a question of time when we manage to suck the quality out of him. Didn't need much.

2466~~~
He's being played out of position. He's better in a deeper position on the left side.

2467~~~
Play him centrally.

2468~~~
Sure, and his best season for Madrid was in central midfield, although he was basically a half-winger. But to say he's wasted on the wing is really silly. What do you want from a winger? Pace? Dribbling ability? Crosses? I'd say Di Maria fits the bill.

2469~~~
Good first half then regressed, hopefully just a case of fatigue, in the second  with each passing minute.

Still far from any blame of today's performance. The wasteful and sloppy first half cost us this game. The goal in the 2nd was an inevitability.

2470~~~
It took awhile, but it seems he has contracted the United syndrome of not playing to his natural potential. The last few games, he looks like a shadow of his former self. Not saying he is shite to the level of young, nani, valencia, etc., but he has not been as impactful as I would have wanted in the past few games. Maybe it is due to playing as a lm? Whatever the scenario is, I believe his bad patch ended with this last game.

2471~~~
I agree, that's where he should be playing.

2472~~~
Why van Gaal insist on playing him on the wing when he's clearly much better in the centre?

2473~~~
Wasted is a wrong word, sure, but he's just not as effective. Infield for us and Madrid he was doing those crazy runs, Messi-esque ones when he's basically skipping past players and does something. When he's on the wing, he's often limiting himself to crossing which doesn't work against teams who can position themselves. We've seen that his crossing is useless even against teams of WBA ilk.

2474~~~
He is ten times better in the middle than on the wing. I hope the diamond formation is back for the next game.

2475~~~
His 2nd awful performance for us in a row.

Nani-esque corner kicks, poor delivery from free-kicks, couldn't string a decent pass together all day and should of intercepted the pass before the goal.

2476~~~
I want to see him back in midfield, his level drops a few notches on the wing.

2477~~~
How can he be so bad at corners? 

Strangely it's exactly what Nani used to do with them. Some underlying reason that genius talent also comes with an inability to get a corner more than two feet off the ground?

2478~~~
So why did he started to be great for Madrid when he was moved to the centre and before that he was just Argentinian Nani, only worse?? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2479~~~
what free kicks were you watching?

2480~~~
As I said in the match thread, I don't care what he's done at Real.

He needs to show up for United in the big games.

2481~~~
TBF I thought he was pretty decent in the second half. He was one of the players driving us forward.

2482~~~
Because big games are more than individual brilliance, and we had a clear system that went out the window with individual errors.

2483~~~
He didn't. Yes, his last season was his best but he had plenty of great games on the wing.

2484~~~
Sounds like the excuses for Ozil

2485~~~
This. Can't believe people are arguing this point. We can't have our best player out wide and not getting involved in the game

2486~~~
A few examples spring to mind, like the one where he missed the target by a mile from the free-kick, when he should have played a simple cross in to the box.

2487~~~
Exactly like Nani. But Nani wasn't ever the best Champions League player...

2488~~~
Rooney and Van Persie both managed something out of nothing in the second half that we were unlucky not to profit from. Di Maria wasted almost everything

2489~~~
Took some great free kicks, except the for his attempt on goal. Corners were a bit poor. I like that he is willing to run at players with the ball with pace. Haven't had a player like that since Ronaldo who was good enough. Lost his man for the goal but his quick passing and flick ons are really good.

2490~~~
It's a bit concerning at how poor he's been recently. 

Really needs to be playing centrally.

2491~~~
Diabolical performance. Also needs to stop taking corners.

2492~~~
He needs to be playing in midfield. I honestly wouldn't mind him in behind Rooney or Falcao away from home. Just give him the freedom to roam.

2493~~~
Find it strange that his free kicks are fantastic yet his delivery's from corners are very inconsistent.

2494~~~
Imo the switch from a diamond is not suiting him at all.

2495~~~
Even if he is played out of position, that doesnt mean that he shouldnt be able to beat a defender of give a half decent pass? That doesnt mean that he should lose the ball so often? There is a basic level you have to reach, no matter which positions he plays in midfield/attack, he hasnt reached that basic level for the 2nd time in the row, no excuses.

2496~~~
Difficult to judge his second half performance, but I thought it was decent in the circumstances.

His first half performance was very disappointing though. Hope he doesn't have many more of these quiet games.

2497~~~
We need to buy Charlie Adams to take our corners :P

2498~~~
Don't think he should be taken off corners. Didn't he play the one that led to the equaliser last week?

Just needs to cut out that first man bollocks.

It was frustrating though.

2499~~~
If we manage to turn even him into average player then we should just give up on football, but I hope it's just a bad form(it should be, it's just two games after all so I am probably panicking too much).

Fecking annoying considering he was excellent for Madrid in that department.

2500~~~
His corners are shite.

2501~~~
Is the excuse for every player  playing poorly 'they aren't in the right position'? Is football really so simple that moving a player a few yards one way or another would suddenly  make everything better?

2502~~~
Maybe Wenger should also play his players in their right position. These players don't need to prove themselves else where. You spend a lot of money, you play them where they are at their best.

It's the same with Ronaldo. You don't play him up top as a striker even though he scores 50+ goals. You play him as a wide forward with freedom to go wherever he pleases.

2503~~~
I thought he was awful. We really rely on moments of brilliance from him and all he managed was a couple of decent wide freekicks that no-one managed to get a touch to and his right foot shot that Hart saved. He's a liability defensively so he needs to deliver going forward. Those corners towards the end of the game were just terrible.

2504~~~
For the love of God don't have him taking the corners. Poor performance again today but I expect it is being highlighted due to the horrendous corners. Rooney whips in a decent corner, have him on them full time. Would much rather have Di Maria in the middle. We got so much success just from him driving through the middle with the ball when playing the diamond.

2505~~~
He is/was basically Nani V2 when hugging the touchline. Before last season where he played as an ACM in Ancelottis system, there was no way that you could ever look at him and define him as a world class player when he was fixed on the wing. Yes he had good games there for Madrid, but he was inconsistent. I hope we go back to the diamond and play him in the centre

2506~~~
If you are unable to tell the difference between playing in a central position and playing as a winger, then that says more about yourself... Of course it may be a coincidence that Di Maria's worst performances have come when playing as a winger but I have a feeling that's not the case.

2507~~~
Corners were poor and we should get someone else to take them.

Other than that he had a decent match and ran his socks off. Would like to see him on the left flank more because he puts in those great deliveries that lead to goals.

2508~~~
I watched the champions league final again right after we signed him, to get a feel for how he'll be in CM for us.

He was a defensive passenger just like he has been for us

2509~~~
Getting to the point where we have to ask ourselves are we overrating him? He seems to only show up in the smaller games and goes into hiding in the bigger games..

And we splash a tonne of money on him and he can't deliver a decent corner consistently?!

During his times at Real Madrid he was fantastic but he was surrounded by the Ronaldos and bales

2510~~~
You've been on the caf for years, shouldnt you know that caftards tend to make a lot of excuses for our players/manager etc.?

2511~~~
Remember when we had RVP taking our corners from the right and Rooney from the left? We looked much better.

2512~~~
Was ok, but not what you expect from a player who you'd look at to be the game changer for us. Also, his corners need to be a lot better than they were. When you're down to 10 men, and in tight games like this, set pieces can prove to be so vital, as we saw from the Fellaiini chance, which is why it needs to be better. Too many times his corners weren't even getting past the first man. Same thing happened last week too, until he put a decent ball into the box and we scored from it.

2513~~~
Not certain players or certain managers they dont.

2514~~~
There is a significant difference between LCM (the position where he excelled at RM) and the wing. It's not just a matter of moving a 'few yards'. Di Maria needs space to move and drive into. Any decent fullback can cut off the space for him to do that from the wing - and in the last few weeks he's played Ivanovic and Zabaleta.

2515~~~
The 35 million Arsenal spent for Alexis is certainly starting to look like the much better deal. Don't get why we didn't get involved in that one.

But no, Angel di Maria is a top-class player who has had a dip in form after a great start for us. He'll be good.

2516~~~
van Persie should take the corners. simple.

2517~~~
As a winger he was usually excellent for Madrid defensively, gave his everything almost every time he step up the pitch. I rememeber some of the classico's when he wasn't even great attacking wise, but still I was admiringi for his defensive work, but looks like that part of his game is gone.

2518~~~
I thought he was better as the game went on but the drop in his contribution since he was moved from AM to the wing is pretty fecking obvious.

2519~~~
It's funny, when we signed him most people on here were wondering why we were signing a winger instead of a CM. When a few of us suggested he <i>could</i> play in CM for us, it was laughed off. Now, after two poor games, 90 per cent of the CAF has decided that he is a CM and only a CM who is completely wasted on the wing, despite having a skill-set better suited for the wing than the central midfield. Complete knee-jerk. He's perfectly fine in both roles.

2520~~~
I think we'll see the workhorse Angel di Maria, the engine of Real Madrid's CL winning campaign, back in action as soon as United is able to perform better as a team. It's a major difference from psychological point of view, whether you exhaust yourself for the benefit of a working team or putting in all that effort and things still don't work out.

I was personally much more annoyed by his pisspoor cornerkicks.

2521~~~
Stop taking our corners they are shit.

2522~~~
Unfortunately for us he was the worst player on the pitch today by a mile. And if he's have produced even half of the quality today that he has since he's got here we would have still won the game despite being down to 10 men. Shame. Still think the world of him though.

2523~~~
Has been touch disappointing in last 2 big games. The left midfield position in diamond suits him best but that system is not very ideal defensively against big teams imo. Oh and he needs to stop taking corners and even free-kicks unless he has a very suitable angle. Rooney is very good at taking corners and FKs and delivering good balls into the area.

2524~~~
Been real dissapointing last 2 games.

Left sided in a diamond suits him more but he cheats defensively more there.

2525~~~
Needs to be taken off corners and direct free kicks

2526~~~
Im not just refering to ADM  though, the same excuse has been played out  to excuse Mata, Kagawa, Rooney, Januzaj, Rojo, and several other players lately.

If it was RVP  being placed in goal I could understand it, but do players really lose the basics of what makes them world class or great players( like free kick and corner taking) when they are in a slightly different spot?

2527~~~
Makes you wonder what the feck is he doing on training that he's getting to take those. It was the same shit with Young. Always taking corners and failing with every single one of them.

2528~~~
His free kicks and corners are really poor, and he doesn't offer half as much on the wing as he does in CM, where he's been a real revelation. Hope we can go back to a Di Maria/Blind/Herrera midfield soon.

2529~~~
His free kicks, when delivering the ball into the box and not shooting, are very good. I have no idea why his corners are so terrible in contrast. They are just too low. The near post defender just heads it away with ease. Put RVP back on them.

2530~~~
Absolute shite the last two games when we needed him most. He played fairly well in the last 10 minutes but still not nearly good enough. Much prefer playing him centrally as he improves tenfold there as opposed to when he's put on the wing.

2531~~~
Well they shouldn't, but it certainly seems that way. The trouble it seems at United is we constantly shoehorn players into unfamiliar positions. Okay, playing on the wing isn't exactly alien to Di Maria, we don't play with wingers like Chelsea or Madrid do. We actually play with wingers in the traditional sense - hug the touchline style. Mata, Kagawa and Di Maria are just really unsuited to those roles. The former two are too slow for it and, as I said before, Di Maria needs to be able to drive into space. The wing position - which is the common denominator doesn't bring out the best in our players. And the actual wingers we do have are just shit.

Rooney <i>looks</i> out of place as a #10, but his numbers stack up. As for Januzaj and Rojo, I've not seen many people excuse them.

2532~~~
Apart from his corner kicks, he was actually pretty good in the second half. Were people even watching the match?

Worst player on the pitch by an absolute mile. Jesus christ.

2533~~~
I wouldn't say he was the worst but for the amount of cash he gets, that was very disappointing to see from him in an important match.  He was knocked off the ball far too often and I don't know why we keep persisting with him taking corners.  Rooney and even RVP are better than he is.

2534~~~
Smalling was obviously on vacations.....

2535~~~
I mean't those that played the majority or all of the game.

2536~~~
not even going to read through criticism of him today.

he's pretty much our main threat even when he's not on top form!

2537~~~
Well, he has been pretty well marked in the last two games but I was disappointed with his corners today. One of pet hates is a corner taker not getting it past the first defender. Shocking from a professional footballer. Even I can do that and I'm fat, forty and fecked.

2538~~~
His initial form seems to have gone. Very poor set piece delivery, not effective on the wings. Unfortunately we now seem to be very overstocked in central areas with Fellaini's resurgence and Rooney/Herrera/Carrick coming back.

2539~~~
His form has fallen off a cliff.

2540~~~
It's taken a while, but we've got our United grip on him.

2541~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2542~~~
We're within our right to expect better from the most expensive player in British football history when it comes to the big matches and his corners were abysmal, but he still threatened so I'm not overly worried. I think it's mostly just a case of him being stifled by the better teams rather than a worrying drop in form.

2543~~~
So I take it you didn't see him last season playing cm or earlier in the season playing cm. Stuck out wide, not at his best as his influence on the game is limited.

2544~~~
Wow slow down mate, he wasn't the worst and almost scored

2545~~~
"Worst player on the pitch" - Jesus did no one watch Valencia? 

Overall that's how I view it as well.

2546~~~
He's a world class midfielder but far less impressive when he's pushed onto the wing. Hopefully this was just a temporary shift for games against better teams and we'll see him moved back into his best position for most games.

If he is played consistently out wide he'll never justify the fee we paid for him.

2547~~~
I would argue he should be in his best position especially for the games against the better teams.

2548~~~
Valencia was one of our best players considering that he's not a right back.

2549~~~
If he has the form to be the best player. Today and last week he just was quite poor and hitting the ball like that, making wrong decisions like that has nothing to do with his position. It's not like the wing is a totally unfamiliar position for him. He can do much better from there, actually, I think it might be his best position.

2550~~~
He's been poor in both of the big games we have played, we'll be slating Ozil or other top players of our rivals if they played the way he has in both games.

2551~~~
Exactly, he was just poor, his passes were off, made the wrong runs, his crosses and corner kicks were bad, it has nothing to do with his position.

2552~~~
He seems to have lost some pace, he was rapid for Real. I would only had placed Bale, Messi, Ronaldo & Robben faster than him with ball at feet, does not seem as lighting as last season.

Hes been poor from set pieces as well,  his in play crosses have been great but station set peice he struggles to beat the first man. Its not like they are rarity we get so many, never really replaced since Beckham...Rooney Mata or Van Persie should be taking them IMO

2553~~~
Nah he spent most of the time getting ripped apart by Milner and he left Smalling vulnerable a lot as well. Saying he's not a right back is just conceding in the same way Di Maria wasn't playing in his best position either.

2554~~~
I wonder if he's carrying an injury? Because he seems to have lost a bit of pace and energy compared to his performances at Madrid. His dribbling has looked really clumsy too.

2555~~~
His best moments for us have come when he's running (with the ball) from deep in midfield. The opposition struggle to deal with that. On the wing he's a bit more predictable and a bit easier to double up on and deal with. I prefer a midfield three of Blind, Di Maria and Herrera. I think for us, and for Madrid last season, he's a lot more dangerous in that position. 

I think people are overreacting a bit regarding his performance today. 

He stepped up in the second half and looked better. His corners are atrocious though and rarely beat the first man. Id rather Rooney and RvP back taking them. They whip them in perfectly.

2556~~~
Spot on man!

Could just be the shit restaurants in Manchester though? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

80% of his set pieces were atrocious & thats another sickening thing from this game, as set pieces looked like our only way to get points from this game. I genuinely believe we could have won today if his sat nav was switched on. We'd plenty of great opportunity's in the last 20mins from set pieces & the ball never even got past the 1st defender most of the time..

2 biggest games of the season (so far) in a row & Di Maria went missing. Never expected that..

2557~~~
I dont agree that Herrera should start. He's a walkover in this league atm & gives the ball away far too much..

Bout time LvG got rid of this bromance shite & toughened up the lightweights..

2558~~~
Could have done better for the goal, and his corners were horrible, but that's about it, attacking wise he was overcrowded... I remember one moment where he had three if city's players around him, but still kept the ball. I would keep him on corner duty, but they really should be better. No idea why he was taking the direct  free kick and not RVP. Greatly annoyed me.

2559~~~
He did that regularly in his first three years at Madrid when used on the wing as well as Higuain, Benzema and Ozil. Those four regularly were poor in the big games under Mourinho apart from the odd match or moment. Him and Ozil had good stats and were quite productive but they regularly went through patches of bad form and inconsistency. It was last year when Ancelotti put him in midfield that he became world class and a big game player and was absolutely brilliant. He became more consistent and influenced matches (especially the big ones) much more. He is entering his peak now as a player so I am sure he will be better on the wing for United than he was for us as he was still quite young at Madrid. But like I said before, the best football in his career by far has come when playing in midfield. Whether United want to use him that way or have the personnel to fit him into such a formation is a different story. But it is a bit crazy to sign a player for the big money that they spent and not use him in the position where he played his best football by far. The player in his first three seasons on the wing for Madrid was worth nowhere near that amount.

2560~~~
I think it is more to do with the speed of our general attacking play. We're dwelling on the ball, especially when RVP or Januzaj is in possession. It showed in our play today in the first half today, and was quite apparent during the Chelsea game. Roll back a few games, and Di Maria was on fire when we had more dynamic movement up front when Falcao and Herrera were among the attack.

2561~~~
Really disappointing against City and Chelsea. Hope he doesn't develop a habit of fading out of the big games.

Would have preferred to have seen him go off instead of Adnan today. Was offering little going forward and routinely wasted free kicks and corners.

2562~~~
Thanks for that man - great post!

I knew he played his best football last season from mid-field, but its always great to get the best perspective from someone who know's him better & you've gone back a few year also. 

If United had Strootman in CM alongside Di Maria & one other, then i'd be alot happier against the stronger teams with playin him there; but havin Blind, Di Maria & Herrera there - we get rolled over. Far too lightweight..

Thats why Fellaini has been a regular the past 2 games & he's actually played very well. The spine of United is as soft as shite & every good team has a strong spine - we dont atm.

2563~~~
In fairness man - Adnan has done f*ck all in the last 2-3 games - same as Mata. He was the 1st guy on everyone's lips to be subbed after Smalling got sent off..

2564~~~
So ppl are questioning his quality now? First Kagawa, then Mata and now him? Can probably soon add Falcao to that list, too. At what point are we going to start questionning our football/system/ability to adapt to modern football instead of blaming every quality player who drops a few levels once he joins us? 

Our football is improving, even today we at least didn't look like we have a ball allergy. 
But we are not there yet, at times Di Maria had space but noone to pass to apart from Fellaini, the players weren't making runs. 
Anyway he was doing great with Herrera in midfield, put both of them together there again!

2565~~~
I still remember that breathtaking run he made against QPR, where he ran the length of the pitch (more or less) with the ball before shifting it to Rooney, who eventually teed up Herrera for the goal. Whatever it takes to get him doing that again, we should be doing it. He's still quality on the wing, but the player who scored that goal against Leicester was something else.

2566~~~
Its not his qualities that are questionable its his performances

2567~~~
Perhaps last year was just a bit of a purple patch for him. He was always pretty inconsistent other than that, which fits what we're now seeing.

2568~~~
It's part and parcel of how we watch, and more importantly, comment on matches these days. I wasn't on this board in the early 2000s, and I doubt there was as much instant 'analysis' back then, but can you imagine the comments when Scholes went through his rough patch after the arrival of Veron, or in the early stages of the 2004-5 season? Or what about when Giggs was experiencing a dip in form (I guess that's where the whole 'sell Giggs' bit came from...) In any event, this is why I'm glad we have an experienced manager like Van Gaal running the show, a guy who has seen, survived and surmounted his share of issues over the last two decades.

2569~~~
I don't think it's completely unrelated that his performances have dipped slightly since he's played on the wing.

2570~~~
Di Maria is a world class central midfielder, he is just awesome there. Play him there, improve our movement in the final third and we will be able to go head-to-head against the likes of Chelsea and City. Angel looks half the player when played as a winger.

2571~~~
Few times he played advance, and scared the hell out of City's defence with his pace.

I still maintain the idea that we have to play him in that Robben's WC position, as SS.

2572~~~
But that only really worked because the Netherlands were sitting back against teams looking for the counter. Most of the teams we play against, we won't be playing on the counter so not sure that would really work for us.

2573~~~
Which dried out the moment we put him on the wing? It's clear as daylight, he is half the player on the wing and we don't have anyone pulling up trees in the middle to justify nullifying our most potent weapon.

2574~~~
When we defend, we often would struggle to get out of the zone. Mainly it's because we have no outlet up-front with decent pace. And I'd like to see our attacker who can dribble at pace. We have Januzaj, but he isn't dependable yet.

2575~~~
I truly bealive he is struggling to come to terms with the emotional and physical toil of the Premiership. Even when he was playing well he struggled to last in some games. This isnt La Liga when you cruising with Cristiano every other week. He just has to come to terms with these issues and he'll be fine.

2576~~~
He was MOTM in the CL final wasn't he? Dunno where this 'can't do it in big matches' is coming from. He obviously can and has done so...

2577~~~
Needs to be playing in a midfield 3 rather than the wing really. Since we have very little quality out wide, and are overstocked in the forward positions, a switch back to the diamond formation for the Palace game would probably make sense. Bring Herrera back into the side.

2578~~~
He's torn Barca apart couple of times, too. (I remember the 3-4 game in particular, even though it ended in a defeat)

2579~~~
Bale was officially I believe, but I thought ADM was the best at the time.

2580~~~
SAF gave Di Maria the MVP award

2581~~~
Nope, di Maria was the UEFA man of the match while was Ramos the fans man of the match.

2582~~~
Hrm... Wonder where I got that from then.

2583~~~
Absolutely, positively wasted out wide. WTH man. Can't we stick Adnan on the left push him more central and let the other minions slot in wherever?

2584~~~
Just get him back in the centre. This playing him out wide stuff is an utter utter waste.

It was one of the Madrid fans (I think <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> ) that said Di Maria is not a world class £60 million winger, but he is as a midfielder. And it shows.

2585~~~
What's his best position really? I see so many people preferring him to play as a CM instead of as a winger. I must say I hardly saw any of his matches before this season but correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't he played all his life as a winger and just played as a CM for Madrid only last season?

2586~~~
Can't remember if it was him I got it from but I got this from a Madrid fan.


"His first three years at Madrid when used on the wing as well as Higuain, Benzema and Ozil. Those four regularly were poor in the big games under Mourinho apart from the odd match or moment. Him and Ozil had good stats and were quite productive but they regularly went through patches of bad form and inconsistency. 

It was last year when Ancelotti put him in midfield that he became world class and a big game player and was absolutely brilliant. He became more consistent and influenced matches (especially the big ones) much more. He is entering his peak now as a player so I am sure he will be better on the wing for United than he was for us as he was still quite young at Madrid. But like I said before, the best football in his career by far has come when playing in midfield. Whether United want to use him that way or have the personnel to fit him into such a formation is a different story. But it is a bit crazy to sign a player for the big money that they spent and not use him in the position where he played his best football by far. The player in his first three seasons on the wing for Madrid was worth nowhere near that amount."

It pretty much seems right to me too, he influenced the games he played in CM so much more than wide, and a firing Di Maria getting on the ball often means we have a chance against anyone.

2587~~~
Yeah, and last season was by far the best season of his career. Before that he was good but inconsistent.

2588~~~
Lots of footballer have a breakthrough season where they suddenly become much more consistent and effective than they were before. Often at the same age Di Maria was last season. There's every chance he could have had a great season on the wing too.

People get far too hung up on the positions that footballers play, if you ask me. As though playing a slightly different attacking midfield role suddenly means the basics of football escape the player in question. It's just a cop-out. Especially when so many of the excuses being made on this basis for the likes of Kagawa, Mata and now Di Maria come from the same posters that regularly crucified Wayne Rooney, someone who has been asked to play more different positions than all those players put together. Really top players are adaptable.

I happen to think Di Maria is a really top player and can be great out wide. He's just gone off the boil after doing a stupid amount of travelling during the international break then coming up against two of the strongest teams in the league in quick succession. That's bound to put a speed bump in the impressive learning curve he's shown adapting to PL football so far. Hopefully onwards and upwards from here.

2589~~~
Just looking at his physics you would think he's a winger. Can't really imagine him being a central midfielder. Most players in the middle need to be a bit more on the average body type look to be bossing the midfield. But if it works then i'm all for it.

2590~~~
He is a good winger, infact a brilliant one. However if you don't have enough attacking threat through the middle of the midfield it is relatively easy to defend against a good winger (you double/tripple team them)

Not to mention the kid has an exeptional eye for a pass/through ball (which is wasted out wide), he also causes all sorts of havoc when he runs through the middle of the pitch (where can can't be double/trippled teamed) with limited options of where to go.

I don't mind him on the wing if its for some tactical reason, but when he is there we lack creativity through the middle which doesn't help any winger imo.

However playing him centrally where has the license to drift out wide seems the best use of his talent imo.

2591~~~
Pretty much my thoughts (bold).

I also wonder how much the difference in the leagues is playing a part in things. I'm not looking to get into a PL V La Liga debate, but I'm pretty sure the pace of the 10 games he's been with us for will have taken more out of him than the equivalent games for Madrid.

2592~~~
Yeah. he's looked a bit leggy at times. You'd have to wonder if all the will he / won't he shenanigans over the summer affected his conditioning work in pre-season.

2593~~~
Of course, La Liga is far more light and less physical demanding than the Premier League.

2594~~~
There's quite a big difference between playing out wide and playing in a deeper midfield position though, isn't there? Certainly if we're talking about a player's ability to impose themselves on a game...

Didn't SAF mention before that they had tried using Roy Keane as a DM but he had been unable to adapt to the role? I also remember him saying Evra had played as more as a wing back before he came to United but they had confidence he had the characteristics to adapt to the LB role in our system. Then you also have LvG's preference for playing left footed players at LCB and right footers playing at RCB. If these changes (far more subtle than the one between playing in midfield and out wide) were held to be that important then surely there must be some merit in the notion that they're a factor here too?

Last season was by far the best in Di Maria's career and it came while playing as a midfielder. Before we signed him many people (including some of the Madrid fans who had been watching him for years) said it was a position that suited him more than playing out wide. Now that he has arrived here we have seen a continuation of that pattern. Maybe it's just a coincidence but as is evidence would surely suggest that he is at his best in this deeper role?

2595~~~
The difference is overstated. There isn't too much into it.

2596~~~
I think the reality is somewhere in between what most are saying.  The past year has really been where he has played out of his skin and showed his full potential.  And when on song, he can be one of the world's best players.  In the CL final he outshone the likes of Ronaldo, Bale, etc....and in the WC, for my money he was just as important as Messi, perhaps more (Argentina didn't score any goals after he got injured against Belgium).  

It's difficult to maintain that type of form.  Going by his history, he's never been the main man for any of his sides, but he's been a stellar accomplice.  He needs others around him to produce the goods as well, so if RvP, Falcao and Rooney can get firing then we'll get a lot of joy this season.  However I think expectations became just a tad bit unrealistic given his stellar first few matches, which were probably the result of a combination of his own motivation of being at a new club plus the poor/average opponents we happened to face.

2597~~~
I think his dip has more to do with the quality of opposition we've faced in the last two games rather than his position.

2598~~~
West Brom?

Its quite clearly his position thats making the difference.

2599~~~
He played out wide then? I didn't see all of that game.

2600~~~
I think so. Januzaj had a stinker that game as well.

2601~~~
Yeah, he was wide against West Brom. He basically did what he's done since, put in a lot of fantastic crosses, but not had anywhere near the same influence on the game as he did in his first games for us. 

I don't think he's bad on the wing, it just restricts him too much, and you lose so much of what makes him such a great player.

2602~~~
Exactly. I'm almost certain that if he plays centrally against Palace he will have a top, top game.

2603~~~
Even Gary "crosses" Neville thinks we need to get him back central.

2604~~~
Yeah, he's still good on the wing, just nowhere near as good as his normal quality when he runs through the middle.

2605~~~
He's barely seen any of the ball in the past few games. Criminal.

I remember Ronaldo used to get the ball in almost every attack. But I guess that was partly due to the genius of Paul Scholes.

Our attack should be built around Di Maria.

2606~~~
He's looked better in the diamond formation with Herrera.

2607~~~
I've been watching some highlights of Di Maria at Real Madrid, and I think I might be onto something that may explain his performances at United (source video is linked below rather than embedded).

1) ADM usually had 2, maybe 3 attacking players watching ADM ready to make their run towards goal. More killer-pass options means more opportunities for ADM to demonstrate his talent. Our first few games with ADM, we played 4-4-2 with two strikers plus Herrera who is quick and aggressive on the attack, so more passing options up front. The games in which ADM had his relative worst performances were with RVP playing as lone striker and our midfield was fairly defensive.

2) At Real Madrid, ADM had powerful, fast runners to pass to. Benzema and Ronaldo could outsprint the last man and get on the end of the ball. At United, Falcao and Rooney are both quick but Rooney has been playing very deep and Falcao is injured. RVP has a tendency of getting caught offsides or starting his runs too late/not quick enough.

3) The defending in some of these highlights is awful - ADM may be having some difficulty adjusting to the relatively high amount of pressing that occurs in the English game, and the amount of "park the bus" that other teams are playing against us.

#1 and #2 above are relatively easy fixes. Just need to get Falcao and Herrera back in the line-up, and our attacking players need to start getting used to making runs forward in anticipation of a pass from ADM. Right now, it's too predictable - Rooney or Januzaj will run towards ADM to get a sideways pass, leaving only a single attacking player trying to make a run towards goal, which is far too easy to defend against and pass-intercept. Change that so we have multiple players making that same run and we're in business.

#3 above is a bit troubling - it just means more of his killer passes are going to be intercepted, or ADM won't even be able to get off the pass that he wants without that little extra bit of skill, which may be part of the reason why we're seeing some poor passing from ADM.

Still no excuse for his corners though :P

2608~~~
Have we actually scored off one of his crosses yet? He must've put in about 30+ great crosses since he arrived, our strikers should be connecting with the majority of them but they haven't done so, and the ones that we do connect with are missed (Fellaini on Sunday).

2609~~~
Get him off the wing and back inside, for goodness sake....that is where he works his strengths are...

2610~~~
Yes. Twice. Although, ironically, neither of them were intended as a cross!

Three times if you count RvP scoring with a rebound after Fellaini's header was saved.

2611~~~
Pretty sure Fellaini's goal against West Brom was from a Di Maria cross too.

2612~~~
He scuffed 2 low shots. You know what I mean, he's whipped in several worldies that we've failed to convert or even get contact on. RVP's equaliser against Chelsea is the shout but other than that we're not getting people on the end of his crosses in the traditional fashion.

2613~~~
This is true. I think it was the West Brom game in particularly where he was swinging in some great crosses which Van Persie didn't get on the end of. I we're going to continue playing ADM out wide (which I hope we don't) I can't wait to have Falcao back because he'd thrive off those deliveries with his aerial ability.

2614~~~
I think that you are on to something, some people seems to think that Di Maria has been 'poor' because he was played 'out of position' when it is just a typical Di Maria slump, he has always been like that, little matter where he is playing. 
That is also why i think that, if we have a good CM we should use Di Maria on the wing, there is slumps won't be as dangerous for us.

2615~~~
Not sure if this was posted yet but his verified page on face book has him in a Real Jersey ?

2616~~~
the picture is still from the 11th July 2011. He isnt really online, i think his wife or whoever ''manages'' the website. I am sure he doesnt give a feck about his facebook page.

2617~~~
He hasnt played well in the last 2 games but has still produced some top quality crosses. Prefer him in a midfeild 3

2618~~~
Up for debate but I think most would go along with him being our best player.

You want your best player on the ball as much as possible, get him as many touches as possible, using him out wide at the moment is a real waste. Hopefully he takes up that inside left channel against Palace and can start attacking the opposition again.

2619~~~
Just LOL at the rumours of Di Maria going back to Madrid in exchange for Bale...

2620~~~
I was just reading that , it has to be bullshit.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.givemesport.com/519566-manchester-united-offered-gareth-bale-in-exchange-for-angel-di-maria" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.givemesport.com/519566-m...ed-gareth-bale-in-exchange-for-angel-di-maria</a>

2621~~~
I wouldn't give them the clicks, personally!

2622~~~
What has happened to Di Maria is exactly as I feared when he first joined us. He was still using his form and confidence from Madrid in his first 4/5 games. But now that the performances from the rest of the team and the results have been so poor, it's now affecting him now too. Of course it will. It's only natural. This has happened many times before at other clubs too.

2623~~~
Been terrible, has added nothing, terrible corners, and even Shaw has passed more defenders than he has, get him back to midfield or out of the line up, we're playing with 9 man today because of him and Januzaj.

2624~~~
How is he playing today?

2625~~~
Not even a surprise that the two or three times he's actually had the ball in a central area, he's looked a hundred more times threatening then anytime he's had it on the wing.

Its so obvious it hurts.

2626~~~
Really needs to be played centrally.

2627~~~
I agree he's better centrally, but the whole <i>"no coincidence he's been poor since he's gone out wide"</i> is a cop out.

2628~~~
Just awful. In Mariappas's pocket.

2629~~~
Has not been hugging the touch line as he did vs City and Chelsea, but still quite poor by his standards.

Had that one run and passed to Rooney who blazed over but he's not really putting in the individual performances he was during September. I did expect things to settle down, but I didn't expect him to become another decent player stifled by the Manchester United disease.

2630~~~
I think it's the set up personally. Undoubtedly there is some form loss with him trying to play to much as an individual but I'd say the bgiger problem is that he went from being central with lots of players close by to play off to being pushed out wide in a system where there is little central support. Most the time he and Januzaj are more in line with the DM than Fellaini/Rooney are. I just don't get the point in pushing Fellaini up so high and having Rooney. It means we're passing the ball slow and the two players who are going to create, draw the fouls, etc Di Maria/Januzaj are left to create something from so far out.

2631~~~
He's been woeful so far. Anyone else and we would be slaughtering him.

His best games came early on when he had Herrera and Blind around him with RVP providing incisive runs, he now has the awesome talents of Fellaini, Carrick and Rooney will all of their pace and nouse and is being expected to make things happen cutting in from the left. It's poor. He has too much to do and keeps trying everything. Having said that it's no excuse for his terrible deliveries from out wide so far.

2632~~~
Why has he forgotten how to dribble for the past 3 matches? Now he just runs straight into people giving them the ball

2633~~~
How many good games has he had for us? Against mighty QPR and Leicester + Everton? Overall not happy with him so far.

2634~~~
I think if we put him in Januzaj's current position he could do some damage for us. Don't know why we haven't tried. We clearly just need to get the ball in the box and cause some havoc.

2635~~~
Nullified. He has two or three players every time he is near the box out wide.

2636~~~
He's so easy to mark out of a game out wide, just double team him and push him wide so all he can do is cross it.

2637~~~
We are getting the ball to him far too late, too much slow build up around the middle.

2638~~~
The Ozil effect ? Start impressively at your new club and then slowly fade away ?

2639~~~
I agree that he's better infield, but I find it a bit of a cop out. 
And it's almost as if people assume that as soon as he goes infield, he'll definitely look like he did against QPR. That may not be the case at all.

2640~~~
Rooney is playing in the position where he needs to be. Unfortunately we have no other wingers, so unless we change the formation back to a diamond then he will be staying out wide.

2641~~~
Different player central to out wide.


Btw stop fecking taking corners.

2642~~~
The game is too slow for him. When he was still playing in CM he and Herrera were the ones to speed up our play now there is just no one there who does it which means he and the team struggles because every team has ages to organize their defense.

2643~~~
He has been drifting inside and still looked average! This "out wide" thing is just an excuse.

2644~~~
It looks like he has taken some of van Gaal's earlier comments about not giving the ball away so much to heart and as a result is playing too conservative.

2645~~~
Not at all. He's at his best playing from deeper but in the middle when he has space to run through the middle. He's getting too isolated out wide.

2646~~~
He's still capable of much better out wide, regardless of his best position.

2647~~~
I agree, at Madrid, he was playing in one of the fastest counter attacking system. Now at United he is surrounded by zombies and static players bar Herrera and blind from our attack.

2648~~~
They told him he could become anything so he became Stuart Downing....

2649~~~
I'm not blaming him yet. 

His best performances came as a mifielder when there was plenty of movement from Rooney, Herrera and Falcao in an around him. It gave him options to pass and created space for him to run. 

As a winger he's stuck on the byline with little to no movement around him especially since our midfield played like zombies today. His only option was to cross it in where he usually had only RVP to aim for surrounded by 3 defenders. It's not making the best use of his talents IMO.

2650~~~
Needs to go back central with Herrera, Blind and Rooney/Mata.

How can he play the way he did centrally vs how he is out wide and Van Gaal then continue to play him out wide?

2651~~~
I believe he's struggling to adapt to the physicality of the league. Quite often he looks exasperated and downbeat when he gets shaken off the ball.

Here's hoping it's only a temporary dip in form.

2652~~~
Does not suit this formation, get him central in the diamond and he'll shine again.

2653~~~
really poor today, and he wasnt even wide all the time. Plenty of time with space through the middle, but not really his day, again.

what if next game Van persie wears Cristiano Ronaldo's face? maybe then Di Maria will find him with his crosses.

2654~~~
So he has turned into Antonio Valencia, only more shit defensively.

2655~~~
Horrible match and I cannot stress enough how much I hate when he runs in a direction where we all see he'll be outnumbered and cornered but he still runs and runs. No variety in his game in this game, just running in a straight line and crossing. I think they must be clear instructions from the coach otherwise it makes no sense to me

2656~~~
Well he got an assist...

Shit game from him though. We need him back in the midfield 3. We'll probably stick with a 4-1-4-1 as we look better defensively, but we need him on the left center mid and Herrera the right center mid, with them actually playing as midfielders and not #10's. Either use 1 striker and the rest on the bench or just put Rooney out on the left if RvP/Falcao have to play up front.

2657~~~
Shite today. But then again, we reverted back to that typical 'bang it out to the wingers, stand there, and hope for them to produce some magic' routine we've seen over the past few seasons. 

It baffles me, though, that our last two record transfer purchases in Mata and Di Maria have been brought in for massive money, only for the guy who has sanctioned the deal to play said players in positions they don't play their best football. Moyes bought a cracking #10 in Mata, threw him out wide. Van Gaal has bought the most unique central attacking midfielder in the game and lumped him out wide, too. 

The common denominator always comes down to Rooney and Van Persie, two players that two managers just don't want to drop for the good of the team. So frustrating.

2658~~~
Can't defend him today, I don't know if he's playing within himself due to not wanting to take as many risks and piss of LvG, or if he's have a bad run of form, but he's faded badly.

2659~~~
It's hard to create much when every other player is so static and not creating any space for you. When Herrera and Falcao were playing they were moving and giving him space + options to create. Having him on the byline with options like Carrick and Fellaini doesn't scream dynamic. His only real option was Shaw on the occasional overlap.

2660~~~
This. 100x this.

2661~~~
Put him back centrally please, he's been shite on the wing.

2662~~~
Well that's a lovely surprise for my fantasy team <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2663~~~
He's just out of form and out of confidence. It happens. He'll be back.

2664~~~
Di Maria looks lost out wide. When he was able to come inside and influence the game he did e.g. the one two for Mata's goal. However, when you leave Di Maria isolated and without the angles available for triangles and one twos its a waste actually having him on. If we persist with playing this 4-2-3-1 I'll start to wonder what the point of buying Angel actually was. His best form has been in the past two years on the left hand side of a midfield 3. That's where we should be playing him as shown against Everton not so long ago...

2665~~~
Spot on. Its so bleeding obvious.

2666~~~
If he's going to play outwide, why isn't it from the right, so he can cut in on his left, like he did at Madrid before he moved into midfield? He looks like Valencia when he plays on the left, as his only option seems to be to stay on his strongest foot. Putting him on the right seems to give him more space to attack.

I'd still rather see him in a midfield 3 or diamond though.

2667~~~
I think the problem is that LVG wants to ensure we're giving as many of our <i>good </i>players as possible game time, and that means putting Di Maria out wide. But Di Maria is the best outfield player we have when he delivers, so I'd be happy to sacrifice anyone else in the team to ensure that we've got him in his best position, especially considering how much we paid for him.

2668~~~
There was no point in paying the amount we did for Di Maria if we're just going to play him in a position where he clearly isn't as good. He isn't worth that fee as a winger, something a fair few people pointed out before we signed him.

Unfortunately the lack of balance in our squad is such that we may be forced to continue playing like this....

2669~~~
I don't think it does at all - playing the diamond gives our best players game time and it puts Di Maria in his best role. 

The only possible player that didn't fit into the diamond was Januzaj, but even then it seems clear that he could play as either a #10 instead of Mata/Rooney, or as one of the front two.

2670~~~
Januzaj also played his best football for us on the left wing... make much sense a switch. At least to try.

2671~~~
Perhaps...just perhaps..he plays better with world class players around him with pace....

2672~~~
for 60M i expect him to take the bull by the horns if shit is not working around him. with or without world class players around him.

So hopefully not. hah

2673~~~
Let's not forget he never scored more than 11 goals in a full season (52 matches), he's always been inconsistent. He's still assisting goals. And I remember spells for Mourinho where he was equally bad as today for weeks, only to turn up at vital times with brilliant stuff. He's entering his prime and with his qualities you'd expect him to be the best player on the pitch every match, but it's his first months in England. New team with a lot of changes, days are getting darker, winter is coming, he might need to settle in a bit more. He'll probably come good around at Christmas, considering he's an Angel and all.

2674~~~
Pretty poor again today. People can't keep moaning about him being on the wing, but that's the position he grew up playing, and arguably made the best individual performance I've seen in a long time playing there against Germany a few months back, so it's not like he's got no experience playing there.

Granted he's not as good on the wing as he is in centre mid, but that doesn't excuse him doing too much and losing the ball - most of his dispossessions coming from when he was in the middle of the park.

He needs to step it up, because I can only see him playing on the wing for us long term anyway.

What Van Gaal said about Di Maria:

<i><b>Now we have five No 9s and four No 10s and we don’t have wingers to play attacking width, not at the highest level, of Ronaldo or Di Maria or something like that.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/manchester-united-boss-louis-van-gaal-we-dont-have-a-player-like-di-maria-mail-on-sunday-interview/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/m...layer-like-di-maria-mail-on-sunday-interview/</a></b></i>

2675~~~
So true. We all know he's better there, but it's a cop out. He's capable of better than he's shown.

2676~~~
I really hope not but it's certainly heading in that direction. Let's face it you're bound to play much better when you've got the likes of ronaldo, modric, marcelo, benzema playing alongside you.

2677~~~
If we had actually put di Maria in the positions that Januzaj was taking up I swear he would be so much more effective. Basically played in the same right flank position for Real Madrid and Argentina before. 

Januzaj needs to be on the left wing to be at his most comfortable. Di Maria for me is capable of wrecking havoc but we need to get the ball to him in positions where he can whip in a dangerous cross or take on a defender one on one. Centre of the park is too crowded for him. The fullbacks also need to strike up a better understanding with our wingers but this will come in time.

2678~~~

2679~~~
Exactly what I've been saying since West Brom.

SO PLAY HIM IN THE MIDDLE FFS!

2680~~~
True, he should be doing better.

In the long term though playing him on the wing is a big worry. As a winger he simply isn't worth the fee we paid and we would probably have been better off pursuing other targets if that's the way we plan to use him.

2681~~~
I thought it was an odd thing for LVG to say though as there is surely even less space in the middle. If anything I think he dribbles between men better in the middle because the opposition have other players movement to worry about. Out wide it's normally 1on1, or even doubling up on players of di Maria's quality.

2682~~~
Get him back into the position he looked a world beater last season. You don't change the position of your best player just to accomodate far inferior players. If Real Madrid found their "balance" with him in the middle I'm sure we can as well.

2683~~~
Thats the most infuriating thing.

2684~~~
The most infuriating thing is how a 4-1-4-1 is more balanced than the diamond. A Carrick-Blind (Herrera)- DI Maria midfield is more than capable of doing the dirty work as well as doing a lot of damage going forward. Considering one of the strikers in our diamond fomration would be ROoney who likes to drop deep as well it makes even less sense.

2685~~~
Yep.

2686~~~
Di Maria playing in centre midfield for Madrid come about by them having both, Ronaldo and Bale on the wings, and not being able to displace them, thus being tried in centre midfield, and fortunately for them, it worked. Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury.

Next season, however, say if we were to get in a couple of top wingers, such as Cuardado, Pedro, Depay, etc, Van Gaal might decide to put him back into the middle.

2687~~~
Would like him in midfield and Nani back on the wing personally. Especially if he stays fit. It's a shame it might not happen as we'd be a better team

2688~~~
I think paying on the wing is combination of that we have ironically to much midfielders and no other good options on the wing. We could have shift Rooney on the wing and him in the midfield but other than that what are our options on the wing? Young, Valencia, Januzaj (in bad form), maybe Mata but he play on the right wing. On the other hand we have Carrick, Fletcher, Blind, Herrera, Rooney, Fellaini and maybe even Mata for the three positions in midfield.

I think we can go after at least one winger in the winter tranfer window alongside defender. I just hope he can make it work on the wing, this last three games he just wasn't good enough for the most expensive in the PL history.

2689~~~
I don't know whether it is because of his position or game plan but day after day is becoming Ashly Young with his cross, blind cross

2690~~~
I agree the problem is I think we need two wide players to switch back to a three man midfield successfully and we just don't have them. The diamond was great in patches but we were wide open, easily overrun and ran out of steam, a three man midfield is the future but maybe not until we get at least one wide player in one of the next two transfer windows.

2691~~~
Why does he stay so wide? Sure he is better in a central role but even in a wider role he can be utilized a lot better than he is. He spends most of his time on the left sideline and hardly leaves it and the few times he does are when he does good stuff. David Silva plays a wide role but he comes inside, he pops up on both wings, he roams around. Di Maria is just out on the left, hardly seeing him come inside to get more involved and never see him out the right. He had the 8th most touches and passes for us today and that's just not enough. Who ever we play out wide we need interchangeability and not the two of them standing on their byline.

Its why he was better in the diamond because he just went all over the place. He was out wide so much he was practically a LM but he also was inside and occasionally out right.

2692~~~
So, playing out wide is the reason why he can't make simple passes, beat the first man with his cross or keep possession? I refuse to buy that. He's just in bad form. Enough of this best player out of position stuff. This is very typical of Di Maria, he's very erratic even at his best.

2693~~~
He's nowhere near as good out wide. I wanted him based off his form as a midfielder. Team needs to be built around him and Herrera in the middle.

2694~~~
Agree.

However, I can definitely see why LvG has changed things. The truth is we do look more secure defensively with this formation and that may be worth sacrificing other strengths for, especially when our back four is in tatters.

The downside of that is that it requires Di Maria to play out wide. In the long term I'd be dead set against this, he is definitely a far better as a midfielder and I have no doubt that being pushed out wide is a massive factor in his dip in form. However, if it's just a relatively short term move (until we strengthen in defence and out wide, say) then I think it does make some sense.

Di Maria is nowhere near as good out wide but that isn't to say he can't perform better from that position than we've seen so far. After all, he got to Madrid in the first place on the back of his performances as a winger. It's not an ideal situation but we definitely need more from him.

2695~~~
Some of the comments about LVG decision to play him out wide are a bit OTT. When he was at Benfica, he played out wide, for most of his career at Real Madrid he played out wide, I'm pretty sure most of his career for Argentina has been from the wing. Therefore not totally surprising that he's going to play his share fair of games for you guys there too. Whilst I think he's a better player from the no 10 he's played some brilliant matches as a winger - he's just not playing very well at the minute.

2696~~~
He played in a diamond at Benfica, in that central hybrid role that Van Gaal initially played him at the start of the season. 

At Madrid his best form came centrally as well, really he was never one of the best players in the world as a winger and wouldn't have been worth £60m in that role - whereas last season he was arguably the best offensive midfielder in Europe.

2697~~~
He's not a £60 million winger.

2698~~~
I agree. This out of position thing is a cop out. He needs to be putting in better performances than he is. He is capable of being a good winger.

2699~~~
Ok my bad, I didn't know where he played on a regular basis for Benfica and was just judging from one game against Everton I watched where he  played on the left wing. 

However I did watch him play wide many times for Madrid and like most wingers he was inconsistent but still had many moments of brilliance. He was wonderful at taking players on but his final ball could disappoint. 

Yes last season he was incredible and definetly had his best season but you have to remember that Madrid side had the best or second best player in the world and complete goal machine in Ronaldo. As we've seen with Suarez having that kind of player can make a massive difference so if you do concede a couple of sloppy goals there's still a massive chance that you will win the game. With Di Maria in the no 10 role as good as he is, it can leave you vunerable to the counter attack therefore he will have to play wide sometimes to give you balance. Unfortunately for you- his form since playing on the wing has been extremely poor - he should be taking some of the blame for that because he can undoubtedly do better.

2700~~~
I'd guess he's being told to stay wide, which is why he stays wide. When you look at how the team lines up it seems fairly obvious they have been told to take up the positions they do. The wingers in our current set up seem to be under instruction to stretch the pitch and that's what they are doing. Unfortunately for us that's not really playing to the strengths of our best players.

2701~~~
I've solved why he has been so poor lately. He has been filling up on fizzy orange.

2702~~~
Why not try swapping Di Maria and Januzaj, both are under performing on the wings so switch them to the opposite wing.

Also a bad ball can be made into a good one as long as a CF gets on the end of it! His delivery has be criticised in the last few games but when he only has RVP to pick out it is not easy.

2703~~~
Di Maria's shopping list is now considered news <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2704~~~
I haven't seen much of him so don't know if just out of form. But on the wing is he any better than Nani? In the games I've seen him play in midfield he looked verging on sensational. Get this lad in midfield long term along side Herrera.

2705~~~
He definitely needs to go back into a midfield role. I get that we have gone more defensive in the last few games, especially against City and Chelsea I can understand it, but I don't get why we did it against Palace. And the thing is, at Madrid it isn't as though his midfield partners were especially defensive. He played in a three with players like Modric, Alonso and Khedira - very good players, but none of them defensive midfielders. I'll be really confused if Van Gaal doesn't go back to this, given how successful he was there and how unsuccessful he has been since moving out wide

2706~~~
Still such early days with him. He will prove his worth in the long run.

2707~~~
Another awful performance. Get him in the middle.

2708~~~
From what the Madrid lads on here have said, he was basically a good, if not very good winger. But one who was largely inconsistent and would often (along with Ozil) go missing in the big games. It was only when Anchelotti brought him inside that he developed into the sensational player of last season, and became 'world class'. I think it was <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> who said that if we've spent £60 million on him only to play as a winger, we'll probably be dissapointed.

2709~~~
He still will produce a lot and do a very good job if he is used on the wing. His and Ozil's stats in regards to assists were very impressive. Like I said before though last year in midfield in the big games and games against "lesser" teams he was just on a different level to what he was before in terms of creating chances, dropping deep to receive the ball and quickly releasing it to start a counter, dribbling, defending and being able to influence a game for the full 90 rather than in moments etc. Him in central midfield (on the left in an unorthodox midfield role in a lopsided formation where he could attack through the middle and move out to the left as well as cover defensively for Ronaldo on the left and help out Modric and Alonso defensively too) was a big reason the defence improved and why the team started conceding much less goals and controlled games better. He was brilliant vs Barca in the league and the cup final and vs Atletico in the CL final and the cup semi finals.

Like I said already, he will do a very good job on the wing but his best football so far has come in midfield so even though he will do well on the wing it still seems like a waste to not use him where he is most dangerous, effective and where the full extent of his abilities will be made use of.  It was his performances last year that prompted United to be willing to spend so much. There is no way they would have been willing to have spent 60 million on him for his first three seasons, even though he was still a very good player. At the time Ozil was seen as the better player, but last year Di Maria played at a level that Ozil has yet to reach in his career. There is every chance Di Maria could reach a level on the wing that is higher than what he played at Madrid as he is entering his peak. I can only go from what I have seen from him during his four seasons and 191 games at Madrid. There is still a lot of his career left and plenty of time for him to improve even further and also adapt to new roles.

2710~~~
Thanks for the post <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a>. Explains it far better then I could.

Interesting to note that moving Di Maria into the middle actually made you guys <i>stronger </i>defensively, yet the general consensus on here is that having Di Maria in the middle is a defensive disaster that leaves us far to exposed.

You are free to think whatever you want, but in fact, Angel is absolutely happy of being in Manchester United ❤️... Buenas noches!!! ✨

2712~~~
The thing that annoys me is that people instantly scream BRING HIM BACK TO MIDFIELD. Like thats the sole reason hes playing bad. Plenty of times his position overlaps his old position, and he ruins it from there also. His problem is his decision making and over estimating himself.

Its like it went so amazing last few matches that he thinks he can beat the world on his own all the sudden. The amount of times he has tried to make an impossible dribble even Messi would have said "are you stupid?" too is just insane.

Also his shot accuracy, and amount of miss kicks, and worst of all his corners and free kicks have nothing to do with his position.

2713~~~
It's not about "his position" and how it "overlaps his old position". That's an incredibly short sighted and one dimensional look at things. 

He was playing in a diamond with Blind and Herrera and had people moving around and ahead of him and Shaw offering himself wide. It was a completely different ball game to the isolated and narrow wing play he's being asked to play currently. He could go wide or play one twos through the centre, he had ghost runs ahead of him creating space for him and two or three options any time he lifted his head. 

He's now got the option to pass inside or push up the line and get a cross in. How often are we throwing men into the area to get on the end off them?

2714~~~
I errm didn't realise there has been rumours that he wasn't happy <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2715~~~
I kinda agree with you, he's forcing his dribbing and his shooting. Like he knows he has to carry us or something and it hasn't helped him. He's got great qualities, he just needs to calm down and his football will do the talking.

2716~~~
Agreed with this. He's better centrally - that's fair enough. But that doesn't excuse his poor performances. 
And neither does it mean that he'll suddenly be great every game in the centre, if he goes back there.

2717~~~
Quality player, I prefer it this way as oppose the fantastic first season and then nothing. This experience conversely will give his career longevity here....

2718~~~
Exactly . . . it never entered my head that he might not be happy until I saw that. Now i'm wondering . . .

2719~~~
Paul Scholes claimed in his column last Thursday that Di Maria looked unhappy at Man Utd. Hence the response from Angel's wife.

2720~~~

Di María vs Crystal Palace.

Watching the game, he was given a bit more freedom than some (myself included) thought and I think it's disingenuous to blame his poor performance on his positioning. The basic elements of your game should not suffer when you switch positions.

2721~~~
I just wish he was kept far away from free kicks and corners. His ability to find the first man is amazing.

2722~~~
Not true. He missed the first man on one set piece yesterday - kicked the ball straight out of play instead.

He's obviously extremely talented, so his recent poor performances are all the more puzzling. I think he'll pick up again, but I am a little worried as to whether or not he's suited to the Premier League. Will he really be up for the cold winter games? I'm not certain and if his play doesn't improve, will LvG be brave enough to drop one of our marquee signings?

2723~~~
Take that Scholes!!
Good woman his wife <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2724~~~
No im referring to the countless of people who blame it purely on his position, while its just the general picture of him atm thats wrong. Its not just his position, its his general decision making regardless of where he is on the field.

2725~~~
Its the curse of the number 7! :P

2726~~~
Hopefully Young will free him up to move centrally. As others have said though, not sure why playing a few meters further out would cause him to not be able to pass a ball without giving it away...

2727~~~
Last few games he has been really poor (after a fantastic 1st few weeks). I was at the game on Saturday and he was massively underwhelming. 

Don't buy all the middle vs wing debate - he is a quality player, but regardless of where he plays he needs to complete more dribbles / passes. 

Sure he will come good though...

2728~~~
At the moment you don't want Di Maria centrally, he gives the ball away too easily, and his deep in form, is just Di Maria being Di Maria.

2729~~~
His delivery is amazing from free kicks. Not sure about corners though.

2730~~~
He seemed to be trying too hard at times Saturday and making the wrong decisions. Hanging on to the ball too long and shooting when itwasn't on. Free kick delivery was decent but corners were awful, hence Rooney took over, plus he had gone off!! Who picks up the baton and drives the tempo when he is having an off-game? Well that was clear to see - no-one, hence the laboured struggle on Saturday. A little worrying.

2731~~~
Agreed. His set piece delivery is getting tarred with the same brush. His freekicks are consistently dangerous, even in games where his corners are consistently hitting the first man. I really don't understand what the reason for this is though, as the technique is fairly similar. 

The way the pitch drops away by the corner flags perhaps? Or has he been doing this on pitches where that's not a problem? Proximity to the fans affecting him somehow?

2732~~~
What the feck is wrong with him these past few games? moving him out wide shouldn't turn him into the average player we've seen. It's typical though. More baffling under performance from another one of our top class players.

2733~~~
The thing with Rooney's corners compared to di Maria's, is that even though Rooney consistently drops the ball in the danger area, it's nothing like as dangerous as when di Maria gets his corners right. The way di Maria whips his balls in low and hard make them very difficult to defend and only require a little redirecting to likely score. The downside of this seems to be that it's a much harder technique, so a much higher percentage hit the first man.

2734~~~
Should go back to RVP and Rooney taking corners, they haven't score many corners anyway plus the chances of scoring from their set piece is greater than them in the box and a poor set piece coming in.

2735~~~
I think he just needs to relax a little more. He's trying to do everything himself. He doesn't have to make something brilliant happen *every* time he gets the ball.......

2736~~~
His indirect freekick delivery is mostly very good. Somehow his corners are completely different.

I don't see why he's on direct free kicks over Mata or RVP, or even Rooney. I can't remember seeing Di Maria score many.

2737~~~
He only really became a world class player when he played more centrally. Last season was his best in a central position and again when he started at United in a similar role

Van Gaal seems to have decided that we are not solid enough with Di Maria in that role so he has moved him out to the wing where he is less effective but the overall balance of the team is better.

2738~~~
He was playing with Ronnie to be fair, he wouldn't have got a look in to take free kicks at RM haha

2739~~~
What the feck is wrong with our club management deciding to play players out of position?

2740~~~
Asking a professional footballer to play a position he has previously played literally hundreds of times at the very highest level is really not a good excuse for a crap performance.

The "out of position" moaning is fast becoming my new redcafe bête noir

2741~~~
He is not out of position he can play both centrally and on the wing and he is a very good player in both positions.

However I think fans underestimate how difficult it is to play on the wing for United when you little movement in the rest of the team. What Di Maria and Herrera added to the middle of the park was bags of movement which Fellaini/Carrick/Rooney haven't really offered, makes a wingers job very difficult as they can be double/tripple teamed.

Saying that though his performances haven't been very good and you would expect better BUT definitely not as bad as some are making out, worst player on the pitch blah blah blah nonesense.

The same people complaining about him shooting from 40 yards seem to forget he has 2 assists from shooting from distance already this season, they wern't complaining when he was doing that, and IMO we need more of our attacking players to take shots at goal.

2742~~~
Yes. There are some reasons for Di Maria's subdued performance that are not within his control. Still think putting it entirely down to his position is a cop out though.

2743~~~
I agree, its not soley down to position. I think he has been off colour and also he misses what Herrera brings too.

2744~~~
Need to find the story with LVG commenting on Di Maria not having a lot of space to dribble in, so it's been difficult for him but, that he needs to then learn to make certain passes. He certainly has been trying a bit more on his own but, perhaps that stems from the idea of being a wide player and that's what he thinks his role is. For Mata's goal and leading up to it - when central, he was already trying to work the quicker passing.

Earlier in the season though he was the man picking up the ball deeper and work the passes or drive forward but, at least on Saturday Rooney dominated that role, so obviously wasn't going to have the same impact as those first few games. 

Hopefully LVG will get the team playing a little more through the middle with the quicker passes soon enough and also Di Maria needs to understand just because he is playing wide - he doesn't have to do it on his own as much as he tries. Let the game just come to him and trust in the others around him.

2745~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2014/11/11/6031511/di-maria-used-to-lose-control-says-ancelotti?ICID=HP_BN_1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spai...d-to-lose-control-says-ancelotti?ICID=HP_BN_1</a>

Poor by Ancelotti slamming Di Maria like that.
Di Maria isnt talking about Madrid, dont understand why Ancelotti feels the need to talk about Di Maria.

2746~~~
He's not wrong. Especially this bit, based on what we've seen at United so far.
In view of his praise for Kroos, am I the only one who thinks that he would have been a better signing for United than Di Maria? 

Not that it was necessarily an option but I'm struggling to see the logic in spending so much money on a CM who often misses the target with his passes. Perhaps I'm a bit old school but I like my central midfielders to have pass completion close to 90%. The place for inconsistent and risky passing is not in the centre of midfield IMHO. All well and good in the final third but a serious liability any deeper than that.

The big bonus with Di Maria - or so I thought - was the fact he could also play wide and we were crying out for some more/better options on the wing. Yet now I'm being told/witnessing that he's actually not very good as a winger?

Hmmm....

2747~~~
Big headline for a pretty uncontroversial quote in my opinion. He is obviously just answering questions about James first months as a Real Madrid player. It's not an attack on di Maria at all.

2748~~~
The passing critique is all well and good but then I watch back his performances as a CM against QPR, Leicester and Everton and I don't care. His performances on the left side of the diamond were a thing of beauty, turning past players, regularly beating 2 players, stretching the pitch and moving out wide to collect the ball, and constantly offering an option. I actually think he played as a sort of a winger-cum-CM in the diamond, someone who spent part of his game operating out wide but also drifting into the CM area, and he was ridiculously effective there.

2749~~~
No, reason being Di Maria is very unpredictable. Kroos would have been a great signing for us yes, but he isn't going to draw 2/3 players out of position. We have midfielders who can keep posession Carrick/Blind/Herrera (although the latter is a bit more risky with his passing) you also need one of those midfielders who is going to take risks with the ball.

Like a Hazard, Messi, Di Maria etc otherwise you will be all to predicatable.

Maybe Kroos would have been a better signing than Herrera but to be honest I like Herrera because of his enegery and tenacity.

EDIT: Also we needed PACE!!!

2750~~~
I think that we bought a player who can become a Robben type of player, i don't think that LVG wants Di Maria to play as a CM. And yes Kroos would have been a better option in midfield.

2751~~~
Maybe he's not wrong but I dont understand why is he saying that now..

Di Maria played as a winger till last year when he had great time as a CM.
I think its not that he's not very good as a winger, he's just in a bad form for whatever reason. And I woulndt say he's not playing good cause he's playing is a winger, that would be a cop put, I think you mentioned sthing like that too.

Its not risky passes I think its just that his passing is off.

Maybe Kroos would be a better signing but we have Herrera and I like what Di Maria brings, its just that he's out of form, nothing less nothing more imo.

CM can have a 90 percent pass completion by just passing to the nearest player majority of the game.

2752~~~
It's great to watch but you're basically watching a very good winger playing in central midfield, with all the pros and cons you'd expect from doing that.

It's easier to dribble past players because CMs aren't as good as fullbacks in a one on one and it's easier to "attack the space" because he's not hemmed in by the touchline. To be fair to Di Maria, the one thing he does better than most wingers I've watched is play a killer pass. So that's a bonus. Still not sure it's worth the simple passes misplaced and general lack of shape to our midfield. 

To be honest, I just want to see him play like a very good winger on the wing!

2753~~~
Kroos as a calming influence is fine when you have dynamic players like Ronaldo, Marcelo, Bale, but what we needed was a dynamic player. Of course he will misplace passes, but we didn't buy him to play it safe, we have enough of those!

2754~~~
He is responding to the "fan's frustration" question and answered that Di Maria is a great player who can't provide you any control in midfield, which is true.

2755~~~
Who asked him to respond to fans' frustration anyway? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Any control? I'm sure he can provide some control..

2756~~~
All of whom play out wide, where it's safer to take risks. 

We definitely need a bit more dynamism in their positions (although Shaw is starting to fulfil the Marcelo role). Just a pity that we've not seen much of this from Di Maria.

2757~~~
The journalist ?

And no he can't, Di Maria will always try to dribble his opponents or try a killer ball, it's in his DNA, you can change that but then you won't have the Di Maria that we know.

In reality we needed an other CM(a rythm controller) AND Di Maria.

2758~~~
Isnt Herrera 'a rythim controller'? 

As for journalist and fans frustration or whatever, its just cheap journalism at its best.

2759~~~
Nope. His passing is a bit wayward too.

I think we can play one or other of them in central midfield (Hererra is closer to what you want from a CM) but play both of them together and we lose any semblence of control.

2760~~~
No, Herrera isn't, he is the player who should do Di Maria works in CM, accelerate the play through runs and passes, he is a direct player.
I need to precise that all that, only works if you except to control the game.

2761~~~
De Gea
Rafeal McNair Rojo Shaw
       Blind Carrick
Herrera Rooney Di Maria
         Falcao/RVP

I think if he played left of an attacking 3 with Herrera on the right and Rooney in the middle it could work. Not as a winger but ACM playing on the left side.

Blind and Carrick give you control of the game.

2762~~~
Then Carrick and Blind are rythim controllers..

Dont understand exacltly what that is. Although Herrera is a direct player he can control the rythm of the game too.

2763~~~
He won't do it at the level required, if we want to be a top team. It's like Thiago or Rakitic they can do it, but it's not the best options. And if you decide to use him that way, help him with an other "controller" like Carrick or a box to box who is good at this like Strootman, not with Di Maria.
Just look at who played next to Di Maria last season Modric and Xabi Alonso.

2764~~~
As I said we have Carrick and Blind but then again it's true we need one more CM. 


What I dont get is, and I'm not refering to your post, just in general, is that in games in which he played in CM Di Maria looked great. Since he was shifted to a wing he hasnt looked good, now maybe its because of form only or he's more suited to being in CM but suddenly some people doubt even his role in midfield. Although as I said he looked great playing as a CM, maybe he'll turn out good on the wing or be lousy when shifted back to CM but dont understand doubting his ability in CM too.

2765~~~
Personally i do not put in doubt his qualities as a CM, i just think that we don't have the players to compliment him, and i rate Herrera.
So for me since i rate Di Maria as a winger, i think that we should try to put him AND Herrera in the best disposition by using Di Maria like Robben as an accelerator, an impact player. And use Herrera as an offensive CM with a player who will control our game next to him, maybe Carrick or Strootman.

Basically i don't want us to be like Man city, they play with Fernandinho and Touré none of them can control a game and therefore they are useless in Europe. And Silva is a great at contolling the attacks but he can't do everything.

2766~~~
Ancelotti's comments are pretty accurate, I think.

Di Maria offers a lot of qualities that few other midfielders possess. His mixture of dynamism, stamina, work rate and ability to step up in big games makes him a fairly unique player in a lot of ways.

Control isn't his strong point though, nor would you really expect it to be given he started as a winger. Playing alongside Alonso and Modric was pretty much perfect for him as they provided a lot of the qualities he lacked and vice versa.

It's hard to see who we can play alongside him here who will provide that same level of control and allow him to flourish. Plus the lack of balance in the squad is such that we'd probably need to bring in another winger as well if we want to shift Di Maria back into his best position in a 4-3-3. Not ideal.

I think you could probably get away with a Herrera/X/Di Maria midfield if you brought in the right type and calibre of player for that final position but it would have to be a very specific sort of player. With that in mind I'm not sure Strootman is the answer either really. He's hardly the sort of player who'll provide that Alonso/Modric type control in CM, is he? Nor is he the sort of sitting DM who'll shore us up defensively....

2767~~~
I don't think you could come up with a better example of that specific sort of player than Blind of Carrick but I reckon it still won't work.

You can afford to have one risk-taking progressive central midfielder in your team. Two if you're lucky enough to find one of those rare breeds of CMs who is progressive and attacking while also being a very consistent passer and almost never giving the ball away cheaply (a la Modric)

I guess it's possible that Hererra could develop into our own Luka Modric but he's looked a little bit flaky to wear that mantle in his United career so far (plus I think his pass completion stats were fairly ordinary in Spain too) As it stands, playing Hererra and Di Maria in central midfield together would be a recipe for disaster against any half-decent team IMO. Which is a bit mental when you consider we've paid not far off 100m for the pair!

2768~~~
Ancelotti's comments read like someone who is retrospectively trying to justify selling Di Maria - never mind all the other positive qualities he brought to Madrid.

2769~~~
Great start for the lad as expected, loss of form come Autumn / Winter which is normal for his build and play style. I am confident that after his first season in the rainy cold north west, he will flourish Feb time and capture all of our hearts once again.

2770~~~
We actually need him to flourish a little sooner than February...

Not to mention that he's at the wrong club if cold wet weather affects his form!

2771~~~
Can't wait to see him playing back in Europe! (pls don't screw it up for a second season Utd)

I can see a few players in the squad only being able to show their best form once Utd are playing in the CL again...more space, slower tempo (in particular games of course) would suit Mata/Herrera/Blind/Herrera perfectly..add Falcao and the future is so exciting.

2772~~~
Does anybody else think he should be given the free role in the team? 

I think he would suit the diamond 10 position better. He seems to be using too much energy up chasing the fullbacks, and then doesn't seem fresh when its time to counter or do something energetic. 

Let Herrera/Januzaj/Valencia do the wide midfield roles, hell even give Di Maria a striker position and leave Rooney, or Falcao up top.

2773~~~
Hhhmmm, not sure I'd be happy a £60 million player is affected by weather.

2774~~~
That makes no sense, some helicopters cost millions and they are affected by the weather or you can't launch a rocket if there is little bit of wind. It's just how it is.

2775~~~
Are we really comparing football players to helicopters?

2776~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> I'm just kidding.

2777~~~
He's just going through a wee blip after an exceptional start to his United career. I don't think it's anything to be overly worried about. Also, I don't think it's entirely down to Di Maria as he's been shifted out wide after excelling on the left of a midfield diamond so Van Gaal has to take some of the responsibility.

Hopefully we go back to the diamond and Di Maria rediscovers that blistering form he demonstrated when he first arrived. I don't think it's hyperbole to say that, on his day, he can win games on his own. He's up there with Sanchez, Hazard, Ageuro in terms of the best players in the league IMO.

2778~~~
Wasted on me. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2779~~~
He hasn't been that bad (apart from the corners), its just that he hasn't been able to do what he is normally capable of. He has always had that when he played as a winger, only last year he became much more consistent. Its his best that is untouchable which makes his okay days seem  poor.

2780~~~
Play him in a 4-3-3 as he did last season.

---------------De Gea----------------
RB---------CB----------CB------Shaw
------Herrera--Blind-- Di Maria--------
Mata----------Rooney---------Januzaj

2781~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thesportbible.com/articles/man-utd-s-worst-passer-has-been-revealed-and-it-s-surprising" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thesportbible.com/articles/man-utd-s-worst-passer-has-been-revealed-and-it-s-surprising</a>

2782~~~
He plays riskier passes, thats why he has created more chances than anyone in the team too.

2783~~~
And that's why he can easily be a liability in center midfield.

2784~~~
I take that point, but I've noticed he gives away possession cheaply, at times. He misplaces the simple passes and is successful with the harder ones. His decision making also seems to be suspect. I.e., when to run with the ball, when to pass, etc.

2785~~~
Depends how you set the team up IMO.

2786~~~
Yeah he has a few times I agree, but I'd still have him in there given some of the passes I've seen him pick out already, especially to RVP.

2787~~~
Obviously, if you have a goalscoring machine like Ronaldo or a defense like Atletico Madrid you can support that but all the other teams will struggle.

2788~~~
Surely it aint that clear cut, if he can play CM in a 3 with 1 more defensive minded player and another one who can retain possesion well, I think thats ok.

Anyway I guess this season we will find out.

2789~~~
Yep, flash backs of Nani almost.
Since we've put him on the wing he's looked the inconsistent player who was in & out in his first few years at Real, rather than his stellar last year playing through the middle.

2790~~~
Ye, me too. I'd still have him in centre midfield, but I guess we'd have to find that balance that compliments Di Maria's style. Preferably, two accomplished passers of the ball, with calmness and composure, which would explain why he shone in a midfield three with Alonso and Modric - two pass masters, who are great at keeping possession. Having said that, I thought he was fine when we played a midfield three of Blind, Di Maria and Herrera.

2791~~~
While that should work out on most occasions, the top teams will plan around exploiting that. Its the same with Fabregas at Chelsea, he's not working both ways like Ander for example and so the top teams will try to play on the fact Cesc wont be tracking his runner all the way back

2792~~~
Granted he's been a lot better in the middle, what confuses me is, whilst playing on the wing, he's been given the license to cut in to middle quite a lot, with the width coming from Januzaj on the other side, which is often where he's been dispossessed or misplaced a pass, so it's not like he's been told to hug the touchline. Hopefully it's just a form thing, but I would like to see him back in the middle.

2793~~~
Cesc isn't playing with 2 defensive minded CMs just one though thats the issue there.

2794~~~
Thats true, altough that defensive minded midfielder is the best one in the league in front of the most solid defence and it can still be an issue, but I think my point persists

If you have a central midfielder who doesn't defend, your opponent will seek to jump on that oppertunity and the best teams have players who will make it count.

There's always going to be some space left behind by such a player and it can cost you. The trade-off is that while they will cost you a goal at the back, they'll create two going forward and you'll outscore your opponent. The trouble is you cant afford any off days when that kind of player doesnt bring anything going forward but still costs you at the back.

I think longterm we'll end up with another proper CM who goes both ways on the left and Di Maria will be pushed further forward where its not a concern. Giving him tactical freedom he can still naturally pull wide to put his crosses in, he just wont be asked to follow runners back

2795~~~
I don't think that Di Maria problems are defensive, the main problem is that he gives away the possession in dangerous situation or areas even in his good days, most of the time in champions league or against a realistic team you will pay that.
So if you can avoid that it's a good thing and there is players who can create a lot (obviously less than Di Maria) and have a cleaner passing game.

2796~~~
We've somehow turned him into Fellaini's assistant, all he's told to do is look for Fellaini's head when he gets the ball.

What a waste.

2797~~~
But... Fellaini is in great form and has valiantly taken Herrera's spot?! Seriously, though. It's not much of a coincidence that when we start playing basic, more 'physical' in our football that Di Maria struggles.

2798~~~
Cmon, mate. Surely us playing more 'physical' football (although our football hasn't changed since Fellaini's come into the team) doesn't make Di Maria overrun the ball or misplace simple passes.

2799~~~
Everyone goes straight to the stats of "Oh Di Maria has the worst pass completion of anyone hurrrr."

It's because he's the only one in the team that will try risky passes anymore.

2800~~~
What would you rather have? Antonio Valencia passing the ball to the goalkeeper from the centre circle or Di Maria trying to create chances with his passing? It's a no brainer really. If RVP wasn't shitting himself in front of goal Di Maria would have 3/4 more assist to his credit.

2801~~~
Heh. It's Fellaini's fault that Di  Maria is playing badly. Flawless logic.

2802~~~
A pragmatic aimless approach in asking Di Maria to constantly launch balls toward Fellaini and a serverely out-of-form RvP is going to improve his play, is it? I don't care about the misplaced short passes or the failed dribbles; that's what you get with a player like Di Maria, but there's quite clearly a reason his end product has suffered recently and its the tactical set-up. There's nobody for him to play neat one-two's with, he hasn't the space through the middle to run from inside to out. I'm not really trying to palm blame because he clearly does look a tier below his usual self, but the 4141 is not helping, I don't even think it's a case of position, the personnel seems just as important. We zipped the ball a lot quicker with Herrera in the side, and that really helps Di Maria.

2803~~~
That didn't happen though, did it. I don't remember Di Maria constantly launching long balls anywhere, never mind in Fellaini's direction. Other than set-pieces anyway. Which seems to be when we're most threatening these days.

I just think Fellaini is getting stick for stuff which is completely beyond his control. Van Gaal himself has admitted to completely changing our approach to tighten things up defensively after conceding too many soft goals. He's even admitted that we've possibly gone to far to the other extreme. This change in approach obviously goes beyond dropping Hererra for Fellaini and will involve all of the players following strict instructions from the manager about exactly how gung ho they're allowed to be when we're in possession. Hence you see Di Maria getting criticised for taking too many people on and not playing the simple pass.

Our slightly toothless football is clearly a result of the team doing what the manager wants and there's no reason to assume we can't be a lot more attacking if Van Gaal lets his team off the leash, whether or not Fellaini's on the pitch.

2804~~~
I don't think he was launching balls at Fellaini, but he was definately launching early crosses into the box (like he had been told to) and no one was really making runs in the box to get on the end of the crosses, this stuck out to me quick clearly

2805~~~
He's been doing that from day one, though. The quality of cross he's putting in does seem to have declined a little bit, mind you.

2806~~~
I'm not sure if the quality of crosses has decreased but the effectiveness has, largely because he only has one striker in the box to aim for who isn't particularly good in the air and doesn't have the movement of Falcao or Hernandez.

I didn't see much of Di Maria last season and before he joined United had largely only seen him play as a winger. I was amazed how good he looked in the more central role on the left of the diamond. It would be a shame if the intention is not to play him there long term.

2807~~~
Definitely a big factor, agreed.

2808~~~
Crossing into the box should never be the tactics when we're using van Persie up front, we should keep the ball on the ground which seems to be impossible right now (has been for a few years).

2809~~~
Really needs to play centrally more. Was so good there for RM. I understand he can be used on the wing but it limits his effectiveness for us, because we lack the drive in midfield. 

Hope he plays there against Arsenal

2810~~~
So. Did anyone watch the Argenitina game? Apparently was left of a front three for them.

2811~~~
Di Maria's always been at his best when he's had the license to cut in and get involved in the middle. He's a good crosser of the ball, but his crosses are quite erratic and wild. He's always been at his best when he's not expected to cross the ball regularly. However, given how little support he gets at the wide areas, he really can't cut in as we'd then be congested through the middle. It's no wonder we've seen him stay out wide so much except against Crystal Palace when Shaw did a very good job providing the width, allowing di Maria to cut in (too bad he only had van Persie as an option).

In Benfica, he was at his best on the right where he could not only stretch the play and put some nice crosses in but also cut into his dangerous left foot. In Real Madrid, he was often at his best when he was allowed to cut into the middle (from the right or left) and not just regularly deliver crosses from the wide areas. It's why he was amazing in the pseudo-central midfield role he played last season as he could start from the middle and play through there or (as he did more often) go out wide and stretch the opposition, giving him the space to run past players and wreak havoc.

Right now, di Maria's been too isolated in the past matches (other than Crystal Palace). Keeping him stuck out wide and expecting him to dribble past 2-3 players with little space ahead of him is never going to work, nor is trying to cross the ball frequently from the left going to work.

2812~~~
Give Di Maria a free role or Centre the attack around him. He's too good to play second fiddle to anyone.

I'd like to see Di Maria , Rooney and Nani or someone similar as a devastating front 3 like our cl winning side with Rooney Ronaldo and Tevez. Skill, hard working and devastating on the counter.

I'm not a fan of this 2 striker system. I think it can only work with a Chicharito type fast poacher specialist. LVG has his work cut out for him.

2813~~~
Partly true

He also has a tendancy to mess up some of the simpler passes

2814~~~
He did this in the Champions League final too

Which leads me to believe its Di Maria's own initiative to put the ball in towards the forwards with crosses early and often

He tried 23 crosses vs Atletico in the final. Yes 23! with 6 finding a teammate.

A lot of them seemed like wishful thinking, but he walked away with the man of the match and Real Madrid as the champs

2815~~~
He destroyed Germany a couple months ago playing on the wing, assisting three and scoring one, IIRC, so there's no excuses for his below par performances in the wide areas for us.

2816~~~
Apart from him being a human and not a robot.

Players are allowed to have bad patches of form from time to time.

2817~~~
Ye, I completely agree. I just don't buy the 'he's not playing good because he's playing on the wing' excuse, because the guy grew up playing as a winger.

2818~~~
What's that got to do with anything?

Schweinsteiger started out as a fullback before making a name for himself as a winger. It was relatively late that he was moved central and made a name for himself as a world class midfielder. 

Would you expect him to perform the same as he does in CM now if you moved him out wide?

Di Maria is a top class central midfielder and an inconsistent winger. The two positions offer him such different options throught the game that you can't expect him to be switched and excel in both.

2819~~~
What a terrible comparison. Schweinsteiger has been a centre midfielder for very long now, and as far as I'm concerned, hasn't played on the wing for ages, which would explain a dip in performance, had he got played there. Di Maria, on the other hand, although clearly better in centre midfield, still plays his fair share of games on the wing for, both country, and Madrid last season.

You also can't forget Di Maria got a transfer to Madrid as a winger, so he couldn't have been bad there.

2820~~~
It's got absolutely nothing to do with how long it's been since they played there. It's all to do with the respective roles and how well they suit them.

In a wing position, Di Maria is generally isolated and expected to beat a man and cross. His starting position is from wide where he has 50% less of the field available to him to use in one way or another. It's less space to run into and less options to pass to or dummy a pass to. If he wants to get the ball to a forward, the only route he has is a cross or a diagonal pass. The only real link up is simple one twos with his fullback or closest midfielder.

Contrast that to a central position we he had a spectrum of passes available to him, to the wide areas, to his fellow CM's or to his forwards. If he dribbles from central he can exploit whatever space is available ahead and around him, it doesn't restrict his vision on the same way the wing does.

It doesn't matter how recently he played wing, it's still a completely different position to CM and as a result suits him much more so it's no surprise that he excels centrally and is inconsistent out wide.

2821~~~
Its pretty obvious that his best position is in the middle the evidence is right there in front of your eyes. Anyone arguing otherwise is just intentionally trying to play devils advocate, or doesn't know much about the lad. Also, the people saying 'oh there's hardly any difference in position' are also being pretty stupid. There is a a massive difference between playing out on the left wing, and as part of a midfield three. Especially the for the way Di Maria plays it, and for a player that is so one footed (although not in a bad way like Valencia).

Just look at the facts. Di Maria, up until last season was highly talented, but largely inconsistent winger for Madrid. He wasn't ever considered world class, or one of the best wingers in the game (albeit a very good one still). The he moves inside, has his most successful season ever, is regarded as one of the most important players in Madrid's CL win, and starts climbing into that 'world class' category. Then he moves to United, starts the season in the middle, carrying with him his Madrid form and instantly looking like our best players. After a few games he is moved back out wide, and surprise surprise, looks less effective and far more inconsistent.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to notice the trend. Some players just excel in some possessions, and not in others. He's still a good winger, but he's a far far better midfielder.

2822~~~
You're completely missing my point, though, and telling me about the difference from wing to centre midfield. I already know that. What i'm saying is, Di Maria has, and still does, produce great performances on the wing for his country (Germany vs Argentina) and did for Madrid last season, so when he doesn't for us, rather than saying it's because he's better in centre midfield, just say it's because he had a bad game.

2823~~~
Of course he can still produce great performances on the wing, but history would suggest they'll be far less frequent them when he plays in the centre (He's also more likely to go missing in the big games).

2824~~~
...and he's going to have more bad performances on the wing than he will in midfield... because he's a better midfielder than he is a winger. It's really, really simple.

2825~~~
Every time a player's thread is bumped, I expect to read that he's got injured.

2826~~~
He was on the right in the recent tie against Germany, too. Has he played there for us yet?

2827~~~
It shouldn't be. From when he can produce very good performances on the wing, there shouldn't be any reasons why he can't keep producing that, otherwise he'll just be another Nani, because I doubt Van Gaal will put him back in midfield (as much as I want it) because he identified him as a top winger, saying 'we don't have wingers of the highest level, like Ronaldo or Di Maria or somebody like that'. 

Hopefully, Van Gaal himself will notice this, and instead of getting another centre midfielder in January/Summer, he'll get another winger and put Di Maria back in the middle.

2828~~~
Went there a for a bit against Chelsea and City, IIRC. I'd like to see him play a full game there, though. If we need someone to cut in from the left flank, we should try Mata there - similar to how City use Silva.

2829~~~
This is what Van Gaal said when we signed him..

<b>Louis van Gaal</b> said: "Angel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player.''

I also seem to remember some quotes about him being a central midfielder who could also play on the wing.

2830~~~
Lets hope he put him back there then.

2831~~~
I really hope he does. We need to build a team around him imo.

2832~~~
I'm sure many will not like this:

2833~~~
Don't really care as long as he wins games for us.

2834~~~
Send him back to Madrid! He is still under guarantee ?

2835~~~
I'm sure he'll love it here when we start winning and actually playing well. His wife says she' happy and what could the French League offer over the Prem?

2836~~~
I would love to see a front four of Rooney, Nani, Januzaj and ADM.

Fast, direct, attacking football with players who can actually take on a defender..... Plus Rooney.

2837~~~
Jesting, yes? Rooney has always been a key part of our fast, direct attacking football for many years. If anything, I'd rather see a Nani (seeing as he is our only other winger capable), Di Maria and Rooney front three with Herrera in behind. That would be fast, direct, and attacking.

2838~~~
I honestly don't think LVG would have gone for Di Maria had he been given carte blanche and a host of world class midfielders to sign, however he will use him to his strengths as an occasional match winner. Di Maria is likely to win us more points that anyone else this season, but in the long run his is a long way from being a utilitarian player the kind of which Van Gaal covets. He gives the ball away far too easily and is about as useful as an ash tray on a motorcycle when it comes to defending, but his creative output balances out his shortcomings. 

He is still adapting to the premier league but if we are to allow for all of his bad traits, he has to be consistent with his assisting and goal scoring. In the first few games no one even cared that he misplaced half of his passes and left his full backs exposed, but now his finishing and through balls/crossing have started to dry up we are now focusing on the bad things.

The problem with Di Maria will always be his inconsistency, a fact Ancelotti has alluded to. I believe if and when we start to recover our place in the league, playing well and dominating games, Di Maria will find his comfort zone again, but he is certainly not a player who will fit well into a struggling shower of shit and drag us through games.

2839~~~
It's a myth as long as players win games for us, nothing else matters. It's also a paradox because at United, we always always had this tradition/quality unlike that of city and Chelsea. Passion for the club and knowing they are playing in one of the best club in the world give them that extra edge to win in close games and to come back in injury times (the "come back king" rings any bell?)

It's almost an insult to have players openly saying things like this and PSG? Christ! I don't recall any United player past and present speaking about their future at United in such contempt! Sir Alex would never ever let that happen. LvG must do something to keep players' confidence in the club. Sigh

2840~~~
Unimpressed with his recent interview, the arse wanna start performing.

2841~~~
He sounds like a bit of a knob head. Needs to pick up his game the little noodle feck.

2842~~~
I don't think he needs to play central like some have claimed I just think he needs to play deeper - in the midfield three rather than the front three. The difference is that in the midfield three he gets the ball from the defenders or Blind with little pressure on him and he is then able to run at the opposition which is his biggest strength, the opposition either has to keep backing off or foul him and give away a free kick. In the front three he is receiving the ball in a more congested area, the opposition full back is tighter to him and he's often doubled up on and as soon as he tried to dribble he is more likely to lose the ball. We're effectively nullifying his biggest threat by playing him on the wing. I understand why LvG tried it though, to try to improve the balance which was necessary, but I just don't think we've solved the conundrum yet. We might be conceding less but we are less threatening. We need to have Di Maria back in the midfield three but have someone cover when he bombs forward otherwise Shaw will be too exposed.

2843~~~
He was talking on a French TV show to be fair

2844~~~
Its no surprise that players dont give a toss about what badge they play for, but he could at least pretend hes not going anywhere, instead of trying to set himself a new transfer in a few years, its a bit early to be courting clubs already

2845~~~
No big deal with what he said really, can't expect all our players to fall in love with the club as soon as they sign for us, and as has already been said he was talking to French TV, if he had signed for PSG and then been interviewed by the English TV i've no doubt he would have said similar things about us.

Reality is he signed a 5 year contract, worst case we can keep him for 3-4 years and then flog him on to some semi retirement club and replace.

2846~~~
Considering his form in the last few games, maybe he should focus more on his game at United than talking about PSG in interviews.

2847~~~
He's on a long-term deal and if he gets sold for a high fee maybe 3-4 years down the road, I won't really mind. Anyways, he only came to us after Madrid purchased Rodriguez, don't really think he has passion for our club besides wanting to win and gain honours.

2848~~~
Get used to it. If we're not in the CL again expect a few more talking like this. These players aren't fans of this club, if they can be paid the same and compete for trophies and play CL football every season they'll leave wet and windy Manchester in a heart beat.

The days of player loyalty are dead.

2849~~~
It's not that much that days of player loyalty are dead, they were actually never there in recent decades (at least not in the last 20-25 years since money started dominating football). 

It's only that at United we usually had British star players who didn't dream about foreign clubs. But go to Italy/Spain even one or two decades back and a lot of their clubs' players (especially South Americans) have played for various Italian/Spanish clubs. If we have had Figo or the Brazilian Ronaldo back then, we would have had similar stuff in every international break. It was the same with our Ronaldo, almost every international break he gave interviews or there were rumours. 
It's really natural and understandable, when they are in England their home media don't get many opportunities to interview, so once they are on international duty the interviews/questions keep coming and the players who are neither English nor have they been in England long enough are not going to keep their mouth shut all the time.

I said this before we were linked with all those foreign superstars: We want them? Fair enough! But then also get used to all the talk which comes with them and which the English players usually don't talk about.

2850~~~
Care to explain this part?

2851~~~
Fecking hell. Talk about being diplomatic. He's lucky he gets to play for such a big club like Utd, and wear the iconic number 7 shirt.

2852~~~
He's been here for 7 matches or so and he's already starting this crap?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Manchester weather must already be getting to him

2853~~~
are we sure that interview is legit? sometimes words get lost in translation...

2854~~~
I'm not sure people need to be having hissy fits over that interview. He and his wife have said numerous times that he's happy here. I don't know why he was being interviewed on French TV but it simply seemed as if he was just trying to be diplomatic, not looking to force an exit.

2855~~~
Not looking to force an exit?!....The future?! God only knows <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2856~~~
Very unimpressed from his latest interview. Came here for record money, played 5 good games and another 3 shit ones and already whining.

Well, next year ask Paris for the money we paid to Madrid if he really wants to enjoy Ligue 1.

2857~~~
Not bothered. We're entering a new era where players will come and go. Just like other clubs. De Gea, Shaw Januzaj and Wilson will be the ones who should be a part of future United teams to come. Young, determined, full of potential. Others like Herrera, Rafael, Di Maria, Jones ideally will progress and still be key parts of our squad at least. RVP, Rooney, Carrick entering their final stages. Mata, Rojo, Smalling, Evans, Blind, Fellaini I feel will be phased out the door.

2858~~~
Not surprising and it's better to be honest. Atleast it was clear to me while the transfer unfolded that he indeed wanted Psg at the beginning for  whatever reason and it's perfectly normal. But even in this interview he does mention the perseverance of United actually made him choose us. I don't see much wrong really, he is not a united fan like you and I who dreamt of only playing here. We are also not giving him European football which a player like him deserves. He is a smashing player and we should get the best out of him for however long he stays. When he moves, he moves. Things change fast in modern football, a year or two  down the line Adm could completely be a united through and through or looking to change clubs. But, it's hardly out of the ordinary.

2859~~~
To think EVERY player signing for us (especially foreigners) has a passion for the club is another myth! In fact, it is naive to think that way. My point was how United has now let players say out loud like that, and LvG is one reason this happened. 

Why? Well, Sir Alex would always always instil into players the notion that playing for United was a privilege and anything other than winning was not acceptable and they are here to taste medals. United players in the past would almost always regard (and want) United as their last club (As long as they keep playing for medals). Winning should be in their bones and going elsewhere is never on the card unless they are not good enough. That's my point.

2860~~~
IS it not fair to describe Chelsea as the club who has first started to be spending obscene money to buy players and managers since Abramovich's purchase of the club?

2861~~~
Firstly, United started spending obscene amounts to buy players like Rio, Veron, Rooney, etc.

Secondly, this was not what was said above. What you said is that Chelsea players play for money and not for passion for the club.

2862~~~
It's hardly surprising, do people really think we can keep hold of players like Di Maria if we stay out of the champions league? A couple of years maybe, but in order to have the best players you have to be one of the best teams, simple as. We'll be fine though, seems like a nothing interview.

2863~~~
My point still stands, because in comparison (at least during SAF era) we had players who are more passionate than Chelsea.

2864~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2865~~~
So you are telling me that players like Terry, Carvalho, Lampard, Drogba, Cech, Essein, Ballack, etc played for Chelsea for all those years without passion?

2866~~~
I truly believe that if United there and then offered these players more monies to play under SAF at United, they would all have switched some point or another in a heart beat. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

But you can't say it about our players the other way round

2867~~~
You are overestimating our players loyalty, United pay very well and was a very successful club under SAF. They were no reasons for them to go anywhere.

2868~~~
Hang on... is ADM <b>not </b>injured?

This is great news!  

I saw his thread had been bumped and just assumed...

2869~~~
You can never be too sure at this point <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2870~~~
Being just one of the best teams wouldn't be enough for a lot of the best players either though and many will start getting itchy feet if they aren't doing laps of a pitch parading a big trophy at the end of the season and Di Maria strikes me as one of these lads so it'll probably take more than qualifying for champions leagues when it comes to holding onto him. Not an interview I'd be taking with a pinch of salt.

2871~~~
That's what I mean, one of the best teams as in competing and winning trophies. Otherwise the best players will look to go to a club where they will be winning trophies.

2872~~~
Should be fined for these comments, why are footballers so thick. I'm not going to pretend I thought he would be loyal but 3 months in and he whoring himself to PSG already...

Shut the feck up and practice your corners because they are absolutely toss.

2873~~~
I don't dispute that. But overestimating or not, it doesn't negate my statement about city and Chelsea. Also bearing in mind some of those loyalty were towards SAF and since his retirement, those loyalty has become shaky. I feel dreaded to think this "loyalty" thing is gradually leaving us, and it will be naive to think LvG can even replicate a tiny fraction of SAF's charisma and winning mentality that have retained confidence and loyalty from players all these years.

RvP's "loyalty" would have lost since the day SAF's retirement and this year he's still playing for us only because of his special relationship with LvG. Otherwise, he might have moved already

2874~~~
He has been here for 3 months for godsake.

Showing absolutely no class imo.

2875~~~
Well said!!! 

And of course I can't find any justification for him to take our corners anymore if he's not improved.

On a different note, just saw this headline and was feeling so down beat. Carrick just got back in the side and he quickly made some very damning observation. Made us miss SAF even more: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/michael-carrick-warns-manchester-uniteds-4637364" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/michael-carrick-warns-manchester-uniteds-4637364</a>
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Michael Carrick warns Manchester United's attacking legacy is a thing of the past under Louis van Gaal</b></span>

2876~~~
Read his whole interview. I can live with it, up to you if you feel so bad, nothings going to change.

2877~~~
It was obvious in the summer he wanted to go to PSG, and that FFP was the stumbling block. This was widely reported.  I'm surprised he admitted it but as long as he gets back to doing the business for us then I don't really care.

2878~~~
Get a grip fellas. At least let's all look at the actual interview and the context of the whole thing before passing judgement. The guy has just moved to MCR and still finding his feet - Interviews that have the interviewer fishing for these kinds of answers are always going to end this way if a guy isn't feeling 100% with the move. Chill the hell out.

2879~~~
Unlike you with your classy posts.

2880~~~
That's why I would prefer to still have Welbeck not him.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Kidding</span>

2881~~~
You are right he's not United fan first and foremost and few players were before they joined. Thing is, once they joined, unless they have issues with the club/manager/colleagues/staff/or family issues etc, they should shut up and play their best for the club. It's not like they were conned into signing and suddenly remember/informed they are not playing in Europe this term. I see many thing wrong with being "honest" "outspoken" and predicting the future when he's only been here a few months. 

If LvG did not see this as an issue, I think he had better rethink and reassess his own management style why he has all these quality players on paper and yet we are now close to mid table and Christmas is almost here. Sigh

2882~~~
Eh?

I'm not pretending to be classy yet this guy signed a year contract 3 months ago, was our record signing and is already saying shit about PSG.

Call me crazy but he didn't have to give the interview, or perhaps word his answers that don't make him look like a mercenary.

2883~~~
Here here! Pain me to say, but whose stupid decision to let Welbeck go?! I am sure even he was desperate to leave, he could have been convinced to stay.

2884~~~
What stupid interview to give, mate if you really want to play in the French league so badly, then you're more than welcome to feck of to PSG in the summer, I'm sure they will pay the £60/£70million required, and if he helps us get back into the top4 this season then no hard feelings. Really can't stand it when players give stupid interviews like that one, I hope he performs to his price tag against Arsenal.....

2885~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2886~~~
Are we intentionally avoiding the bit that isn't quoted by the press and was retweeted by Caf's twitter account?

2887~~~
So what?, he just stated he wouldn't have come here if PSG could have afforded him so that part is irrelevant.

2888~~~
Stop jumping to conclusion based on headline grabbing interviews ffs. As I said, he gave an interview explaining what led him to manchester. Nothing there was new for me. If you have read the bit about when he reiterates how United were the only one that stayed for him and made him come here, this would sound a lot less blasphemous than most people seem to think.  A lot of footballers don't commit about their future these days, it's hardly earth shattering. I only care about his performance for the club as long as he is here, that is all.

2889~~~
I just wish players could use their heads when giving interviews. This isn't that bad though.

2890~~~
He just said that we've shown the biggest desire to get him and therefore he joined us. Rest is irrelevant.

See? I can play this game too.

2891~~~
You only got to know this now? have you been sleeping during the transfer window?

2892~~~
They offered CL footy, basically at least one guaranteed domestic trophy per season, and better weather in a nicer city to live in. I don't hold anything against him for saying that part.

2893~~~
No just log off, you're terrible at this game. 

He just said he only joined us because PSG couldn't afford him, if you don't know what that means then whatever.

2894~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2895~~~
Has anyone here ever been to Manchester? It's actually a pretty nice city and some places like Chesire have beautiful houses and I'm sure most people would live there, I doubt it's really a city thing. Fair enough about the weather <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2896~~~
That's hardly a criticism of Manchester... Have you ever been to Paris?!

2897~~~
Yes I have, 4 times actually, and other than the central part, it's hardly that much better than Manchester, the weather wasn't great either.

2898~~~
Yes it's easy to say you only care about his performance and nothing else. Fact of matter is at united (and many other clubs) if you have your mind set elsewhere how can you preform your best? 

If you don't read between the lines of interviews like that, you're naive. And if his mindset is like that in the dressing room has it ever crossed your mind that it would have negative effect (saying you might leave for PSG because it's the club you have meant to join initially)? 

These players should be told (by manager and fans) it's not helping the team when you answer questions that way. I know players aren't exactly the most diplomatic, but why is it so hard to say, "I am playing for united and am doing my best. PSG was the club I had wanted to join but I am a united player and I will do my utmost to win games.  

Why couldn't they do just that? Was it not true if they did say it that way? Made you wonder to he honest what's going on in the dressing room

2899~~~
To be fair it's been pissing down every time I've been to Manchester and beautiful when I was in Paris, so maybe that has skewed my opinion. Anyway I think it was fair to say a millionaire footballer would prefer to live in Paris than Manchester, if the choice were as simple as that.

2900~~~
You would prefer Welbeck over Di Maria? Holy feck 
White text cnut <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2901~~~
Can't see the problem with the interview - seems to be simply a statement of the facts as they unfolded. 

I never understand why some think players should care as much about the club they play for as fans do. This is a global game now and players move clubs on a regular basis - they can't support all the clubs they play for. The sooner fans realise it's a big business, and players (on the whole) are simply employees that change club the way the rest of us change employers, the sooner they'll stop having unrealistic expectations of players and being so disappointed. All fans can ask is that players perform to the best of their ability while the club employs them.

2902~~~
There could be a dozen reasons why he said what he said and one of them being the man I've highlighted there above. If Di Maria was here this time last year when we were 150 million quid better off and in no better a position you can be damn sure it be have been ''Get fckin' Moyes out quick before more lads start dreaming of living beneath the Eifel tower'' job now. There's only one way to keep players like Di Maria's mouth shut so Louis better start pulling up his socks.

2903~~~
All I will say is, you are overreacting way too much. And I have absolutely no idea what makes you believe that ADM isn't going to give his best. That interview certainly doesn't suggest that.

2904~~~
You were not reading carefully. And your mind is shut.

Being in the position we are in right now, players should be more careful not to affect team morale (granted it's the manger's job and I reiterate LvG should make sure their players are all in this together).

It was not a harmless remark like you want to think. And I wasn't over reacting (I didn't call for his head or asking him to be oust but he does need a word to his ear we are now very vulnerable and teams coming to us are not afraid any more. He's part of the set up to generate fear for the opposite teams, not giving them more confidence to beat us! Are we clear??

2905~~~
Let's agree to disagree about the repercussions of his interview then and hope he delivers where it matters most. Good night.

2906~~~
Let's be honest if this was a quote from a player that City or Liverpool bought for 50 mil 3 months ago, we would be pissing ourselves.

2907~~~
Weird, I was just thinking the other day that he hasn't looked like he's enjoying himself here so far. Not compared to when he was at Madrid, or when you look at what our other signings are saying about playing here. The interview pretty much confirms what I expected, he signed because he basically had no other option.

2908~~~
Just a bit odd really, his early interviews were all:

"Manchester United was the only club I'd ever leave Madrid for"
"It's a dream to play for United"

Now it's all:

"Yeah the only reason I didn't join PSG was money problems"
"The French league is great and everyone wants to play there maybe I will play there sometime in the future"
"But I am at Manchester United and I am happy... for now"

etc


hmm....

2909~~~
didnt someone say a few weeks ago he looked unhappy? Neville i think

2910~~~
Scholesey

2911~~~
He's made himself look a complete cnut. A disrespectful one as well.

Wasn't it only a few months back that he said that as soon as United  became interested he didn't want to go any where else?

2912~~~
It was pretty obvious that he was just doing what most footballers do and tell the supporters what they wanted to hear. It was very easy to follow his transfer story where PSG looked like they had him for a long while and then werent able to, leaving the door open for us.

If you believed Di Maria's convenient version he told when he signed, I dont feel sorry for you. He might as well have been saying the world is flat

2913~~~
Look, nobody here expected him signing to be out of his love and passion for Manchester United, but at the end of the day, after you sign you have to at least pretend that you did. He could have easily said, "I'm a Manchester United player and PSG doesn't interest me now. What's done is done. I'm happy here, bla bla bla.".

I personally don't care, if before signing for us, he wanted to sign for fecking Liverpool, but comments like this? It damages the morale of not only the supporters, but his fellow players also. Now I'm left wondering, if he is <b>really</b> happy here, like his wife says, or just wants to move at the first opportunity he gets.

2914~~~
I didnt say he's not wrong to do it.

I said its our own fault if we want to believe in fantastical tales that dont tally with all the stories that were common knowlege before then. If you disregarded all the PSG stuff, its because you wanted to believe in what best suits the club or yourself. Not so much being interested in the truth

2915~~~
I don't think you understood what I wrote. I don't think anybody here expected him to sign for Manchester United because he is a fan, but he should have kept his mouth shut and just perform. If he wants to go at the end of the season, fine, but until then - have the decency to just shut up and play for the team that you're playing for.

That's like Falcao giving an interview on how Real rejected him and he had no other choice, but to sign for United. We know that's what most likely happened, but that doesn't mean he should flat out and tell us.

2916~~~
Player gives silly interview in international break shocker.

2917~~~
Why not? Some people appreciate honesty

Which by the way, is not what Di Maria practiced

2918~~~
There is absolutely nothing wrong with that interview. At no point whatsoever does he state he wanted to join PSG over united, nor does he said he wants to move there. There's some right fecking drama queens on here sometimes.

2919~~~
As I said, it ruins the morale of his fellow players and the fanbase. Do you think a player that City signed, signed for anything else but money? Hell no, but at least they pretend they did.

“I know I’m still young, perhaps I’ll go to PSG one day. I don’t know how it will all end."

It's absurd to accept a comment like this.

2920~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B2ktMm6IAAAugrn.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B2ktMm6IAAAugrn.jpg"/>

2921~~~
I think being professional players, they know it to be the case more than fans do. They're well aware that PSG werent able to fund a Di Maria move so it became possible for us to sign him

They arent fans, they're doing a job and are unlikely to get emotional about it because a certain player does or doesnt want to stay

2922~~~
Let's just drop this. We both have different opinions on the subject and it appears neither of us is going to change theirs.

2923~~~
People really need to stop dissecting a fecking interview with their senseless posts and giving rest of us heart attacks when this thread pops up. Injury! is first thing which crosses my mind when a player thread pops up nowadays when our match is not on.

2924~~~
Pretty much my opinion. I really can't understand the fuss.

2925~~~
He's certainly been playing like he's not enjoying the winter. One of the biggest drop offs in form I think I've ever seen from one of our players. He was unbelievable when he came in, even for Argentina v Germany in their friendly he was brilliant.

We even bought his mate Rojo to keep him happy. I think most of us realised we weren't his 1st choice in the Summer but money talks and we have a lot of it.

2926~~~
poor from Di maria tbh.

2927~~~
"At the time, there were a lot of clubs interested". "There were a lot of clubs who wanted to have me. They came and went but Manchester appeared and they never went away and because they really wanted me, I went there. That is how it happened".

2928~~~
You do know that United desperately wanted atleast 3 of them to play for them...and they didn't.

Infact, when was the last time United won a transfer bought a player Chelsea wanted?  There are countless examples of players choosing Chelsea over United.

2929~~~
Its a combination of money and living in London. Ballack, Mikel, Hazard and even Zouma. I've probably missed a few here.

2930~~~
I agree. I mean dude we know you're a merc you don't have to be so obvious about it!

2931~~~
I think this is the first time he has ever had to experience playing in cold. A bit of autumn depression is kicking in for him I think. He better wipe his tears with the stacks of cash we give him and start performing again!

2932~~~
Essien, Robben, Mata..etc

2933~~~
True. We're not an attractive club for top foreign players, never have been. Thats what makes our achievements even greater.

2934~~~
It gets cold in Spain too though. Madrid is as cold as Manchester right now minus the rain <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2935~~~
True but it's the same thing which is harming United now without SAF. Even Manchester City were allowed to take away players like Silva, Toure when United should have been in for them.

2936~~~
Yes. We signed Ashley Young the same season City signed Silva. Januzaj too for 575k!

2937~~~
First of all, it seems as if di Maria had no special affiliation with any club that wanted to buy him. It seems like he just wanted to leave Real Madrid and had the club take care of where he could go. It seems as if he was asked about PSG, and he mentioned how they couldn't match Real's offer due to FFP concerns, so he had no chance of going there. He then went on to talk about how so many clubs were interested in him with only Man. Utd. continuing their interest rather than dropping off, which was why Real accepted our offer and he ended up here.

He then goes on to talk about playing for PSG in the future. To be honest, he hasn't really specified when he would want to go. Many players have done this when they were asked about wanting to play somewhere at some point and not really ruling it out. It's really nothing concrete when a player says "I might see myself playing at X someday...".

Yeah, there's nothing much in this interview for me. It's what I would expect from someone who doesn't immediately have his heart set on any football club he plays for.

2938~~~
Much ado about nothing. I actually laud him for his honesty.

2939~~~
This always happens when foreign players go on international duty. I guarantee his quotes have been twisted in some way.

2940~~~
Now that you mentioned it, di Maria might release a statement where he clarifies his statements, especially if the British media take this news too far.

2941~~~
Are people really getting their nose out of joint over an interview with a French broadcaster, even if the quotes are word for word what Di Maria said, its fairly innocuous given he was responding to a question on a French team. Do you expect him to say that he hates France and he's glad the move fell through? He's just being interview savvy.

I suspect the question was probably quite leading - something like We understand you were very close to moving to PSG in the summer but that fell through at the last minute, what happened? His repsonse about money problems and United staying the course make more sense then.

Its like when Bradley Cooper was interviewed in Ireland and they asked where the Hangover 3 would be set and he said 'who knows, maybe Dublin, its a cool city' (or something to that effect). obviously it was never going to be Dublin, he's just playing nice, but the resulting headlines took the quotes literally -

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/film/its-hangover-3-and-its-set-to-be-shot-on-the-streets-of-dublin-27981282.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/...e-shot-on-the-streets-of-dublin-27981282.html</a>

Chill the feck out.

2942~~~
Do you know the exact reasons for the three players in your mind who failed to come to United? Or whether SAF desperately wanted them??

That's what I was getting at. Players who joined Chelsea because of money and Chelsea has bottomless pocket, whereas under SAF the policy was not about paying obscene money to compete. The bottom line was to attract the right players who're joining not for money only but for trophies and who have the right attitude. I think SAF would agree with my assessment. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2943~~~
He's deviated from the script, players are supposed to pretend the club theyre at is the only club they would ever want to play for. But Di Maria is no less committed than any other player, he was just a bit naive with the answer he gave.

2944~~~
Anyways back to the matter at hand, Feck PSG.

I really hope Di Maria is restored centrally this weekend. And Van Persie takes the corners <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2945~~~
I couldn't care less, it was obvious he didn't come here because he had a special love for the club and was always a true fan. It's all about money for 99% of footballers.

2946~~~
I dont think there would be half as much fuss if he weren't in poor form right now.

2947~~~
Don't worry, he'll fall in love with the club when he plays at night in a big CL game...

2948~~~
SAF did desperately want them. And they didn't chose Chelsea only for money. There was playing for the best manager in the world, winning trophies, staying in London,etc.

2949~~~
Has he had to travel long distances this international break?

2950~~~
he has been at Manchester since last Thursday I suppose as his next game for Argentina tomorrow is at Old Trafford.

2951~~~
I agree. Why the hell would he have some kind of emotional attachment to United, Manchester as a city and our players? He has been here for a few months, obviously we can't expect him to have grown so attached to us that he rejects the idea of moving elsewhere.

PSG are a top quality club, having went out on away goals in the quarters's two years in a row. Once against Chelsea were their key player got injured after they battered them - and they couldn't coop without him. Once against Barcelona.

So even if they are not a top 4 clubs in terms of performance over the last two seasons, arguably they have been the fifth best performer in the Champions League over the last two seasons.

1. Bayern(Win - Semi)
1. Real Madrid(Semi - Win)
3. Dortmund(Final - Quarter)
3. Barcelona(Semi - Quarter)
5. PSG(Quarter - Quarter)

We finished 7th in the England last year, currently we're 7th again this year. Di Maria wen to United for money and a belief that last year was Moyes fault. He clearly has reasons to have his doubts and leave his doors open at this stage as we aren't racking up more points this year.

2952~~~
Well that's from your subjective angle. Sir Alex never wanted a player so desperately he competed with Chelsea which has bottomless pocket and are able to buy trophies with monies. That's an objective way looking at it. End of discussion.

2953~~~
I'm well aware that the vast, vast, majority of players have no inherent loyalty to a club like the fans do, but I do expect the player to ultimately want to be at the club. That reason can be, love for the club, location and whether, money, whatever, but I don't believe you can really be at your best if you don't want to be there.

That's why I find this interview quite frustrating, especially in conjunction with his 'letter to Madrid'. There is an air of disappointment around Di Maria that says to me that he did not really want to go to United but came here rather as a last resort. That's a bad attitude to have, not only for himself but the team as a whole and I wish he'd just be quiet.

Now he has to make the best of it because I can't see any way that he's leaving any time soon. I seriously hope we start winning games because that is the one thing that can cure all ills.

2954~~~
I really don't see why he is used on the wing, it may be better for the team, but the team should be built around ADM

2955~~~
What a bunch of headline generating rubbish, what's the guy supposed to say to French TV? That he hates France and all things French and would never be caught dead at PSG??? The way they're bending this story out of nothing is like he's guaranteed he'll be gone next window!

<i><b>BTW</b> Talking of PSG I've just seen the David Luiz "Candid Camera" thing they did on AdM. It must be on the Caf somewhere, yes? If not let me know and I'll post it, it's FF!</i>

2956~~~
Nope. only all the way to London (West Ham's stadium) and then back to Manchester!

2957~~~
Totally agreed. LvG is no SAF in terms of man management but he (LvG) really needs to consider how some tiny public comments would affect dressing room morale. At the moment the result so far is disappointing and players negative comment is not helping. 

Like someone said here, keep practicing (and improving) corner kicks Di Maria and focus on present and not future move. It's not about you being honest. Stop being stupid

2958~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You see United at the moment have actually turned into a club which you have described above.

2959~~~
Yeah, let's face it, our "benefactor" has just not stopped giving! <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2960~~~
Whats all this fuss about? Did he say sthing wrong?

2961~~~
He simply indicated that he could just as easily have ended up at PSG and he wouldnt have been any less happy if that had happened. That is how I read it. And I dont think there's anything wrong with feeling that way - though obviously the faster route to fans' hearts is to go the badge kissing, "playing for this club is a dream come true" route.

2962~~~
The part PSG couldnt afford me, United wanted me and got me - nothing wrong with that. 

But saying - maybe I'll end up in PSG one day - that's a bit silly. 

Then again his words could have been twisted.

2963~~~
I did say end of discussion! But if you insist... Yes I don't disagree with what our club has turned into in a way being desperate and money spending. Gosh we don't know how to react since Sir Alex retires but I don't necessarily believe we will ever become a City or Chelsea.

What I fear most though is to become a Liverpool if I am being honest... as one can easily settle for second best within and outside the club so I was in so much pain when LvG mentioned the two words "three years". We all know what might happen with a mentality like that. But god forbid we will get our acts together and climb back to top soon.

And Di Maria and co must consciously and intentionally be part of the process with winning mentality in each and every game they play until the end of season

2964~~~
His interview isn't diplomatic you shouldn't say that 3 months after joining a new club.

But what he is saying is not that bad, when you followed the story this summer, he was supposed to join PSG because they "sealed" the deal very soon and apparently his wife wanted to live in Paris. And like he said, if they had money he would have joined them, but according to some french journalist, he was also interested in playing in the premier league (no matter the club), and apparently if he had the choice from the beginning between the prem and the ligue 1 he would have choose the prem, but it wasn't the case, only PSG was in for him and a lot latter, us.

2965~~~

2966~~~
As I said above nothing much in it although he could have let that 'maybe I'll play at PSG one day' part.

2967~~~
Yeah, it's not much, but it's like telling to your new girlfriend, "you know, i was supposed to date your friend but you took her place, but hey! maybe i still have a chance. "

2968~~~
Needs to keep his mouth shut and focus on bringing his play back up to an acceptable level.

Even if he prefers a central role to playing on the wing, the minimum he must do is put in some effort.

2969~~~
He shouldnt talk crap and start performing again. I'm well aware that not all players who come to us are instantly in love with the club but that part was a bit crap.

2970~~~
A good analogy to be honest. If LvG (or Giggsy) does not do anything to at least say a few words in his ear, he would continue to have this mindset. It's so not cool.
Sir Alex would have instantly injected the love of the club mentality into new players. Manager and the players alike are in it together to restore the "fear factor" about the club/team. This kind of silly reply to journalists is not helping that cause.

2971~~~
True, but Fergie is not around anymore. It seems we are a new club altoghether..

2972~~~
Like most have said, seems something of nothing. It was clear all summer that he'd quite happyily have stayed at Madrid and it was clear he'd have gone to PSG had they had the money. I don't think we should be under any illusions he's here because he loves the club, or anything. If we miss out on the CL this summer he'll be one of the first looking for a way out. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a clause to that effect.

Of course none of that matters if he plays well.

2973~~~
It seems like it. If Giggsy was not sitting there every game, you will be struggling to find out what team were we watching nowadays. I am trying not to be negative but it's a true gutted feeling. 

And I just saw an article the Argentina coach Martino commenting on Di Maria's recent form at United. Sadly Mirror's headline was less sympathetic (to United) - Manchester United's slump has affected Angel Di Maria's form, reckons Argentina boss Gerardo Martino. LvG should take notes for sure. 

Here's the Daily's: 
Angel di Maria will regain form Gerardo Martino assures Manchester United ahead of Argentina and Portugal showdown

2974~~~
It seems that people are round the circle trying to defend Di Maria's quote and how he feels. 

When you go to a new club it's part of your job to ensure you go on top and be able to play in the CL next season. 

Why would people on here seem to acknowledge that it is alright for him to talk about the future move when it's their very own duties to ensure they stay (if CL is one of the determining factors not to leave)? It's team work and the manager play a major role but Di Maria's recent form is hardly attributing to other players or team selection. Maybe he's not training too well?!!

2975~~~
I was very surprised when PSG pulled out of the deal, as like many others I thought it was nailed on.  Then I was actually shocked when we went in for him.

I don't really mind what he said, it's his dedication on the pitch and winning us points that really matter.  I also don't mind if PSG comes in for him again in the near future, but they better prepare a boatload of cash + Marquinhos.

2976~~~
Very disappointed to see ADM possibly unsettled so soon into his arrival!

2977~~~
Some of you sound like you'd ask a whore post-blow job if she loved you once you'd handed over the money....

2978~~~
Exactly what i was thinking.

Dude went to the highest bidder, not to the club he loved the most.

Hes not obliged to exclaim his love to the club and the fans, as long as hes performing and doing what hes paid to be doing.

Maybe he would've gone to PSG had the chance materialized earlier, who cares.  The fact is, he didnt and hes here.  Hes an awesome player whom we have to utilise to the best of his ability.  If he reaches his sell by date, we make some of the money back, purchase some other good player who may or may not help us win things, and so on.

No need to get your titties in a twist over a stupid interview.

2979~~~
Hardly expect him to burn his bridges with other clubs but the timing of this is questionable, especially when you consider his decline in form and attitude over the last few weeks.

2980~~~
That girlfriend analogy is a decent one. Add that to:

"Yeah, if Maria hadn't dumped me we'd still be together..."

and it gets worse. I still genuinely believe he wants to be here though. As soon as he finds form again all will be forgiven.

2981~~~
He certainly knows how to endear himself to the fans anyway...

2982~~~
All these theories about why his performances have dropped. Here's another one....he's just not motivated by playing for a struggling team that is out of Europe and essentially playing to finish fourth place.

(This would also explain his overtures to PSG)

2983~~~
What on earth is going on? Bad form? What? 2-3 games? He's only just joined the club and has been the best player this season by an absolute mile. He is complimentary to PSG in a French interview and it's a major scandal? What is wrong with people?

As for how happy he is, he was outstanding for a number of games at the start of the season and all you hear from the crowd is "Lolololololo Radamel Falcao" for 90 minutes. He's the club's record signing and best player and he doesn't even have a decent song!!!

2984~~~
He isn't Yaya Toure. I'm not sure he gives two shits.

Watching three games and heard his name metioned and looked and it was subs coming on (but no names going off) was he subbed?

2990~~~
Never mind, just checked it on goal.com

2991~~~
Does Nani blame di Maria for pinching his spot at United or something? That tackle was so far away from the ball. It wasn't even aimed at the right foot!

2992~~~
Crazy by Nani.

and on his club colleague non less.

2993~~~
They are as competitive as can be - it's probably just in the heat of the moment. Stupid tackle though, no doubt.

2994~~~
Is he injured as well now? That would be beyond a joke.

2995~~~
Not sure if he's WUMing with that x-ray tweet as no other journos are reporting that... You never know with Jackson these days. I'd unfollow him but one in every 50 tweets is worth reading.

2996~~~

2997~~~
Another injury? At this rate I'll be getting a game against Arsenal.

2998~~~

F*ck off. Just f*ck off right now.

Quite frankly I'd have been more surprised if he <i>hadn't</i> got injured today <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3004~~~
Nani needs to calm the feck down in a friendly like that. He's a teammate ffs!

3005~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jackson is such a twat!

3006~~~
Honestly think posting Jacksons tweets should be a bannable offence. He's always making a dick out of himself.

3007~~~
Horrible by Nani

3008~~~
He'll be fine, that's clear from what they said about it just being swelling. Martino only mentioned it to bring attention to the foul from Nani. He'll just have a little bruise from the contact, be fine to play.

I know we're in the middle of an injury crisis but it's making people unnecessarily hysterical. De Gea, Carrick and Di Maria should all be fine to play against Arsenal, and we haven't heard anything to suggest that they won't. Blind is the only serious injury to come out of this international break. (That's one injury too many, sure, but let's try and rein in the waaaahmbulance stuff.)

3009~~~
Hope you're right but I  don't feel as positive. We can't seem to catch a break atm.

Fe.king Nani and taking him back in January. 

Fe.k off!

3014~~~
Today is Tuesday, so he has another 3.5 days to recover.
I hope he is ok for the weekend.
I am becoming extremely pessimistic about the Arsenal game.

3015~~~
We arent beating Sanchez at the Emirates. We wont have a strong enough team to take him

3016~~~
The game will have to be postponed  due to neither club being able to field 11 players.

3017~~~
fecking hell, this has reached epic proportions of fallacy, how do we get injuries in any match our players play, this is such a joke

3018~~~
Do you realise we are being carried by one player too?, not to extent of Arsenal though.

3019~~~
Arsenal have Ozil, Koeisnldkdsdnjsny and Debuchy out so we have a brilliant chance to take 3 points, Di Maria is pretty much the enitre output of our attack these days, all our goals come from either himself, his assist, or him starting the play of. 

In other words, he better not be fecking injured, this is also our biggest game of the season thus far, because the winner probably goes to 4th place in the table which would be a brilliant morale boost, especially considering we have 2 home games against Hull and Stoke right after.

3020~~~
Feck Nani, sell him to the MLS and let him rot.

You just know DiMaria's foot is going to swell up like a balloon overnight and put him out.

3021~~~
This thread is hilarious. Firstly, most reports say ADM will be fine, secondly he has been absolute shite for us as of late, yet everyone getting their panties in a twist.

3022~~~
Seems like it's a 'nothing' challenge.

3023~~~
you would say that with your post count...

3024~~~
Couldn't make this up.

Just need Rooney to get injured in training now

3025~~~
Lol

3026~~~
We don't need him against Arsenal anyway. We have Rooney.

3027~~~
He's only trod on his foot he will be absolutely fine. Was a stupid tackle by Nani though, looks on purpose to me as he has come in with the completely wrong leg to win the ball. Shame as just when he was winning back his reputation, he does something stupid like that on our own player in our own stadium <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3028~~~
People over-reacting a tad in this thread.

If he is injured, we should forfeit the Arsenal game to preserve goal difference. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Middlesborough did that in 97, as they had a lot of injured players. In the end they <b>lost</b> points and would not have gotten relegated if they had just played the match and got thumped 18-0.

3032~~~
He's training so it's all good.

I think he is training though. The Man Utd Facbook page put up those pictures today saying:

What team would you pick to take them on?

3039~~~
Maybe they are putting up an old photo of the Noodle training to trick Arsenal into thinking he is OK.

3040~~~
I would pick Neuer, Thiago Silva, Robben, Messi and Ronaldo by the way.

3041~~~
De Gea, Herrera, Carrick, Januzaj and Wilson would <i>hammer</i> them.

RvP can't hit a cow's arse with a banjo when he's wearing a United shirt, Falcao would be be constantly hobbling off to cover various body parts in ice due to his watch weighing him down, ADM would have one eye on the ferry times to Calais and Mata would keep hugging Rooney.

3042~~~
Shit.

3043~~~
That is supposed to be funny? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3044~~~
As if playing really well for Sporting wasn't galling enough, rucking up our main player would just top it off.

3045~~~
Good idea. We should start Wilson instead of the rest, and I'd be pretty confident of a top 12 finish then.

3046~~~
The team lacks balance.

3047~~~
Wilson's the only striker to pick from if the other team's got Rooney, RvP and Falcao in it <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3048~~~

3049~~~
We need him against Arsenal. He would tear them apart.

3050~~~
Only if his heart were not thinking of PSG. Seriously he has to do better (if fit). No excuse

3051~~~
We're selling him to be able to afford Ronaldo/Bale it seems. But it's the daily press who's saying that so I'd trust them as much as I trust any transfer rumour. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/537388/Man-Utd-Di-Maria-Bale-Ronaldo-PSG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/537388/Man-Utd-Di-Maria-Bale-Ronaldo-PSG</a>

3052~~~
That would be a woeful idea. Good job for you guys its  not true.

3053~~~
These 'prank' videos though...

3054~~~
What the actual feck. Since when has playing one season and winning one League Title been enough to get you into a "Hall of Fame"?!

The reward for winning the league is.... well, winning the league. Hall of Fame should be reserved for people who have won multiple titles, Cups or at least made a significant contribution to the league over a sustained period of time.

What a joke.

3055~~~
He has been subpar against the big teams so far and those are the ones we need him against, no excuses about playing in a different position and what not. Tomorrow, di Maria needs to show he's worth his price tag and regain his form. We need the three points badly and we won't get those if he continues his play from before the international break.

3056~~~
Tbf, only 6 managers have actually won a Premier League title. It's a pretty exclusive group.

3057~~~
Absolute pedestrian, get him back into midfield where he's involved for god sake

3058~~~
Had almost forgotten he was still on the pitch.

3059~~~
Very disappointed with that finish. If you're going to play the Robben role you need to be clinical with those chances and kill the game.

Get the man back in the centre for christ sake.

3060~~~
Thank god that miss didn't come back to hurt us. You're forgiven Angel <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

Thought he put a great defensive effort in, not his game at all but he worked his socks off for the team, credit to him.

3061~~~
Another assist and should have scored.

3062~~~
Dreadful on the 1v1 but overall pretty good.

3063~~~
How he didn't even hit that on target is beyond me...but he set up Rooney so all is forgiven.

3064~~~
The miss at the end aside he was very good today. Never stopped running and for the first half, was our only outlet. Combined well with Rooney as the game grew.

3065~~~
Should've scored but pleased with his overall performance. Makes great runs and usually plays the right ball. Can't have asked much more from him today...other than to have scored the 1 on 1, obviously.

3066~~~
Should've scored but other than that a much better performance. Should be playing deeper, the higher he plays the less effective he is IMO.

3067~~~
Quite poor again. He needs to be playing left of the centre of midfield. It's where he was sublime in when he first signed for us. Did well to get his assist, but he fluffed his lines for that superb chance he had to make it 3-0.

3068~~~
Thought he was good today. He's easily our most useful player on the counter. Love to have him in our team.

3069~~~
He's back! Good game from him.

3070~~~
Was good with the assist and had a decent game overall, bar that glorious chance.

3071~~~
Some good stuff, at least better than the Man c/Chelsea games, still expect much more from him.

3072~~~
He was really good today but he really should have put the game to bed right there. De Gea deserved the clean sheet.

And his antics at the end were hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3073~~~
I think he was poor and I expect better. Lost the ball at stupid places and should've scored the goal that would save our faces towards the end.

3074~~~
Great asset with his pace but we need some better players along side him!

3075~~~
Disappointed he didn't score at the end there.

When Giroud got one back for them I feared the worse.

3076~~~
Very important for us on the break.

What was he thinking with that finish though.

3077~~~
Brilliant today but shouldve scored. Did great in that free role though. Blatantly not as good out wide.

3078~~~
I am so relieved his miss didn't cost us in the end

3079~~~
Far better through the middle. Can see his time at Madrid came in handy in the last few minutes of stoppage time too <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3080~~~
Some seriously lowered expectations if people consider that a good performance.

3081~~~
Very wasteful. Nani would have scored the chip

He spat the dummy out when Rooney delayed his pass too long. Was good to see them link up not long after and Di Maria play Rooney in to score to show it was quickly forgotten about

3082~~~
Thought he did okay, should have scored but his pace on the break was a threat. No way was he great or anything though.

3083~~~
Anyone could've missed that, but still. Holy fecking hell Angel you almost gave me a heart attack there. 

Was far more like it from him though. The ball to Rooney was delicious, he was the only one of ours who kept tearing Arsenal apart. Glad to have him.

3084~~~
Hmmm, I didn't like his attitude at times today. Looked like he couldn't be bothered a couple of times.

3085~~~
If we're playing the diamond I'd like to see him up top more, esp in the big games.

3086~~~
Ran all day, and his skill in tight situations is first class. Much more to come from this guy, i'm sure.

3087~~~
I thought he was poor, had one good rush in the first half, and played a part end 2nd half with the counters, other than that, he did nothing.

3088~~~
He was ok, nothing spectacular and what a terrible miss at the end.

3089~~~
Was good apart from the miss. We hardly had the ball but once he got it it always looked dangerous. Defended well as well. Plus we got the Real Madrid and Argentina school at the end, too <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3090~~~
In that case none of our players did anything. The most someone did was assist (di Maria) or score (Rooney).

Given the team performance, I can't see how ADM didn't do well today. He was bright on the ball, never stopped chasing and pressuring and created a goal.

3091~~~
Bright on the ball? Yeah maybe twice in the whole match, we are talking about individuals and he was poor imo.

3092~~~
Yeah he should have scored. But he worked his ass off today. Never stopped running after the ball. Got his routine assist as well.

3093~~~
Okay in that case no one in our team deserves any credit (although Rooney and adm definitely do).

Individual performances always have to be viewed in the context of the team.

3094~~~
Good assist. Terrible miss. At least it didn't cost us the win. Everyone makes a mistake. He still provided a big spark for us plenty of times today. Let's all move on.

3095~~~
Very good performance. He's a nuisance to the opposition. The play acting in the end was a bit over the top.

3096~~~
20 - Angel Di Maria has now recorded 20 league assists in 2014, more than any other player in the top five European leagues. Provider.

3097~~~
Wrong, Fellaini and de Gea have, Smalling too.

3098~~~
Seems to be lacking confidence to take on and beat players at the moment after a few average to poor games. A few wins is all he'll need to get back to his best.

3099~~~
Probably our best attacking player first half, decent in the second but nothing special. Best thing about him is that he's getting goals/assists. Shame he didn't score that goal for 3-0.

3100~~~
What are Rooney and di Maria supposed to do when our midfield can barely string two passes together? I think those two did well. They had scraps to work with and made a difference.

3101~~~
Thought he was pretty bad. Gave the ball away an awful lot. 

That run in the first half was sexy though.

3102~~~
Good game, which will be slightly outshined by the missed chip. Looked way better in this role then as a winger pur sang.

3103~~~
Not enough end product according to Souness though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3104~~~
Thought he had a good game overall. Really worked his ass off. 

That miss at the end is annoying. But nonetheless, good performance from him.

3105~~~
Surprised so many think he played well. I thought he was very disappointing again.

My problem with him is that he can do one magical thing a game. For the other 89 minutes he can spend the rest of his time making poor passes, badly timed runs (the one when he was forward 2 on 1 with RVP and was offside the whole time jumps to mind), hollywood shots and overambitious runs. 

Part of my problem is undoubtedly that I expect so much from him to be fair. He can be a very frustrating player to watch at times though for me.

3106~~~
Bizarre mix of brilliant and awful today.

3107~~~
In between running around like an absolute madman? Thought he put a good shift in today considering he isn't in the best form right now. He did a very good job of being an outlet especially in the first half. Created a few opportunities with a couple of long runs and did his job well on the counter setting up Rooney. Obviously a real shame that he missed the one and one and made us suffer in agony for another 25 minutes or however long that stoppage time was.

3108~~~
Thought he was better today. I feel the way we set up (on the counter) helped him a lot as he was able to drive into space from deeper positions. Should have scored, though, after Rooney's great work. Would have made it a lot more comfortable in the closing minutes.

3109~~~
Worked his socks off for the team and provided yet another assist. Good enough for me.

3110~~~
His best game for a while, hopefully the start of a return to form and a freer role in the team.

3111~~~

3112~~~
Pity about the missed chance. Won't have played many games chasing the ball as much probably but good to see him play the whole game

3113~~~
The miss was bad, what else was he suppose to do otherwise though? Had a decent game overall. He being an outlet  worked and worked well defensively.

3114~~~
I'm not too bothered about the miss at the end, but he was so wasteful and lazy looking at times today.  Other than a couple of flashes of brilliance I wasn't impressed at all - certainly didn't see it as the return to form some people are making out.

3115~~~
I thought he did well, looked a threat for us, shame about the miss.

3116~~~
well...still would prefet him playing for us than anyone else, regardless of how he still needs to settle in and find out how the other players play the game

3117~~~
Worked his arse off. Caused terror in the Arsenal defence, got an assist and should have easily gotten a goal. This is before you mention that he was pivotal to the whole tactical set up today ala Robben for Holland in the world cup. Good game by him.

3118~~~
Should have scored, a 3-0 would have been demoralizing for them. Instead we had to concede late and sweat our palms.

3119~~~
thank goodness that miss didn't allow them to steal a draw!

Was gutted, he missed, for fantasy footy points as well as a really good scoreline.

Never mind,his work for goal 2 was more important

3120~~~
I thought he did okay especially when he received the ball in tight situations something that RvP couldn't do but it relieved a lot of pressure and allowed us some time on the ball.

Granted he was wasteful at times but it was definitely an improvement and if he had scored at the end it would of been classed as a good performance.

3121~~~
I knew he'd miss that one on one just like I knew Rooney would make it 2-0. 

Good performance today, much better than the shite he was spewing out in October, but he can do better. Really should have scored too.

3122~~~
He had our best passing accuracy, the most "key passes", the most dribbles, and was fouled more then anyone else (well level with a few others).

Overall thought he was our best attacking player, was a constant danger whenever he got the ball and his pace really killed Arsenal. Got an assist, should've scored at the end but overall, a very good performance and was key to us winning. Also had some very good passes into the channels for Rooney or whoever else to run into, sometimes wrongly called offside like shortly after the goal. Much better then the last few weeks for sure, as he was given the freedom to roam and wasn't just stuck to a wing.

3123~~~
Of all the players I wanted to be clean through on goal I really couldn't believe he fluffed it

Amazing how we turned a player who arrived brimming with confidence after a superb season last year with Real Madrid into one that's obviously got no confidence at the moment

3124~~~
I can't belive people are complaining about Di Maria today. He played a crucial part in almost everything we created going forward. If it weren't for him, we would almost definitely have drawn/lost.

3125~~~
I thought he was good today. The miss was a bit shit but he definitely looked like our most dangerous player.

3126~~~
Involved in a lot of our key attacking moments. To be offside for RVP's through-ball and then miss that huge chance rather spoiled his performance for me. Had some good moments, looked class at times.

3127~~~
That offside was not his fault at all. Twice RVP had the chance to put him through and twice he hesitated, Di Maria made the run, got back on side, started to make the run again and then RVP finally released the ball when he was half way back.

3128~~~
Agree.  Some have criticized Di Maria for fouling up the run but when RVP saw the opening between defenders he shouldn't have hesitated to play it through.  The entire play was lost from RVP's indecision.

3129~~~
If he hadn't of side footed that chip he would've scored.

3130~~~
That chip looked like he was full of confidence. Kind of cocky. He just fluffed it.

3131~~~
That isn't really saying much though is it. He only narrowly pipped Gibbs to that accolade.

3132~~~
It isn't but he put the fear into the arse defenders a few times. He was much better today.

3133~~~
I thought he had a solid enough game. Not brilliant but he was a threat.

3134~~~
I thought his best moment was where he tackled an Arsenal player then kept the ball under pressure, rolling the ball around and bamboozling the opposition player. It didn't really contribute anything but it was brilliant skill and it's the kind of ability on the ball I wish all our players had. Anyone else would have been tackled. Also his ball to Rooney on the left wing was perfect, Rooney was called offside but he wasn't and it would probably have led to a goal

3135~~~
He should have intentionally not started his time at Utd as tremendously as he did.  He set the bar very high and now, a performance like that which was excellent (other than the wasted goal) is judged as not up to par.

3136~~~
Agree. If he can just build on this and keep improving then it is all good. He also pressed quite well I thought.

3137~~~
If we plan to play counter attacking football, Di Maria and Rooney upfront is they forward. Today, these two could have two goals and two assists playing each other, when both playing upfront.

3138~~~
He looked knackered imo. Should have converted that chance but he was always going to be just an outlet today while we did a backs to the wall job.

3139~~~
They can definitely be very effective countering, but we will run into issues if we rely on that. Not every team is going to come at us all guns blazing like Arsenal did - even today it took them going a goal down to really give us that space to run into. Smaller teams will sit back against us so we still need to know how to play through a compact team. Di Maria should be very useful for this as well though

3140~~~
We should bring Nani back so he and Di Maria can start a theatrical production in the 91st minute next time we're ahead.

3141~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Thought Di Maria did a good little job in the corner there. Knew just how much to play it.

3142~~~
Managed to waste a bit of time and get Giroud wound up at the same time. Worked like a charm.

3143~~~
Was good today I thought, you want him to get on the ball more but that wasn't his fault today. His chance was harder then it looked too, after sprinting 50 yards at full pelt near the end of the match you are going to be absolutely fecked, to then try put a chance away is going to be hard.

What happened at the end there as well? I looked away for a second and all of a sudden he was on the ground holding his balls. I thought he was going to get sent off when he threw a bit of an elbow too.

3144~~~
Actually he's never been the best finisher so I'm not sure why he's the player you'd want through on goal. He'll just never be one of those player you know will finish. 


Not surprised by that at all. Bizarre how so many think he was poor. He was never going to run rings around their defenders given how much we were pinned back.

3145~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at RVP.
He was right to expect the pass, it would've been difficult, but certainly has the skill to do it. But his body language

3146~~~
Di Maria was very good, one of our best players. Shameful miss, but he had some fantastic runs and, on top of that, he should've (could've) grabbed two assists + that wrongly called offside.
He looked better without Van Persie on the pitch though, had more space upfront for himself

3147~~~
The problem we're having with di Maria is not necessarily his own fault. At Madrid he was brilliant because the opponents were afraid that Bale, Ronaldo or Benzema would cause them damage, so di Maria was lower in their priority list. 

When we play, di Maria is our most talented and dangerous player, so immediately when he gets the ball he's surrounded by 3 defenders who can out-muscle him. For di Maria to regain his form we need opponents to feel like any one of the front line can do the damage, but with the exception of Rooney we have had cloggers in there for the last few games.

3148~~~
Fully agree. This also helped him stand out at Benfica too where he played on the left side of a diamond midfield, 4-1-2-1-2. Aimar, Saviola and Cardozo were the big threats which allowed Di Maria on the left and Ramires on the right of the central midfield to provide the bonus options with their energy and delivery.

Taken from 2nd March 2010, this is an excellent insight into the Benfica days - <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/02/benfica-the-most-attactive-side-in-europe/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/02/benfica-the-most-attactive-side-in-europe/</a>

Yet more proof that the left side of a central midfield is his best position too. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/05/27/real-madrid-4-1-atletico-madrid-aet-real-snatch-late-equaliser-at-end-of-cautious-first-90-minutes-before-becoming-rampant-in-extra-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/05...inutes-before-becoming-rampant-in-extra-time/</a>

And another example for Argentina, same position - <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/06/12/argentina-world-cup-2014-preview/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/06/12/argentina-world-cup-2014-preview/</a>

Key player in a team that includes Aguero, Messi and Higuain.

3149~~~
Also enjoyed how he kept fighting with Sanchez for the ball - fantastic to see both of them working their asses off.

3150~~~
You don't try a dink over the keeper like that unless you have the confidence to pull it off.

3151~~~
I had no problem with Di Maria's performance to be honest. 

The team/formation was changed so much due to injuries that no one managed to play well or with any flow.

But i do wonder if the constant remarks from LVG about him needing to do better is having an effect on his confidence.

3152~~~
Played well and worked hard I thought. Any other day and him & Rooney bag a similar goal and assist each and we win 3-0.

Play him through the middle.

3153~~~
That run yesterday where he started in midfield and laid it off to Rooney was something to behold. Not too many players in the world can do that.

3154~~~
That was fantastic, but truth be told IMO he held onto that pass for a second too long.

3155~~~
Exactly. Whilst he is capable of scoring goals, we bought him to assist and to create chances. Theoretically, RVP, Rooney and Falcao should be scoring the goals between them. Mata is also a better goal scorer than Di Maria.

3156~~~
We have Van Persie, Falcao and Mata who should all be doing that.

3157~~~
Di Maria Rooney and Nani would be devastating on the counter.

We would need a possession based midfield behind them as they all can be wasteful. But teams wouldn't be able to handle that speed and skill. Kinda like 2008 Tevez Ronaldo Rooney.

3158~~~
It was actually breathtaking. Reminded me of a Iniesta but with more pace where he runs through the whole defense when he feels like.

3159~~~
Thought they'd be gifs galore of that moment. Echo your sentiments wishing we had a team who were that comfortable on the ball. It changes the way play is built and it forces a respect and fear from the opposition that buys time on the ball and disjoints uniform pressing.

3160~~~
Thought he chased down and tracked well, and I'd imagine stuck too the game plan perfectly. i.e he was our outlet for pace! And it worked second half he should have scored, knew he'd go for the chip but he should have gone round him I thought.

Also made a ridiculous run first half that should have resulted in better than it did.

3161~~~
Thought he was superb, apart from missing the chance at the end.
Worked hard, kept the ball well and was involved in all of our best attacking moves. Hopefully he keeps this up now.

3162~~~
Thought he played well. He's never been a particularly prolific finisher anyway so I wasn't overly surprised at the miss.

3163~~~
Thought he had a very good game myself. Linked very well with Rooney. 

They are not connecting with Persie though, and as soon as we can get that bit right, whether it is with Persie or someone else,  we will be devastating.

3164~~~
He did well. First time he's played in that position here, in the 'Robben role' if you like, but he managed to carry our main threat in the first half and was sublime on a few occasions on the counter -particularly that run from within our own half when Dave picked him out.

He's not a goalscorer however. If that was Arsenal's star attacker, he scores, but di Maria isn't prolific, so it's kind of expected to see him profligate in front of goal. Ideally it would have been the same combination with AdM to Rooney like with the second and we most likely score a third. It's good to see the connection between Rooney and di Maria on the pitch though, both are always on the same wavelength.

3165~~~
No idea why he didn't just take it round the keeper for an easy tap-in, that miss could have been costly but we managed to hold on. Looked a lot more dangerous than he has in the last couple of games though so that's a positive.

3166~~~
I thought he played well. Some sloppy bits of play but also some moments of really world class football. You expect that from a player like him though. He was always going to be more of a Nani than a Valencia. Hopefully that wee dip is over and can continue as the game-changed he's looked like for most of his career at United so far.

3167~~~
We just don't get him on the ball enough - when we had Ronaldo we tried to get him on it as much as we can. When Rooney became the main man, we tried to have things go through him as much as possible and even today that seems to be the case. Maybe that's because passing is not his forte but, we need to nonetheless look for more ways to then get him either running at the heart of the defense and around the box or out wide getting crosses in - because every time he does get the ball, it seems like something is going to happen.

3168~~~
Di Maria played better than his  newcomer rival Sanchez, who kinda dissapeared toward the end. 

It's encouraging.

3169~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2847156/Ten-things-learned-weekend-Manchester-City-need-tighten-defence-Brendan-Rodgers-substitutions-damaged-Liverpool-Angel-Di-Maria-s-pace-undid-Arsenal.html#ixzz3K1AmnM6D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...Maria-s-pace-undid-Arsenal.html#ixzz3K1AmnM6D</a>

3170~~~
He's a top quality player, and will only get better as our team gets more and more cohesive.

3171~~~
He had his first good game after a dip in form and I think it's more down to the role he played which is key to him playing well.

3172~~~
When the attack starts to click he'll be brought back into the central midfield and given space to roam once more and deliver the goods. After his blistering start from deep, he's probably the #1 watched man by every team since. Get an on song Falcao, RVP, Mata and or Rooney to pressure them too et voila. The Di Maria of Madrid, Benfica and the World Cup will light it up again. No doubt about it. 

The boy is special. He and Falcao have the potential to claim 2nd and 3rd spots as the best foreigner attack minded players to play for Utd in the Premier League. On song only Ronaldo beats them.

3173~~~
So is it a coincidence that he puts in his best performance in the last few weeks, having been brought back off the wing? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

3174~~~
yes. we need to get him off from the wing.

think he will nailed it in a"robben world cup" role as well. the link up between di maria and rooney could be devastating when both are on fire.

3175~~~
Rooney, Falcao and Di Maria up top, could be a mouth watering prospect....

But, we shouldn't expect too much too soon. Di Maria is without doubt wasted on the wing though

3176~~~
He need proper support behind him for us to see his best,he's more helpful in central areas than at wider.

3177~~~
I don't think so. Arsenal practically encourage teams to counter attack them and that's what he's very good at. It did help though that he had very little defensive duties though.

3178~~~
yes. more than his position, what helped him was our set up (park the bus) + arsenal attacking leaving ridiculous gaps to take advantage from.

nothing new.. we all know Di Maria excels with an counter attacking set up.

the problem is when we have the ball and other teams park the bus against us. Thats when he looks (and the whole team) less effective.

3179~~~
What about giving him a game as a striker. We lack some serious pace up front, and he can offer us that. Against a team like Hull, it could work.

----- Fellaini -----
Herrera -- Carrick
------ Mata ------
Rooney - Di Maria

3180~~~
It can be frustrating, but on so many occasions when we do win the ball, we tend to pass around the back a few times first, and give the opposition time to organise themselves. We just need to hit faster

3181~~~
exactly, we need to be less predictable. recover the ball, attack. recover, attack. the problem is our midfielders are much better at passing around the ball than being incisive and fast with the transitions. (except Di maria)

3182~~~
I kind of agree, but not comletely. He can be effective both on the wing and in the middle, but for different formations. On the wing, he can be brilliant if it's a counter attacking set up. In a possession set up, he can be brilliant playing in center midfield and running from deep, as he showed in his first 5 or 6 games. Putting him in the middle for a counter attacking set up, unless it's as a free role going forward, wouldn't be the smartest, and playing him on the wing in a possession set up where the opposition park the bus usually is when he is inconsistent.

The good thing about him is that he can be absolutely world class in both set ups, just needs to be picked in the right positions and have the right roles in those set ups to get the best out of him.

3183~~~
He's winning games for us on a regular basis but he's not Messi or Ronaldo. He's exactly what I expected so far and absolutely worth the money we paid for him.

He's definitely strongest through the middle or on the right though, let Shaw provide the width on that side (when he's fit of course).

3184~~~
was thinking of this for the hull game. rvp simply needs some time off and falcao is still isn't ready. tempted to give wilson a start here as well.

3185~~~
He's a poor finisher, not going to make it as a striker. His creativity would go to hell up top too.

3186~~~
How can anyone want to play him anywhere other than as a midfielder (at least quasi-central)? He's been miles better for us there than in any other position, and it was his brilliant form in that position that we bought him for.

If you want pace up front, just play Wilson instead of RVP.

3187~~~
Di Maria should never be started as a striker!

3188~~~
A central midfielder with freedom to roam around and move over to the flanks, that's about the only position he's truly world class in. Buying a €70m player and then refusing to play him in the position he's best in seems a bit pointless.

3189~~~
Exactly.

3190~~~
If a back 4 is tenable for that game then I'd very much like to see this too, or Mata & DiMaria behind Rooney. Unfortunately the likely unavailability of specialist full backs paired with somewhat makeshift CB options might well mean the wingback choice is rather forced upon us.
A backline of Valencia-McNair-Smalling-Blackett-Young seems more viable than Valencia-McNair/Blackett-Smalling-Blackett/Young. If we had the option of Blind plus Carrick in front of the ailing defence...
So if 5 at the back then Fellaini+Carrick+Herrera then DiMaria behind Rooney would give him that freedom again.

3191~~~
Surely LvG realizes now that he's way more effective in a free central role, but he isn't a striker, those lining him up like Robben in the WC I think are wide of the mark. Move Rooney to a #9 role, bolster CM so Di Maria can play as a free roaming AM in a 3, and add some width either side of Rooney.

3192~~~
The whole point of playing in central midfield is to be disciplined and not wander round wherever the mood takes you. 

If he's playing a bit further forward then a free role is fine. I thought the position he played against Arsenal is the best way to use him and he responded with a decent performance.

3193~~~
I think with Di Maria it’s more than his positioning. With Real he played right wing and as a free central midfield. The fact is that in both position there, I think it’s the same with Argentina; he’s not there to dictate the game, not a playmaker. He’s more a player who destroy opponents lines with the ball, and create space for others. At United he’s saw as the best player, when at Madrid he had more important player surrounding him.

I really think that he can be as good as last year playing left wing, if we manage to balance the team, if Rooney becomes the leading striker, and if we boost our midfield with top top quality. Then ADM will be free to destroy everbody. I think that he must be free to run, run , run take the ball, try and loose it knowing that others will dictate the tempo, but not been the general like CR7 but more the lieutenant

3194~~~
It's a fair point that in those teams he's not the main man and therefore is afforded more room and less pressure, but his best ever football was played as an AM where he can drive counters. If you put him on the left he's going to have to resort to crossing a lot of the time, and if you play him right he'll be expected to score goals cutting in, something I don't think his his strongest suit. The free roaming AM role with two quality CM's behind would still be ideal IMO.

3195~~~
Real Madrid won Champions League with him playing in the exact same role. I'd say with a 3-man midfield we're bound to play with Di Maria you can have one that doesn't necessarily stick to one position.

I still think Mata, Di Maria, Blind and Herrera is our best midfield combination. Give them time to gel and they'll be very good. Move Rooney up front and depending on the opposition either add another forward or bolster the midfield to make it a 41212 or 451.

3196~~~
I think he is worth the money if played centrally, his work rate is insane, he presses and in that sense he helps out immensely defensively and also his ability to dribble so well through the centre is helpful and he just pops up out of nowhere in pockets of space and if he drifts to the left he has a very good cross.

I think LCM is best for him so hopefully we can make the diamond work and in the summer Louis van Gaal will entertain the possibility of moving Rooney up top, signing wingers and then playing a middle 3 of Carrick, Herrera and Angel di Maria. 

I don't think he has a great shot, he cuts in from the right and shoots too much, from the left he might put some good crosses in for a Falcao so we will see about that.

3197~~~
I think too, but to be clear what and who do we need then to get the best out of him ?

Should we play ala Madrid ? Which United player has the same style in the same position ?

-----------------------------Alonso-----------------------------

At United this can work for you ? But what about LVG's love for Strootman, his pursuit of Vidal ? And placing ADM inside, would mean that we have an absolute need to buy wingers (as LVG dreams about 4-3-3). Is Januzaj good enough to play a role ?

How can you possibly think that after last season? 

Its quite obvious what his best position is, and it isn't as a winger, or a striker (despite his improved performance this weekend).

3199~~~
Its funny, Madrid win the CL with Di Maria part of a midfield 3, a Madrid fan on here says that Di Maria in midfield made them more solid, and yet people on here claim he can't play in midfield as it leaves us to open.

3200~~~
Because how he performed last season is not really relevant to what we need from him right now. 

If we had Alonso and Modric alongside him in central midfield and Bale and Ronaldo on the wings I might think a little differently.

3201~~~
A midfield of Blind/Carrick/Di Maria would be solid. The issue we have right now is getting everyone fit at the same time.

But to spend £60 million on a player and then not play him in his best position would be utterly stupid.

3202~~~
I'd be ok with a midfield of Blind, Carrick and Di Maria but that also means no room for Mata or Hererra so we'd be leaving more than £60m of players on the bench in order to play this £60m signing in what is supposed to be his best position. Which makes the decision a little less obvious.

When you take into account that he's not being picked in central midfield by the Argentina coach and has played most of his career in a position where we're desperately lacking in quality then I fail to see what is "utterly stupid" about playing him out wide.

3203~~~
He has multiple positions where he can be at his best, it's not a case with him that he can only play in one position. He's world class in a midfield 3, having basically a free role in attack when we play a possession based style. Likewise, he is class when playing in any attacking position, be it up front, in the hole, on the wing, if we use a counter attacking formation. He just needs space to run with the ball and a set up that will get the most out of that. The way we used him against Arsenal, a free role as part of the attacking trio, can work really well IMO. It lets us have a solid midfield like herrera, Carrick and Fellaini behind, with a good blend of defensive ability, passing, creativity, and strength, and then an interchanging attacking trio like we saw on the weekend with Di maria, Rooney, and then one of Mata, RvP, Januzaj, Falcao next to them. 

The key with Di Maria is to just give him a free role though, not isolate him to a wing, as even though he can be class, it restricts him a lot.

3204~~~
Blind and Herrera or Fellaini will offer him as much protection as Alonso and Modric (without the same quality of course), we don't have the same wings but we don't have to play the same way and it doesn't mean we have to shift him out wide. Actually our players in front of him will offer Di Maria more stability and protection in defence (Rooney for instance works much harder than any of Real attackers).

3205~~~
The midfield of blind herrera and di Maria is what I hope to see develop over time, with the likes of mata, rooney and falcao ahead. When he played this left central attacking midfielder role for madrid he'd help run the midfield but also sprang forward as a left winger getting crosses in. It was a very unique role which is where I think he was truly a special player whereas as a traditional widemen he's been very good.

3206~~~
I think if you play Di Maria and Januzaj either side of Rooney we'd be very short on goals as the front 3 in a 4-3-3 all need to be goal threats, and Di Maria on the left would leave him mostly just pumping balls into the box.

I agree that it would require buying 2 wide forwards as well as Strootman to go 4-3-3 with Di Maria in a 3 man midfield, but we could use the diamond with just Strootman added.

3207~~~
No more Blind as holding midfielder please.

3208~~~
What's all this "PSG preparing huge Jan bid for AdM" rubbish all over the papers this morning?

3209~~~
We don't have a game in Europe, something needs to be written about us.

3210~~~
For even more of a goal threat you could even swap Herrera and add Mata at home vs the park the bus teams.

3211~~~
It’s only that Di Maria gave an interview for the French MOTM two weeks ago. And he said (like Ronaldo) that we never know in football (for a future transfer in Paris). Then it was just a lot of speculation from medias here in France.

3212~~~
Why?

3213~~~
What? He's the best holding midfielder we have right now and has been excellent for us so far.

3214~~~
I don't agree with that, for mee it looks clearly like a player out of position there, he's ok but we need a midfielder who can impose himself better on that possition.

3215~~~
Where do you think he should play then?

3216~~~
You're pretty much on your own there. Definitely the first person I've seen who hasn't been really pleased with his performances in that position. He's been one of just a few players who's not really had a bad game this season.

3217~~~
He has been ok so far but at some point we are going to need a midfielder ala Keane/Carrick who can actually dictate the game from midfield, I think Blind would be great in a midifield of three as some kind of Hargreaves or Fletcher but I don't see him as an answer for a midfield of two or a creative midfielder.

3218~~~
He won't be going any where in January because we don't need money. Although 100 million plus Silva might change my mind <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3219~~~
He has far more mobility than Carrick which in my opinion makes him better suited to the role, particularly in a midfield 2. Whenever Carrick plays as part of a 2 his partner struggles immensely because of the ground they have to cover. If both Blind and Carrick are fit for me it's either Blind on his own or both of them (dependent on the game).

If we go with a midfield 2 I think Blind-Herrera is our best bet as both have great mobility and both contribute defensively. I certainly disagree that he's not well suited to a midfield two (far more suited than Carrick). Herrera would play box to box ala Toure and Blind would play defensively ala Fernandinho.

3220~~~
Blind has been one of our best signings, in my opinion. Very composed performances in midfield, and it seems to be widely acknowledged that it is his best position. De Boer and Kluivert both agree. He's iffy at left back, and doesn't have the height to be a centre back. He's a holding midfielder all day long, and he's done very well. rarely puts a foot wrong, or a pass wrong. Losing him to injury is a huge blow.

3221~~~
Well, that's nonsense. Carrick is slightly immobile, not lame. In fact, I'm fairly sure there were plenty of CL games Carrick covered the most distance in our entire team a few years back. He covers plenty of ground during the course of a game. Not like Blind is very mobile either, though granted, he's slightly better in that respect. Carrick's been unluckly that he has had to carry pensioners, afroman, fat bastards and Tom Cleverley in midfields and basically do all their work for them.

3222~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I agree with you though, Carrick has been absolutely terrific for us - especially considering the conditions he has been working under for quite a while.

3223~~~
I don't think anyone called him lame? Carrick's issues in midfield have been there for all to see, his immobility and failure to deal with being pressed are his biggest faults. He is a great player but it hasn't just been his partners all these years that are the cause of our midfield woes. Most teams that have an immobile player ensure that he is in a midfield three with legs around him (ala Pirlo, Xavi, Alonso).

However we've always tried to shoehorn him into a midfield two, as that was Sir Alex's preferred system. In all honesty I think Carrick will have a bit of an Indian Summer with player's like Blind, Herrera and Di Maria in a midfield around him, he could easily be our Alonso. However if we are moving to a midfield two Blind & Herrera are the obvious choices for me; both cover a lot of ground, both are good defensively and both are proficient at a "pass and move" style.

I think Blind-Carrick-Herrera or Herrera-Blind-Di Maria or Blind-Carrick-Di Maria are all very good options for us in a three (with Fellaini to come in if we need height etc); but in a two only Blind-Herrera would be a good option I believe.

3224~~~
Agree with all of that.

3225~~~
This are exactly my thoughts too. 

He had amazing performances at CM, even when we were below standards, but now, even playing better against Arsenal, he seems to be lacking something.

3226~~~

Would love to see that given a go.

Di Maria needs to come back inside more, even Neville said it after analysing the derby.

3228~~~
Really love the look of that team. Would fancy it to have a good chance against anyone, and it'd probably destroy lesser teams. If we could get a world class centerback in place of Smalling (or if Smalling improves sufficiently) then it could be pretty solid in most situations too.

3229~~~
Other than two right backs ( <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> ) I like that team a lot. Of course we still have to wait and see how the likes of Falcao and Wilson will do with a proper chance

3230~~~
I just got back home, why was he subbed off? Obviously a blow I'd reckon, but did it look serious?

3231~~~
It didn't look serious, but it's still rotten luck. I expect him to be back quickly.

3232~~~
No, not very. Looks like he felt something in his hamstring, but he was walking normally. Probably just to be cautions doubt he'll be out for many weeks.

3233~~~
It didn't look serious at all, in fact he continued playing for a few minutes before getting subbed. I'd be surprised if he isn't playing again next week.

3234~~~
Yeah but sometimes when players continue playing on they just worsen the injury. Modrić played on after he got injured vs Italy and it proved to be a serious injury. Doubt its the same with Angel but given our luck this season.

3235~~~
He was still jogging and whipping in crosses after so he should be ok.

3236~~~
I hope he'll be okay, wanted to see him play on tuesday when I'll be at OT 1st time in my life. But doubt it. Hope noone will get injured before stoke game. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3237~~~
I missed first 15 minutes of the game. Hopefully it was just precaution? Subbing him off?

3238~~~
To be perfectly honest, we're not gonna miss him in his current form.

3239~~~
I thought he pulled up to cover his blushes for that pass at first and when he came back on quickly it only enforced that. 

It'll be interesting to see if he's actually injured.

3240~~~
That final cross into the box he whipped. He couldn't have done it if his other ham was seriously injured, which is a good sign.

3241~~~
He looked very sharp today.

Let's hope it's just a tight hamstring and he was taken of as a precaution

3242~~~
Good decision to bring him off with Xmas fixture list round the corner.

3243~~~
I knew he shouldn't have said anything about injuries in that interview ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3244~~~
Hopefully the quick change means a game missed and thats it.

3245~~~
Hopefully just a twinge and he can miss the Stoke game and be ready for Southampton.

3246~~~
Can't say his injury has come as a surprise. This is really mental. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3247~~~
Nah. He was our second best attacking outlet vs Arsenal by far.

3248~~~
Its a shame as he looked to be doing well before he came off - after some poor performances recently it was nice to see him looking sharp.

The silver lining is that it gives LVG a chance to try out the Carrick/Herrera/Fellaini midfield which I think is the way to go for us - I would be utilising Di Maria on the wings or competing with Mata for the #10 spot myself.

3249~~~
Ah, yes, that slipped my mind. He was actually very good then.

3250~~~
Out of Stoke game according to LVG.

3251~~~
Shame obviously but at least it didn't seem like a full tear, just a tweak. A rest won't do him any harm.

3252~~~
Wish I hadn't switched him to my fantasy footy captain this morn, it's all my fault!

3253~~~
Doesn't seem to be taking corners anymore and I'm over the moon about it. I love Di Maria. His free kicks are fine but his corners were awful. Either sailed over everyone's heads and out for a FK, or hit the first defender.  Even when he was on the pitch yesterday RvP took the corner(s). Hope he's back from injury soon though. We will miss his surging runs.

3254~~~
We'll miss him, without a doubt. But to be honest I'm too excited about Herrera/Mata playing to worry too much about ADM, especially vs. Stoke

3255~~~
Apparently his wife has confirmed on Instagram (where else?) that he has a 'small tear' in the hamstring. How long are we looking at him being out with that news? We talking weeks, months?

3256~~~
Couple of weeks as far as I know, not a complete tear which would be months.

3257~~~
It's very vague but the fact she said "small" would make you think weeks, rather than months. You'd usually talk about grade of a tear, rather than size but I'd assume "small" is at the less serious end of the scale.

3258~~~
Ah not to bad then, especially considering our injury record this season.

We <i>should </i>be okay tonight without him, but we'll definitely miss him away at Southampton though, I'd imagine we'll be set up to counter a lot more in away games, and Di Maria is a crucial part of that.

3259~~~
Lads, these recent posts are an example of ones that should be in their own thread and not this one.

Incidentally, there is a fecking separate thread for his injury!

3260~~~
Should probably start an "Angel Di Maria's Wife | 2014/2015 Social Networking" thread too.

3261~~~
Wasn't long ago this whole discussion would have taken place in that godawful twitter thread *shudder*

3262~~~
What would we do without ADM's wife!

3263~~~
I'm thinking maybe Niall should introduce player injury status to the banners

3264~~~
Lets see how the season plays out. PSG sure do love them some Angel. I'm open minded about this. The absence of a 60m signing should be palpable, instead I see Ander Herrera step in to the team and frankly transform things in the middle of the park. As I said,lets see how the season plays out.

3265~~~
We're not going to sell Di Maria in the after one season.

3266~~~
Fe.k. sake, you're already open minded about us selling him? 

My god.

3267~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Come on man, he's 26. We can have Angel at our club for the next 3 years, which will also be his prime years. We could cash in on him then, and still likely make our fee back. 

Angel is here to stay for a few seasons.

3268~~~
Probably and most likely not.
 My God is a bit more accomodating.

 That seems ok.

3269~~~
Easily the best player at United since Ronaldo. Pay him what he wants. It's vital we have the world's best players at Old Trafford.

3270~~~
He only signed for us for a British record fee 3 months ago. His wages will hardly be peanuts. It's not even time for talking about increasing them.

3271~~~
Something doesn't sit well about him to me. just get the feeling he would prefer to be at PSG and live the absolute high life. Hopefully wrong but if somebody does come in for him in a year or so, my bet would be Bale returning to the prem.

3272~~~
Understandable really, he is not English, he isn't our youth product, England is too different to Argentina/Spain, so obviously he would rather be in Spain or even Paris than England/Manchester. With the likes of Herrera/Rojo it is something else, they made a step up so can easily ignore the "disadvantages" of living in Manchester in exchange of the "luxury" of playing for United. Whereas Di Maria has not only come from a city like Madrid and a club like RM but also won the decima with them and was very settled there.

Anyway he has already said he isn't missing much, not even food as he is eating similar/same stuff in Manchester, and the only thing he is missing is warmer weather.

3273~~~
Bales agent said he doesn't want to come back though and bale is playing really well for Madrid so they have no reason to sell him either. If he does come back it'll be when he's on his 30's I guess.

3274~~~
Hmmm, i just cant see bale as a long term player at madrid though, the way they chop and change their attacking players im just not sure. id imagine he sticks around for another couple of seasons at the very least but he will still be 27/28 and bang in his prime.

3275~~~
Apparently there is an outside chance he might be ready for tonight.  I wouldn't want to risk it, unless absolutely necessary though, which I don't think it is.

3276~~~
NO chance, LVG wants his players to train for a week and pass a fitness test before he consideres them for selection. I think the Liverpool match is more likely.

3277~~~
Well, so he's been held for the Liverpool game, right?

3278~~~
Yes, I would think so

3279~~~
Really struggle to stretch teams without his pace, has to be back for the scum on Sunday otherwise it could be another painful game.

3280~~~
I don't know how we are going to set up against Liverpool, but if we stick with the 3-5-2 we really need him back as we are going to need his pace on the counter attack.

3281~~~

3282~~~
We really missed his pace and dynamism. Gives us something different. Hope he is back for Liverpool.

3283~~~
glad we got full points for the last 2 games even without di maria being involved.

hope he will be back for liverpool game now.

3284~~~
We seriously lacked pace yesterday, can't think of any of our midfield or defence who had any legs on them, we need him back asap.

3285~~~
Please tell me he's fit for Liverpool. At the end of the day, he's our best player. (Rooney & De Gea run him close) but he is the outstanding talent in our team. His injection of pace is so important for us.

3286~~~
It's not even his pace which makes him perfect for this team. It's the fact that no other player can pick the ball up from deep and move past the opposition midfielders. Far too often Rooney was getting the ball and trying to run at them only to run into a wall of players and not know how to get past them.

3287~~~
It's also the fact that he takes risks. Mata for example has brilliant technique and could probably carry the ball from midfield nearly as well but he's been so reluctant to take risks with his passing and so insistent on keeping everything safe that his vision is barely noticable these days.

3288~~~
Running at pace is one thing but with Di Maria on the pitch, he has the intelligence to make incisive passes which is lacking in our last two games.

3289~~~

3290~~~
I don't think he'll be fit. You are out for around 2 weeks with a hamstring injury (small tear) and if he must train for one week (according to Van Gaal's philosophy) then i guess Aston Villa will be his comeback

3291~~~
We miss his ability and confidence to take people on.  It is all nice and cute passing the ball side to side and back but well organized defenses aren't concerned.  You need a player who can run at pace into spaces and pass players to cause the defensive formation to fall apart.

3292~~~
Think he might be on the bench possibly but don't see him starting vs Liverpool.

3293~~~
Van gaal said before the liverpool game he was close but that the liverpool game was probably too soon. If I was to bet on it, I'd say he will play on Sunday.

3294~~~
I guess he will come in either for Herrera or Mata once he's fit. I personally would prefer to see him in a midfield 3 again but I doubt he'll play there unfortunately

3295~~~
Good to know we have a source inside the United physio room.

3296~~~
He's not in the training pics ahead of Sunday's game and I'm fecking raging. Typical that he misses the Liverpool clash, he would have had a field day.

3297~~~
feck

3298~~~

3299~~~
Great.

3300~~~
Big miss but we should still have more than enough to beat this lot.

3301~~~
Bit shit as we are very predictable without his pace. We'll still beat them though as they're even more predictable than us.

3302~~~
Didn't think we expected him back for this one anyway.

3303~~~
Injury situation is improving apparently. Only Evans has come back though.

3304~~~
We will probably win regardless, butit will likely be a laboured crossing exhibition from us as opposed to the manner in which we should really be beating that lot.

3305~~~
I bloody did, i don't know why though but I thought we were resting him against Southampton not taking the risk so he'd be fully ready for Liverpool game. Still should have enough to beat them though.

3306~~~
I think LVG doesn't want to rush him back, but will be missed but we will win regardless

3307~~~
Rafael and Jones are back as well.

3308~~~
Feck

3309~~~
Philosophy. 

I think Di Maria is healthy but isn't match fit.

3310~~~
We'll still win without him. 1-0. Rooney (pen). Skrtel will powerbomb Jonny Evans in the penalty area to win us our first spot kick of the season.

3311~~~
There are a few murmurings that Di Maria may be fit and starting today. Not really got any sources apart from it seemingly being linked to Argentine media.

3312~~~
Don't get our hopes up. He'd be on the bench anyway.

3313~~~
Can't see it myself, would love it to be true though.

3314~~~
Have you really not won a pen all season?

3315~~~
Nope not one, it's a staggering stat.

3316~~~
Very very skeptical about him featuring at all but it would be fantastic if he does. 

He would scare the shit out of them.

3317~~~
Maximum 20 minutes if so...

3318~~~
You have to run into the area first.

3319~~~
What about the by line?

3320~~~
I think it may be fair to say that this lad is the difference between winning and winning and playing well for us.

He would have had a field day today, especially in the second.

3321~~~
Can't wait for him to come back.

3322~~~
At least we know we're not a one man team!

Still, can't wait for this lad to get back.

3323~~~
We didn't need him today. I'd imagine Van Gaal wants him fully fit for the holiday and Jan fixtures.

3324~~~
Would have ran circles around the Liverpool defense today.

3325~~~
Where is he ?

3326~~~
Amen, those first 3 or so games, i thought if he was injured for a stretch we would be fecked.

3327~~~
hope he will be ready for the festive period.

surprisingly we didn't miss him much the last 2 or 3 games but you always want an angel in your line up.

3328~~~
Will he be back against Villa?

3329~~~
Wow 6 assists already, the lad is an assists machine, cant wait to see him play again

3330~~~
I think the break will have done him good. Form became a bit patchy and hopefully he can come in again with a big impact.

3331~~~
Must've had money on himself to score today. Turned to shite and lost our momentum when he came on.

3332~~~
It was like bad Nani performance.

3333~~~
Was bit shit today tbf. Shades of Nani.

But slightly understandable i guess.

3334~~~
Will take him a couple of games to get back to match sharpness.

3335~~~
Kept trying that cut inside and shoot thing, resulting in the ball dribbling towards Guzan.

Not match fit right now, hopefully he'll look back to his best against Newcastle.

3336~~~
Have to be honest, he's borderline awful as a winger so far. Not just based on this game.

3337~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3338~~~
And people are laughing at me when I say that Nani is better winger than him. Worse player of course, but better winger.

3339~~~
Did LvG actually sign him to play him as winger? He's not been in central midfield for a long time now.

3340~~~
We played a little better for a while after he was subbed on, he provided the pace and movement that we needed upfront, but individually it was a bad performance from him. Disappeared in the end. Nothing to worry about though, he isn't match-fit and it wasn't a best game to regain match fitness.

3341~~~
Too many weak shots on goal. Should focus on this teammates as he eases his way back in.

3342~~~
Hopefully we can get a 4-4-2 diamond with Carrick, Herrera, Di Maria and Mata all playing together. The latter 3 is when we have played our best football.

3343~~~
As a winger, yes, Nani's crossing is better than Di Maria.

3344~~~
Added good pace and movement, but his shots were wasteful. If he's going to play as a winger, he's better on the right cutting in, rather than the left IMO.

3345~~~
Too greedy on the right and we didn't get the ball out to him enough on the left, needs to step it up over Christmas.

3346~~~
Kind of tried to be the hero didn't he? You just can't do that is this league...hopefully he will learn...

3347~~~
fecked up the momentum we had we he came on with his useless shots. Maybe if would have been better to put him in central midfield and put Rooney upfront... 

Since he came here he was fantastic every time he played central and shit when he played wide and these days he seems to play wide all the time.

3348~~~
Lets be honest, he was woeful.

3349~~~
Since he came to United he is insisting on long range shots but they look nothing special. He can score from around the box but I have no idea why he tries so many shots from longer distances.

3350~~~
Didn't think he was bad on the right (more up front anyways), couldn't get into the game on the left though. It wasn't him coming on that killed our momentum, it was Wilson on for Valencia. We were looking pretty good at first with him up front and got close to going in behind on occasion.

3351~~~
Was expecting more from him today, maybe that's unfair. Too many shots from distance when he should have passed.

3352~~~
Play him centrally. Wasted out wide largely in part because there were no other people making supporting runs off him which made play very one dimensional. Has been off form for quite a while now and hope he regains it quick.

3353~~~
It's hilarious and frustrating in equal measure that we've broken our transfer record twice in this calendar year, yet insist on playing both of these players in a different position to the one which gave us cause to buy them in the first place.

3354~~~
Another puzzling decision by LVG to put him as a wing back, Mata should have been taken off, Rooney as no.10 and Di Maria in midfield.

3355~~~
got into a couple of decent positions but his shooting was that of someone who hasn't played in a month....he will improve and can't wait to see him and Herrera back in the starting lineup

3356~~~
That's not being honest. That's being ridiculous.

3357~~~
Even before his injury, he's been trying to force things, to force the dribbling and the crazy shooting. I think he needs to relax and not try to shoulder more responsibility. He's so good already.

3358~~~
Needs to play in midfield.

3359~~~
I expected much more from him since he joined us. Apart from his first couple of games, he's not been in good form.

3360~~~
He was injured for the past month? What do you expect in his 30 minutes he was on today where everyone else is standing still.

Incredible how quickly people make their minds up about players.

3361~~~
I didn't say about today, but from before his injury, he didn't play well then either.

3362~~~
Why was he taking a shot [and very weak ones at that] at every slightest opportunity? It's the sort of thing most United fans would kill Nani for.

3363~~~
Doesn't really stop him from having the most assist in our squad though, even when we've thrown him on the wing where he looks a lot worse.

3364~~~
I'd much rather that than pointlessly passing the ball around.

3365~~~
He played really well against Arsenal, got an assist and should have scored but that doesn't take away that he was our most threatening player on the night. Was poor by his standards against City, Chelsea and Palace I think but it's not like he was awful. Came when he was put out on the wing against the 2 best teams in the league who are both very good defensively and then just a quiet game vs Palace. Wouldn't be worried. Once he gets back into midfield he'll be back to his brilliant best.

3366~~~
You will, because it's Di Maria. You get the point hehe..It will suddenly become "stupid and selfish" if it's Nani.

3367~~~
And it's the thing people praise Ronaldo for. Personally I never criticized Nani for it, or very rarely did. I would much rather that players have a go from range then do whatever Mata tried today, always play it safe and then the attack just dies out.

3368~~~
I'm a big Nani fan so...

3369~~~
Hope you are correct. My worry at the moment though is that LvG for some reason will keep him on the wing. I can't understand why he changed him from central midfield when he was that good in his first games for us. Poor from LvG.

3370~~~
Not sure why but I'm finding it very difficult to warm to him. Just can't put my finge on why. Maybe I expect too much from him

3371~~~
It isn't being ridiculous, he hasn't been a good winger for us at all. In fact even at Madrid he had consistency issues on the wing, until Ancelotti utilised and reinvented him in that central attacking midfield role. I doubt we can even switch to a 4-3-3 with Di Maria on the wing if he continues performing like this

3372~~~
For goodness sake...we actually sign a top world class player and people are complaining..I mean it is his first season in a brand new league and he's been injured...get a bloody grip. Sure he might fall on his arse here and hate it...but give him a chance at least...certainly more than just one season...

3373~~~
Not you, just the general perception of United fans to certain players is what am trying to point out really <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3374~~~
You're reacting as if people asked for him to be benched. Chill out.

3375~~~
Think he just wanted more defensive shape with wingers actually as we were too open before hand, and our winger options are shite so he had to go out wide. It makes sense as we were playing against Chelsea and City. Hopefully long term he stays in midfield, though as a winger he does have it in him to be class, just is a bit out of form. He's much better as a winger when the team is counter attacking anyways as he was against Arsenal.

3376~~~
A bit greedy when he came on today. I admire him trying to go for goal - but sometimes it was just ridiculous.

3377~~~
Di Maria dominated in midfield yet LVG plays him as a winger and then, after he was able to at least cause some problems from the right, LVG moves him to the left where he was useless. A player who costs his money should play well anywhere, but van Gaal definitely hasn't used him well either. Nonetheless di Maria has to pick it up. Right now, Sanchez, Fabregas and Costa look like the much better transfers.

3378~~~
He's more like a second striker in that Arsenal's game, which is where i think  his best position.

3379~~~
Actually I am chilled out....just a little tired of the negativity, from knee jerk reactions, of a player who...lets be honest...hasn't really played for us much yet.

3380~~~
Needs to play in the middle as his COMPLETELY wasted on the wing, his in a new league and a new country we needs to lay off him a bit. Everyone has different time scales when getting used to these changes it's just frustrating when you look at Sanchez at Arsenal and how quick his made a difference.  

When he gets settled in his gonna be fantastic for us, I'm just dreaming of him assisting Falcao next season when we are destroying the PL<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3381~~~
With Falcao just looking for a chance and Di Maria continuing making the wrong decisions almost everytime there won't be much destroying. Based on about the last 7 matches, Di Maria doesn't deserve to start.

3382~~~
I don't really see any agenda against him generally, I'd hazard a guess that many of our fans view him as our best player, maybe by some distance (I do)
edit: along with de Gea

3383~~~
I saw a lot of him at Real Madrid prior to last season - which, admittedly, was said to have been his best - and he was nowhere near a £60m player. Real must have been pleasantly surprised we offered so much money.

3384~~~
Luckily your not our manager then, did you see RVP's form up until recently, I'm sure you was saying the same thing but luckily for us we have a experienced manager in charge who knows how to man manage his players, other wise we would be starting with 3 players, De Gea in Goal Carrick in midfield and Rooney up top!!!

3385~~~
I'm just not 100% convinced by him. 

Not as this megastar talent, a notch below Ronaldo and Messi. Which is where the hype (and the fee) would put him. Not from what I've seen at United anyway. 

Quick, direct, decent left foot and an eye for a pass but he seems quite easy to defend against. Not seen anything we didn't get from Nani on a good day and his good days don't look like they're any more frequent than Nani's good days.

Probably being overly negative and it was only a cameo today. Hopefully onwards and upwards from here.

3386~~~
To be honest I'm not even sure any fans can say that. He's not our best player at the moment with what he has done in the team. On paper yes...but certainly not in actions. I just think the expectations of a supposedly world class player can exceed what they can actually do in a team that has hardly any world class players to mix with.... well...perhaps unless you are Ronaldo!

3387~~~
'Quite easy to defend' he's fecking rapid, when he's on he's impossible to defend. He's pretty much a younger version of the latter era Giggs I reckon, very direct and perhaps too much at times, I think there's a lot more to come from him.

3388~~~
Personally..and only my opinion, I really believe he will not adapt to the Premier league, but more importantly...the whole culture of Manchester, England and all it entails...if you get my drift. There is something..and I can't put my finger on it, a bit incongruous about him...

3389~~~
Nothing wrong with being selfish.
We needed a goal.
Nobody else in the team was shooting at goal (on target), so Di Maria was taking it in his own hands.

3390~~~

3391~~~
He's a risk taker and a match winner, it was great to see someone actually trying to be direct and score.

I hope he doesn't change.

3392~~~
That's why I don't wanna splash a lot of money on Falcao either.

3393~~~
If better options were on, then yeah there is a bit of wrong to it. We were around their box, with a couple of players potentially free for a pass/better place to shoot. 

Doing it once was fine, but doing the exact same again with the same result is just annoying.

3394~~~
I'm convinced he'll prove to be a top player for us if played through the middle. But I must say I'm very surprised at how average he is out wide. Thought his dribbling was much better than what he's shown so far, particularly in tight areas. He never seems to have complete control of the ball and I don't think I've seen him beat a fullback.

3395~~~
Is it just me or does he have some really lazy technique at times? Like with his shooting right after he came on. We're lucky his efforts reached the goal

3396~~~
Worth every penny through the middle, but he's nowhere near a 60M winger, imo.

3397~~~
Greedy? He was watching the match too and saw nothing was being created and he knows he capable of winning matches so you cannot blame him from coming on and trying it.  Only complaint I have with him is the corners but if that's all he's bad at we're laughing.

3398~~~
Exactly. He is a match winner and was just trying something special, as you say wasn't like we were creating chance after chance.

Only thing I will say, he doesn't seem to have bought into us / prem just yet, that does worry me a little.

3399~~~
Since Fergie left we've become a kind of 'buyer of last resort' in world football. 

'For that awkward player, with a big reputation, you just can't shift. Phone Ed.

The number is.....Anything You Want!'

3400~~~
Some of the fans here. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He just came back from injury and some of you are on about not being convinced by him,that he wont adapt to the PL, Manchester and cold weather, he wont succeed. And not only that, he hasnt bought into us to... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Based on what? 

How quickly some fans turn against their own players and to make it worse after he just came back..

Lets sell this useless greedy bastard in the summer.

3401~~~
Fair or not, he'll always be criticized the most just based on his price tag. If you spend a large sum on a player, you expect him to produce accordingly. Prior to his injury, he was not performing well so most of us expect him to return to the player he was in his first few games with us.

3402~~~
Fair enough but its a matter of opinion what should he do and offer for a certain price tag. People shouldnt judge players on price tags but that's just my opinion.

 I just think its ridiculous to slag him like this after he just came back from injury. People go to extremes, from worshiping him to writing about him not adapting to PL ever and all that based on nothing really.

3403~~~
First game back in a while and looked a bit rusty, which is nothing out of the ordinary.

3404~~~
i think he looked ok... lively at least.

But that position behind the strikers doesn't suit him at all. He needs space to run to, and he needs to be part of the creation of our game linking up from deep and moving up.

Rooney playing in midfield instead of him (or any other midfielder) is so annoying.

3405~~~
We've missed him. He comes on and goes completely against the whole team's morale. He takes risks and shots, something that the whole team wouldn't do today. I hope his confidence and play style doesn't change in his time here

3406~~~
on the wing he is too predictable and up against full backs seems a lot slower. Again i have to repeat what most people say, but play him through the middle in a 3 man midfield and he will shine.

3407~~~
He was MOTM against the best defensive side in the world last season when it mattered the most. He's got clear deficiencies and is not worth the fee, but I don't particularly care considering we shit gold up our arses.

3408~~~
Get him back on the left of a three man midfield with some one who can dribble in front of him in a front 3 (Bale would be nice) and the guy is top drawer as teams struggle to double up on him in this position.

3409~~~
Even though the best football of his career so far has come in the middle, if he is used on the wing he will still be very productive even if he does not put in great performances over the 90 on a consistent basis. At Madrid when he was playing on the right there were plenty of games where he was average or poor by constantly losing the ball and making bad decisions but he still ended up with a goal or an assist. If the wing is where Van Gaal is going to keep using him then he will still be very effective and have great output, despite being a bit frustrating from time to time. I hope he can stay fit now and get a run of games and show what he can do.

3410~~~
Well, fullbacks are generally faster than central midfielders, so it is no wonder that he appears slower on the wing. That said, I think Nani is faster than Di Maria. Di Maria is amazing at carrying the ball through the middle of the park because he is very fast, but more importantly, he is exceptionally agile whilst carrying the ball. In many ways, he is like Ryan Giggs in CM with the legs of a younger Giggs.

3411~~~
He still made some of a threat over 20 odd minutes after coming back from an injury than all of our other players did through a whole 90. He's got that sense of urgency about him that few of our other players have, that they don't seem to attack the goal as often as they should. When Di Maria sees the goal in sight, you can tell he has the motive to attack it himself more often than not, or if he can't see an opening then he will look for an opening to let someone else in. We have been piss poor in attacking the goal in our past 5 games, and Di Maria coming on must have had more shots on goal than any other player in the time that he was on. I don't care that they were poor shots; the fact of the matter was that he made the effort to test the goalie rather than us losing the ball through weak possession around the box, which we have done so often around the box recently.

3412~~~
A fantastic player for sure but I can't help but think that we've paid over the odds for players like him and Mata who were both deemed surplus to requirements by teams we aim to be beating.

To think that a lot of fans last season were thinking that us getting £20-30M for Rooney would be good business.

Regardless of all the new signings we've made this season our most important players are still Rooney, Carrick and DDG.

The bigger problem is that there are four massive players in key positions whom we've lost in the last 2-3 years and still, IMO, haven't replaced:

Ferdinand
Vidic
Giggs
Scholes

I don't really see many players in the world right now who can adequately replace what these four (in their prime) did for us.

3413~~~
Who Madrid deem surplus to requirements depends entirely on the whim of a chairman who runs the club like a teenager plays Football Manager. There is a list of players discarded by them who have gone on to establish themselves as world class.

Also Di Maria is probably as close as you will get to a modern version of Giggs...

3414~~~
Ferdinand -- Varane
Vidic -- Kompany
Giggs -- Bale
Scholes -- Verratti

Of course, there's no chance in hell of signing any of them.

3415~~~
Mata, I agree. Di Maria on the other hand was in the top 3 for Madrids best players last season (Ronaldo, Modric and Di Maria easily ahead of everyone else), and their best player in the champions league final and many other big games. He wouldn't have been surplus to requirements if he didn't have a bit of a contract problem and James Rodriguez didn't score 6 goals in the world cup which made Perez want to splash the cash even though Di Maria is a better player. Was definitely top 10, arguably top 5 players in the world last season. So yeah, he wasn't surplus to requirements, he was a very key player for what is the best team in the world, and that's why we needed to pay so much.
Also, we aim to get to Real Madrids level eventually, but it will be very hard because I can't see us matching a forward line like they have with Ronaldo and co.

And as Stringer said, Di Maria is probably as close as it gets to a Giggs when he was in his prime. Great at running with the ball, excellent crosser of the ball, incredibly quick, can play in the middle or out wide, left footed and has a great eye for a pass. He's easily up there with Rooney and De Gea as our most important players (Blind is a like for like replacement for Carrick), as without him we become very pedestrian, though we can still get results. Just give him a few games to get back up to speed and in his proper position and he'll show how important he can be for us.

3416~~~
I don't like his shooting selection. Tries the impossible too often and has been lucky that once or twice they've actually turned into assists. Good to see him back though.

3417~~~
Unfortunately he has been playing like the old Di Maria for Real instead of the last season Di Maria for Real for quite some time now. I hope he finds again what made him so strong last season or else we have bought a very expensive Nani.

3418~~~
Its amazing how quickly people forget and the narrative changes. In his first month here, people were talking about us being a one man team, being over reliant on him, wondering how we'd cope if we got injured. I also seem to remember a few saying he was to good for us.

A couple of sub par performances, and an injury later, and he's rubbish. Genuinely amazing.

3419~~~
It really is astonishing...

Give it a bit of time and I am sure he'll be at his best. We are by far more threatening with him than without, we just lack balance at the minute. 

I think he is trying to be the star man a bit too much. He needs to get into his groove, which was never scoring loads of screamers, but rather being amazingly effective when running with the ball and then assisting. 

He'll be fine.

3420~~~
30mins after an injury layoff and he gets criticised for setting the world alight. Incredible.

Going forwards as well, if we want to see him as the 60mil man we bought, we play him where he became the 60mil man, in CM. If we play him out wide, we'l never see the best of him and all this moaning about not performing like a 60mil player will continue but would make no sense as he wasnt a 60mil player on the wings even at Real.

Let him get fit first. When he does, play him at fecking CM and see the best of him.

3421~~~
The only issue I have with him is his constant speculative efforts from distance. Perhaps someone will correct me but I don't remember him doing the same at Madrid. I also understand since he had Ronaldo and Bale in the same team so it didn't perhaps necessitate for him to go for goals. But we also have some very good finishers. Maybe he thinks he is the biggest player here and can do things like that. He was never a prolific goal-scorer. He should try and set up assists for our strikers. There were times yesterday when he could have played one of Falcao or RvP in but he instead went for tame shots from 20-22 yards out. Made feck all sense since he kept repeating it.

3422~~~
That's a flawed logic. At some point even our resources are depleted and all we're left with is a roster full of overpaid players who still won't get the job done. Arsenal picked up Sanchez for a little more than half of di Maria's price and he seems to be performing just as well.

3423~~~
So much knee-jerking and i can't help but let it get to me. He has been out awhile ffs, don't expect him to come in the side second half and havoc everyone and everything.
And he just isn't that good out wide nevermind in a wing-back position, play him in CM and he is world-class, we will all see that when gets to start there again and all this moaning will be over.

We should all look at things in a bigger perspective than one sub performance.

3424~~~
It is amazing, isn't it?
I'm baffled how some of our fans quickly turned against him...

He wasnt that good apparently, he's not worth the price tag, he probably wont adapt to the PL and Manchester, he's not that special. Amount of kneejerking in this thread is just fascinanting.

From the posts about him not knowing why the hell he ever came to us to this ridiculous stuff..

3425~~~
I don't think anybody's turning against him or knee-jerking. People realise what his qualities are and that he showed a very good start for us, but also that he's had injuries that have set him back. However, he's not been as effective out wide as we'd have hoped and it's ironic that many players who people were saying we should sell last season are the ones who are performing for us right now: Rooney, Fellaini, Young, Carrick, Valencia.

3426~~~
No, concerning Van Persie I was saying something completely different. The difference with Van Persie is that in poor form he keeps thinking, looking for the right choices, not trying to force himself into form with an impossible shot. 

Probably Van Gaal's strongest point is that he gives players do's and don'ts and if they stick to that they can within that margin be as creative as they want without causing problems. Di Maria is either not obeying them or has been given to big a margin for his own poor decision making. Benching him might be an incentive to become a player in a teamsport again by making decisions that benefit the team performance.

3427~~~
I have no doubts about Di Maria. He came off the bench yesterday after watching us create hardly anything and he's ready to prove himself again after an injury so he was probably trying too hard hence why he was shooting a lot. I'm sure he will start the game against Newcastle on boxing day and he'll hopefully show why we paid so much for him. So far his season has been good, three goals and six assists is great but I do feel this lad has got a lot more to show.

3428~~~
Injured in training apparently......

3429~~~
Hopefully just being rested for sunday and isn't injured ...

3430~~~
Where did you hear that?

3431~~~
Our injuries are incredible

3432~~~
2015 will be luckier.  Has to be.

3433~~~
Injured again. Fecking ridiculous stuff.

3434~~~
Source ?

3435~~~
MUTV

3436~~~
Just said it on mutv.

3437~~~
Something is surely wrong at Carrington

It can't be just Van Gaal's training because we have massive injury problems since 5 years

3438~~~
This is beyond ridiculous.  Have we had more injuries in training than in games?  An obvious area that requires reconsideration by LvG.

3439~~~
Could be Jones! We know for sure at least 3 times he has injured players in the past.

3440~~~
MUTV

3441~~~
I've gone beyond the stage where you have to laugh or you'll cry. Now I just cry <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3442~~~
I'm hoping this is some kind of mindfeck for Spurs' benefit and he'll be starting on Sunday.

3443~~~
Just ban training. There's no point.

3444~~~
Maybe he just didn't fancy this cold winter fixture congestion..

3445~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

How many games has he played since that interview he did on not getting injured?

3446~~~
Although, as bad as it is, I think it would be worse if we lost a defender (or Carrick). I think we have enough going forward to cope without him, as we did when we went on the winning run.

3447~~~
United Training caught on film.

3448~~~
ffs I was looking forward to watch him play, not much excitement in this Utd team already and now that he's out <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

That would be giving Spurs way too much respect. Highly unlikely.

3449~~~
Unbelievable. I'm so pissed off.

3450~~~
This has to come down to poor management and our incompetent physiotherapy team. When the unexpected becomes expected, we can no longer claim these events to be fortuitous. Hopefully, Van Gaal is just taking precautions and resting him for our next upcoming fixture.

3451~~~
We actually have starting now. Only recovery days for the festive period. Watch someone get injured coming out of an ice bath now.

3452~~~
He was just getting over an injury so its probably down to bad luck.

3453~~~
Ffs what a joke. Really don't understand how every player we have can be so injury prone this season. Half a season gone and not once have we had something like a full strength team.

3454~~~
If anything, that shows we haven't handled his recovery properly.

3455~~~
There is a good chance we won't see a full strength 11 this season.

3456~~~
Not necessarily. People are frustrated that he's not playing and quite are willing to invent scapegoats.

3457~~~
And on the other end you have people blaming everything on bad luck.

3458~~~
That's entirely plausible, as all other kneejerk scapegoat theories imply the club is deliberately allowing its players to get injured, which is both laughable and prosperterous.

3459~~~
The players even had a day off training yesterday yet he found a way to injure himself on training <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3460~~~
Why the feck is nobody asking LVG what's the reason behind all those injuries in training? This is getting fecking ridiculous.

Jones back in training, injuries start to happen again, ref United, Fergie bought the FA, etc.

3461~~~
I am not an injury expect, but the injury he just came of was perhaps a grade 1 hamstring injury based of our management team taking the precaution to take him of early at that time. Which normal takes at most two weeks to recover. Di Maria has been out for over three weeks if I recall and should have fully recovered by now. Unless, he had a recurring strain in his hamstring due to poor man management during one of our training session, I can not see how luck would come into this equation. It has to come down to poor man management. But, I am hopefully that Van Gaal is just taking pre-caution and he will be fit by Sunday. However, I will not hold my breath, believing that will happen.

3462~~~
His training methods have to be helping cause this. This is ridiculous

3463~~~
This.

3464~~~
Well, there goes the only pace in the team, more slowly, slowly does it I guess.

3465~~~
Hard to make any sort of assessment unless one is a doctor with access to the physio reports.

3466~~~
Can't we just rescind our participation from the 2014/15 Premier League season before our players straight up die?

3467~~~
Been very disappointed with di Maria after a great start. Injuries, inconsistent performance and talking up a transfer to PSG.

3468~~~
He had one sub appearance I think. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I just knew he will end up injured after reading it.

3469~~~
This is getting boring now. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3470~~~
I'm starting to genuinely think he wants away now.

3471~~~
I was laughing as I read it, thinking you poor niave guy, you are going to get massacred by our medical team for your blasphemous words. They have the ability to injure anyone and will not take the challenge lying down.

3472~~~
Because he's injured? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Beat me to it.

3477~~~
how long he out for?

3478~~~
Instead of spending insane money for Gareth fecking Bale I hope we are building a new medical center and spend most of the money for it. Our injury record is a big joke and it was already before LvG. Maybe he needs to change the training a little bit, but even then it's not the only problem.

3479~~~
I've said it before, you are supposed to miss a 60m player,badly really. Its a good thing we dont,but is it?

3480~~~
I do wonder what the problem is? Perhaps the intensity of our training sessions is too high?

3481~~~
Could've done with him away to spurs and stoke!

3482~~~
Not a heavy injury but we didn't want to take a risk.

Van Gaal on mutv.

3483~~~
He'll be back for Spurs.

3484~~~
I love the lad and would have really liked to see him start.
But during the game I was wondering... where would he have started today? Mata looked good today.

3487~~~
<i>"His pelvis is not in right relationship with his leg."</i>

The... what?

3488~~~
He's Angel Di Maria. He basically picks himself when fit. One of RVP or Falcao can drop out.

3489~~~
Di Maria has been selected in the L'Equipe team of 2014.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B53omxtCcAEEMRG.jpg" src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B53omxtCcAEEMRG.jpg"/>

3490~~~
That does not make sense <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3491~~~
where does he start?

he starts as pick number 1 alongside Rooney and DeGea then 8 others form around him.

3492~~~
was he in the squad that travelled to spurs?

3493~~~
How long will he be out for? Anyone knows?

3494~~~
I think the lack of info coming out of the club indicates no one knows. Pelvis injury could be lengthy.

3495~~~
Most created clear cut chances so far in Europe's league. 24, one more than Messi who came in second. 

Averaging 2 times more clear cut chances created per game than Messi isn't bad. According to WhoScored's half season analysis.

3496~~~
Hopefully he'll be fit for the Southampton game to start. Will probably get subbed on against Yeovil to get a run out. We've missed him in terms of our play, not so much results though we probably would've turned at least one of the 3 drawn games into wins had he been fit.

3497~~~
Can't wait for him to hit form again in the middle of the park for us. He looked on another level for a good few weeks there early in the season.

3498~~~
He'll come back and we'll lose Falcao, Herrera and Smalling again. It's annoying because it's true.

3500~~~
any hope he'll be on the bench at least on sunday?

3501~~~
I almost hope not...our record signing on a bumpy pitch against a bunch of over excited League One hopefuls looking to crunch tackles in from minute one?

Think I'd rather he was brought back for Saints at home.

3502~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>
Very surprising tbf. Better than Fabregas? Makes you think, how many clear cut chances had Van Persie missed earlier this season?

EDIT: oh, it's for the whole 2014. Not surprising at all then

3503~~~
Where do you guys think we should play him long-term?

I'm thinking once we get a little more luck with injuries, and van Gaal recruits a few more of his own troops (meaning he can play how he wants) we will see di Maria move from midfield up into the front 3. 

I doubt it's a secret any more that he wants Strootman, so I think next season a midfield 3 of Strootman, Blind, Herrera and a front 3 of Rooney, di Maria, Falcao.

Thoughts?

3504~~~
From what I've seen I reckon you're probably going to be wrong about quite a few of those. Strootman remains to be seen, obviously, but I think LVG really rates Carrick so as long as he doesn't drop off I can see Blind in and out of the team. I'm not convinced he really rates Herrera and I expect to see Rooney in there as LVG doesn't seem to fancy him as a striker. It'll probably be ADM and A N other wide of RVP.

3505~~~
Next season though Carrick will be 34, RvP will be 32, Rooney 30, so I doubt all 3 will be starting. Carrick probably, though I can see him being rotated with Blind but both getting more then enough games, Rooney will obviously still be fine to play week in, week out, but with Van Persie I'm not sure. Think he might be just a squad player next year. If we do complete the Falcao deal then he'd be the lone striker I'd guess with Rooney and Di Maria drifting behind him, though maybe Rooney will be the lone striker as well, with Mata and Di Maria drifting. None of them are particularly suited to being stuck on the wing, both Di Maria and Rooney and even Mata are better given free roles to roam I think. I do think he rates Herrera as well, just sometimes we're too lightweight in midfield or don't have the right balance with him and Mata in front of Blind or something. Put Strootman and Carrick or Blind alongside him and I think he'd excel.
Something like between these 2 would be might guess: 

or

3506~~~
Given he played for most of the year in 2014, do you think we're covering up a Christmas break here?

He clearly strained his hamstring so is it a possibility that we have granted him a rested phase of rehabilitation through muscular conditioning and strengthening treatments? My only thinking is that a pelvic injury or misalignment or whatever story we've fed the press lately would obviously have been detected in the medical before the transfer. Therefore it feels like we've just covered it up with a generic injury without any great detail or explanation of course.

Ferguson gave Ronaldo little breaks here and there before too. It's not an unknown approach from us. Especially with non-acclimatised players of this elite quality.

3507~~~
I'm actually impressed on how we've coped without him but it's still clear we're missing his drive and creativity on the pitch.

3508~~~
Yeah I think it's perfectly feasible. It wouldn't be good PR for our biggest signing ever to take Christmas off, despite the fact it should revitalise him for a big second half of the season.

3509~~~
He's our best player. Play him in his best position, and don't waste him out wide.

3510~~~
This. I want him as involved in the build up as possible. 

One thing I haven't liked is his selfishness at times so far. It's like the opposite of the selfless player we saw at madrid. Maybe were trying to have him as more of a goal threat but like madrid I think we have enough of those. What we need from him is exactly what he did for madrid. Tireless running and excellent attacking midfield play. Which he was doing till he got injured for most parts, with an extra doze of aforementioned selfishness.

3511~~~
I did think this also as the reason LVG gave was more confusing then anything else. If it is the case then LVG I feel has made a good decision as ADM is our best player and we need to keep him wrapped in cotton wool! You never know we might be going for a title charge....

3512~~~
Yes, but also he will naturally go wide and cross because thats what he likes to do. So whether you play him there or not, he'll end up there at times

3513~~~
That's fine, but when he's been played wide for us he's stayed wide and it's resulted in poorer performances by him.

3514~~~
<a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> <a class="username" data-user="78472, @Will Singh" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78472/">@Will Singh</a> glad you both agree and I'm not alone in that theory.

While Falcao obviously missed a large chunk of the season, he needs to prove his fitness. I also think the same can theory can be applied to Herrera and Rojo too.

Ander obviously had the rib injury but the exclusions from the bench over this period were notable as it reduced our options.

Rojo came back and then has again had similar quiet periods however his situation is much closer aligned to ADM as he is the only one of the new signings to play the entire World Cup also, not unrealistic for him to have been a part of 80+ games (arguably more but there were suspensions at Sporting) in 2014.

3515~~~
Yes, and its harder to mark him when he's gone wide from a different position because you already have to mark the wideman who is supposed to be out there. So you get easy 2vs1s or 3 if the fullback is there too

3516~~~
Pelvic misalignment can occur at any time. If his body has started breaking down because of the long year he has had it wouldn't surprise me if things like that start going. Not that I completely disagree that he could be giving him a rest.

3517~~~
If we really were just giving him time off there would have been no reason to have him on the bench for the Villa game. Why give him 20 random minutes, claim he's back fit and then lie again saying he's injured himself?

3518~~~
I don't know if this is the right game to bring him back. I don't think Yeovil are a dirty team or anything, but he'd be a massive target.

3519~~~
Keep his fitness levels up while still resting him?

3520~~~
If he's being given a break then say it. There's no need for cloak and daggers. When Fergie gave Ronaldo time off he didn't invent fake injuries to fool the fans. Van Gaal doesn't strike me as the type of person who worries what people would think of him if he gave a player some time off.

3521~~~
He strikes me as quite a straight talker, if he said there was some kind of injury I believe him.

3522~~~
If we do, then we'll be a one man team [atleast that's what you'll say]. It's a good thing that we don't crumble because we have lost a particular player or two, no matter how good that player is. If you think he's not that good, then that's fine.

3523~~~
It's pretty obvious we'd have looked much better if he was there in the squad. But with Van Gaal's emphasis on a system and team being more important than individual players, I'd expect us to become a team that copes well without some of its stars given time.

3524~~~
We obviously miss him, but it's good we're not completely reliant on him.

3525~~~
I just got carried away with the results. Its fair to say we miss him badly. Our football is awful at times despite this unbeaten run.

3526~~~
Woohoo! Nice finish. Welcome back!

3527~~~
He loves those little dinks, does our Angel.

3528~~~
Good performance and finish.

3529~~~
Hopefully that will give him a nice bit of confidence to bring to his league return.

3530~~~
We're going to miss a player like him but i just hope he plays in the middle at our next PL game!

3531~~~
We look so much better with him but still an absolute dire performance

3532~~~
His injection of pace and threat makes everyone elses skills come out. He makes a big difference to our forward play.

3533~~~
Great to have him back. Hopefully he stays fit now

3534~~~
Even Real missed him at the start of the season.

3535~~~
Great finish, good to see him back!

3536~~~
He definitely made a difference when he came one, ran at the Yeovil defence, sent in 2/3 nice balls into their penalty area and then the goal. A very good 45 mins from a player just back from injury.

3537~~~
Hope this will get him going. We have not seen enough of him since he joined. Great start, then poor, then injured, 20 mins against Villa and injured again.

Play him as much as possible and we have a fantastic player in his 2013/14 form.

3538~~~
Get him back at LCM. He, Mata & Herrera can link up very well imo.

3539~~~
Welcome back Angel. Came on and looked hands down our best player.

3540~~~
Yeah...we kind of need to keep this guy. Offer him whatever he wants.

3541~~~
Our counterattacks will always be a cause of concern with him back playing, teams will be worried about that.

3542~~~
Eh? We've only just bloody signed him, why would we be offering him anything?

3543~~~
Remember when we signed him, and tons of people thought it was a stupid move? Loads of people said he was overpriced, that he was a luxury and/or panic buy when the team needed players in other positions far more. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3544~~~
Just with all the PSG rumours and that. I know they could all be bs but if they are true then you know, we just need to make we keep him.

3545~~~
We badly missed his pace, looked good today even if he was being played as a striker.

Half expected him to feck up his goal at the end like Arsenal away though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3546~~~
Glad to see him back, his pace alone will make us more threatening.

3547~~~
Done very well to maintain his cool to chip the ball over the keeper

3548~~~
Bails us out with that line clearance from their corner and then scores a goal, great to have him back.

3549~~~
Jesus christ though, give over. We've just signed him and you're already going midtable mentality on us?

3550~~~
Always fantastic to see Angel score no matter if it's an EPL match or FA cup<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3551~~~
nice to have him back. hopefully he will avoid all those injuries from now on.

3552~~~
Midtable mentality? I don't even know what that means but no. I'm just saying he's our most important alongside Rooney and De Gea and it's great to see him back and I hope he stays here for many years. Period.

3553~~~
The mentality of worrying about selling players when a club comes along. We are not a selling club ffs. You are panicking, literally, over nothing.

3554~~~
I thought he was going to miss that dink, again.

3555~~~
Breath of fresh air when he came on, hope he can get a good run of games under his belt now.

3556~~~
Before he came on I was just tense with the way we are playing but it's amazing how my reaction changed when he came on and more importantly the players looked much better on the ball. They see him in training and they know what he can do and I'm so fecking happy we have him. His the next best thing to Ronnie and will be as good for us!

3557~~~
The most pleasing this about his play, apart from pace, is when he gets the ball he ALWAYS looks to try and carry the attack forwards!!!

3558~~~
Man of the match? Not much competition mind.

3559~~~
Great finish finally some pace to our side

3560~~~
Funny how people seemed to forget how good he was after like 2 below par performances and him being out injured.

3561~~~
Quite simply, just an essential player for us.

3562~~~
I don't know if I just notice it more these days, but football fans seem to be more knee jerk than ever before. Players can literally go from being not good enough to start to being among the best in the league in the space of four or five performances.

3563~~~
It's honestly ridiculous.

3564~~~
Crucial in defence and attack, the way I love him. Now pls play him in midfield (or free role if it has to be) but not on the wing. He can still be useful as a winger but he just adds so much more when he isn't playing as a winger!

3565~~~
What do you mean? he's only just signed for us and I'd imagine he's already earning a ton of money.

3566~~~
What the feck are you talking about? He has only been here 6 months

3567~~~
Only player in the United front 6 that is direct, has pace ,drive and dribbling ability.
United as team have looked very pedestrian when he is out of the team.
Since Ronaldo left United have not had a player with that X factor (maybe Van Persie 2012/2013).
He is it.

3568~~~
Keep the fecker fit at all costs. He has counter attack written in his DNA, he will win us games and bring the best out of our midfield and Attack.

3569~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he already around £230k a week doesn't he?

3570~~~
Can't wait to see him for the full 90 again <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3571~~~
If used correctly, he will. I don't like him being shifted out wide.

3572~~~
We will need him for the run in and to hold on to a top four spot, we can't go in doing what we are doing

3573~~~
Nope nor do I and I don't think he likes it too much out there either.

3574~~~
Yeah, that's a funny statement. We just signed him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The pace and goal threat he adds <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3575~~~
Showed his class today, in both his defensive and attacking roles. Good to have him back

3576~~~
I stopped watching just after Herrera scored his goal (nice one at that). How did Di Maria do?

3577~~~
Very well, he was the only one who looked like they knew what they were doing.

3578~~~
I know what you mean.
The most ***-pleasing thing about our team is that when our defenders get the ball, they have a mentality of passing the ball backwards - eventually the ball goes to De Gea who hoofs it forward - the ball gets headed down to an opposing player. In effect, when we do all that back-passing, we are in effect passing the ball to the opposition.

I think all our players needs to think more about playing the ball forward and especially not to De Gea.

3579~~~
I think LVG is trying the replicate the system he had with the Dutch, pace upfront in concert with someone strong to hold the ball up.  I thought that Di Maria playing upfront against Arsenal was a one-off but think that it may be more frequent that that.  I guess LVG does realize that we don't have enough pace in the team hence he wants to utilize Di Maria in a position where he can use his pace to maximum effect.

3580~~~
He adds pace. Take off a striker and add him and we're fine.

3581~~~
I agree with what some are saying. Initially I wanted to play him as a winger but I think he is better in CM in a 4-1-2-1-2 or as the free roaming midfielder in the 4-3-3. He is too contained on the wing. 
I would rather see us sign someone like Robben, Depay or Cuadrado to play on the wing.

3582~~~
A truly gifted player. I know Yeovil had committed players forwards but he went from the edge of our box to the other end so quickly and you just knew he was going to score. He has qualities that other players just don't have. His pace on and off the ball and his composure and control of situations makes him nearly unplayable when he's in form. Some of his exchanges with Mata just had me <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

3583~~~
Played well when he came on, great to have him back.

3584~~~
He is the missing link in our attack, have the pace no one else in our team has. Will be crucial for the second half of the season.

3585~~~
Very nice cameo from him. I agree he is the missing player, the only one who will run at defenders with the ball and make things happen.

3586~~~
I'm not a fan of him as a striker, I much prefer him being on the ball in midfield so he can use his vision, or dribble at speed and use his agility to break teams down.

Like against villa when we brought him on and stuck him up top, there was no space for him to run into - it was a waste.

I feel our lack of genuine pace between our main strikers is making van gaal want to use him like that, but it's such a waste of his talents.

Obviously though today it worked, and has proved why pace will always be an important attribute.

3587~~~
Am I the only one that thought his touch was rather rusty and poor today. To be honest, I didn't think he played as well as some people are saying. He didn't playing badly, but he was far from his best. Saying that he is one of the few players that actually look like they want to attack at times and it paid off with the goal. I can't wait to see him back fully fit

3588~~~
The system he had in Real (4-3-3) was perfect. He started out as the CAM and whenever the left winger (Ronaldo) drifted into the centre, he occupied the space on the wing so that Ronaldo could play as a striker

3589~~~
Completely agree. Just take a look at how many awkward touches he had for the goal. It never seemed like he'll finish that. Also in many other instances his dribbling was a bit awkward. But thats probably just because of his return from injury. He'll get there soon enough

3590~~~
Di maria in his best performances for us are like when an exchange student comes from another country and they're insane at some obscure sport we dont play much in the UK. a class apart on form.

3591~~~
I know what you mean.  I feel like Rooney, Mata and di Maria have started forming a nice understanding.  If Herrera can get a run of matches, it will be great to see these 4 together, with Carrick and/or Fellaini in a holding role.

3592~~~
Problem with that logic is it doesn't account for games like against Stoke. Di Maria's pace will have no use if it's against teams with 10 men behind the ball, whereas his creative streak will.

3593~~~
Di Maria doesn't play upfront. I don't know why people say that. It's only during corners he's made to stay as high as possible to facilitate counter attacks using his devastating pace. Just look at De Gea during corners, if by any chance he catches the ball, he'll look straight for Di Maria who will be standing exactly at the halfway line and give him the ball. Another instance is when we are pinned back. Di Maria is wasted if we are making him track back. Just let the other players do the dirty work and he'll stay as high as possible. This guy can run the whole length of the pitch with the ball and create a goal from nothing. You won't see other midfielders behind di Maria all the time. He's the creative outlet. He's responsible for creating chances. LvG is making good use of him at times.

3594~~~
It's a sad feeling to feel that he is wasted here at United. Too good.

3595~~~
I prefer him to play in midfield where he can bring the ball forward, play brilliant balls to our front 3 players or come over the left to add some width. When playing upfront or as a winger he depends on our midfield to bring the ball forward and we all know how well they do that currently

3596~~~
Why do you think he's wasted?

7.8 Your rating

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3599~~~
Deservedly, we need him to kick on from where he began, we need that player of extra quality who can create something out of nothing.

3600~~~
Odd post. Too good for who? Rooney? Falcao? Van Persie? Mata? De Gea?

We're not a team full of superstars like Real Madrid and Barcelona, but we're hardly miles off.

3601~~~
Just play him in midfield and he'll boss it.

3602~~~
He left Real when they were at their peak, in terms of individuals and in teamplay. The team we have right now is being rebuilt, not sure what people expect of him or of us. We're on the way up, have some patience.

3603~~~
Yep, so frustrating that at the start of the season we played him there and he ran the show. He then got shoved onto the wing and his form dipped slightly, then got injured and is now playing upfront. 

What's changed since then I am not sure, but I would love to see him dribbling from the middle again. His passing and running is so much more dangerous in that area.

3604~~~
That makes no sense. Was Paul Scholes wasted at United during the (comparatively) lean early 2000s? How about Ruud? Di Maria's job is to take us to the next level - I imagine he is enjoying the challenge.

3605~~~
I did have a short spell where I thought Di Maria must wonder what he was doing here.

I think it was in the Chelsea game where we were still well down the table, barely getting a kick in the game etc.

However, look at us now, 3rd and not exactly the finished article by any means.

3606~~~
Just a gentle little reminder for those of you who seem to have have already forgotten just how good the lad is <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3607~~~
Ok he's quite good.

3608~~~
You mean this Chelsea game:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29679403" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29679403</a>

Where we had more possession than Chelsea?
And more than twice the number of shots on goal?

3609~~~
Good video, he's absolutely magic.

We really need to get back to how we were playing, attacking wise, earlier in the season. 

He clearly needs to play, but the issue is who do we drop? Because Mata deserves to remain in the side too.

3610~~~
Either one of the strikers or Mata. Di Maria is simply better.

3611~~~
As I said in another thread, it's one of the strikers that has got to be dropped. 

It's like having two guns with only one bullet being loaded into either gun every few minutes. It'd be a much better idea to have one gun having a bullet loaded into it every thirty seconds.

3612~~~
That pass with the outside of his foot to RVP is so good that if that happened in a video game I would of said that the game was broken and returned it.

3613~~~
Why does he keep doing that heart sign gesture after he scores? Any significance?

3614~~~
Man, i love that clip at 1:03-1:12. Grit, determination with a sprinkle of immense skill. Hope he can stay injury free for the rest of the season. The way i see it, he is our only player (except Rooney and maybe RvP) who can turn the tables with some individual brilliance in tough matches

3615~~~
For his little girl, who i think was born with complications and only barely made it thru

3616~~~
That's a nice gesture then. Do you know why Bale does it?

3617~~~
I take it you either weren't at the game, or watching it then!

Once again you can prove anything with stats, my goodness.

we stole a draw with a  last min equaliser. I doubt many thought it was deserved.

3618~~~
the Mirror quite incredibly have Mata, Di Maria, Rooney, Falcao and VP all starting

that'd be a fun lineup!

3619~~~
Just a cnut who copied. Di Maria has been doing it since his Benfica days as far as I know.

3620~~~
We were helped with the red card, which I think wasn't, but over 90 minutes, I do think that we deserved the draw.

3621~~~
I can see him dong great things here, what a talent he will be just as good as Ronnie was here maybe better all round player!!! Just hope he plays more central as that's where I think his played his best.

3622~~~
It was well deserved. It was a shame the goal came about after Ivanovic was sent off, but we were well in that game throughout. Hazard was a bit more effective than Di Maria, but we completely marked out Fabregas and Matic didn't control the game like he normally would. The most noticeable player on the pitch was Fellaini and it wasn't even because of his hair.

3623~~~
You just feel seeing him play that he'l absolutely flourish if we have a fast pacy striker that can play with him.

3624~~~
They dominated the first half, we dominated most of the second half. On balance, a draw was absolutely deserved.

3625~~~
Yup. You can already see how he makes Rooney play quicker in the same way he did in previous years, add another quick forward and we'll be flying again.

3626~~~
Blind also needs to get back to the first 11 asap.

3627~~~
It was entirely deserved, what are you on about. They were better in the second half and when they scored we werent really knocking on the door, it was instead just a stop start game as they tried to kill it but we created plenty of chances in the first half and were by far the better team

3628~~~
That chip against Leicester still makes my willy tingle even though the rest of the game was dire. 

It's pretty simple if we want to see this Di Maria again we need to play him CM by far his best position I really hope he plays CM from now on and not on the wing.

3629~~~
Watching the video, my thoughts exactly.

3630~~~
Looking at some of the play in those video's we are only 2 or 3 top players away from being back amongst the big boys. Hummels and reus for huge money would make us insane.

3631~~~
Its such an annoying goal. On the one hand its utterly brilliant, and for me our goal of the season so far, but on the other, whenever I see it all I can think of is what is about to come about an hour later in the game. Completely ruins it for me. fecking Leicester <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3632~~~
Still can't believe he plays for us.

I remember seeing him Real a few times and being blown away with how fast he was with the ball and how direct he was. In our Champions League game against Real I thought he was the most dangerous player before he went off injured and was also impressed by him at the world cup.

LVG needs to build the team around him and get him on the ball as much as possible. Defenders shit themselves when he runs at them. He can be wasteful at times but it's because he is always looking to make things happen, not pass the buck like some of our players are guilty of.

3633~~~
He's one of my favorite players in the world but he has to start performing again.

3634~~~
He has got to play in midfield, not on the wing, not striker. Play him in LCM and he will be unstoppable. Cant express how important this is. We will see the best out of him then.

3635~~~
just happy he is back, always able to produce some magic.

3636~~~
I can see him linking up well with Nani.. next season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Was great to see him back in the goals last game. Hopefully he'll produce more of that tomorrow

3637~~~
Feels like he's been gone for ages.Can't wait to watch him tomorrow.

3638~~~
Still depressed about that Leicester result. Not because of the result but more because it's hard to enjoy Di Maria's goal after a loss.

3639~~~
I still like to watch highlights of those first 50-60 minutes or so before closing it down, our attacking football was simply amazing back then.

3640~~~
I agree, I was probably a wee bit over critical of Mata at the start of the season but he's definitely impressed me recently and he's got goals...I just don't know how we are going to look for the run in where do we fit everyone in?

3641~~~
Angels back <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3642~~~
Its nearly Di Maria day <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3643~~~
He's going to be fantastic for the rest of the season. I can feel it in my length.

3644~~~
Middle one?

3645~~~
Lol, I read that as "leg" for some reason!

3646~~~
Left, Right, middle. Wherever it is, I'm feeling it

3647~~~
That's what Angel says to van Gaal.

3648~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3649~~~
I don't think he even needs that, he just needs players who can pass and think quickly around him - Herrera, Blind, Mata, RVP and then maybe someone with pace on the wings to give them relief. But down the middle, we need to play them all together. It would completely stop our zombie passing with our CBs, Fellaini and even Rooney, who for all the brilliance he brings, undoubtedly slows down the play a bit.

3650~~~
Can't wait to see him play today. He's such a class player. Also very direct. Still feels weird that we have him.

3651~~~
We need a big performance from him today I feel, hopefully he's in the middle rather than on the wing.

3652~~~
Really want to see him central again. I liked his performance against Arsenal and it worked against them but I prefer him giving our midfield a spark. 

Sadly, I think it will be Rooney who will deeper and Di Maria out wide.

3653~~~
Some pace upfront would allow us to play at a higher tempo. You can see he's used to playing much quicker, as you said, a pace that allows us to pass quickly. Currently, it feels as if he has to slow things down because of others.

3654~~~
I honestly read the last word as mouth for a split second. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3655~~~
i don't know but just got a funny feeling that bale is more buyable than rues. either one would be great for us though.

agree with you about those 2 or 3 players away from being back to one of the best team as well. hope we go for some  big names this summer.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3656~~~
I just hope he starts in midfield from now on

3657~~~
This x 1000! 

Do we think that he is starting today, considering he's just had that sub appearance at Yeovil?

3658~~~
I did put him in my starting lineup, but I have my doubts. Half-time sub maybe?

3659~~~
I'm torn 50/50, really. Normally, under van Gaal he wouldn't start quite yet - but it seems like he's been a bit less consistent with that rule lately. We shall see as the big man says.

3660~~~
He looked fit enough against Yeovil IMO. I think LVG will start him today. Southampton is the hardest game we've had in a while, and we'll need all of our best players.

3661~~~
Hoping for an impressive performance today. Would be nice to see him remind the rest of the premier league just what level of talent this guy has. Seems to have gone off the radar since his injury and weakish performances before then.

3662~~~
Love watching him; has that Ardiles lightness and movement, though way beyond as a player.

Glad he's not going to get dragged too deep without the ball, though saying that you should dominate possession. Expecting this to be amongst the best games of the season, though maybe a bit early with so many recent injury recoveries.

Looked sharp against Yeovil though and that was a week ago.

3663~~~
He has a bit of Hollywood Steve syndrome, every time he gets the ball he tries the final ball, dribble or shot. Frustrating when he is having a bad day.

3664~~~
RVP must be fuming with his constant long range shots <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3665~~~
Reminds me of Nanis poorer performances so far.

3666~~~
He should keep it simple and not try to some hero by shooting the ball from stupid angles and distances.

3667~~~
LVG is using him similar to how he used to use Arjen Robben. I like.

3668~~~
Started off well but nothing was working for him near the end of the half. Sometimes it seems as if he runs himself into the ground and plays the last 10 minutes of a half totally shattered.

3669~~~
He's not match sharp. This is pretty obvious.

3670~~~
Shite performance so far, but I'd prefer him to get the ball in deeper positions, earlier in our attacks. Or on the wing.

3671~~~
sanchez <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3672~~~
Its nice to have someone with a bit of pace and directness. He almost seems to contradict the teams slow, measured build up style. In a good way of course

3673~~~
I don't mind it, he needs to start hitting the target though even if just to force rebounds and corners. We're not getting the ball to feet in the box so it's refreshing to see someone actually having a go.

3674~~~
Di Maria is our one player who tries the risky through ball or long shot consistently. When it comes off it looks genius, when it doesn't you have today. I still would give him the freedom to try out incisive passes though.

3675~~~
How good would Sanchez be for us in this game? How good would Di Maria be for Arsenal? Honestly the problem is us, not Di Maria.

3676~~~
No problem with him doing the risky stuff, he just looks a bit clumsy and snatchy today.

3677~~~
Hopefully he'll get them on target. One shot really irritated RVP <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3678~~~
Should be playing deeper. You can see he wants to get on the ball and run at defenders from deep. Just swap him and Rooney ffs.

3679~~~
Just saying if Zaha or Wilson played like that....

We know Di Maria's quality and we need him to show what a great player he is second half.

3680~~~
He was performing great in CM, so obviously we play him everywhere but there.

3681~~~
Di Maria performance is down to Van Gaal playing players in position they should not be playing.
Blind at lcb
Rooney in midfield
Di Maria as striker
Di Maria is a much better player facing goal and being the creator, then he is facing his back towards it, with limited opportunity to orchestrate and have space to run into with the ball.

3682~~~
Robben's a fantastic finisher and Di Maria a fantastic assister from deep.

Glad he's not got overcommitted defensively though, playing with a bit more freedom.

3683~~~
Our 2 best players are both playing out of position and actually in each others. Its shit like this that irritates me.

3684~~~
Wow for a player of his quality really poor show, can't even put in a decent corner or free kick let alone in open play. Just back from injury and playing in a new position so will give him the benefit of the doubt.

3685~~~
He wouldn't have done better in our system, I can guarantee you that.

3686~~~
Crap showing.

3687~~~
But let's blame the players all the time and not the manager. Imagine what he'd do under Fergie.

3688~~~
He's wasted up front. Give him space to run and be creative. He's not a striker and it's pointlessly frustrating trying to force him to play there.

3689~~~
this.

3690~~~
At home, as a striker, against a well organized defense, it's stupid to play him there. Away from home, in a counter attacking set up, it would be much better.

3691~~~
I think some of the people who put the boot into Ozil will be squirming because so far he's following a very similar pattern.

3692~~~
Terrible today but what the hell in playing him upfront? yeah lets play Di Maria#10 then put Rooney in midfield. Bizarre.

3693~~~
Tried to do a bit too much today. Still, him and RVP basically had no decent service. Also, unfortunately for him what he tried didn't come off today.

I still think he would shine in a 4-3-3 formation (which LVG implemented at bayern) and play a similar role to arjen robben. Don't understand why we insist on using this nonsense 3-5-2 formation which the players are clearly uncomfortable with and have no idea how it works when we go forwards.

3694~~~
Stop playing him as forward, stop playing him as winger... what's next, stop playing him at all and we will see the genius he is?

He needs to improve his decision making and stop playing like he is ten times better than anyone else and trying everything himself and be more patient with the ball. Anyone can play good when the team is built around him. We have few players who could have team built around them so we should stop using the excuse of him being played out of position. Hardly anyone in the team is afforded being played in his favourite position at the moment, actually most of our players are played out of position more than he is.

3695~~~
He's a CM, not a fecking striker. For the love of god, Louis, play him in his actual position and drop this turgid 3-5-2 nonsense.

3696~~~
Interesting. Did we really buy him (after he got a crazy number of assists) to play him as a feckin striker?

3697~~~
Let's play him as a left wing back. He can't be any worse than he is as a striker and LVG clearly won't play him in midfield. Why not?

3698~~~
Had a poor game but he is only back from injury so that's understandable. I'm still not sure why Van Gaal decided to move him out of midfield when he was our best player in the first 2 months of the season. He's been less frequently involved in games since then and his quality has diminished.

3699~~~
Only getting back to match fitness and was playing in the wrong position in my opinion. Nothing to be worried baout here. A week off until QPR and he'll be right as rain then.

3700~~~
Needs to step up. It would help if he was given an actual position to play in.

3701~~~
If anything, we're just too patient with the ball, I dont blame him at all for trying to do things. There was this 1 moment right at the start of the game. He was under a lot of pressure from one of the Soton CMs with Shaw wide open. Di Maria held onto the ball, got past the CM, played it to Rooney and ran forward looking for a return pass only for Rooney to take 2 touches, kill the move and then lay it off to Shaw. Frustrating.

regarding the part in bold, it shows in how we're playing doesnt it?

3702~~~
To be fair, Di Maria got tonnes of service today. The one he almost fed through for Rooney, the Blind ball over the top and a number of other passes to put him in 1 on 1 with the last defender or 3 on 3; just didn't do much with them.

3703~~~
Him playing as a striker doesnt excuse him for all those missplaced passes and shots out of nothing, which werent even barely dangerous. He wanted to do too much by himself, especially in the positions where he could pass to a teammate.
He got in a few good positions and then he either missed a pass or try to shoot form lousy positions. 
Sure he shouldnt play as a striker but he was poor today and not because the position he played.

But he only got back from injury so I'll bet he'll be better.

3704~~~
We bought a player whose best position is in a formation we don't and won't use because we have too many other big names who can't be accommodated into it. Looked rusty and struggled in that position, if we aren't going to use him in midfield then it should be as a winger not as a striker.

3705~~~
I expected this. Merely replicating robben Persie at the WC

3706~~~
Yeah, it shows, but you should play in formation your manager wants you to, like everybody else. I like that he is trying, I always appreciated his kind of players for that, but he is trying too much and he looks too greedy and too stupid trying it. Giggsy was always thinking forward but he never looked this greedy as he is now. Giggs would never ruin that attack like he did when he tried to shot but had van Persie in very good situation. We payed 60m pounds for him to improve the team, not to improve his dribbling or shooting because he couldn't do it next to Ronaldo.

3707~~~
There was a comment by ancelloti the other day .. Demaria can produce the magic but he loses the ball too much .. That's exactly what I am seeing from him.... Shoots from halfway line ... Makes some Hollywood passes .. Tries some flicks that seldom works .. Still produces some magic ... Is he worth 60mm .. Don't think so

3708~~~
he needs to play in a midfield three, on the left side of it. That's where he played last season for Madrid. LvG needs to stop fecking about...

3709~~~
This season. Di Maria's dribbling success is 38%; Bale's is 60%. For all the mocking of Bale's dribbling, he's so enormous it's hard to win the ball off him without fouling.

3710~~~
Bordering on mismanagement to just not play him in the position where he's clearly at his most effective. Not that it's an excuse for that performance from him today.

3711~~~
Buy a player, play him out of position. Welcome to Manchester United, this is what we do.

3712~~~
One of the biggest black marks against Van Gaal's reign so far is the stagnation of attacking wide players such as Di Maria and Januzaj.

3713~~~
That's crazy, if true.

3714~~~
And then we go on to play him in striker....

3715~~~
I'm just presuming that Van Gaal never watched Real Madrid last season because if he did he wouldn't be messing around wasting Di Maria in stupid positions. Why LVG chose to play Rooney in midfield and Di Maria upfront rather then both in their normal positions was just daft today.

3716~~~
0% shot accuracy
0% take-ons completed
0% crosses completed
0 key passes
60% pass accuracy.

3717~~~
Don't know why Van Gaal tried to use him as a Robben/Sanchez today. He's not that sort of player. Perhaps if we were going to play on the counter, and loop one round the back of the last man - like the 2nd goal against Yeovil - then it would make a bit more sense, but we looked set to keep the ball and probe, and playing him as a striker made him look shit. He had his back to goal the whole time, and that's just not his game. He should have been picking up the ball where Rooney or Mata were mostly playing, and launching at them.

He was poor today, but I'm not overly disappointed in him. Playing with his back to goal, trying to flick the ball on first time like a target man is unfamiliar territory for him. I don't know why we'd pick the most lightweight player in our squad to do such a job.

3718~~~
He was brilliant at the start of the season playing in CM, but since things were working LVG being LVG had to change it around. Complete waste of 60m playing him on the wing and upfront.

3719~~~
Yea, if we thought that playing him on a wing in 4141 was stupid then today we've got a clear winner. Playing him as a pace-based striker against a team who surrenders all the possession for us to create feck all.

3720~~~
Juan Mata is the answer to that.

He knows Rooney will do the defensive shift, Mata and Di Maria in the middle would be a disaster.

3721~~~
Talk about an overreaction. We were struggling to get a shot at goal. 100s of passes before getting into the final third where we inevitably fecked it up. Crucify him for taking a shot. Yeah it was a poor call, the one you mentioned but things like this happen with every player every game, you're making too much out of it. When we're struggling to break a team down, I have absolutely no problem with an attacker having the balls to try something of his own.

3722~~~
Well if that's the case then Mata needs to be taken out the team. As much as I like the guy he doesn't influence games enough to be an automatic starter when we have one of the best midfielders in the world to play there.

3723~~~
Hopefully we play him in his actual position next game.

3724~~~
Poor today, not totally sure on whether playing him as a striker really works or not.

3725~~~
It's not the first time, his shot after the corner was equally poor decision, and have you seen one of his last cameos when he just kept shooting from various angles?

3726~~~
Di Maria's strength is his creativity whereas his shooting is inconsistent. Number 10 or midfield please.

3727~~~
He has to either play as a CAM or as a winger, he is not a striker.

If you want to play and Di Maria and Rooney and Mata than one of RVP or Falcao needs to be out of the team perhaps even both.

3728~~~
Yes I have. He tries shots. I dont mind it given how poor we look as a unit in attack anyways. Most of the time, we're content passing it between ourselves till we actually get to the business end where we lose it. Di Maria had moments even today where he made a quick 1 touch pass and continued the run only for Rooney and MAta to take multiple touches and then lay it off wide. Shit like that gets irritating and I dont really blame him for then taking it upon himself on occasions.

3729~~~
If he wants a fast striker, he should go and buy a fast striker. Don't spend 60 million on a midfielder and play him out of position.

3730~~~
I think there's a chance that Di Maria is a huge problem for van Gaal at the moment. The way he plays in midfield doesn't suit van Gaal's idea of the game at all, he's way too direct, way too wasteful in possession and therefore needs a completely different defensive set-up than what van Gaal prefers. So the only solution is to play him in a role similar to Robben's at the world cup. The problem is, Di Maria was always an inconsistent winger, often really frustrating and he's definitely not a good finisher. Ancelotti found a role for him that fit his strength perfectly, but if that role doesn't exist at United, what to do with him?

It also raises questions who actually made the transfer decisions in the summer. All three big money signings don't fit into the team at the moment, but that's probably a discussion for a different thread.

3731~~~
Pretty much this.

3732~~~
Indeed very important question. I felt that both Di Maria and Falcao were pretty much transfers made by Woody for Woody. He wanted to show he can bring big names to the club after he bottled quite a few transfers that season before and let's be honest it worked. For some time the fans loved him for it. If Di Maria referts to his Real form from before last season and Falcao turns out to be a useless waste of money this might change pretty fast though. I still hope we can find a way to integrate Di Maria into a system that van Gaal is willing to play but atm it looks like LvG is really struggling to find a setup for all our attackers that works properly.

3733~~~
Just on this quickly. It wouldn't surprise me if most of the transfers were only ok'd by Giggs and Eddie. As it doesn't make any sense that Van Gaal would ask for these players and then used them in this way(Although at the start of the season there seemed to be something working)

3734~~~
The answer is really simple. If he's your best player, and you're not getting the results otherwise, you accommodate him, and make the necessary changes to the setup. I'm not expecting LvG to do it, but to diminish the impact of several of your best players in favor of some idea of an ideal way playing football that in theory might work is... Well, each and every one of us can make up our own minds about what's the most suitable adjective to describe it.

3735~~~
Can someone please convince me he's bringing more to the team than Nani would have, if he'd stayed put? 

Today was horribly reminiscent of one of Nani's bad days. Constantly making bad decisions and losing possession cheaply, combined with one or two fantastic balls into the box.

He's had some very good performances too. But you'd have got that with Nani. At considerably less expense!

3736~~~
A rusty, hopefully singular day at the office. The worst game he's had for us, don't think that is the norm at all for him

3737~~~
With every game that he's played out of position (and the flaws in his game become that much more exposed,) the signing makes less and less sense, particularly when you consider that 60 million could have bought us just about any player we desired last summer (bar Ronaldo, Messi and Bale.) The Di Maria we saw in those first few games looked like everything we'd been missing. The one we've seen since has evoked memories of Nani, both the good and the bad.

3738~~~
The weird thing was that in the summer Van Gaal said he couldn't play a 4-3-3 because he didn't have a player like Di Maria or Ronaldo. So we then proceed to buy Di Maria and he ends up sticking with the 3-5-2 and playing him as a striker.

3739~~~
True should have spent 30 on Sanchez if that was the case

3740~~~
He's in a different stratosphere to Nani, he's just had rotten luck with injuries, and needs to be played in his best position.

Even the best players will suffer when they are shifted about all over the place, and are not getting a consistent run of games, plus it's still early days in the PL for him, don't think any of our other new signings have done any better, sadly it could be next season now before we see the best of him.

3741~~~
And then we couldn't play a back four because we didn't have full backs. Next thing we know we're still playing 5 at the back with Shaw and Rafael at wing back.

3742~~~
That's a redcafe consensus. Don't think VG ever said that.

3743~~~
So DiMaria had just under 62% pass completion. That's fecking diabolical. The comparison, based on today's game, is unfair on Nani.

3744~~~
And I'm not gonna bump that Sanchez vs DiMaria thread I created any time soon. In fact, I may delete it.

3745~~~
He said it in an interview with MUTV.

3746~~~
I'm pretty sure I've heard LVG mention it.

3747~~~
It sure is but in all fairness he is not match fit and has only just come back from an injury.

3748~~~
0% shot accuracy, 0% crosses completed and 0 key passes too.

3749~~~
One of the few players that want to try something and gets subbed off. I'd rather Di Maria shoot from silly angles than pass back to the defence and repeat the same bullshit cycle again.

3750~~~
To be fair that one cross was narrowly away from Rooney and probably would've been a goal had he made any contact.

3751~~~
I'm annoyed we played him out of position but it's no excuse for that performance today. Hopefully the lad will step up his game.

3752~~~
You're not wrong.

3753~~~
Indeed they are. Ozil started like a house on fire, got injured and then eventually came back and played underwhelmingly in the tail end of the season. He kept it simple without being spectacular. It did not help that we had absolutely no pace in our side for Ozil to exploit (no Walcott, Ox or Gnabry even), so he just recycled the ball a lot. Don't know how many times he'd look up for a run only to see everyone standing still waiting for the ball to be passed to their feet. Ozil has played with Walcott less than a dozen times.

Di Maria has had a similar start and also had injuries which have obviously interrupted his season.

Both players are far too good not to end up succeeding. I think ADM should be played through the middle though.

3754~~~
Not having the Woody arguments, yet again, something LVG fecks up, we put the blame somewhere else. He's so stubborn with the 352, what he said about 433/di Maria earlier in the season, he completely threw it away. Raging about balance, afterwards, he put Rooney in midfield, mata as a 10 and 2 strikers, how imbalanced does it get? Talking about philosophy and players have to train for at least two weeks and come in slow, he suddenly puts Blind in, or using the no full backs excuse to play 352, why have we been playing it lately, the fullbacks were available. Not all his weird decisions shouls be pointed elsewhere.

3755~~~
He do waste possession quite alot, but he is a risk taker so it is something we will have to get used too, but that also Means he needs to produce the magic. I thought he could do well in this role "Robben-role", but after this game it is clear to see he needs space running into, we should definitely play him in midfield.

3756~~~
He has a genuine desire to get things going and take the game on, much like Sanchez. Both will lose the ball or play some poor passes because of this, but get them in the right system and they will obviously win games off their own boot. Players like that can create a goal out of nothing even on a poor day.

I don't understand why he's being played up-top though, it goes against almost all of his strengths - unless he's told to drop (very) deep to pick up the ball and run at defenders.

Personally I think van Gaal is trying to be too clever and accommodating all of his big names. Someone needs to take the fall and sit games out so Di Maria can play in his best position (midfield).

Di Maria - Herrera
Blind/Carrick

That seems like a winning combination to me.

Having said all this, I hope van Gaal continues to play him up-top as it is good for the rest of us.

3757~~~
Were wasting him <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> It made no sense why Di Maria was played out of position. It almost seemed like LVG had a few players and just put them in with no particular plan. To have so many people out of position is odd, but when its your best two (rooney and Di Maria) its mad.

The fact he didnt change it at half time worried me. Di Marias main asset is speed and taking on people. He wasnt playing away from home, he was playing against a packed defence so needed to play deeper.

3758~~~
I'm pretty sure Van Gaal wanted Di Maria. Mentioned him by name a couple of times in the summer.

3759~~~
Just an utter utter waste of a player. Its beyond frustrating, and almost makes you want to cry. You watch those highlights of him from the start of the season, then you have to watch him up top, looking frustrated as hell, and getting absolutely no involvment in the game. 

If we wanted a fast striker, we should have fecking bought one.

3760~~~
Is anyone else of the opinion that he just doesn't look too arsed here? 
I say that because I remember watching him at Madrid and whenever I saw him even if things weren't going his way he seemed to work hard and especially last season was fairly selfless but with us he seems to stand off at times when he can press, doesn't track back anywhere near the amount he probably should and today took about 3 shots from long range which were nowhere near the target and he had better options. Would he be doing that at Madrid with Ronaldo & Bale giving him an earful?
He reminds me a lot of Ozil at times last season and their exits at Madrid have a lot of similarities so maybe it's something to do with that, it could also just be me being overly negative and knee-jerk due to a disaapointing performance from him today but I've had the feeling for a while that whereas every other player seems happy here, there's just something about him which makes me think he'd much rather be elsewhere.

3761~~~
I was going to post this in the other thread but since that one is about who is buying the players I think I'll post it in here.

Actually on second thought to my comment, Van Gaal mentions Ronaldo in those quotes as well. Ronaldo does play out wide but cuts in and almost plays like a striker. He's deployed Di Maria in a similar sort of role. Same like his use of Robben for the Dutch.

Perhaps he is using Di Maria exactly how he intended to use him i.e. a cutting in wide forward. Which would be really worrying, because Di Maria's best has come in a deeper midfield role or as an out an out winger. He doesn't posses the shooting capabilities of Robben let alone Ronaldo. It'll be a huge waste.

3762~~~
Too often gives back possession, RM took us to the cleaners with the transfer fee.

3763~~~
He is a creator, so it is expected for him not to have 90% plus passing accuracy considering he takes more risk with his pass.

I would not say Real Madrid took us to the cleaners for the reason that in the beginning of the season, he looked well worth his figure. At the moment,  Van Gaal is just struggling to incorporate all his stars names into his philosophy and finding the right balance with his team and system. As such, it has affected his performance.

3764~~~
Honestly, he was abysmal and lucky to stay on for as long as he did. If any other player had put in a performance like that they would have been hammered. He needs more match time and to be moved back into midfield.

3765~~~
Passing was atrocious, has his decision making gone down to a Januzaj level?

3766~~~
I red somewhere that Ancelotti was not fussed about losing him because of his inability to keep possession. I think he has the potential to be a match winner but I think he will be a frustrating player due to amount of possession he coughs up.

3767~~~
Best creator of 2014 getting shoved into the striker role with his back to goal. Mind blowing.

3768~~~
He is not a striker, he rarely scores goals, he is a playmaker and was played out of position against Soton,with that being said - he seems to lose the ball a lot and has poor decision making skills

He isn't worth 60 million imo, its looking more and more like we are overpaying more than these players are worth, i mean from Fellaini to Mata to Di Maria.

3769~~~
The bizarre part to me is that playing him in the striker role just does not make sense at all. While he's a bit constricted as a winger, there's a lot to his game that means he's got attributes which can be suited to a winger, even if it's not his prime position, but playing him as a back to goal striker is incredibly bizarre. I'd rather see him out on the wing, as much as it can occasionally limit his game.

3770~~~
It is somewhat understandable if you are playing a 352 counter attacking system away from home, where Di maria can almost play the Robben role in the WC Dutch set up. But what completely blows my mind is playing him as a striker home, where we're not set up to counter attack. I got a lot of hate for raging right after the game for the Fellaini-Di maria striker sub, but now that I think about it, I'm even more frustrated. Why did LVG think Fellaini is a better striker than Di maria is a midfielder? He could have easily just switched Rooney and Di maria's positions and avoided the whole tactical hoof ball defeat. Once again, LVG is clueless as to how to use Di Maria <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3771~~~
He got player of the year 2014 for Argentina!! That's ahead of Messi and Aguero and we have people on Caf saying his not worth his £60M. I think the problem is more LVG playing him upfront and playing Rooney in his position which is mind boggling.

Put him in the middle and watch him rock and roll....

3772~~~
Pescado out of agua as a striker. Best role is running at people or into space-which opens things up for others.  Instead he was target man for long passes-which Soton did well defending.  

Can't believe I'm writing this because it's so obvious-but LvG needs to play MFs in midfield and strikers up top.  The talent is there-but the tactics are holding things back.

3773~~~
Regardless of his position. The way he cuts in and shoots does not remind me of Arjen robben, but a 12 yr old girl who still kicks the ball with the tip of her toes and just rolls the ball over the ground. And the worst thing is, Di Maria has done this about 50 times in his last 5 appearances.

3774~~~
I don't see why he couldn't play there and score a lot of goals for us.. give him free roaming role around striker and he will do it, he is quick, good at tight spaces can run at players ALMOST like robben.. the problem was that we don't have midfield and play this stupid system so he couldn't get into game. Next time I would like to see him with herrera dominating midfield tho.. we can experiment with him once we figure out our midfield..

3775~~~
Wasted playing upfront especially in a 3-5-2 formation.  He is not a poacher but a creator.  Rooney should be up top rather than him.

3776~~~
I don't rate his finishing.

3777~~~
Over the last 4 seasons and this one.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Dribbling success
</span>
Nani 62%
Di Maria: 46%

Di Maria's dribbling look amazing when it works, but he loses the ball a lot more than casual onlookers of Real Madrid games who got giddy off that Champions League final run thought. It makes it difficult for the midfield around him; particularly when he isn't working as hard defensively as last season.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Goals and assist</span>

Di Maria: 80 goals/assists in 151 hours (117 minutes per goal/assist)
Nani: 44 goals/assists in 100 hours (136 minutes per goal/assist)

Di Maria's been better, but there's not an incredible amount in it.

3778~~~
Nope, he said it:

Which is fair enough really. Young and Valencia aren't even wingbacks, let alone proper fullbacks.

3779~~~
He said we have to play 5 man defence because we are missing Rafael and Shaw, only to contradict himself in next game and start game with Rafael and Shaw - in 5 man defence again. He then substituted them both at half time and switched to 4 man defence with Blackett and McNair as fullbacks.

3780~~~
I think hes trying too hard. He should just keep it a tad more simple, and he'll be fine. Needs to cut out the idea of trying something spectacular every time he has the ball.

3781~~~
1 bad loss and all if a sudden our players play like 12 year old girls!! I agree his flopped a few shots and a couple have led to assists lol but his the best player at the club and 1 of the top high profile signings we have made!

3782~~~
One game? His last good game was on 5th October. However he didn't play much in midfield after that and that may be one of the reasons.

3783~~~
I think that was more down to the fact he was playing McNair and/or Blackett as Jones, Evans and Rojo were unavailable and he knew he was likely to have to substitute the not yet fully match fit Rafael and Shaw.

3784~~~
Just cannot get my head round the idea that any footballer who ever completes as little as 62% of their passes in a game should be played in central midfield. Admittedly it's just one game but his passing has been <i>very</i> hit and miss every time I've watched him. And that's not to mention unsuccessful dribbles. How does a team accomodate a player in the middle of the park who loses possession that often?

Definitely looks like Van Gaal wants him to have the same role as Robben had for Holland in the world cup. In fact, the extent of his tactical input on our team seems to have been trying to turn us into Holland at the world cup. Has Di Maria ever posed the kind of goal threat that Robben has?

3785~~~
No, he has always been a creator, a player who makes more assists than score goals. That is why it is more baffling using him with his back to the goal just in order to have a pacey player upfront. 

As for being a midfielder, that he played as a "Central midfielder" is pure myth. He played as a left sided attacker starting from deeper in the midfield, more tucked in than a traditional winger. If you watched him for Madrid, he'll often take position on the left side with Ronaldo moving centrally making it almost a 442. Think of numerous time Giggsy played as a tucked in winger for us, almost making him a third midfielder.

3786~~~
To be fair he isn't the player who is in charge of dictating the play, he is the 1 who is trying the risky passes to make a goal. I would much rather he played some killer balls, and go for gaps that were difficult to create goals than just play it safe and pass sideways or backwards every game. 

Unfortunately like Nani he is a player who maybe tries to force it a little, but when on form these little passes come off and look magestic. I think Southampton just defended well which made it look worse. Sure he didn't actually have a "good" game, but losing possession in game where they are sitting very deep and compact is nothing to worry about.

3787~~~
He looked excellent in midfield at Real Madrid and I don't think his passing stats were amazing there, he's not the sort of a midfielder who will play short safe passes. He's an explosive midfielder who can take the ball forward and create something out of nothing, he could have a 70% passing completion in a game and end up with 3 assists the way he plays. He's not really a typical central midfielder.

If we're going to use him as a forward/winger then I hope we sell him in the Summer, it's pointless. Marquee signing that we have no idea how to use, after good first 4-5 games he has turned into a Manchester United of current player.

3788~~~
I'm sure his stats would look better in midfield though as he would adjust his game to the more central role. He is just better there and Ancelotti saw that as well. Feck knows what LvG is doing with him.

3789~~~
So, player gets relatively free role in a team who will be utterly dominant in 9 out of every 10 games they play and racks up an impressive number of assists playing behind the best striker on the planet. Moves to a new club, looks good for a few games before it becomes apparent that his manager seems unwilling to play him in what is allegedly his best position and performances drop off when asked to play anywhere else.

Has the Ozil comparison been made yet?

3790~~~
Apart from his first few games, his decision making has been poor, the number of bad touches and bad passes terrible, and the free kicks and corners were dreadfull. From any position on the pitch, it's ridiculous to blame the manager for that.

3791~~~
I don't think that's a big problem as long as he's paired with the right players. I guess the issue is that you can't play Di María in a midfield two and you can't really play him in a midfield 3 with Ander Herrera because he also has a habit of losing the ball too often in midfield. Would Di María with Carrick and Blind be too cautious to work?

3792~~~
Looks like he is losing interest rapidly to me, totally different to the player we had in September.

3793~~~
He'll come good again when we put him somewhere in the centre of the pitch. He was fecking magical there at the start of the season and last year for Real. We all know Sanchez was a great buy and we should have got him too, especially if we are trying to shoehorn Di Maria into his best bloody position, regardless they are different players who (ideally) play in different positions so I don't see why the comparison is drawn so frequently. Di Maria as part of a midfield 3 behind Rooney and Sanchez, now that would have been something to behold eh?

3794~~~
Fellaini I can agree with, but Mata and Di Maria were both vital players for Chelsea and Real Madrid respectively. I think it says more about the state of our football club that we can't seem to get them to be as effective as they used to be.

That being said, this was Di Maria's first game back from injury, and Mata has looked increasingly better this past few games.

3795~~~
I know he is not a striker, but my God, his passing has been poor, set pieces has been poor and overall decision making has been terrible in most games. How can we blame "being played slightly out of position" for stuff like this? Professional footballers should be able to control the ball and pass it to their mates irrespective of where they are played on the pitch. Well, not like I'm surprised or anything, Di Maria has always been like this, he's so similar to Nani, but more talented.

3796~~~
Have you tried him on the right yet, by the way? Before you switched to wingbacks, obviously. I always liked him there at Real Madrid - he had some consistency problems, but on the whole was pretty great...especially cutting in and crossing towards the far post.

3797~~~
He was supposed to be that superstar player that helps fire us into the top four, but right now he's looking like a fecking liability. He's dropped his performance levels to what Nani used to serve up at his worst.

3798~~~
I bumped this post last night to make the comparison to Nani. Haven't been watching enough La Liga to get much of a feel for the bloke but from what I've seen this season the similarity with Nani is uncanny. The good and the bad. And I completely agree that playing out of position as an excuse only goes so far. It certainly doesn't excuse getting the basics wrong as much as we saw against Southampton.

3799~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ffs man

Agree with your post, especially the part about LVG trying to fit all the big names in.

3800~~~
In this 3-5-2 system, it seems like LvG wants to play him upfront in the Robben role.  But di Maria is no Robben, they're not the same player just because they share the same trait of great pace.  Robben has a better goal scoring record and is more shifty and fluid in his movement.  Play this man in the midfield again so he can create chances.

3801~~~
Apparently he travelled to Zurich to be in FIFPro World XI.

3802~~~
Really, it's incredibly frustrating. AdM is a beast in CM, and we saw that we he came. Rooney is a better player close to the goal.

YET, Rooney plays on midfield and Angel shoved up front. How can this be real?

LvG seems hellbent to get his formation and pattern to work, instead of accommodating the best players in their best positions.

Am I crazy to think like this?

3803~~~
Agreed, it's not they are subpar players, there are not being managed well.

3804~~~
Lack of match rhythm.

3805~~~
Stop arsing about and play him in a midfield three, please and thanks.

3806~~~
Also, sometimes you just have to laugh.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/GznePKv.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/GznePKv.jpg"/>

3807~~~
Blind played the whole 90mins after missing out for weeks so I really hope you're right. I think you probably are.

3808~~~
LvG said after the match that he planned to sub Blind also, but because of RvP getting injured he couldn't do that.

3809~~~
RVP got injured before or after Di Maria being replaced ?

3810~~~
Can't remember, but there is not much in it. He said that he had planned to sub Shaw, Di Maria and Blind. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3811~~~
United have not had a player in the World XI since 2011 so congrats to Di Maria! Even Fifa know ADM should play in the middle <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3812~~~
Yeh, congrats to him. Having Luiz in there makes a little bit of a joke of it but it's still a great achievement and a fully deserved one. Hopefully he can find some of that form during our run in. Because we are going to need it.

3813~~~
If only he was performing for us how he did to get there.

Oh but wait! Our manager is playing him as a striker for feck sakes.

3814~~~
Can anyone else see Di Maria looking for a move at the end of the season?  He is being played all over the place and, as a result, looks disinterested.

3815~~~
Not really. And even if he did, we wouldnt let him go, so at the end of the day he can look all he likes.

3816~~~
Seen this thrown around elsewhere as well. How did you come to this conclusion?

3817~~~
It's absolutely baffling to me that van Gaal put him up top against Southampton. He's one of the best midfielders and creators in the world, not a fecking striker! I just do not understand why van Gaal continues to put him in positions where he is not nearly effective as he can be. 

Just immensely frustrating.

3818~~~
It would have meant he couldn't play Rooney in midfield, seems to be his thing of late.

3819~~~
Which is also incredibly baffling and frustrating. God knows what Louis is trying to make happen with this fecking formation and where he's putting players.

3820~~~
Infuriating! The only player who can dribble and get past players by using skill as well as speed doesn't get the chance to do so as he is played as a striker. And this while we actually have Rooney/RvP/Falcao as strikers and a lack of quality midfielders. Words fail me.

3821~~~
The only reason i can think of is that LvG believed that with the way we are struggling to create chances atm, if S'ampton managed to always defend with enough players behind the ball we would never break them down. He wanted to use Di Maria's early runs into the box and his pace to get a player behind the backs of S'ampton's CBs.

The problem was that Koeman expected that and had his answers ready: Wanyama, Schneiderlin and Davies worked their arses off closing down Mata and Carrick and we couldn't find the right through ball towards Di Maria. Plus his defensive wingers were always there to provide cover. The utilization of Alderweireld as a central defender, instead of another "heavy" CB, also indicates that Koeman had read LvG's mind well and expected Di Maria to start in that position.

There's nothing wrong with losing the tactical battle in a game but that's just one side of the story. I agree with you that it's frustrating to see our most expensive signing struggling to find his place in the team and if LvG doesn't sort this out and the results don't get better the Di Maria "problem" might get out of proportions.

I give him one point though, people keep complaining because Real Madrid managed to get the best out of him in two positions while we can't do that. I don't believe that's quite true. He flourished in a three man midfield with a holding midfielder (Alonso) and a deep lying play maker (Modric) playing behind him and giving him the opportunity to stay in the attacking half of the pitch. We are asking of him to cover more ground and play a bigger role defensively in each game.

He was also good as a winger at Real Madrid but he played alongside Bale and Ronaldo who provided the majority of the goals and assists. In both cases Ancelotti managed to get the maximum of Di Maria's abilities to link well with his teammates, open up spaces for them and also carry the ball and press in the final third. We are so desperate in the creative area and we expect him to suddenly become an amalgam of Iniesta/Ronaldo...

3822~~~
It shows when he is so desperate to make things happen (the long distance shooting). He knows he has a lot more responsibilities than at Madrid here because he's our best player ability wise.

3823~~~
Don't know really, just things like his body language, the fact he is not 'looking for the ball' as much and the fact that he no longer seems to be smiling much!

3824~~~
Well Di Maria was never a 60 million player to begin with, he is never going to be a prolific goal scorer but when teams play to his strengths he is a complete game changer. He is actually perfect for us but LVG needs to just stop being stubborn and play him in his best position

3825~~~
We still miss two or three players to settle ADM in his best position.

I'm still unclear if his better as a CM or a winger. I know that he's better with assisting than scoring, and as a winger he could be less effective, but he can still tear defense apart. Knowing that he's very draft in his play, he's better in the middle. 

But I repeat that Di Maria is a top top lieutenant not a captain. He will make other better, he will not win us trophies alone

3826~~~
It's waste to judge him when he's not being utilized properly. LvG must be very stubborn to keep playing these guys in weird roles, he just needs to do the simple stuffs first before going for such crazy experiments.

3827~~~
I am seriously worried about losing him, at the end of this season or next

3828~~~
He's only in the first year of his contract, the only way he'd be leaving is if there was some plan involving financial fair play and an elaborate player merry-go-round.

3829~~~
People are only thinking about him leaving because we're going through a shitty patch and we hadn't seen Di Maria in ages because of injury.

Once we get going again and he's scoring and assisting, he'll look happy and all this talk will go away. He looked bloody ecstatic at the start of the season when he was banging them in and assisting all over the shop.

3830~~~
Just came across this interview on skysports. Apologies if its already been posted.

Doesn't sound like someone on his way out

3831~~~
Ffs. I hope he's not saying were still going to continue with this 3-5-2 disaster of a formation...

3833~~~
Someone is certainly overpaid, our wage bill is astronomical.

3834~~~
A few are, but we do have a lot of feckers still scrounging around on our bill. Aren't we also paying Nani's wage - or a large percentage of it?

3835~~~
Probably. When we're no longer paying most of Fletcher, Evans, Cleverley, Hernandez, Nani, and possibly some of van Persie, Smalling, Rafael, Jones and Valencia, it will look a lot better. But we'll need replacements, a top CB and CM would cost a tidy sum.

Di Maria isn't the problem, wages wise, anyway.

3836~~~
Am I the only one who thought there was potential there for him and RVP?

Obviously I would like to see him play in the middle, but I didn't think it was that bad when he played forward as some make it out to be. Of course, he was a little rusty and his passing wasn't the most accurate, but that was down to the kind of balls he was trying, he rarely goes for the easy side way pass like Mata, for example.

He's got great vision and we should encourage him keep doing what he is doing, not try to limit him because he has low passing accuracy. We have enough guys who shit their pants when they have to play a through ball.

3837~~~
Unless someone comes in with an incredible bid, I don't think we're in too much danger of losing him. Even though he's perhaps not been brilliant, he's showed enough of what he can do to ensure that we won't get rid of him. At the same time though, since he's not been at his very best constantly, no club is going to come in with a price that would result in us selling him.

3838~~~
I seem to remember in the match day thread in the buildup to the game there were quite a few people putting Di Maria up front in their team predictions. Cant be bothered to go back and check who but certainly such ideas didnt seem to be so roundly ridiculed before the game as they were after the fact.

3839~~~
I'd also like to him in back in midfield. Either centrally or out wide if we have to. Just not up front please!

3840~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30820285" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30820285</a>

3841~~~
This so called "new style" seems to be a thing of myth because i'm not seeing it, we also seem to be getting worse as the season goes on, not improving like you would expect us to. On top of that after 4-5 months of "working hard" you would of thought that they would be getting pretty familiar with it by now, instead they look more and more lost and void of ideas with each passing game.

3842~~~
Injuries have affected that to be fair, they haven't actually all been working on it for 4-5 months together which is a problem.

3843~~~
I don't think he thrives with having such big share of the responsibilities in the attacking department. He gets the ball in a less than optimal position and we see a risky pass or a long shot towards goal.

3844~~~
There are two problems:
1) He was world-class in one role. Now he has to play in a completely different role. He is not a striker and he is only a good (not a world-class) winger.
2) He is a player who naturally wants to take risks. LvG on the other side wants to minimize the risk of losing the ball, so he restricts his players. He doesn’t want that his teams loses the ball in the middle of the park so he tells his players to play it save in most areas. Players are only allowed to take certain risks in specific areas (wings/at the very front). That’s why LvG hesitates to use Di Maria as midfielder.

LvG has to rethink his tactics or di Maria has to grow into a new role.

3845~~~
Why LvG plays him up front when its quite clear to see it doesn't work is beyond me. I mean he's not even a goalscorer like Robben.  Complete waste of his talents. 

If he wanted pace up front, he should have fecking kept Welbeck. Di Maria's a shit striker and Rooney is an average midfielder. Why play both out of position?

3846~~~
Does it really take such a long period of time to get used to new tactics and playing style though? The injury problems seem like a convenient excuse to me. I'm not saying that they haven't had an effect but the fact that the manger stated he could only play a certain way because of injured players to only continue doing so once those those players were available again, proves that it's just his way he wants the team set up and not because of who's available.

3847~~~
Yeah, it seemed to take chelsea a whole season. Liverpool half a season, before they started playing great stuff under Rodgers too.

3848~~~
The only way we will get the best out of Di Maria is to play him as the third man in midfield and let him roam forward.

Pfft!

3854~~~
If he had that touch on Sunday would have been through 1:1

3855~~~
That really isn't anything at all. You'd see young academy lads doing that at the weekend

3856~~~
Pwoaar!!

3857~~~
Why is Di maria playing as a striker? This is becoming ridiculous. Welbeck, Hernandez and even Bebe, Nani and zaha would have done a better job from what I have seen.

3858~~~
Dont care how much he costs, if he doesnt get back in midfield he should be on the bench, he adds close to nothing for a while now.

3859~~~
We're wasting/ruining one of the games stellar talents.

3860~~~
LVG is killing his confidence.

3861~~~
So frustrating to see us wasting him like this. Especially when all he needs to do is swap him with Rooney. It's this kind of stubbornness that's doing him no favours at all.

3862~~~
You can't put it down to simply him being striker. He's playing unbelievably poor. Don't know what's wrong with him.

3863~~~
Looks like someone with PTSD compared to his first few games.

3864~~~
He's not a striker.. no shit

3865~~~
He isn't a striker who can hold up the ball.

3866~~~
So one time Di Maria finally runs at the defence at the 40th-odd minute mark we get 2 corners. Still don't understand why he's playing as a striker.

3867~~~
Yes you can

3868~~~
Every time he's got on the ball in deeper positions he's looked dangerous.

It's so fecked up to play him as a striker in this horrible system of LVG.

Today is the first time I'm actually starting to doubt LVG. Surely he MUST see what he's doing to our best players?

3869~~~
There's nothing wrong with him. This is Di Maria, he's either really good or really bad (insane number of turnovers). No middle ground. Still, the problem is in the manager. Even when he sucks he can create something from the deep. As a forward, he simply sucks.

3870~~~
We sign a world class midfielder and play him upfront, might as well play Wilson instead.

3871~~~
No you can't. You have seen the first half right, what's having a poor first touch losing the ball when there is no pressure got to do with 'not being a striker'? Some of the things he did wrong the first half, if he did this in midfield QPR would've had a field day.

3872~~~
The one time he was actually able to come deep and take someone on he made a cute one-two with Valencia and almost created our most dangerous chance of the half. We'll keep lumping it at him with Onuoha at his back and take him off at the 70th minute, though.

3873~~~
No you can't. It doesn't help but you don't suddenly turn shit at everything because you're playing out of position.

3874~~~
Wasted. We're playing the league record signing up front who so far in his career, has never managed to score more than 11 goals in a season. While we have our captain playing in midfield who hasn't scored less than 16 goals in a season since he was 18.

3875~~~
Yeah, he doesn't want to be here.

3876~~~
But but, it's because he plays as a striker than he can't control the ball.

Waste of money.

3877~~~
He's not a striker!! Why doesn't LVG accept this? We're wasting the talents of one of the best players in the world.

3878~~~
The 60M Nani

3879~~~
He is really terrible at the moment, judging by his performance he wouldn't get into QPR's 18 but I really don't want to blame him, or any other player anymore, everything is just ridiculous.

3880~~~
No, his movement being offside and looking uncomfortable, that's down to playing as a striker. But his first touch and some of his passing are inconsistent in all the positions he plays.

He's always been like this, and the one moment where it all works out can and will change a match, so I'm not that worried.

3881~~~
Terrible first half but it so clear and obvious he hates this role he's asked to play.

3882~~~
Not a striker, simple as.

3883~~~
The only time we should be using him as a centre-forward is if we set up to play a counter-attacking style. He's being utilised poorly by Van Gaal. We're expecting him to hold up the ball and chase after long balls. Even worse is the fact that he's a very direct player and lacks the patience needed in such a role.

3884~~~
There is definitely the distraction factor as well. When a team's marking Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema, they can't mark you as closely. Especially when Modric and Alonso are in behind and Marcelo charging forward down the wing you spend most of your time near.

3885~~~
Play him on the wings or behind the strikers. Its really that simple LVG.

3886~~~
Seeing him playing like absolue shite up front is making me want to tear my hair out. In his first few games he looked so far above our other players, while in midfield, we were saying that we felt sorry for him. For christs sake move him back there.

3887~~~
I think we might have an inverse Rivaldo situation brewing here. Rivaldo wanted to play forward but was slotted into midfield at times. Angel's most productive position is in a midfield 3 yet somehow we're inexplicably intent on pushing him further up.

3888~~~
What else can we expect when he's being used the complete opposite way to what he's suited to? The glimpses of class he shows is when he drifts deeper in a midfield position and runs at defenders.

3889~~~
Looked so much better when he was playing deeper.

3890~~~
He looks a good player when played in his position, who would have thought...

3891~~~
Terrible as striker, much better at midfield. Surprise surprise.

3892~~~
Apart from the fact that he is being played in the wrong position. I'm still waiting to see the played I thought we had signed. Hopefully its just the position he's playing in that is the cause of it. But I'm not so sure.

3893~~~
Jones taking corners actually scared me more than anything. Does LVG even see that Di Maria isn't a striker and performs to his best in midfield? I'm genuinely worried.

3894~~~
Much better when played deeper. Everyone sees he's not a striker, hopefully now LVG does too.

3895~~~
It's laughable how LVG has decided to use him. We should sign Aguero and play him left midifelder. Will be fecking brilliant.

He played two absolutely magical crosses today. AndHe was doing brilliant things consistently when he played deeper. He's got no real attribute suited to a striker or a second striker. Ridiculous.

3896~~~
NEEDS to play as a midfielder.

'nuff said.

3897~~~
I don't see how having pace can qualify as making one suitable to being a striker. He's never been a goalscorer and he doesn't like playing with his back to goal. It's a bizarre decision. He's our record signing ffs. Play him where he has played his best football.

3898~~~
It was so fecking naive to think that just because it worked for Robben that the same was going to be with Di Maria. Robben's touch is a lot more consistent to begin with.

3899~~~
Got bullied around so easily by none other than QPR defenders, he simply isn't a striker. He just looked heaps better in midfield.

3900~~~
Surprise surprise, looked really good and made a few chances once he just moved further back so he can run with the ball at defenders. Who would've thought it?

3901~~~
And they're completely different players. Other than being quick and left footed. Robben is a good goalscorer and an "attacker" in the true sense. Di Maria is a very very creative, and hard working attacking midifelder who can score some goals.

3902~~~
He is so much better when he can pick the ball deeper and run with it, there's more space for him there. He's useless with his back to the goal, LVG playing him is just clueless

3903~~~
As soon as Wilson came on he started to really look dangerous, but even before that toward the end of the first half he dropped a bit deeper and started attacking from wide right and getting himself into the game. I thought he did well for a player who is being completely mismanaged.

3904~~~
The stupid thing is if that's the kind of player we really wanted, then Sanchez would have been perfect for that role. Yet we showed no interest in him and let Arsenal pick him up for a great price. Di Maria is just not that player.

3905~~~
What I don't understand is that even with the dreaded 352, Di Maria could still play in a #10 role, where he's infinitely more effective.

Why not:

It's bizarre. Falcao's more than competent enough to play as a lone striker.

3906~~~
You could even switch him with Rooney. Let Di Maria attack from midfield, and Rooney plays in the number 10 role he's sometimes excelled in.

3907~~~
Clearly isn't a striker, and shouldn't be played there. If LVG wants pace up front, he needs to drop one of the big names for Wilson. Di Maria, has to be played deeper. I want to see the man getting on the ball far more and being given the chance to run at people like he was in the second half today. That is where he is best, and should be played.

3908~~~
LVG has him looking average when he should be a star.

3909~~~
Rooney should be up top and Di Maria in midfield. How can LVG not see this? Absolutely baffling especially as Di Maria began so well playing in midfield.

3910~~~
Wilson on, Di Maria dropped deeper, chances came, breaks flowed, opportunities to use pace arose. 

Rooney forward, Di Maria deeper. It's time. Stop the games.

3911~~~
Barring any emergency he needs to only ever be considered for Midfield.

3912~~~
Preach brother. Amen.

3913~~~
Agreed.
If we wanted to buy a striker, we should've bought a striker (like Aguero), for £60M.
It would've been money better spent and would definitely yield results.
Instead, we buy a midfielder and decide to play him up-front.
If someone who had never seen Man Utd play was asked to identify our most expensive player, I doubt Di Maria would be identified as the one.

Also, if our plan B is to play long balls in to Fellaini (or other player), maybe we should buy a tall striker (like Crouch), as he would be more better suited to the long ball tactic.

I only hope that any new players bought, are played in their strongest positions. If we buy a defender, I dont want to see him played in midfield (or vice-versa).

3914~~~
Needs to learn to pass when there's players free around him, instead of tryna knock it between two defenders and losing it. Either that or he tried shooting from a silly range.

3915~~~
He looks like he's sulking because he knows he's playing the wrong position and LVG won't listen.

3916~~~
To be fair Di Maria was still more advanced than Rooney. Rooney was pretty much playing in the position Di Maria was when the diamond first came into play in September.

3917~~~
He didn't look 'really good' at any point in that game. Been a bit of a disappointment this lad. Still plays like the guy I remember at Benfica, even though I was told he went up a level last year.

3918~~~
Poor performance but again, LVG isn't helping.

3919~~~
Saw his performance improve once he was played in his best position. He's a top class midfielder, a mediocre striker.

3920~~~
What a waste of a great midfielder.

3921~~~
He had the glimpses of class whenever he drifted deeper, which is my point. He should play further back in midfield where he's one of the very best players in the world, a position which got him into the world 11 and rated as the 10th best player in the world. He's not a striker in any way, he doesn't hold up the ball and play with his back to goal, it's just not his game. He's made to run with the ball from deeper at defenders and through the midfield. The last 20 minutes he did really well too, made a few chances and just looked a completely different player.

3922~~~
If we want pace upfront, use a fast striker. If we want creativity from midfield, use our most creative midfielder there instead of as a striker. How novel!

3923~~~
I didn't see that much of him last year.
Did his performances actually look sustainable, or (being honest) did it just look like a guy in his very best form in a very well-suited team/system?

3924~~~
Looked better and more involved after the "Formation Switch."

3925~~~
He's not a striker [Not sure what LVG is thinking] and LVG isn't using hm properly now, but my word, he is terrible at the moment. Being played out of position should not affect your first touch, it shouldn't prompt you to give the ball away so easily like he did. He needs to pull out his finger, simple.

3926~~~
It looked sustainable. It also looked like he should always be played as a midfielder though.

3927~~~
Did He do a single thing right today? I did look away a few times.

3928~~~
£60m player? Someone call the police, we got scammed.

3929~~~
Not really. He's a creative attacking midfielder, not a striker. His performances in midfield early on were fantastic. 60 million is obviously excessive but that's what it takes to get a world class player off a world class team.

3930~~~
Yes, he did.

3931~~~
Sure he should be a midfield. But when he looses the ball, makes a poor touch or is all in all poor that isnt because he is playing out of position but because he is.. well.. poor.. and is having a bad game.

3932~~~
I think it's clear for all to see that he's not a striker and should be played in a position more familiar to him like in the second half where he was far more effective.

3933~~~
2 great crosses/passes for Falcao in the second half, set up Wilson for his goal. 

First half was a shocker but once he played deeper he looked more like his old self.

3934~~~
Di Maria is our best midfielder, the only player in our squad you could remotely consider putting in a world XI, genuine world class attacking midfielder, and what do we do.

Play him continually out of position. Don't buy the pace excuse, if we want more pace in our attack line play Wilson instead of Falcao or Rooney.

Stop shoe horning players into positions.

3935~~~
Once he moved further back or whenever he drifted deeper he did something good, found falcao brilliantly twice. He's clearly world class, just isn't a striker at all. He's being asked to play the completely opposite game to what he's used to.

60m for one of the best players in the world when played in his position coming off of an amazing season where he was one of Real Madrids top 3 players alongside Ronaldo and Modric, seems fair. As a striker he wouldn't be worth 20m, because he just isn't one. He's at his best running from deeper, running at defenders through the middle and making things happen, picking out through passes into forwards, no playing with his back to goal and holding the ball up.

3936~~~
Looked much better when played in midfield. He's so dangerous when he can turn and run at defenders, they're frightened of him. He has to be playing CM.

3937~~~
They were very sustainable, and he's shown that form whenever he's played in midfield for us really. It's where he is best at by far. Obviously everything about him will go to shit when he's asked to play a role he is completely unsuited to. It's just really harsh to judge him on these games he's played as a striker.

3938~~~
I'll admit I've never been able to keep track of all 11 players at the same time. 

His passing in the first half was stunningly bad, but then he wasn't the only one.

3939~~~
He's obviously not a striker and so I understand that he isn't playing at his best. However he's still been poor. His head is constantly dropping and he is losing the ball a lot.

3940~~~
Two outstanding crosses for falcao. One which falcao hit the target from but couldn't score but should have anf the other where falcao almost tapped it in but missed. Also played the pass which led to the wilson goal.

I thought he was good whenever he wasn't too further forward.

3941~~~
We have a world class midfielder and we are using him as a striker lol.

Even though we have world class strikers yet no other world class midfielders.

feck me <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3942~~~
Playing out of position isn't an excuse for the passes he made today. Losing the ball isn't what creativity is.

3943~~~
Is he actually playing as a striker?

Could Van Gaal not argue that he's giving Di Maria a free role behind Falcao? An attacking midfielder with no defensive responsibilities. Should be a good chance to showcase his skills. 

We played him out wide and the caf declared he can't play out wide. We're playing him centrally and the problem is what? He's playing too far forward? Is he really so limited a footballer that he turns to shite unless he's in a specific small area of the pitch?

Sorry but this bloke's been a crushing disappointment. I don't usually hold transfer fees against signings but you can't ignore the fact he's the most expensive player signed by any Premier League club ever. About time he started looking like it.

3944~~~
Imagine he was losing the ball so much in a deeper position. 

Definitely higher than he played previously, but he doesn't stay up top.

3945~~~
Exactly!

3946~~~
I bet that he's upset by the fact that Madrid are doing so well without him. He was regarded as a crucial part of their team, then he goes and they win 22 games on the trot. It may seem to be a minor detail but doubts may be creeping in his mind, particularly in the context of United's struggles in the Prem.

3947~~~
Like most on here, I love nothing more than to see Di Maria get the ball from deep and run at the opposition. They can’t handle him. At the same time though I can see that his lack of positional discipline (you don’t want him rooted to one spot) might leave the fullbacks/wingbacks exposed when he plays in midfield, and the fact that he is quite likely to lose the ball in midfield when dribbling might cause us problems at the back. Admittedly we haven't found the perfect solution yet, but I can understand the concerns with him playing in a deeper position.

3948~~~
This and last season.

Loses the ball per match - Bale 8, Di Maria 10
Creates or scores during 10 full games - Bale 11, Di Maria 8

While Di Maria is prettier, Bale gives the ball away 20% less and scores or creates 40% more. That's including the best season of Di Maria's career.

3949~~~
I always thought he was a hard working player at Madrid. But he seems to be a bit lazy here.

3950~~~
I just can't equate the bloke I've watched this season with the central midfielder he allegedly was last season. How the hell can anyone get away with being that careless in possession in central midfield? Alonso and co must have been constantly bailing him out.

3951~~~
He was giving the ball away almost exactly as often last season. Modric and Alonso are fantastic at slowing a counter attack down though (not necessarily tackling, but slowing things down).

Alonso places himself brilliantly (like an extra-special Carrick) and Modric has phenomenal workrate for someone with that much natural ability.

Also, Ramos and Pepe are quite assertive to say the least as centre backs. So you end up with a thicket of intelligent or aggressive players between the player on the ball and penalty box. Not many teams in La Liga can get through that without going wide and crossing isn't the most effective route to take when counter attacking.

3952~~~
I only saw the highlights of yesterday, but on Match of the Day they particularly mentioned how his work rate was excellent yesterday (Although it was Phil Neville so its pretty meaningless).

3953~~~
On top of that he was playing on the left of the middle three in a 4-3-3 with Ronaldo on the left of the front three. It's hard to imagine either of them offering the LB much protection, but as you said Modric and Alonso would have to cover. I wonder if we could use Carrick and Blind similarly in midfield together, rather than midfield and the other in defence.

3954~~~
I would definitely play them both in central midfield. Seems a no-brainer. They're our two best central midfielders after all.  Like many things this season, our manager seems reluctant to do the obvious.

3955~~~
During his four years at Madrid Di Maria always tracked back and defended both when he played on the right and in the middle on the left and not only was his work-rate impressive, his defending was too. He was very good at winning the ball back and shepherding it out of play and a lot of Madrid's counter-attacks were started by him winning the ball back and then either dribbling his way out of the back or by him passing it out. The team became much more balanced when he was put in midfield last year and the defence improved and kept a lot more clean sheets. That said, Madrid had the players around him to make it work when he was used in such a position and I am not sure that United do or if Van Gaal even wants to use him there. All I can say is that there shouldn't be much trouble with Di Maria in term of him not tracking back or working hard, wherever he is put. His attitude and flexibility is excellent and in the end they were what made Ancelotti want to keep him over the more talented but less diligent Ozil.

3956~~~
Real last season defended in a 442 with a flat midfield 4 of Di Maria, Alonso, Modric, Bale . The team struggled in the first half of last season with their 4-3-3. The move to that asymmetrical 4-4-2ish formation with Ronaldo as a free roaming 2nd striker and Di Maria as a left sided box to box midfielder really worked for them, especially in defense, where they were vulnerable before. But it was a very specific set-up with unique roles fit perfectly to the players available to Ancelotti.

3957~~~
Since they were both fit I have wanted to see Carrick and Blind in midfield together. It seems LvG is trying lots of things to try to address the lack of balance. Hopefully he eventually stumbles across the solution. Carlo Ancelotti had a similar issue last season when Bale came. I remember him trying a few different things (christmas tree, 4-4-2, diamond etc) before the 4-3-3 with Di Maria in midfield worked and they stuck with it. Forget the pictures with arrows, but <a class="externalLink" href="https://defendingwiththeball.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/ancelotti-finds-balance-in-4-3-3-formation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ancelotti's quotes in this article/blog</a> about a lack of balance in the team in the first part of last season, echo van Gaal's from this season. I just hope we find the solution.

3958~~~
I remember. I hope we find that balance but we haven't yet.

3959~~~
So we put a player up top and he looked disinterested. As soon as he moved into midfield he came to life but lets ignore that and slate him.

3960~~~
I'd say that Phil's analysis on MOTD of what's going on with him (and what most of us can see) is spot on.

3961~~~
DiMaria started the season brilliantly when he was in midfield, he looked every part the player we expected for that money.
He then gets and injury and is stuck on the wing when he comes back, now he is being played upfront and he hasn't looked the same player since.

Can anyone explain to me why Van Gaal doesn't see this?, i mean you can't just say because our injured midfielders are fit now because its freaking DiMaria we are talking about, he's better than our other midfielders imo.

3962~~~
Been said by me numerous times, he's probably a £50m midfielder, a £20m winger (£30m at his absolute best) and a £10m striker (at best). If we're going to play him anywhere outside midfield we've basically wasted our money.

3963~~~
Simple, but spot on.

3964~~~
I'll add that I found him annoying on the wing for Real Madrid whenever I watched him, he seemed wasteful and inconsistent and would dive all over the place. I saw his a few times in midfield last season and he was marvelous on all occasions, home game versus Barcelona and Champions League final being prime examples of his level there. If he had another ordinary season on the wing last year (had they not signed Bale he would have been deployed on the wing) we would be buying him for £25m last Summer.

He was a joy to watch in his first few games for us, ever since we changed his position he has been a pain to watch really. One of the least exciting players on the pitch which is some achievement in our current side.

3965~~~
Pretty much spot on imo. For Real on the wing he was basically what Nani was for us, a lot of talent but only with like 1 good game out of 10 and more frustrating than anything. Only last season he found consitency and was definitely Reals second best player after Ronaldo while before that he wasn't even a certain starter for them.

3966~~~
He looked very good in every game he was playing in midfield. Even if he started on wing and played poorly, he instantly improved after moving to LCM (in a single game).

I wanted to reply to you but it seems you’ve already found an answer I agree with:
Especially the bolded part is spot on. He is extremely unique, I can’t think of any other players like him right now. Overall he’s nothing special- one footed, inconsistent touch and poor shooting. However, if you let him run at opponents from the deep he can be very useful and in a way he provides what we lack at the moment, the drive in midfield. There’s a risk he will lose the ball every now and then, and it might be the reason LvG’s been trying him upfront (I have never seen him in such role before TBH). What he does requires special conditions and in my opinion, there is no point in buying Di Maria if you’re not going to use him in this “special role” because he’s not even remotely that good in any other position.

That’s also important, obviously he won’t be getting the same numbers as he did last year for Madrid.

3967~~~
Without wanting to resort to 'But can he do it on a wet Wednesday night at Stoke?' cliches, I wonder if the brutal northern British winters and the gruelling fixture schedule that accompanies them is coming as a bit of a culture shock to him. And that he does just need time to adapt to his surroundings.

3968~~~
You make it sound like he's a furry animal, lost from his furry animal brothers and sisters, in the harsh wilderness <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Maybe he should wear gloves? <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3969~~~
Didn't Silva struggle somewhat - relatively speaking - in his first season with City?

Lots of players take time to adapt to a new league and a new country. But I do wonder if the Premier League at this time of year might seem especially harsh for those who've never known anything but warmer climes. I've lived in northern Britain my whole life, for example, and some of these winter mornings still knock me sick.

3970~~~
Yeah fair point. Problem is, no one is afforded any kind of adaptation period nowadays......(the Caf is ample evidence for that!)

3971~~~
Maybe its just me but sometimes it looks like we have some kind of fetish for changing players position.Even when we buy new player,"He is AM but he could also do the trick as CM(even he is 50% better player in his natural position).

3972~~~
Silva came from Valencia, Di Maria came from Real Madrid, along with starring in a CL final and winning the league as a key player for them. There's a stark difference in expectation there IMO.

Ander Hererra for example has far more of a case than Di Maria regarding adaptation.

3973~~~
I'm not sure why prior success should necessarily make it easier to adapt to a new country, new climate, and new league?

(Besides which, Silva arrived at City a World Cup and European Championships winner)

3974~~~
Some players are expected to come in and deliver, and that's the way it's always been. Do you reckon SAF signed Veron with the opinion that he'd need a season or two to adapt? I don't think so, he brought him in for an instant impact and he didn't get that. Silva was also in the 'young player' category when he arrived at City. What was he, 23/24?

Di Maria is 26, which is in or around the prime time of any midfielder. The club didn't fork out 60m(following a season outside the top four) for a player that needs time to adapt. I bet you that.

3975~~~
He obviously hasn't really needed time to adapt though, seeing as he was excellent earlier on, when, funnily enough, he was used in his best fecking position.

It's only since LvG bafflingly started using him in every position other than his best position that he's not looked up to it.

I reckon it won't be long until we're no longer using any of our players in their natural positions, I mean Jones is already on corners so he'll probably be up front for us soon at this rate. LvG seems to enjoy doing the opposite of what's obviously the correct thing to do, just, well, because, feck it it's his philosophy and he does what he damn well wants.

3976~~~
Saw the highlights of the QPR game and his workrate was brilliant. Closing down players even late on. I really hope we find his best position and he is happy there. He is the type of player we need to bring us back to the top level.

3977~~~
4-4-2 diamond worked for him because it allowed him to occupy the left side. We got way too easily bypassed still. He's not good enough to work in a CM pair in the Premier League at the present moment. In fact for the talk about him excelling in CM for Madrid:

1. He had an awesome, fully functioning team to let him play freely.
2. He wasn't really a central midfielder. Ronaldo went towards the middle, essentially freeing up the left wing for him to run from deep and occupy.

Unless we go to 4-5-1 where he can be compensated by two other midfielders to play his natural, attacking game, we won't see him there.

3978~~~
It's the single biggest problem we have as a club, in my opinion at least.

3979~~~
How van gaal is using him lately, I would not be surprised if he makes him into an Anderson or Nani. He needs to be the center of our style of football like how Wenger is utilizing Sanchez at Arsenal. So far, Di maria looks like a shadow of his former self and that is definitely down to our management team.

What I would like to see is my 1-4-2-2-2 I kept talking about early this season with Di maria alternating between both lam/ram role.

De Gea
Defenders
Carrick/Blind ---- Herrera/Fellaini
Januzaj/Mata - Di Maria
Rooney/rvp - Wilson/Falcao

3980~~~
The thing I find with Di Maria is that he'll try something that requires a high level of technical ability most of the time he receives the ball. Left of the diamond, it allowed him to run at players from deep and get out wide to whip the ball in, his two best traits. However, he's incredibly one footed so if he doesn't have that space to break onto his stronger foot under pressure, he struggles. He also has no idea when a pass is not on, if a striker makes a run over the top he generally tries to play it. It's incredibly frustrating because it's not his actual ability that's the problem, because when it is on he has the talent to find his man.

Anyway, if you take away from being left of a pivot 3 in midfield, you take away the two main qualities he possesses and experience more of the inconsistent Hollywood passes and longe range shots, as he's not entirely sure what to do.

3981~~~
I just want him to play midfield so I can go back to enjoying his performances.

3982~~~
If you decide to spend 60 mil on a player, then you don't change his position all the time, but play him in his best position and build the team around him or at least make it play to his strength. And if you don't want to do that, then why buy him? 

I just hope LvG is doing some experiments and not really thinking permanently keeping him out of position. But then I'd rather he would do his experiments once we have top 4 guaranteed. Really don't know what he is doing right now.

3983~~~
Maybe because when he played in midfield early this season, he got tired easily, then eventually got injured often. I think by shifting him to the wing or in attack, LvG is planning to introduce him slowly to the pace of the league while get his fitness improved.

Contrary to some in here, I think he did fairly well as second striker. It just seems like his best combo is with Rooney. I definitely would like to see him more in that position before judging him only by the last game.

3984~~~
Wasn't a threat, didn't dribble at or past people, didn't link the play, couldn't hold it up, provided no service for the main striker and basically did nothing at all whilst sulking and looking uncomfortable in an unfamiliar role.

Perhaps you'd like to say what he did well?

3985~~~
His pace at least pinned their defence back deep. Also his movement created several chances for his partner (Falcao) that fluffed some good ones.

3986~~~
Correct me if I'm wrong but if that's all he can do (I don't really see those movements that you've mentioned at all) then I would rather play Wilson.Playing him as striker only weaken the team as a whole.Midfielder any day of the week for me.

I would also like him to take less shots from outside of the box.It's so obvious that it's not his forte.

3987~~~
If that's what he is being used for in that role, that's a criminal waste and misuse of his abilities.

3988~~~
just play him on the left side of the diamond midfield formation. obviously his best position for us.

would not mind to put him furthest forward in the last 5-10 minutes of a game though. his pace will get us a few counter attacking goals (yeovil, QPR to mind)

3989~~~
In this same page...

3990~~~
That just seems like you're trying to justify and make excuses LvG's actions.

Given he is also playing Rooney out of position and experimenting tactically formation wise I'd say supporters are within reason to become frustrated with his tactical 'philosophy'.

3991~~~
I'm not sure why you make it sound like I did a wrong thing with that. Surely LvG decision to the best of players and the team. I don't say I agreed, but I'm trying to understand why LvG made that decision, based on my observation.

Are you giving up on LvG already, or else?

3992~~~
Haven't given up on LvG, clearly needs more time. 

But don't agree with the notion that he is playing ADM up top to 'regain his fitness and adjust to the league'. Seems like a clear tactical approach which is failing and based on ADM's qualities one he is not suited too. 

I know that our squad was heavily unbalanced prior to his arrival and one transfer window is hardly going to fix that, but he did have those six weeks in the summer to, in his own words, 'assess the squad' and make signings as necessary. Surely he could've envisaged that we were short on full backs, and had too many similar central attacking players with similar qualities (RvP, Rooney, Falcao, Mata). 

In that respect, I'm fairly disappointed with LvG thus far. I don't believe he is going to persist with Di Maria up top any longer, surely not.

3993~~~
He has played in Champions League and at two different World Cup tournaments, I know it is a popular opinion to think that Premier League is above everything else but honestly, he should have absolutely no problem adapting to the pace of the game because it doesn't really differ much fron what he is used to. If anything he has impressed the most when the pace of the game was insane (against Barca last season, I can assure you it wasn't like Hull v Palace).

3994~~~
He has been trying to make him his Robben at United, problem is they are completely different players who serve different purposes. The sooner he realises that the better.

3995~~~
He is a conundrum, he's not a #10 but I think LvG has concerns over playing him on the left of the diamond and he's looked poor playing wide in a forward position. He cost so much money that who we buy next has to be a CM that allows him to play in a midfield 3 if that's possible in English football for him.

3996~~~
He's not playing in the correct position, but for £60m he should be playing so much better. I suppose the same could be said for most of our renowned players though. He's struggling in a poorly performing side.

3997~~~
If Lamela had his performance today, I'd be disappointed, and I give Lamela a huge amount of leeway.

That heavy touch when the left back was caught out of position was the worst. That's his game and he made so just about anyone on this forum could have got the ball off him.

3998~~~
Was proper shite tonight, no excuse for it at all.

3999~~~
Wasn't great today but shows how bad we were in that he was still our main attacking threat.

4000~~~
Veron...

4001~~~
Don't think he was shite at all. Made plenty of chances and on another day could've probably had 3 assists. He's obviously a bit low on confidence so is still far away from his best, but I thought he was good today for the most part. Had good stats as well. 4 key passes, 80% pass accuracy, 5 shots, 76 touches, 4 dribbles, dispossessed just the one time, etc..
Played that lovely through ball into Van Persie as well.

Actually this is the typical good performance that people completely ignore if the result ends badly (a draw in this case) for a player who has been heavily criticized recently and he doesn't get a goal or an assist. Was a perfectly fine performance for any standard of player.

4002~~~
He wasn't shite at all, but you know, whatever you want to think.

4003~~~
He was shite, but you know, whatever you want to think.

4004~~~
terrible. looked like he couldn't give a f**k.

4005~~~
I can't be bothered to check the stats, results etc to back up this claim, but I thought we looked better and more balanced as a team without him.

4006~~~
Terrible but created our best chance of the game when he chipped it to RVP and then the shot that got saved.

4007~~~
I am getting the same vibe as Ozil last season from watching him. Ozil had a great start and did nothing after that. And sadly Di Maria is doing the same.

4008~~~
his performance today was one of those shit Nani's performances. 60m really? or maybe play him as b2b where he can work hard at least. He should also try to find an easier pass sometimes, or choose not to shot when being in a completely terrible position to do so. Of course we need some player who will make wonders but lately he is very selfish and very ineffective.

4009~~~
Taking 3 shots a game (9th most in the Premier League) to Bale's 3 and a half. Bale's got 9 goals in half a season; Di Maria 3.

What was that about being wasteful.

4010~~~
It is a bit worrying, I agree. But, Ozil has always been a very lethargic and fairly mentally weak player. Di Maria worked his socks off at Madrid, Benfica, etc... Hopefully this is just a slump. I'm still convinced once we get him in a three man midfield, with the freedom to run forward and not pass sideways all game, he'll be fantastic.

4011~~~
Thats brilliant, but he creates 2.99 chances per 90 mins, thats more than anyone at Spurs btw. Only one creating more chances in the league is Fabregas.

4012~~~
Everyone who is saying he was shite, give me examples of this. His stats were perfectly fine, he created a few very good chances, ran at defenders from deep, had a couple of loose touches but that happened to everyone with the pitch being as it was. He worked hard, caused problems all night as you'd expect and if the forwards' finishing wasn't off, he would've had a couple of assists at least.

Like I said, today was a standard case of a player putting in a good performance, not amazing, just a good, normal 7/10 performance, but since he's had his critics recently, is a record signing, and the result was a bit embarrassing, everybody overreacts and says he was shite. Which he wasn't, in any way.

4013~~~
Taking a few touches to get the ball under control a couple of times and overrunning it on the counter attack. Just didn't look sharp enough. Lot of sideways passing on the edge of the box.

Still created chances and struck that effort well late on, but visually he didn't look that level above you want to see. It was like watching Henderson create assists rather than a Fabregas or Modric today. I know there's no real difference but it didn't look slick or precise for the most part.

4014~~~
Yeah, that happened a few times. He also did a lot of good things though. Like I said, he had a decent game. Not amazing, not shite by any stretch. Had a few poor touches, but also made like 4 really good chances and had a couple of good shots and generally looked a threat with his running from deep.

Agree that he's still far away from his best, but people are overreacting just saying he was shite, when he really wasn't. Clearly low on confidence as is everyone else and that affects even the best players. Today was more on the right track compared to the last few where he played up top.

4015~~~
Think I gave him a 6. Only Rojo I think got higher off me.

4016~~~
Everyone was struggling to get it under. A half-frozen chopped up pitch didn't help. Like playing on cobble stones. Di Maria was one of our better players tonight but it wasn't a game where flair players could express themselves. Suited the likes of Rojo much better.

4017~~~
He's trying too much to get a goal which he desperately needs. Once he gets it he'll be off and running again i'm sure.

4018~~~
Thats the one thing I'm not really getting (and thats annoying me). He's never had a particularity good scoring record, nor do I ever remember him shooting as much from distance for Madrid or Argentina as he is atm for us. His game has always been about providing assists for others, and I don't know why he's trying to change it. He just needs to do what he was doing at the start of the season, and if nicks a few goals along the way, then great.

4019~~~
What do you do when no one is making the runs for you? As soon an RVP came on he played that lovely ball over the top for him.

4020~~~
I think the issue is his price-tag.
For a Galactico type price-tag, we expect him to perform like a Galactico, ie. be the best player on the pitch almost every game, which he isn't.
Had he been got for £30M, we'd probably be satisfied with his performance.

I cant believe that Chelsea got Fabregas for half the price of Di Maria.

4021~~~
I'm not sure he is settled living in England yet and it will all take time...He definitely does not look like an Elite player on current form but he has shown glimpses of being something special. We need another top central midfielder to take the pressure off the likes of Di Maria and who will give them better service. Fellaini will only ever keep things simple. A proper creative central midfielder alongside Carrick would help a lot. Anyways I hope to God that he comes good because I don't think the club can afford any more expensive mistakes......but Di Maria on his day is outstanding so you'd think Van Gaal can get him performing somehow

4022~~~
I don't think he's settled yet.

I'm sorry for saying this and I hope I'm wrong, but I'd say he'll be gone within 2 years. Doesn't seem able to express himself properly at United, similar to Kagawa.

It's only been half a season of course, but meh.

4023~~~
How long before people start slagging him off for this wastefulness like Nani?

4024~~~
Think van Gaal is trying to get him into a goalscorer. He's having a lot more shots from range then usual, he's been playing up front and that's just not the way to use him IMO. He needs to play deep and run at defenders with the ball. Not with his back to goal, hold up the ball and run backwards. Completely opposite to what he's used to. 

Saying that, vs Cambridge he was one of the few who looked threatening throughout and made a few great chances, even if the decision making was a bit off at times.

4025~~~
He is forcing his game, trying to do something he's never been comfortable doing. He can score goals but maybe when he's more relaxed and doesn't put intense pressure on him, he's trying to carry us as he probably sees the teams desperately needs some inspiration.

4026~~~
Proper mercenary huh

4027~~~
To be fair, he's a much better player overall than Kagawa. Whereas Kagawa arguably wasn't good enough compared to Rooney and Mata to get time in his preferred position, LVG will hopefully start giving Di Maria time where he thrives best.

4028~~~
I don't see why people have a problem with Di Maria? The way I see it:

First few games: Sensational e.g. goals v Leicester, Everton and QPR. 
Games after that: Quiet but effective e.g. Assist v West Brom, Involved in the goal v Chelsea, Decent away at Man City 
After that: Ages out injured
Comes back: Goal against Yeovil, very effective when played in midfield against QPR

The only game where he was dogshit was Southampton. With his injuries this year and settling into a new league I really don't think there is an issue. The potential is there for me for him to be a top player for us when he settles down. I suppose the price tag is what people will always point to. 

There is a much bigger issue with Falcao.

4029~~~
What a bizarre comparison. Have people seriously forgotten how good his start at United was? He was expressing himself as freely and as effectively as any player in the league when he played in midfield, which then led to even a Liverpool fan compare him to Ronaldo/Suárez.

4030~~~
He plays well when the team plays well, I'm sure he'll come good once we build a bit of momentum. He's not a game-changer for us at the moment though, which is disappointing.

4031~~~
Honeymoon period? I don't know. It's just a gut feeling that I can't really reason with.

4032~~~
We're at a point now where we're questioning all our players in an attempt to make sense of the current situation, instead of admitting the reality that van gaal is doing a poor job handling them so far this season.

Di maria isn't the only player struggling, when so many players are performing way below their standards you should always look at the manager.

4033~~~
I don't think it is a coincidence he has gone missing a bit since he wasn't played in CM. Doubt it is a good enough excuse for everyone though.

4034~~~
I think he's best when he's not the main player on the team. So he can do what he does best without trying so hard to make an attempt to justify this superstar price tag. I don't think he is a superstar player like Ronaldo, Messi, Bale, Ibrahimovic. These players need their stats to be excellent as much as their performances. 

Look how many wild shots Di Maria is taking. The amount of times he tries these silly flicks giving the ball away. It is reminiscent of Nani and as a winger they're equally inconsistent and erratic. As a CM in Real Madrid he had the luxury of having a well oiled team of quality to allow him to play. He wasn't really a midfielder. He was a left winger still but positioned deeper, while Ronaldo moved to the center.

4035~~~
I agree he probably feels more responsibility to be a goalscorer at United - it comes with the territory when you're played up front, in fairness - and that's making him a bit more wasteful than normal, and that can be backed up with the stats. This season he's taking over 3 shots per game which is more frequent than at any time in his Madrid career. Part of that is down to him being the main player I agree, but part of that is down to the role he's being asked to play - it's partly mental but also partly tactical, IMO. The silly flicks and overly casual passing leading to him giving the ball away cheaply is just something that's always been part of his game (in the same way it was part of Giggs' game right 'til the end).

4036~~~
Fair point. To an extent it further strengthens my view that Di Maria is not a central midfielder however. In a 3 he can get away with it with others doing his dirty work but until we get the right balance through transfers in and out we won't go to 4-3-3. He's a winger playing in CM. I'm not surprised why Van Gaal is trying to keep him away from there because his game is very oriented to one particular facet: taking players on. I don't think he's a great passer, he's slight and erratic. Last season when he was outstanding he pretty much occupied the left flank but from deeper positions. He had the players as I said to do so and Madrid aren't missing him. The so called engine isn't being seen either as he looks a bit disinterested. What he's good at he is very good and can be relentless but he is not a central midfielder. If we get the players in to go 4-3-3 he'll be on the wing.

4037~~~
Just imagine the damage he would be doing to teams under Rodgers. What a waste of world class talent.

4038~~~
Wouldn't say it was only the honeymoon period. His performances took a pretty sharp downturn the second he was moved from his deeper/left center midfield position. In it, whenever he's played, he was amazing. Outside of it he's been streaky. Had a few good performances on the wing, a few poor ones, and then up front he's just not a striker so that's understandable as to why he was poor there. Playing in the hole like the last game and a bit he was definitely closer to good then bad though, it was decent overall but getting better. As long as we play him deeper, as part of a midfield 3, I reckon he'd be right up there with aguero and Sanchez as the best player in the league, without a doubt. Elsewhere, well why the feck would you buy one of the best players in the world for £60m and then proceed to play him in a position where he didn't get that reputation in? Its a strange obsession with united managers, playing players out of position.

4039~~~
Agree with this. Chance taking dribbler but worked his absolute socks off last season (started almost every game after Christmas at such pace it looked almost impossible to keep up more than 70 minutes) and deservedly got his Champions League medal out of it. Both his crossing and passing are on and off but most wingers in world football would swap for it. Just not the very top level ones like Silva, Ozil or whoever.

His workrate was great, but it still needed Modric and Alonso doing incredible attack slowing and stifling whenever Real Madrid lost the ball to make it work. Seriously, watch how many times somebody dribbles past Modric and isn't slowed up or forced back; does not happen often. Amazing for somebody so short and seemingly lacking in the skills to dominate without the ball.

Struggle seeing him outdoing Fabregas in a central midfield role. Apart from the ridiculous amount of assists Fabregas has (Di Maria could get close I suppose), Fabregas does miles more defensive work (like 3 times as much). Mourinho's got Fabregas extremely well drilled this season; whole new level of effectiveness.

Assuming he goes third best player in the league after Aguero and Sanchez is building way too much out of last season and ignoring Costa, Hazard and a couple of others. I'll be even more impressed than I was by him last season.

4040~~~
Forgot about Hazard tbh, I have him as my best player anyways overall, though Sanchez has been the best this season for me. Di Maria in his proper position is up there with them, and I mean, he has shown that form at the start of his career with United when played there and a lot of last season. I don't think it's building too much out of last season, at his best, he is as good as anyone in the world at their best bar Ronaldo and Messi IMO, and that's why he was part of the world 11 and shortlist for the ballon d'or. The problem is when playing outside of his best position, he's as inconsistent as Nani was outside of his 2 year spell that he was world class during. Simple solution would be to just play him back in midfield, but it's not like he's a central midfielder like Fabregas, he's a very unique player and that almost wide, but also central midfield role while given loads of freedom at the same time is probably his best position. He effectively replaces a #10, but goes further back, works a lot harder and has more of an influence on the game from deeper then traditional #10's, and isn't right in the middle. The problem with why United couldn't get a balance was because we still played with 2 strikers and a #10, along with having him back there... Doesn't work.

What he does better then pretty much anyone in the world is link the midfield to the attack through his running from deep on the ball, and his ability to see a through pass which really is terrific, just he hasn't been able to show it enough these last few months because of the roles he's played in. That's why Ancelotti played him sort of in a 3 man midfield, but sort of out wide. Ronaldo would start out wide, with Di Maria inside and start like a 4-3-3, but then he would drift wide with the ball and overlap Ronaldo who would go inside and make like a lopsided 4-4-2. Obviously now we don't have the same players as Real Madrid, but at the same time, we can definitely incorporate Di Maria in a similar system to get the best out of him, since you know, he is our best outfield player (at his best).

Also, nobody is going to catch Fabregas this season, but put Di Maria in midfield all season in a functional side and he'd run away with the assists I think. Even on his bad days he still makes plenty of chances, but our forwards just haven't been putting them away.

4041~~~
He was seriously extraordinary in his first couple of weeks before the injury and position swaps hit. I think it has been forgotten slightly by some while he goes through this patch of poor form.

4042~~~
Also forgot to add, while his level does go down when playing out of position as does everyone, he can still be world class on the wing or in different positions. It's not like he has to play exclusively in the middle. It just depends on the system the team is playing. If we're playing a game where we are dominating possession, the opposition have 10 men behind the ball sitting deep, then he won't be that useful out wide, he needs to be more central and further back so he can run at the opposition. In a counter attacking system, then I think he'd be able to play anywhere behind the striker position really, out wide, behind the forward, as he'll have time and space to run with the ball and have other runners along side him, that's when he is at his best. He would've been perfect in old Fergie managed United teams IMO, as that was exactly the style that he would do so well in. Just don't think there's any style that he would do well as a striker, so it's weird as to why Van Gaal ever played him up top. Complete waste.

4043~~~
Its funny, despite being out of form/injured he still has 10 goals/assits in 16 matches (and would have about 5 more assits to his name if RVP had finished of all the chances Di Maria has laid on a plate for him). Even when he plays badly his productivity always remains relatively high, which is a great asset to have.

4044~~~
He will be here for the next 5 years at least and will go down as one of the best players of the decade in Premier League.

4045~~~
Reading those comments makes me sad. People really have forgotten how good, and exciting he was, at the start of the season. We need to get him back in the middle, and playing like this.

The really sad thing though, is I remember a few posters jokingly saying things like 'I wonder how long until we ruin him' or 'how long till he drops down to the United level'. Oh how we all laughed. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4046~~~
We need him to be more Ryan Giggs than Ronaldo given his skill set and unfortunately he has been played up front recently rather than midfield. His shooting is inconsistent, we need him to tone down on the audacious efforts and keep putting in fantastic passes that we know he's capable of.

4047~~~
Judging by van gaal's comments he is back to trying the diamond, if so I would like to see Angel as the LCM.

4048~~~
I think anywhere other than LCM prevents him playing his best stuff, driving from deep with the freedom to drift wide or attack centrally is a huge part of what took him to another level at Real last season. It's whether we have the CM strength to allow him to do that in this league that is uncertain.

4049~~~
It is absolutely crazy that we paid £60 million for him and aren't using him in his best position.

4050~~~
All he needs is another QPR performance to get the ball rolling again.

4051~~~
Excellent so far today. Play him in his correct position and allow him to run with the ball from deep midfield and he'll thrive.

4052~~~
Playing in his most effective position and thriving. Who'd of thunk it?

4053~~~
He needs to be moved to the left wing or striker next game.

4054~~~
Needs to bring back that killer instinct, and we will finally have back our most expensive signing. Apart from that he's been very effective.

4055~~~
Wasted that counter with Falcao. Very poor pass.

Otherwise he's looking more lively.

4056~~~
Personally thought he was much better against Cambridge, goes to show how the difference in scoreline affects peoples opinion on individual performances. Still playing decently just over hit a few passes in key areas.

4057~~~
Still wasteful but looking a lot brighter than of late.

Hopefully can play himself back into form.

4058~~~
His final ball is really lacking. Other than that he's better than he's been recently, but I guess that's not so difficult. Hopefully it's the start of an upward trajectory for him.

4059~~~
Better, but not amazing. Play it to Shaw more, he's there for a reason.

4060~~~
He does make things happen more than any of our other players, but 64% pass accuracy is pathetic really. Nani would be shot if he was ever that low.

4061~~~
Wasteful and nowhere near his best but just his energy and drive moving forward is massively helping us in the attack.

4062~~~
Slowly returning back to his best. I hope he gets the pre-WBA form back.

4063~~~
Agreed. He's looked lively, but I expect more.

4064~~~
this! i think is so obvious, i cant understand how LVG doesnt see it

4065~~~
He loses the ball a lot but still contributes very well to the team - good but not great.

4066~~~
Just for kicks, everyone should read that as ADM having, at some point in his career, played for WBA.

4067~~~
He just needs a goal or something like a good assist after a crazy run to lift him up.

4068~~~
Still think he would be a lot more devastating on the left flank. Even maybe the right flank.

Love the fact that we are blindingly quick on the counter attack though. Its really the tip of the iceberg of how fecking good we could potentially be on the break. Its a thing of beauty watching defences shit themselves when they cant recover after a set piece.

4069~~~
He has a free role and is thriving in it, needs to be more precise for sure but he's getting on the ball a lot and influencing our attacks, the accuracy will come if we can get him a run of games in this role.

4070~~~
Bad wording from me, again.

I meant he looked good for us before that game.

4071~~~
He will always lose the ball a lot, that's not his game to keep it. He makes things happen.

4072~~~
That moment when he gets past a player and bombs forward, you feel as though something will definitely happen.

Even when having a hot and cold game, he makes such a difference.

Just leave him in some kind of midfield position where he belongs...play him as a striker and he's wasted.

4073~~~
It's one of the main reason we bought him. We've nobody else that can provide that.

4074~~~
Wasteful at times but effective.  Would rather watch that than the cowardly stuff we've seen the last season and a half.

4075~~~
Agreed. Tbh I don't really care that much when he tries to force it and loses it as at least once or twice a match it will pay off and we'll get through on goal because of it.

4076~~~
His passing is not good enough for this role. The reason he was dangerous for Madrid in midfield last season was that he was essentially a half-winger. He started in midfield but would often drift out wide and go on his devastating runs down the left when space opened up. He can't do that down the right because of his oneleggedness and there's rarely space to do it down the middle.

Despite the Caf consensus, he is <i>not</i> an out-and-out midfielder and to use him as such is as much of a waste as it is to play him in attack. He's better on the left-wing than he is in this role.

4077~~~
Disagree, he's too predictable when played left wing. He was really poor when played there earlier in the season, while he's usually good when played central as he can get involved more and drift around into space more.

4078~~~
He's been very good today imo. That touch<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4079~~~
He was very good in his first few games. He's been decent today by those standards.

4080~~~
Ran the show in that second half. His touch at high speed is devastating. This is how he should be used.

4081~~~
Again very good.

4082~~~
Was great 2nd half, who has a quicker turn than him at full speed? Was ridiculous at times.

4083~~~
Good game, more like it.

4084~~~
Good game today. Totally different player when getting the ball deeper.

4085~~~
Flattered to deceive. Looked dangerous, ultimately fizzled out each time apart from the shot leading to Falcao's rebound goal

4086~~~
Should have passed to Wilson at the end.

4087~~~
Had a good game today. Pleased with that performance.

4088~~~
Love it when he can turn and run at players.

4089~~~
Looked dangerous today, still a lot more to come from him.

4090~~~
Final ball/shoot was lacking today but he was a major threat everytime he had the ball. Our most creative player in the team! Runs past players for fun as well.

4091~~~
Very hit and miss

Dunno what to think of him at all

4092~~~
Looked very dangerous in the first half, just had glimpses in the 2nd.

He's a great dribbler, his final ball just seems to be lacking. And he really can't shoot for shit, he's just not a striker.

4093~~~
I don't think anybody would pass it on when they have a chance on the half volley like that.. In fact I'd be a little disappointed if they did as it shows a lack of confidence in not taking it on yourself. Was a great chance either way. Should have scored, but it's not that big of a deal that he didn't.

My only problem with di maria is that he's a shite finisher really. He's a world class player but his finishing is so inconsistent. Rushes his shots too often at times. Brilliant at running with the ball though and finding gaps in defences.

4094~~~
Looks like he is getting fitter, was still running at their defence in the 90th minute.  He wasn't lasting the whole game previously.  Still think that there is much more to come from him, loses possession too easily from time- to-time.

4095~~~
Ridiculous to watch those turns - perhaps Sterling and Hazard can match it, but few others. He's just so entertaining to watch; ufortunately, that applies to too few of our other players. But ADM, what a gem when he plays like this, and today he was even wasteful!

4096~~~
I'm not convinced so far. He has obviously has great talent, particularly when turning and running with the ball, but his passing, shooting and overall decision-making leave a lot to be desired. He was fantastic during his first month; for the money we paid, I'd expect to see that form on a semi-regular basis.

4097~~~
Like Herrera he brings urgency and changes the whole rythm of our game when in midfield.

Take him out and replace him with another slow paced player happy to never run at people with the ball and we'll look as flat as we have for the most of the season.

I don't really care if he loses the ball a lot, he makes us dangerous even if he's wasteful.

4098~~~
Wasted a glorious chance for a goal but basically wrecked havoc on the break. Just brings a different speed to our play when used correctly.

Would like to see him on opposite wings to Januzaj. That would be a sight to behold and it might also allow Herrera a spot in the side.

Hopefully this is ADM rounding into form when we need it the most for the most important months of the season.

4099~~~
He really wasn't very good today in terms of his touch and shooting, but still makes things happen. That's why he is a great player, still had a big impact on our attacking play and when he does hit his top form will be unplayable (as he was earlier in the season).

4100~~~
Some very good runs, just needs to tighten up the end product, overhitting way too many passes.

4101~~~
Well hopefully today was a step in that direction, albeit a somewhat faltering one. We'll need him at top form if we're going to challenge for 2nd or 3rd (or even hold on to 4th.)

4102~~~
Thought he greatly resembled Nani today. Did all the not-very-important things really well. Hustled and harried. But when it came down to the crucial moments, consistently made the wrong decision. Killed numerous chances with terribly weighted passes, and also gave the ball away unnecessarily multiple times. 

I guess the word for it if you like the player is 'mercurial' and if you don't it's 'frustrating and wasteful'.

4103~~~
Brilliant to see him finally find his rhythm again

4104~~~
Improved as the game wore on. Hopefully a sign of things to come.

I think he's best playing in a free role rather than our rigid formations.

4105~~~
Did he play a LM or nr. 10?

4106~~~
He made things happen while still being way off his best in terms of end product. A very minor complaint, but I wish he'd stop taking our right-sided free kicks. He rarely seems to produce from them whereas RVP has took them well before.

4107~~~
Much better today, always get that wide-eyed sense of excitement when he gets the ball and runs at/away from defenders. Thankfully didn't take many hopeful, wasteful shots but really should have scored on that one chance. Do wish he'd put in more crosses again, he used to whip them in when he first got here.

4108~~~
Well, he has produced really good form on a pretty regular basis, when playing in a position he is suited to. Up front or isolated on one wing when the opponents have 10 men behind the ball does him no good. He needs to be running with the ball through the middle or be given a free role to switch sides.

4109~~~
I thought he was poor today. Ran with the ball well at times but more often than not it broke down. His passing was poor and he lost the ball quite a lot. Insisted on trying that long ball over the top quite a lot and they were easily dealt with.

I think he's far too wasteful at the moment.

4110~~~
As a 10. Januzaj then kept more width on the left while Rooney tucked more inside to act as a normal CM, with Valencia offering the width on the right. 

The free role suits Di Maria much better.

4111~~~
Sthing like our Robben<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4112~~~
Yep that’s how it is with him. Even when he has poor game he does a few very good things. If we find a setup in which somebody covers for him we will be fine.

So far he is very …unpredictable I would say. Not on the same wavelength as the rest of our attackers. At the beginning he was putting in crosses almost every time he got the ball near the box. But today I thought he was playing some sort of “free role” which I don’t think suits the team. Causing a lot of disorganization in both teams I suppose.

4113~~~
good performance. his acceleration and pace are asset to us.

still, should had passed to wilson and not a fan of him playing upfront. should have been rooney moved forward when robin was subbed. but van gaal is van gaal obviously..

4114~~~
Please stop moving him upfront. Had a mixed bag, but was a hell of a lot better in a deeper role.

4115~~~
I thought he was very good. His final ball wasn't the best, but that's how it is with these kind of players. Opposition defenders are shitting it when he runs at them with the ball.

4116~~~
Did we overpay for adm? To be honest I expect much more from him. Is he the same player that he was when he was at real? Or did the players like Ronaldo, benzema, etc made him look good than he really is?

4117~~~
That ball to Falcao (who was offside) in the first few minutes was delectable.

4118~~~
His style was better suited to them as the ones around him played in the same vein. We dont. Also, he's at his best when he starts off deep. Playing him high up the pitch and he isnt a 60mil player.

4119~~~
You people can be desperate sometimes. He was better than in previous performances but that was a wasteful performance by Di Maria, his final ball was lacking every single time and his decision making was hit and miss. It seemed like he was in competition with Rooney for who will missplace the more passes.

4120~~~
Fantastic performance. Hope to see more of that.

4121~~~
Brilliant dribbling! But needs to improve his shooting technique?

4122~~~
We overpaid because we are Manchester United and we were in crisis at the time, but he is still a genuine world class player and every bit as good as we all thought he was.

You can see by the way he can pick the ball up deep and just waltz through the opposition midfield/defence how good he is... there are VERY few players in world football who can do that. He needs to be able to run at players, not receive the ball with his back to a line of defenders.

4123~~~
We did overpay for him for him but who cares as long as he plays well?

He's just the player we need in that role. Unlike a certain other Spanish #10 we have, he never hides in games and is constantly trying to create chances and take on players.

4124~~~
He's not a match winner but he is a game changer.  Really can change the tempo of an attack as soon as he receives the ball. I think if we surrounded him faster quicker forwards. . We'd be bagging plenty of goals, he creates so many dangerous opportunities. . Its just he can't put them away himself.

4125~~~
Out and out wideman is a complete waste of this boys talents.  I think most of us are in consensus on that.

4126~~~
He should have done better in the final third, but as a threat he was great. The swagger, touch, brilliant dribbling was all starting to come back.

4127~~~
if your manager stopped swapping tactics / formations every 5 minutes and played him consistently in the same position with the same players around him....you'd see his best.

4128~~~
Of course we overpaid for him. We were desperate as feck and he is a top top player. Don't care though as he's just the type of player I wanted at United. Brave, creative, willing to take players and never stops running. If we consistently play him in midfield hell do great. Obivously much depends on how the team and its chemistry develops of course.

4129~~~
He was worth £35-40 million in real terms, he is very similar to Nani in terms of consistency and decision making, he's not a goal scorer either. But he is an excellent player, just not £60 million excellent.

4130~~~
Well he won that competition. 69% pass completion vs 86%.

4131~~~
Patience ladies, patience. Calm your tits he'll come good.

4132~~~
He had a good game yesterday, probably our best player after Blind. Talk of wastefulness is boring when you consider the cowardly nature of many of our players in recent years. 

We tend to lack pace, conviction and imagination and Di Maria offers that from deep. That second goal doesn't happen if he's not on the pitch.

4133~~~
Maybe not conviction, but yes, I agree. He's probably the most gifted plank of wood I've seen.

4134~~~
Has great ability but I would expect more from a player of Madrid. The shot he skied, he was right too shoot despite Wilson being there for a tap in. A little bit more composure and it's a controlled finish. I think Ruud said that he used to try to score great goals but you don't always need the hollywood finish. The pace was on the ball and a controlled side foot would have got him his goal. Up to a point, he's quality and we're lucky to have him. He reminds me of a certain Portuguese player playing for Sporting. Next season could be a lot of fun

4135~~~

4136~~~
fecking hell.

4137~~~
Must have been Falcao, the bloke is stealing a living at the minute. <span style="color: #ffffff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Lol</span></span>

4138~~~
They were very forward in their demands. Di Maria - not being a fan of that position - was confused by this.

4139~~~
If true then feck

But wouldn't surprise me to hear tomorrow "Di Maria doesn't live in a house....he still lives in an apartment/flat in the city with his family"

4140~~~
Fecking hell, it's an incident like this that could see him ask to leave, that's seriously messed up.

4141~~~
One of the fastest players in the world.  Truly unstoppable when he turns on the speed. Time to build the attack around him.

4142~~~
Yeap. Was very nice to see those drives from midfield yesterday. One of the very few players on our team willing to taken it on himself to carry the ball forward.

4143~~~
Yep, and that's why I feel he should play centrally as a #10 in a sort of free roaming role. 

Lets assume for arguments sake, that Nani does come back and Bale signs for us in the summer.


The three behind the striker would have the pace, power and trickery to kill any side on the counter. That's what we should aim for.

4144~~~

4145~~~
He is quite similar to Nani i have to say. Both can be quite careless mainly because they're risk takers and not safe players who are everywhere in this team. In my opinion there is very little that separates Di Maria from a fully fit Nani.

4146~~~
He's vastly superior to Nani. As wingers there wasn't much between them when Nani was at his best. But di Maria has a lot more in his tank. There's no way Nani could have been as much a part of the "engine" of a team as di maria was at madrid. His stamina and running ability is nuts. Nani is quite lackadaisical in comparison.

4147~~~
He and Blind looked really promising as 2/3rds of a CM, I thought. Di Maria is so good on the ball that he can turn pressure into an advantage rather than being forced backwards. 

DiMaria----Herrera
------Blind------

needs to come back.

4148~~~
If he was an 18 year old, bought for £10M, we could definitely give him time.
But for £60M, a player is expected to make immediate impact. He should be the finished article.
Sanchez, Costa, Fabregas, etc have all made immediate impact.

Half the season is over and we have to accept that this is now his 'normal' standard of play.
Either his standard has dropped or he just doesnt suit our team/play.

The other thing to remember is that he may be a big game player which means that on big Champions League nights, he may come alive - but we need to wait and see.
He certainly hasnt covered himself in glory when we have played big (EPL) teams. His best performances have come against the likes of QPR, which is not reassuring.

IMO we overpaid and if I had a choice to do a straight swap with Fabregas, I'd bite Chelsea's hand off.

4149~~~
Nani was fit as a butchers dog. Did a lot of good work defensively. To be honest, I'm really not seeing much of a difference between what Nani could have brought to the team this season and what Di Maria <b>is</b> bringing to the team this season. 

Lots of nice touches, some neat dribbling, a few goals and assists but generally a bit wasteful, makes poor decisions and frustrates fans and team-mates alike. And that's "bad Nani". The "good Nani" of a few years back was miles better than what we've seen from Di Maria this season. Plus you have to bear in mind that Nani was a big game player. Even in seasons where he wasn't at his best he seemed to step up his game against the best teams around. The opposite is true of Di Maria. So far.

All the provisos about new league, playing for team in transition and all that still apply. So there are very good excuses for him not being as good as we'd hope. But let's not kid ourselves that he's been anything other than slightly disappointing. If was to continue to play at the same level we've seen in the season so far he would be a really terrible waste of money.

4150~~~
But he has made an immediate impact? 

The majority of games he plays in usually results in his work producing a goal. Whether he scores himself, gets the assist, shoots and someone gets the rebound or he's ran past 3 players, he's making an impact. His issue is inconsistency in games, he can look like the best player in the world one minute and the next he's playing the most wayward pass you wouldn't even see in league two.

4151~~~
So pretty much exactly what we would have got if we'd held onto Nani and kept the 60 million quid.

4152~~~
I dont want to sound negative, but the 'Galacticos' of Cambridge Utd found it quite easy to stop him.
In fact, many teams have found it quite easy to stop him and all our forwards. We have struggled to create chances or score goals lately.
He played a little against 10 man Aston Villa who Arsenal put 5 past.
Unstoppable isnt the word I'd use to describe ADM.

Off the top of my head, the EPL players who I would class as unstoppable are Sanchez, Aguero, Costa, Kane, Fabregas, Hazard, but to name a few.

4153~~~
Don't know how you work that out, as most of them have been "stopped" plenty this season. Including by our own creaking defence.

But yeah, ADM sure as hell isn't unstoppable either.

4154~~~
Nani was fit. But he didn't have the kind of engine that Di Maria has. The latter if used in midifeld can run and run and run. Nani was your typical attacker. He did a bit of chasing here and there.

Thing with us is that we're an inconsistent side. We're trying different formations. Trying different styles. Playing players like di Maria upfront and rooney in midfield. It's no surprise that we have a lot of players sometimes playing well and other times playing poorly. Rooney as well has been affected by this. Like di Maria has done some very nice stuff this season but also struggled, given we want to now turn him into Danny Murphy.

Also it has to be added that unlike Costa and more like hazard and ozil, di Maria isn't a powerful player so he's obivously got more adjusting to do. It would have affected fabregas more as well had he not played here before.

But no doubt he has to be more precise with his play than he has since his return from injury, although I thought he did well in our last game albiet without end product.

At the end of the day, I hope he settles quickly because I think he's capable of peforming a role for us few others can. Like I said last season, I have rarely seen the kind of combination of skill and running and harrying, that he showed for madrid then. So I hope we can get the best out of him.

4155~~~
Come on, he's not set the world alight but it's not even a comparison.

4156~~~
I dunno. If Nani had got the same amount of minutes I wouldn't have been surprised at all if he'd been that productive. Along with being similarly wasteful and frustrating to play with. Nani has a better shot on him, mind you.

4157~~~
In this team we are crying out for a Nani type player to play ahead of Di Maria. As much as Nani frustrates we miss a players of his skill set in this team. Even an average Nani produces more than Adnan imo. Can't believe I'm saying this but bring back Nani

4158~~~
Apart from a few games he's been largely crap. His long shots are hardly ever near the target or are nonthreatening, his crosses have slowly gotten worse, his corners hit the first man a lot and he gets muscled off the ball easily. A lot of his attempted through-balls are way overhit as well. Needs to get on the same wavelength as the rest of the team.

4159~~~
We paid more for Di Maria than what Madrid paid for Kaka who was a ballon'dor winner For what he's produced so far, we've been mugged of badly.

4160~~~
Oh yeah, Kaka, he was great for Real wasn't he?

4161~~~
Erm where did I say he was? I simply said he was a ballon'dor winner which justified his huge price tag a bit. Di Maria has never hit those heights, even last season.....

4162~~~
While Di Maria didn't win the Ballon D'Or last season like Kaka did in 2007, this is a very misleading argument.

Yes, Kaka did win that individual award but statistically he scored 18 goals and provided 11 assists in the 2006/ 2007 season. Di Maria's numbers from last season are equally comparable if not better at 12 goals and 23 assists for the season. Would Kaka win the Ballon D'Or in a season when Ronaldo was on the verge of breaking a plethora of individual scoring awards and in an era where both he and Messi are regularly scoring 70, 80 goals per calender year ? I really don't think so. Angel is no scrub either. He was the man of the match in the Champion's League final, Madrid's 2nd most influential player for La Decima behind Ronaldo, named to every major team of the year list, is one of the highest assist makers for the last few seasons in Europe and so forth.

We paid standard market value + a bit of a premium due to missing out on European football for a footballers of his undoubtedly world class quality. Sometimes players need time to adapt in a new league, to their team-mates, a new style of play and find their rhythm. By no means were we mugged. It's always prudent to wait 2-3 seasons before judging a transfer because then you have a decent sample size to gauge that player's performance and contribution to the team.

4163~~~
Absolutely devastating through the middle, average as a striker and another Nani on the wing. Looks like a no brainer where he should play, yet for some reason it isn't. 

The way he runs at players with the ball is fantastic, we haven't seen that here since Giggs was young.

4164~~~
Relax, I said "so far" which means he can still and probably will prove me wrong. He is an excellent player when on form but he is way to inconsistent.

I agree with your bit about waiting 2-3 seasons before judging a player(Last year Fellaini was the spawn of Hades, now he's a good, solid player), but that doesn't mean you can't talk about or rate his performances so far which have been very disappointing.

As for Kaka, he was a much more accomplished and better player than Di Maria. He was in the fifapro team of the year 3 times and had already won the Ballon'dor.

4165~~~
If you consider inflation, we actually paid about 5-8m less. Also, Di Maria has probably produced more for us than Kaka did for Madrid. The guy was a monumental flop in Spain.

Personally, I don't think Kaka was much better. He had a season or two where he was undoubtedly great, but like a lot of Brazillians, his peak didn't last very long.

4166~~~
Ok fair enough. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4167~~~
Knee-jerk much? Di Maria is shit but Harry 'I've player for Spurs for 3 months' Kane is unstoppable, yeah alright. Di Maria has been fine in midfield, he's useless upfront but who the feck plays Di Maria up top with his back to goal? a complete waste of his talents, it's the equivalent of playing Jonny Evans on the wing.

4168~~~
Di Maria has been one of the best players in the world over the last year. This includes being amazing in CL and the world cup. He was was excellent at the beginning of the season with us but our manager has misused him for the last few months. We saw what he could do from a deeper position last game. 

When he is able to run at defenders from deep he is unstoppable.

4169~~~
Angel di Maria would make an average striker, a decent winger, or a world-class midfielder. If you buy a player for 60 million pounds, you certainly do your best to get the maximum out of him.

4170~~~
Have to say I'm quite happy with his peformances in midfield so far given the number of games bes played there and how stop start that has been. Maybe I'm alone on that.

4171~~~
He's better than just a decent winger - though I don't see what he offers as a striker as finishing isn't his game.

He should be played through the middle where he can be more involved. I don't think he's that much worse as a winger, I just think he sees less of the ball there so isn't given as much of an opportunity to affect the game.

4172~~~
I agree - when played in midfield he played well and hopefully he'll play there

4173~~~
Hope that having his house attacked by armed robbers while he's eating tea with his family won't scare him away. Apparently they've moved to a hotel for the time being.

4174~~~
As a winger, he can still be influential and have the ability to affect the game if he doesn't play like a rigid winger who just stays out wide and delivers crosses in. His attributes, style of play, and skill sets do not suit that of a central midfielder where many seemingly want him to play. The only way I can see him be useful there is if he plays the role Giggs played for us since 2006 (pseudo-central midfielder), which is pretty much the role di Maria played in his last season at Real Madrid.

For such a role, you need two holding midfielders who are great playmakers, great on the ball, and great at reading the game. You also need forwards who are highly energetic and all-rounded as you'll often have only 4 players on the attack and no more. So far, we don't have another team like what we had in 2006-2009. As a result, we can't afford to play di Maria in central midfield as he's too risky and attack-minded for that role. He's pretty much suited for the final third with his attributes. He's perfect as a winger as he can always take his man on and try to create chances. He'll be frustrating and inconsistent if he's to play as a rigid winger who just stays out wide and crosses the ball in (IMO, only Beckham has performed that role well enough). Like many world class wingers, he should be given the freedom to cut in as that extra freedom will help make him perform better. If people want to see him make driving runs, he can do that from out wide as he's shown many times in the past. His pace, dynamism, and energy can be of great use in moving around and disorganising defences. Him playing in an area where making mistakes won't be costly will be good for him as well as good for the team. Besides, he mostly looks to cross the ball in, anyways, rather than play players into key areas as playmakers do.

If di Maria is to be at his best, he needs to be given the freedom to play his direct, attacking game. Given that he's not a regular goalscorer or efficient user of the ball, he's at his best when playing as a winger, and I don't mean as a rigid winger like Valencia, but as a free winger like Reus, Lucas, Nani, or Hazard.

4175~~~
Good post.

4176~~~
We'd need to sign a Carrick replacement long term but I reckon that team would annihilate most.  I'm dieing to see Wilson play that inside forward role.

4177~~~
Great post.

<b>EDIT:</b>

However, let's not forget that, although Di Maria played wide, he was actually give the chance to roam inside, with Januzaj keeping the width. 

Below are heats maps of the three games we played Di Maria on the wing.

<b>Di Maria vs Palace</b>

Now, if you compare that to Januzaj, it seems that Di Maria was actually asked to be a roaming winger, whilst as I said before, Januzaj focused on keeping the width and stretching play.

4178~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80898, @mazhar13" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80898/">@mazhar13</a> I don't think when he has played out wide this season he has strict specific instruction that he must stay there, but the angles and time on the ball are a lot less so than he regularly amounts through the centre. As we are a side (at the minute) who seek to retain as much possession as we can by absorbing it in the middle/tip of our own half, Di Maria when out wide rarely gets a sniff. He's also not really able to act as the catalyst in the tempo, as he has to wait for the ball to come to him. He's also double - if not triple - marked out wide, and that reacts in him being even more of a rash and wasteful manner than before. He isn't given the space and freedom to burst forward as he can centrally, which really dents his game.

And it's all well and good branding him the lease of a free winger, but who in our squad has the ability to interchange positions fluidly during a game? Maybe Januzaj and Herrera, and those two don't play very frequently. It works well for someone like Hazard as Oscar, Willian (now Cuadrado) and even Costa really like to move around the field. Our front line and midfield is a little too rigid.

There ya go!

4180~~~
You ignore reality. Di Maria played as winger for several seasons and he was never worldclass in this role. He is a good, maybe a very good winger, but that’s about it. His favored playing style is also in conflict with LvG´s tactics. Di Maria likes to take risks and loses the ball a lot while making up for it with his tenaciousness/energy/hustle. LvG on the other hand fancies almost the exact opposite.

Di Maria didn’t turn into a bad player but he is the wrong player for the current philosophy. It just reaffirms my view that he was a panic transfer. (same as Mata/Falcao).

4181~~~
Being able to drive through space in midfield and commit players is one of the most dangerous assets you can have in football. That's why he was one of the best players in the world last season, and to restrict him to playing on the wing, in my opinion, would be criminal. Taking players on in that area of the pitch requires a different skill set and it would limit what he brings to the side, he can play there occasionally due to availability of other players, but primarily he needs to be in midfield.

4182~~~
Such a brilliant player when played LCM. Has the freedom of the left flank to run into when he pleases. 

He simply has to play in this position.

4183~~~
Playing well and interchanging with Mata in the LM/AM role effortlessly.

4184~~~
Much better thus far. Seems to be influencing the game in a big way and creating. Good to see.

4185~~~
Not a surprise to see him playing nice football with Mata. They both play football the 'right way'.

4186~~~
brilliant today

4187~~~
Excellent so far, should always play in this position.

4188~~~
I, for one, am shocked to see that he's much better in midfield.

4189~~~
So he played in midfield, Rooney up top and Mata in behind the two strikers?

4190~~~
I think it's the last thing that any of us expected.

4191~~~
or

4192~~~
Fellaini up top Rooney in midfield.

4193~~~
I, for two, am as well.

4194~~~
Play him in that position every game and it boosts our chances of winning games, it's as simple as that. I'll go mad if LVG starts fecking him about again.

4195~~~
Ahh okay, thanks

4196~~~
He's been much improved in the last two games. It's a bit daft I know, but playing players in their best positions does tend to lead to a positive outcome.

4197~~~
Ðefinitely better in his last few games, but these performances have come against very poor opposition. Must be good for his confidence though.

4198~~~
I like your choice of Ð instead of D.

4199~~~
Looking a lot better since moving in midfield, final ball is a bit lacking at times though.

4200~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a>

He was only a free-roaming winger against Crystal Palace. Otherwise, against West Brom, Chelsea, and Man. City, he was pretty much playing at the wide channel with rare forays into the middle.

<a class="username" data-user="69549, @DWelbz19" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69549/">@DWelbz19</a>

You also brought up another reason why both Januzaj and di Maria struggled in the 4-1-4-1: lack of support from the midfielders and a slow tempo. There were barely any quick transitions back then, and our midfielders would frequently rush into the box rather than support the wingers.

In terms of your second point, you saw the match against Cambridge and how the players interchanged seamlessly. This is what I mean about his game. You could see him do well at beating players from out wide and creating chances there as well as coming into the middle to get involved on the ball.

<a class="username" data-user="79874, @PedroMendez" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79874/">@PedroMendez</a> <a class="username" data-user="78385, @ChrisG11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78385/">@ChrisG11</a> 

In Real Madrid, di Maria may have had frustrating moments of play, but he was still a quality player who was a dangerous attacking outlet. Back then, it was C. Ronaldo who was hogging all of the media attention under Mourinho with almost everyone else not being recognised for their good performances. I remember several di Maria performances for Real Madrid where he won matches for Real Madrid from out wide, and I do remember that he was still seen as a world class winger back in those days and not like Nani has been viewed here for much of his time. Out wide, di Maria was a great threat, even if he did make some baffling decisions.

From what I've been seeing of di Maria recently, I'm glad to see him be more efficient on the ball and not as wasteful as he used to be. Against Cambridge, he did quite well in not losing the ball from midfield areas whilst remaining an attacking threat in the final third. If he is to play as a pseudo-central midfielder without as much protection, he'll need to be less careless in midfield, and he's starting to improve on that aspect.

4201~~~
This is true, but it's was only a home game against a fairly knackered Cambridge. We'll have to see if the side can keep it up.

4202~~~
It was the same against Leceister, too, though his final ball was worse in that match than in this match.

4203~~~
Not Di Maria, I meant the sides ability to interchange. The players will feel less of a luxury in a more competitive game and play in a more conservative manner.

4204~~~
I know. I meant that we've been doing such a thing for a while, even against Leceister. It's not as if this is the first time we've played like this. We've done this many times, but we didn't play at a quick enough tempo to take advantage of this.

Back to di Maria. I'm quite happy to see him do much better with his final deliveries this time around. Yes, it's Cambridge, but he was poor in his final pass against Leceister. It's good to see that this was just a mere blip.

4205~~~
maybe <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> can comment on that. 

My impression is, that he had only few wordclass performances out wide. Overall his finishing was poor and he was lacking end-product in front of the goal. He also went missing in several games. His numbers look way better than his actual contribution.

4206~~~
Well, that was better. Nowhere near our best player though. Which is the level he should be aiming for. Won't get many easier games to show us what he's got either. Still, early days.

4207~~~
Definitely our best attacking player I would say.

4208~~~
In terms of influence, not much between him, Mata and (oh yes) Fellaini. Did finish strongly though and put savage whip on his corners. Which was nice.

4209~~~
Good performance, I think we may have something with him and Mata interchanging between LM and AM all throughout the game.

4210~~~
Problem with Di Maria is expectations are massive. We want him ripping teams apart (especially the likes of Cambridge) with incredible defence-piercing runs and he ought to be peppering the opponent's goal with shots in every game. And to be fair, considering the price tag, such expectations are valid.

Don't think he's doing too badly, but does need to create more.

4211~~~
That's been the biggest disappointment for me. 

In his first few games he was putting in some great crosses but has created very little in recent months. An occasional clever little dink over the top but much more likely to go for glory himself. Can't actually remember the last really good cross he's made in open play and not sure we've ever seen the deadly through balls that his Madrid highlights are full of.

I hope it's all just debut season nerves. Trying too hard to prove a point. When he's a bit more settled he might become more of a team player.

4212~~~
Has a look on his face at times that says "what the hell am I doing here?!?!" 
He'd move in a heartbeat! He won't be here long term and I don't think I'm that arsed. I haven't really warmed to him at all. 

Still though, he's been better recently

4213~~~
Living in the Lowry now apparently....

4214~~~
Same feelings here. Hope I'm wrong but I wouldn't be surprised to see him depart at season's end, especially if we don't make the top 4.

4215~~~
Jesus, he's not departing at the seasons end. We've just signed him.

Some of you live in a ridiculously negative fantasy land.

4216~~~
To be fair, he would have went to PSG ahead of us

4217~~~
Have to say, I agree with that. He's a world class player but I can't help thinking that he'd rather be elsewhere. Hopefully that's not the case.

4218~~~
Jesus christ get over yourselves.

4219~~~
I get this too. 

It's like how Ozil looked last season. He kind of looks underwhelmed.

4220~~~
Relax <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4221~~~
I am relaxed, its you fretting about nothing.

4222~~~
I'm not fretting mate <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I said in my post I'm not arsed either way.

4223~~~
Who the hell cares though? he came here and we've achieved far more as a club than moneybags PSG. I don't see the point in bringing it up time and time again as if 'lowly' Manchester United are lucky to have acquired such a player.

4224~~~
Em OK....I was just saying he would have went to PSG before he came here so I wouldn't be surprised to see him move again.

Wasn't on about achievements or calling anyone lowly.....

4225~~~
I wasn't speaking about you specifically, but it's been brought up a few times on this thread now and the posts above certainly word like we're a lesser club. We've had much better players than Di Maria playing for us.

4226~~~
Ah right. Wasn't paying much attention to those posts.

I'm personally not arsed about Di Maria. I haven't warmed to him at all and he hasn't been worth the money we've paid for him so far imo.
Nani comes to mind anytime I see him these days

4227~~~
Not sure why'd he'd leave now.

4228~~~
Can't see how people think he will leave at the end of the season. He is only hear a year and it would take a crazy fee for us to sell. Not sure what makes people think he is unhappy either.

4229~~~
I think he will be much better next year for us especially if we are in Champions league. He will have been used to the league and would get a proper pre season under his belt with us. LVG just needs to be consistent with where he plays him I think

4230~~~
I'd be relieved if he left. Haven't taken to him at all and he just feels like a mercenary that would rather be elsewhere. Fecking hate signing Madrids cast-offs.

It might be daft but I valued the way we operated as a club under Fergie, it's all I've ever known since I was young. This signing went against all that.

4231~~~
Sneijder en Robben did quite well for their new clubs despite being Madrid cast-offs. I would love Di Maria to have a similair impact.

4232~~~
Robben yeah, Sneijder had one good season.

4233~~~
Veron?

4234~~~
Yes you're spot on with this, reckon he, and Shaw will be loads better next season, both have had injuries, and both need a good bit of time to bed in and in Di Maria's case get used to the league, not a chance Di Maria will be sold as people are suggesting, maybe in 2 years but not this summer.

4235~~~
Him leaving in the summer is one of the dumbest thing i have heard. To me he looks energetic and always run alot to press opposition, but he needs time to bed in like almost every new player and next year i think he will push on and show us why we bought him for 60m. He haven't been bad either this season, but playing out of position is doing him no good.

It is worth noting that in the 5 appearances he has played in CM he has scored 3 goals and assisted 3 goals, that is pretty good i would say.

4236~~~
Why are people saying he will be leaving?

4237~~~
Welcome to RedCafe.

4238~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> will we have any players next season?

4239~~~
Genuinley curious as we bought him just 6 months ago. He's a class player that cost us a lot of money and is someone who can help win us titles down the road, yet some posters think he'll be off in a few months?

4240~~~
Yep.

4241~~~
He isn't leaving any time soon, Even if we did sell him, I'd doubt we would even break even on his transfer fee unless PSG really really wanted him.

4242~~~
Relieved if he left!? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


Some of you better get used to the idea of mercenaries signing for Manchester United, this is the era we live in. We're no more attractive than City, and that's the hard truth.

4243~~~
Jesus, wanting our best player to leave because he came to us from a club who were doing better than us at the time and that instantly brands him a mercenary.

4244~~~
Lazio weren't Real Madrid and you still felt that he had a lot to prove at the highest level and that we were a step up that he earned.

A lot of players turn us down to go to Madrid, so I'd rather they never got the chance again. We have a lot to offer players and we can make superstars out of them if they're good enough, I'd rather that privilege went to players that dream of getting the chance and are willing to work their bollocks off for it, rather than some primadonna that Madrid turns players into.

4245~~~
Cuz he's not running up and down the pitch with a smile on his face.

4246~~~
Bullshit. There's literally millions of footballers that would love to play here. Di Marias desire to come here has been questionable since day one. 

Why not try and find the next big thing and get them here, something that served us well enough for decades. It's not sustainable for us to keep bringing in players like Di Maria on such huge money.

4247~~~
There's literally millions of footballers that would love to play for City too.

Di Maria won't be the last mercenary here, neither is he the first.

4248~~~
You want us to stick to signing players for around £20 million? Because SAF left with his last few signings being Smalling, Jones, Zaha, Young etc. Same players everyone moans about now.

Then there was RVP who was a short term signing. Worth it for the title, but still.

Also we signed both Rojo and Blind each for under £20 million btw...

4249~~~
Not spending big on footballers cost us players like Hazard, so feck that. You do what you must to get the best. I'm not saying we need to constantly pump up megabucks for superstars, but the idea that you should have a limit of £20m per player or something is crazy. I mean why? Pride or something?

It's not like it's one or the other either, as was said above, look at Blind and Rojo.

4250~~~
I feel little affiliation to di Maria, which is strange, but I know he's a joy to watch at times and an incredibly important player for us going forward. I'll enjoy his time here with us. Feeling relieved if he left is beyond ridiculous though, especially with the club in the state it is.

4251~~~
Good? I would call it a perfect season. He was very important in winning the league, the cl and a cup more than just good. He was also (in my opinion) the best and most important player at the wc that year although thats international and not club football.

After that treble season he wasnt bad either but ofcourse he couldnt recreate that perfect season.

4252~~~
Never change, redcafe.

4253~~~
Of course we are more attractive than City. Most footballers hadn't even heard of them 10 years ago.

4254~~~
Not anymore we're not, fact. Half these lads we sign nowadays couldn't give a shite about ten years ago.

4255~~~
I don't even buy into that shit about RVP being worth it for the title. He's probably going to cost us £50 mill or so in total, for one player. How is that worth one league title? He's been bang average ever since.

And your list of players that Fergie made is incredibly selective.

4256~~~
How is it a fact? Just because you state it as a fact, it doesn't make it one.

City are bankrolled by multiple billionaires, they have to pay obscene money to make these players think twice about going there.

4257~~~
Kind of like how we thickened di Maria's pockets so the lack of Champions League football wasn't an issue? United's and City's transfer business is closer to each other nowadays more so than they ever.

4258~~~
Yeah, and wasn't that the point I was making to begin with? He's a mercenary that didnt give a shit about us a year ago. He even seemed to want to go to PSG over us when he had the chance. Why we bother with players like that is beyond me. I've seen plenty of posters say they can't take to him and this is the reason why.

4259~~~
That's the way it's going. I remember when Shaw was linked with both us and Chelsea and was apparently a Chelsea fan as a boy. It then hit me that he was 7 when Abramovich took over, and they've been title challengers for likely as long as he can remember. Obviously City have a way to go, especially in Europe, but they're not going away. It's been 7 years since their takeover, a long time in the mind of a 22 year old man with no affiliation to United for example. It isn't just about money anymore. It won't be long before you've got 17 year olds saying they idolised Yaya and their earliest memory is the 3-2 QPR game.

4260~~~
That's just a load of crap.

4261~~~
Like I said above, I feel little love for di Maria, but I at least know he's an incredible footballer. Relief when he leaves is ridiculous.

4262~~~
It isn't if you think about it, sorry.

4263~~~
Like I said, it might just be me with such a stance. Though others have said they can't take to him. For me, personally, it takes the enjoyment out of it. No matter how well he does, it'll just be a case of "well yeah, we've paid enough for it". Any success he has will feel hollow to me.

4264~~~
If United and City are offering a player the same terms, We are 100% a more attractive destination, The fact you even think we aren't is hilarious man. Arguably the biggest club on the planet, 20x Champions compared to a team that can't fill a 45,000 seater stadium and haven't got a single CL title to their name and will fall right back of the face of this Earth if FFP continues.

Ceterus Parabus, we should be a lot more attractive to players compared to Man City.

4265~~~
Agree somewhat. But still, he's world class, lets enjoy his time here?

4266~~~
Do you really believe that right now? Honestly? Things change very quickly but come on... Think about it. Really think about it. Take the rose tinted shades off and really think about it.

4267~~~
Exactly, it's Citys money that makes them attractive.

4268~~~
Winning trophies kind of helps too. And they do win trophies these days.

4269~~~
I'd love to, but I just don't seem to be able to. When we all used to take the piss out of City and Chelsea for signing mercenaries and having to pay big money to convince them, I actually meant it. Others have flip-flopped on that stance massively these last 2 years, getting excited about Woodward needing to make a marquee/statement signing etc.

4270~~~
I suppose we're never happy. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We bemoaned the clubs lack of movement for top class players in the transfer market for years. Many of us wanted Woodward out. The big signings finally come and we label 'em mercenaries.

4271~~~
I also don't get why people are so angry he would've chosen PSG, I mean, who wouldn't right now, quite frankly? Top of their league, CL football, and most of all, located in Paris. It's not like it's an insult to the club that he would have, a lot of players would, I'm just happy they couldn't afford him. I'd say it'd be a different story if he was choosing between us and them if it was similar to our situation two years ago, i.e. top of the league and in the CL.

4272~~~
Yes I do believe that. No red tinted glasses here, I'm looking at this objectively, and there should be absolutely no reason if all things are equal, City being even remotely close to us in attracting players.

As for trophies, we won 2 trophies in 2013 and have a very good chance of winning a record breaking 12th FA cup. It's not like we are on some Arsenal level trophy drought lol.

4273~~~
They're not equal though. City are in the Champions League and competing for the league. We are not.

4274~~~
We seem to be getting into this whole "bigger club" discussion again but anyway - players look at the future much more than fans, who look at the past.

The reasons United fans will give for players choosing us (money being equal) are our history, our trophies, and the number of spectators.
Players are more bothered about who's winning tomorrow, not who won yesterday. And City are just as likely to win trophies as us in the near future (perhaps more so)

Plus the fact that a handful of huge names have spent four or five years at City (and not just a year or two before leaving) is definitely increasing their profile. They're seen as a club for big players.

4275~~~
We're sounding more like the Liverpool fans we mocked by the week.

4276~~~
As I said before, players don't give a shit about the history of a club.

4277~~~
Exactamundo.

4278~~~
Who did I miss out? Kagawa? Hernandez? Obviously De Gea was a very good signing, but that's not the point. Blind and Rojo could be very good signings as well, and so far they have done well.

4279~~~
Saw only the highlights of our last game and he seemed to create or play a big part in the majority of our chances.

4280~~~
I thought everyone was just saying it to piss off their fans but didn't actually care too much about it? Its a player going to play football for money at the end of the day. There are a handful of things they care about: their wages, potential success with the club and their role in the team, and the city they live in. Very rarely does history play a part. Hell, if we weren't successful all those years, do you think Giggs and scholes would have stayed here their whole careers? No chance IMO.

4281~~~
I never had a problem with any club paying big money for top players, it's the source of the money I ridicule. 

Oil money vs Revenue built on the back of years of success.

4282~~~
Was ronaldo a mercenary or did he love the club?

4283~~~
I've seen Di Maria be the best and most exciting player on teams with Ronaldo Messi and Bale. Tells you something.

4284~~~
I don't think that's true. Some, maybe. And with United you're not talking ancient history anyway. 70k stadium, full every weekend. For a lot of footballers that's a really big deal. We're not a bigger draw than Barca or Madrid but clearly a step up from City or PSG.

4285~~~
As is always the case, damned if you do, and damned if you don't. Criticize Glazers for years for being thrifty [despite Ferguson and Gill taking pleasure in splashing silly money and wages on average Joes like Young, Valencia, Bebe etc], then criticize the club for signing a top player, Lol. It's 2015 lads, times have changed, Ferguson is no longer manager and that uniqueness about us is now gone, we are like any other club out there, if we want top players, we have to pay top money, and Woodward gets it. Is there any glory in mediocrity or what, I don't get this mentality. Di Maria is class and we need top players to attract other top players, he'll settle down and starts deliering very soon, then everyone will forget his transfer fee.

4286~~~
Can't believe theres people here saying they don't want real madrid cast offs reffering to him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

On his day he's top 5/6 players in the world and people calling him a mercenary for commanding such a high fee and wages with his reputation is daft. He's joined a squad that's rebuilding in every sense from players to playing style. He'll obviously come good once we have settled.

4287~~~
In summary, if we buy players for huge fees, they're mercenaries, if we buy players for lower fees, they're not good enough for us and whichever we club we buy the player from we are only getting them because they are those clubs cast-offs . Ok follow this line of reasoning... NOT!

4288~~~
Yes we are, fact.

Why did RVP turn down City then? I know things have changed since with SAF going and us struggling last season but we are still a far more prestigious club. Thanks to FFP they can no longer blow us out of the water financially so that's one less advantage of going there over us. You else get to play in front of £75,000+ week in, week out at OT. City struggle to sell out the Etihad. The only thing City can offer us this season that we can't is CL football and I expect that to change next year along with us being title challengers.

4289~~~
I dunno. Isn't it pretty well documented that Di Maria wanted to go to PSG but they couldn't do the deal? I think money will trump most things.

4290~~~
Well that's what PSG were claiming. Whether it's true or not I don't know. Ballague seemed fairly clued in on this transfer and IIRC he never mentioned PSG. Di Maria himself said Ronaldo played a big role in him coming here. 

I completely agree about money being a huge factor. Part of my point was that City can no longer trump us in that regard. If anything we can probably offer better wages then them these days.

4291~~~
All things being equal, it probably will. Mind you, we can't assume all players are motivated by the same things. I'm sure there's a lot of players out there who would be willing to earn slightly less to play in a packed Old Trafford every week, instead of < 50k fans in the Parc des Princes. Not to mention the relative prestige of the two leagues. Although that will depend massively on where they're brought up.

4292~~~
Who said he wanted PSG? Haven't seen those comments but I assume they come from the player himself?

4293~~~
Because of Ferguson.

4294~~~
That's definitely how it was for me. Plus I genuinely wanted us to sign a good number of the players who then moved to the moneybags - Aguero, Silva, Mata, Hazard, etc.

Obviously the motivations are different for each player, but most of them are trying to act as professionally as possible. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Dunno about Scholes and Giggs though, there's a difference in players' motivations when they grow up at the club they supported as a kid (at least there used to be...).

4295~~~
di Maria is our best player, and we should build a system which helps him, not hinders him.

4296~~~
Living in Paris is a huge draw. Unfortunately that probably supersedes our significantly better footballing pedigree for many players.

4297~~~
You're probably right. Paris is a weird one. One of the most impressive cities in Europe but feck alll footballing heritage.

4298~~~
Personally feel it's massively biased and short sighted to suggest we're more attractive than City right now. It's actually a laughable opinion.

4299~~~
Like feck is it laughable. Even if we ignore reputation, heritage, size of stadium and attendance at games how's about we look at the respective records in the CL of the two clubs? Even under David Fecking Moyes we went deeper in the competition than City have ever done, in their entire history and it took a farcical display from Bayern Munich to stop them getting knocked out in the group stages again this season. That's going to be an issue for players coming from the continent.

4300~~~
We're not even in the competition!

4301~~~
We're not talking about who was more attractive last summer!

Obviously, a club that can offer CL football with have the edge over one that doesn't. If United can get back in the top four then their record in the competition will make them a much more appealing prospect than City, barring some sort of amazing run from them this spring.

4302~~~
Quite sure we will be when it comes to bringing players in again.

4303~~~
Us not being in the Champions League is obviously not the norm and by next season order will have been restored.

4304~~~
My comment said right now, not last summer.

4305~~~
I would agree, definitely. 

But my original point still stands. There's very little between ourselves and City nowadays when it comes to attracting players, as the majority of 'em couldn't care less about our history.

4306~~~
We still have the glamour of being a big club, a legendary one in fact. That's a big pull for some players IMO.

4307~~~
It probably is to some, but definitely not all. Look at the likes of Silva and Aguero.

Sport are saying that Di Maria might be off at the end of the season. Don't know how reliable they are but it could just be assumptions due to the burglary.

4309~~~
A club would have to pay more than what we paid last summer to sign him, in my opinion, so don't see him going anywhere.

4310~~~
The only reason Silva and Aguero are at City is because SAF didnt want to pay the fees required to get them....same goes for Hazard at Chelsea. Now that we are paying market rates for players we are a bigger draw IMO.

4311~~~
I disagree because we're not in Europe and not in the title race, but things can change very quickly.

4312~~~
Back to Real in exchange for Bale........

4313~~~
The funny thing about that is, they didn't even go for ridiculous fees. Aguero, Toure and Silva were all a steal. If we had of forked out for at least one of those players, we'd be a lot better off right now.

4314~~~
Right now? The transfer window is closed. The next time a player has to decide between the two clubs there's a decent chance both of them will be in the CL. So what's laughable about saying United might be a more attractive prospect?

4315~~~
I don't see how the current situation is relevant when it comes to attracting players. By the time the transfer window opens we'll probably have qualified for the Champions League.

4316~~~
Footballers are like dogs they will go to whoever is holding the bigger biscuit.

4317~~~
A transfer window closed less than a week ago.

4318~~~
Its stupid to generalize the way you are.

4319~~~
Strange, I thought we signed 6 players last summer including ADM with no CL to offer them, or maybe it was my imagination

4320~~~
Silva, aguero and Hazard would all go for 2-3 times the amount they were bought for initially.

SAF didnt anticipate the inflation of the market and we were slow to react to the flow of oil money into the game.... this coupled with the fact that we never seemed to buy big from a position of power has all lead us into the position we are in today. It will take a few transfer windows to sort it out but we are on the right path.

4321~~~
If anything, his comment is silly precisely to the extent that it <i>isn't  </i>general enough; because people gravitate towards better wages in all walks of life, not just football. This should be a reason to be optimistic for United fans, rather than not.

4322~~~
Thought loyalty oaths went out in the 1950s.  Not sure what we want from players-pass a test on United's history?

From what I've seen AdM plays hard and is finding his footing with the team.  Happy he's here.

4323~~~
It depends on the clubs in question. Pretty sure quite a few footballers would pick the likes of Real, Barca, Bayern and us over most other clubs even if the wages offered are slightly lower. The key here is the other club in question and the difference in wages offered.

4324~~~
I'm sure there are some exceptions to the rule. The empirical test for this fact is fairly simple though; if indeed you could attract quality players with history, prestige, fan base etc. the clubs that you've mentioned would be bloody fools to not spend <i>less</i> money on wages. But they don't. In fact, all of those clubs are at the very top when it comes to wage spending. Go figure.

As a corollary, see if you can guess whether the next superstar choosing his future would rather pick AC Milan or City.

4325~~~
Well next time a rival company offers you double for the job you do, tell them "No! I do not care how much I earn, I'm loyal to my employer, even if he pays me less than what you are offering I will work for him."

I mean Angel probably lives a lavish life, he spends a lot on those close to him, he looks after them, he wants them to live in as much luxury as they can and that's his right like anybody else's, he also has a short career and what he earns must sustain not just during his lifetime but be passed down to his kids and grandkids too, he has every right to play for the club that will pay him the most for his services.

He's a contracter, we know what he offers and we also know he will do his best to provide that service, either we want it or we don't, if we do then we will have to pay more than others for it. This isn't just football, this is the world, I mean we pay Young 120k per week, Anderson has earned a fortune for doing so little, it's the way things work, Wayne Rooney is no different.

If Anderson cared about playing football he would have left long ago! He has stayed for the money.

Do you think Rooney is here because he loves the club? He is here because we were willing to pay him more than Chelsea, he doesn't even care about becoming the club's all-time top scorer, he cares about the cash money.

And what about Louis van Gaal? This is the same person who left AZ Alkamaar for a high paying job, he wanted to become Sunderland's manager because the job would pay well but as it was they chose Steve Bruce over him, eventually FC Bayern came calling and things worked out well for him in the end, he almost did the treble in his first season, after that he took a dutch side expected to get knocked out in the group stages to the semi-finals of the world cup, not that Steve Bruce couldn't do that.

I don't blame Louis van Gaal for wanting a high paying job, he had lost millions to Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme, the point is though his wage was very important in where he went after AZ.

4326~~~
I had a thought, if we offered Lucas Silva more money than Real Madrid, perhaps like 25% more in wages and agent fees, would he sign for us?

4327~~~
What about Reus? If we offer him far more than Madrid surely he would seriously consider us?

I'm not saying we should, a players worth however will vary because he might be far more valuable to us than Madrid, if Louis van Gaal decides to go 4-3-3 with Angel di Maria as LCM and not to sign Falcao then he will have money available (well he has that anyway but even more), he will need high level wide players and he might identify Reus as a target.

Reus would be very important to us and so our valuation of him might be higher than Madrid's and we might be willing to pay more for his services.

Furthermore a player of Reus' ability would cost a fortune but because of his situation he might go for less than what players of comparable quality tend to go for, I would happily pay him a massive signing on fee on the basis that his transfer cost is far below his 'market value', that is to say if we want comparable quality from another club it will probably cost us a fortune anyway and even by paying Reus this huge signing on fee we will end up paying less in total than if we were buying comparable quality from other clubs.

And I don't care if he is a mercenary, I'd sooner he be wearing a united shirt than madrid, call him whatever names you want.

4328~~~
Reus has had his injury problems, I also think he's a bit of a softy so I'm unsure he'd be suited to the Premier League.

4329~~~
I'm not sure how that's history, though? I mean, sure, the stadium was built in the past, but ...

And yeah, we're a step up from City and PSG, <i>when</i> we can offer CL football.

4330~~~
Poor guy had his house nearly broken into as well. LVG did say Di Maria wanted to play against Cambridge though, which is good.

4331~~~
Poor. Again.

4332~~~
Nani

4333~~~
He's only player who is creating anything for us. Not sure how you can single him out.

4334~~~
Should be taken off now, that was unbelievably poor. Completely useless today.

4335~~~
I don't know why people complain about Phil Jones taking corners when Di Maria is possibly the worst corner taker I've ever seen in my life.

4336~~~
He was by far our worst player in that half.

4337~~~
I'm tired of this now, awful signing.

4338~~~
He is surrounded by non threatening players and has all the responsibility to create out of nothing...

4339~~~
Are you joking? He's been absolutely appalling.

4340~~~
Just doesn't look up for it. Clearly not as good a player as we all thought he was six months ago.

4341~~~
his corners were poor but he is providing drive from midfield and dribbling from midfield.

4342~~~
He isn't arsed. His Heart is not in it

4343~~~
I really don't what your watching. He is the only attacking player who is doing anything what so ever! Easily the best out of some very poor performances.

4344~~~
He is our lone threat going forwards. Our two strikers are just too slow and static to cause any sort of problems against our opponents. This has been a recurring theme. We can't afford to field Falcao and RVP in the same lineup unless we are at Old Trafford. ADM and Janujaz should be flanking RVP/Rooney and that will see us create a lot more chances and have a lot more balance in midfield/defence.

4345~~~
Can't be said enough how much Modric, Alonso, Ronaldo and Bale helped Di Maria reach his absolute best last season.

4346~~~
Really didn't think he was worth it at the time and still don't. Serious question, would anyone take £40 million for him if a team like PSG offered it? If It was Nani out there, he'd be getting crucified by our fans.

4347~~~
Yeah, losing the ball constantly - that half assed effort that led to Rojo getting booked where he lost it simply and did nothing to try win it back was a highlight of his ineptitude in the first half. I'm not alone in seeing how bad he has been, thankfully.

4348~~~
Playing well.

4349~~~
A stretch of poor form, way too early to judge the signing one way or the other (obviously the price was a bit too high) Rooney has been through a number of periods like it where nothing works for him. We saw at the start of the season how good he can be, we desperately need him to get back to those levels soon.

4350~~~
For being one of the top 10 attacking players in the world, his first touch is poor

4351~~~
fecking hell, people blaming him for the fact our "midfield" has hardly had a touch of the ball? He can hardly do anything when they are controlling the whole game.

And we all know he is bad at corners. Doesn't mean he's not arsed or playing poorly just because his corners aren't good. It's just baffling we keep him on them. 

The only time we look like doing anything progressive is when he gets the ball.

4352~~~
True. But from the first 8 months he's been so poor, playing like a worse Nani. Apart from the first few games against big teams like Leicester, QPR and Everton he's been awful.

4353~~~
Lost the ball a few times, less then januzaj, Rooney, falcao or van Persie probably. Only playet to track back on the one counter attack to save us when Valencia was 1 on 1 with Valencia, but of course, he can't be arsed. Had our only good shot in the game as well. Maybe we should fecking get the ball to him if we want him to make an impact, not have him defend the whole game.

4354~~~
He's not a top 10 attacker though.

4355~~~
A lot of previous criticism has been off mark but he's been complete garbage so far

4356~~~
I don't think he's lost it less than any of them to be honest, but I don't know the exact stats. He gave it away quite a few times. I hope he turns it around in the 2nd half but I wouldn't be at all sad to see him taken off.

4357~~~
Then why did we spend on him like he's a top 5 player in any position? He clearly is considered that

4358~~~
Not for much longer, though.

4359~~~
First second half involvement? Gives it away. Again. I guess you probably missed that too, in a nice attacking position.

4360~~~
Well if he comes off then we definitely won't score. Our only player who has looked remotely dangerous despite not playing that well. The problem is the other players around him, its idiotic to play with 3 strikers and the other midfielder being a 19 year old winger. Or 20 now. Di maria and everyone else will look better if we put on a couple of actual midfielders in there so we can actually start controlling the game and give di maria the ball. He's feeding off scraps.

4361~~~
We've successfully brought him down to our level.

4362~~~
Terrible performances off late..

4363~~~
He's been shit for a while now. I don't understand  how/why.

4364~~~
Shadow of the player who was excellent for Madrid last season.

4365~~~
Definitely not what i expected after £60 million and demanding the #7 shirt.

4366~~~
Looks very uninterested of late. If another club comes for him in the summer he'd push for a move, I reckon. Not sure there would be many candidates for that price though.

4367~~~
He has been poor and I have to say it is all because of Van gaal and our management team. My fear that he will slowly assimilate to our style of football is coming to reality. Van gaal should have never tinkered with what was working early on in the season despite having static strikers.

4368~~~
This is a guy who looked a certain to depart when Bale came in but was determined to stick around and prove himself. He did so, became arguably their best performer and his reward was to be shipped out to a team in transition. I can see why he perhaps comes across as looking like he doesn't want to be here.

4369~~~
Fact is we have signed a bunch of players this summer. It's like when a club like City started off by buying all players on the market that were any good at all, stuff like Wayne Bridge. So it's hard to know if it's just the player himself or the miss match of players in the club. I think we won't be successful with all our signings, but Di Maria is definitely better than this.

4370~~~
Isn't this more of a negative than positive for us?

4371~~~
Counter attack in acres of space; takes him about 30 metres to fully get the ball under control, by which time he has to double back and pass to the full back.

Seconds later, pulls out of an 80-20 challenge in his own favour.

4372~~~
Yes. My general thoughts is that we had our pants pulled down for this signing. We were desperate but as has shown we don't know how to get the best out of him. Plus that fee puts pressure on him to produce a goal or assist every game and that has brought a selfish attitude to that game.

4373~~~
All thanks to Jorge Mendes.

4374~~~
The comparison with Ozil can be made. Both at their best when other players taking the headlines.

4375~~~
Ozil seems to be getting his groove back

4376~~~
SHITE FREE KICK GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

4377~~~
sad to say it - but he is turning out to be one of the biggest flops of the season. Scary considering how he started

4378~~~
Has looked woeful today, very expensive buy at 59 million, not sure if he will ever hit the heights here.. 45 mil + Lucas moura and psg can have him.

4379~~~
Yep. Other players raising their game which takes the pressure off. Now with Sanchez and Cazorla, plus even with Welbeck he has like minded players to play with. He isn't a player to take a game by the scruff of the neck which he was unfairly criticized for last season.

4380~~~
He is not a 60MM player.. He is like how Ronaldo was with us when he was 18-19

4381~~~
It is Van gaal fault for turning him to this average player. I would not call him a flop because his performance is being affected by our management team.

4382~~~
sorry LvG - this is enough for me. I want you gone after the season.

4383~~~
I'm sorry, but he's a bit of a pussy.

4384~~~
I'm sick to death of seeing him back away from the ball.

4385~~~
Is there a worse corner taker in the league?

4386~~~
Someone please explain those corners to me?

4387~~~
Hope they kept the receipt

4388~~~
Torres level flop. Dreadful footballer. He had one good season at Madrid and they knew it and wanted to cash in, and we were so desperate to make a big signing we lapped that shit up.

4389~~~
He was amazing last season.

Dreadful footballer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4390~~~
Hope he's dropped for the next game.

4391~~~
Even if he doesn't deliver on the pitch, he's still fulfilled half his purpose - to be the marquee signing Woodward was desperate for.

4392~~~
If we can get our money back I'll put him on my back and carry him to Paris.

4393~~~
Would be nice if we tried to freshen things up next time. ADM and Falcao deserve to be dropped. Mata and Herrera to replace them.

4394~~~
He was good last season, yes. I said as much. He was mediocre for the two or three seasons before that. He played above his level for one season and we spunked a British record fee on him.

4395~~~
Careful mate, you'll hurt your knee.

4396~~~
He's fecking pathetic. Pussying out of challenges all game and his delivery most of the time is crap.

He gets the ball and he always does one of two things:

1. Runs really fast until he has enough room to send in a whipped but low cross that gets cleared by the first man.
2. Tries to dribble with it, realises there's too many people, stops, turns around and gets muscled off it which leads to an opposition counter attack.

4397~~~
That was a genuinely woeful performance today. I haven't seen him play at that level for us until today (either I've been oblivious to it or he really did hit a real low).

4398~~~
He was genuinely up there with Ronaldo last season and he became available.

4399~~~
Having him and Falcao is like playing with 9 men at the moment. Maybe worse, as Di Maria seems determined to give the ball straight to the opposition to set them on counterattacks.

I'm shocked to be honest. Always thought he had more bottle than this.

4400~~~
Not just back away. He was twiddling his thumbs so many times after he lost the ball. No vigor, no fight. Falcao may be poor but he is giving his absolute all. Di Maria seems to be cruising through.

4401~~~
Wahey! I'm not the only one saying it. He's been terrible. We got sold a dud. Pogue's been saying that for months, among many other people, I've just finally realised that they're right.

4402~~~
Nani was never as bad as that tbh

4403~~~
He was absolute pish today, likewise for our other star attackers. Hates the 50/50's which is a really bad sign in this league. Very disappointing.

4404~~~
He doesn't want to be here. Didn't his PSG deal fall through because of FFP? We were his backup choice and it shows.

4405~~~
No courage or desire.

4406~~~
LOL. If I were personally funding this purchase, I'd demand a refund.
I mean, if I bought the most expensive TV in the country, I'd expect that TV to be the absolute best...no ifs or buts.
Anything less and I'd return for a full refund.

I only hope we dont end up buying Falcao for £40M+. That guys is worth £10M max (to the right team), but not good enough for Man Utd.

4407~~~
I believe people forgot how good he was early this season. He at least has the capability to be the world's best, but he is being held back because of our management team.

4408~~~
Very poor today, we massively overpaid for him, if he does genuinely want to go to psg and they gave us our money back it wouldn't be the worst deal.

4409~~~
He shied away from one too many challenges today, as did Blind, it was disappointing. That free kick that he took was a joke as well.

4410~~~
How exactly did they hold him back today? He got on the ball plenty, and messed up quite regularly. How is that a fault of management?

4411~~~
this

4412~~~
Was not world class today at all.

4413~~~
Sums it up for me, you saw him jump out of tackles a number of times today. 

I think hes one of those players where if the team is playing well hes on it but when things are going against hes hardly going to rise to the occasion. I also wonder how much he likes it over here in England

4414~~~
Cowardly performance. Pussied out of so many challenges against players no bigger than him. Did well running with the ball and bringing it forward with pace, but his pass, cross or shot were always poor. Really didn't offer much off the ball. Just seemed to walk around. Disappointing.

4415~~~
He is getting his wages paid by us and not PSG. He better get his head out of his arse and start earning the massive salary he is picking up. I don't care if we were his 2nd or 200th choice. He is a professional footballer and there is absolutely no reason or justification for that kind of performance especially when he is supposed to be our marquee player.

4416~~~
I wouldn't mind that he's not looking worth the money if he actually looked like he cared. In my book its unacceptable to be jumping out of challenges like that when we're struggling in a game.

4417~~~
Not been impressed by him. As others have stated his lack of desire to go in for 50/50's is really worrying. I wish he would have been subbed instead of Januzaj, even though Adnan didn't have a great game either.

4418~~~
Calling him a terrible footballer is a massive, massive overreaction. 

He's definitely not playing like he should be, though.

4419~~~
Ridiculous.

4420~~~
Some players play the season of their life when they're after a bumper deal and have something to prove. Maybe that's being harsh on him. Maybe it's not the case at all, but he wouldn't be the first...

4421~~~
Playing him as a striker, surrounding him with static players, having a brand of football that is undynamic and unimaginative, and lastly playing a striker in a role, that probably would have suited Di Maria more. I might be forgetting some others, but this is just the top of my head. These factors effects players performances.

4422~~~
Was shit today but he'll come good. Too good not to. Keep the faith.

4423~~~
we call out LVG for jones taking corners - this guy is sh!t at it.

4424~~~
You don't think he's been awful for us?

4425~~~
He was shit today but it's like he's realised that the rest of our team is shit and slow, and the only directness has to come from him and so, is trying way to hard to create something (he has to btw, until we start playing Herrera).

4426~~~
When you look at the edge and aggression Sanchez and Coutinho play with it's disappointed to see him basically looking soft and scared of a challenge.

4427~~~
I think he's been awful at times, usually coinciding with when the rest of the team have been awful too, but he's also been excellent at times too (early season). It's just way too early to judge.

4428~~~
Exactly though today he looked like he didn't fancy it.

4429~~~
His heart clearly isn't in Manchester. If we can get the same money as we paid, I'd snap their hand off.

4430~~~
First 30 mins I actually thought he was playing quite well, picked the ball up from deep and was beating players, played a couple of good passes but then it all turned to shit really. Poor performance from him today and I said a while back he reminds me of Ozil from last season, I just don't get the impression he wants to be here. I remember one moment in the second half where he pulled out of a tackle from a West Ham player when the ball was right next to him and it was easier for him to get than for the West Ham player. It's just like he hasn't really got into the team first mindset, like he's gone from being a small fish in a big pond to a big fish in a small pond and so he's trying to prove he's our star player. Also, his corners are shit.

4431~~~
I think he just is tired mentally from trying to carry this team

4432~~~
I don't think he's got a clue what position he's supposed to be playing, in fact I could say that about 70% of the team.

4433~~~
Well I warned people before we bought him that 60M is a lot of money for a player who had played only one consistent great season so far and otherwise had always been a woefully inconsistent player but no one wanted to hear it. I'm afraid he has regressed again and now we have spent 60M on a 1-world-class-performance-in-10-games-player. 

I hope he can still prove me wrong but I'm afraid he is going to be our Özil.

4434~~~
When players starts getting mentally unmotivated, I fear the end the result. Van gaal is probably feeling the pressure right now and I hope he starts mixing things up positively.

4435~~~
Where is that player at Real that nicked the ball off people, pressed and did the hard work? At least if he did that we'd be better off. Off it since Chelsea at home.

I wouldn't pay 30m for him right now.

4436~~~
He gives the ball away a lot, but he does try to make things happen. He's been mostly poor lately but I dont think effort has been an issue,

4437~~~
He wasn't good but some of you are just hard to deal with sometimes. Bunch of drama queens who are spoilt and have ridiculously OTT expectations.

4438~~~
Maybe we should stop cramming the middle with players which makes it easier for opponents to shut down ADM.

Maybe we should play ADM on the left wing where his crossing and pace can be put to better use.

Sadly I doubt we will see this happen.

4439~~~
I am getting so sick of reading posts along the lines of 'ADM must really wish he was in Paris/Madrid now.' I'd honestly be happy for him to be in either of those players if it meant spending that money on a player who actually performs consistently at a top level (which is really what you'd expect when spending that kind of money.) The excuses about being played out of position only go so far. 

At some point, after seeing yet another long shot float harmlessly wide/high, yet another corner kicked directly to the opposition, yet another free kick wasted, and yet another dribble lost, you begin to realize that the player must man up and repay the significant trust the team has put in him (and earn the high wages he is being paid.) 

I'm not going to play amateur psychologist and claim to know where his head is (although I have my suspicions, as I'm sure others do,) but I think it's fair enough to expect a telling/game-changing influence on a regular basis. Apart from his first few games, ADM hasn't offered this at all.

I've always felt it's a bit pointless to mention the exact amount we paid, as I reckon there is a bit of a markup for a team like United (particularly when the team is desperate for an injection of world class quality.) However, for a premium price, whether it's 40 million or 59.7 m, I think we could have our pick of world class quality players, players who can be difference makers on a regular basis (with perhaps Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Bale and Suaez being among the few untouchables.) To this point, ADM hasn't been that player.

4440~~~
I'm looking forward to him leaving.

It's embarrassing to have spent £60m on such an ineffectual player.

4441~~~
He won't be here next year.

4442~~~
I don't see what is over the top about expecting him to be putting in performances that are a substantial upgrade over what he had been getting from the likes of Nani. So far, I don't think he has.

4443~~~
People are suggesting we sell him in the summer. Thats OTT.

4444~~~
Yup. Doesn't answer my question though. How did that affect his performance TODAY? All those things from previous matches mean he jumps out of challenges, loses the ball repeatedly etc?

4445~~~
He's been a massive disappointment. Maybe with a formation change next season he could excel here but he doesn't really look settled in England so I wouldn't be surprised if he demanded a move in the summer

4446~~~
I'm not so much suggesting we sell as regretting that we bought him in the first place. Now that he's here, we have to try and make it work, but significant improvement is needed.

4447~~~
He's been rubbish since his injury at the start of the season. If we could get anywhere near what we paid for him I'd gladly send him on his way.

4448~~~
I'm not sure I'd want him sold just yet. He has a lot of class in him, I don't think that can be denied.

What can be questioned at the moment is his desire as I really don't think he looks like he wants it. Definitely doesn't look like he's enjoying it, and his performances have been downright poor. I would like to see him benched for a game or two, send a message to him that despite his large fee, he's not guaranteed a place. Course, the same could be said of Van Persie, but I don't see him being dropped either.

4449~~~
FFS people talking about selling him, get a fecking grip. Put him in a functioning team and he'll look world class. As in, don't put Rooney in midfield and put the 2 useless overpaid twats that we have up front on the bench. Put Herrera and Mata around Di Maria and he'll look brilliant, players who can open up space and get him the ball quickly. 

And take him off corners because he sucks at those.

4450~~~
Had absolute stormers against shit opposition ie Leicester and QPR, and at everton, then has been absolutely shit since what is required of him

4451~~~
people want him sold already ffs. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4452~~~
It affected his performance mentally and psychologically. With all those factors aforementioned happening, it appears that he has lost belief in what the manager is doing, as such he becomes undecisive with his decision making ability on the pitch. However, some player like Ronaldo(versus Mourinho), has the ability to overcome managerial negligence, some other players overall ability become affected by it. If Van Gaal fixes what is wrong with Di Maria in the team, he will be more motivated and not carelessly lose the ball or jump out of challenges. It is a psychologically things that begins with what the manager is doing with his players.

4453~~~
Needs to up his game. Lots of his touches and decisions were poor today. Obviously not helped by Louis' insistence on leaving midfielders on the sidelines.

4454~~~
Poor touches, poor decision making, dummied out of few 50-50 challenges. He's not playing badly because he was in the strikers' position, he's just being Di Maria, a very fantastic player who will frustrate the hell out of you from time to time, if we actually can get a grip of things in midfield then he'll play better. Right now he's just playing so shit, it's unbelievable.

4455~~~
This is what I think as well tbh.

4456~~~
He reminds me of Giggs. Always tries the spectacular, when it comes off its amazing but when it doesn't he ends up giving the ball away all the time.

4457~~~
Sanchez is a fighter. Di Maria is just your typical mercenary.

4458~~~
Mended that for you.

4459~~~
Well a big reason why the team isn't functioning is that the player who we bought to be the fulcrum of our attack has been massively disappointing. He's been every bit the 'useless overpaid twat' as have been RVP and Falcao.

4460~~~
Considering how much we've paid for him, performances like today are pretty outrageous.  Players are entitled to have a bad game every so often but he doesn't show any commitment to pursuing a loose ball or winning the scrappy battles.  His injury may figure into that but there's a certain level you need to play at with that kind of salary.

4461~~~
Awful performance today, and he hasn't really got any excuses. Needs to up it.

4462~~~
We paid 65m based on 1 WC season. Money spend for the sake of spending
And we bought him without a plan on how to use him. Talk about hasty decision from the top level management..

4463~~~
He's been abysmal. I agree that he'd probably do better if we stopped playing with idiotic team selections but even still with players like him you expect moments of magic, something out of nothing but there's none of that, just a scared little wimp pussying out of tackles and taking myopically shit corners.

4464~~~
Not at all. He's actually shown plenty of bits of class here and there and had a few good games that get forgotten the second he has a poor game. He needs to be given time in his CORRECT position and have similar minded players around him. You can't put one world class player like Di Maria in a team who hoofs the ball all the time and when they don't just pass it around the back 4. Wee have to play with pace, pass the ball around the pitch with pace and attack with pace. He's the only one who ever looks like creating a chance even when playing poorly. What the feck have Van Persie and Falcao done all season? They have 13 goals combined in almost 40 appearances between them. That's atrocious for our supposed world class strikers. Di Maria at least has 11 combined goals and assists in 18 games, could be a lot better but it would be if Van Persie and Falcao didn't keep fecking up every chance he creates. He still creates more chances then anyone else in our squad so he's doing his job even though Van Persie and Falcao basically have no movement up front so it's hard for him to create stuff for them.

4465~~~
Don't like him as a #10. In fact, I mis-read the line-up and thought Januzaj was at #10.  That was dumb-but didn't see AdM effective as the orchestrator.  I think he's been at his best on the left side of the diamond-which is where Januzaj actually played.  

He can make things happen when he gets the ball deep and makes runs at defenders.  His crosses and delivery into the box has been poor though.

4466~~~
Didnt he play in the midfield today?

4467~~~
I can only laugh at the people who actually want him gone.

That being said, he clearly isn't right at the moment and his performances have dipped. The worrying thing is that so have everyone else's too.

4468~~~
Regardless of his poor performance, there's no excuse for pulling out of challenges. Really disappointed with him.

4469~~~
He blows hot and cold. I just hope he soon gets back to playing the way he did in the first couple of months.

4470~~~
So we can put the out of position excuse to bed. That's a run of what, three? Four? games in a row in this position that was supposed to make him a world beater. Against poor opposition too. Just been very underwhelming for most of the season.

4471~~~
Played behind the strikers, but it was hardly a game where he could make an impact. West ham dominated the first half and we hardly got out of our half, so how exactly is that on him? That's down Rooney, Januzaj and Blind failing to control the game, but then again, I put that more down to the strikers we have up top forcing Rooney out of position to a place where he just isn't very good. And Di Maria was far from the worst out there today. Had a much bigger impact then Falcao and Van Persie and much better games then everyone in our midfield and offence bar Blind. They were all shite, but he at least created a couple of chances and looked dangerous on the ball. The biggest let down from him was the corners but it's just baffling why he keeps taking them because he is shite at them.

4472~~~
Yeah, position stuff is out of the question now. 
Lots of excuses for him here. 
Dont want to sold him like some though.

4473~~~
yes - another sh1t excuse about where he plays - he looked crap.

4474~~~
Some classic knee jerk reactions going on around here at the moment.

He'll come good be we need to play him on the wing and get some solid midfielders behind him. At the moment he's a luxury that we can't afford.

4475~~~
So basically its everyone else's fault?
I mean when a player missplaces passes, looses the ball or makes shots out of nothing that's not cause all the other players are shit and are not controlling the game.
He looks dangerous on the ball? that's not enough.
I didnt watch the game today mind you but I've seen enough of his past games to say that there's always and excuse or 2 for him.
I mean you say it was a game where he could make a impact. If he's a wc player and he is and should be he should do something out of nothing every once in a while if nothing.
Maybe he's just in a bad form. Sure our general form isnt helping but its not logical we fault all the other players and not him.

4476~~~
Not playing at all well and should be doing better.

Definitely feel being shifted around the place has made it hard for him to settle though.

4477~~~
He should be doing more without question. I'm saying the way we play and the players we have making "runs" is hardly making it an easy role for him. He thrives on having runners around him, picking the ball up from deep and running at the opposition and picking out through balls. Currently, nobody in our team is making any runs. Falcao and Van Persie are so ineffective week after week that we basically play with 9 men on the pitch. They're more at fault then anybody for our poor performances in games IMO (Well apart from Van Gaal who picks them constantly) as it disrupts the balance of our team and forces other players elsewhere. The point is he still creates a few very good chances every game even with the lack of movement, and if the strikers put them away, he would get an assist for it and people would get a completely different opinion of his performance in the game. Again, he should and can be playing a lot better then he is. I'm just saying no player can be at their best if the whole team is so disjointed and you have so many players not performing or playing out of position. 

We haven't had one attacking player actually play well consistently this season. Not one. Not even decent performances consistently. Now every player has different reasons for that, but IMO, with Falcao and Van Persie, it's because they just aren't very good players anymore and are way past it, and with the others it is due to the whole slow style we play, and having those 2 up front and forcing everyone else around them to play more restricted roles so we can accommodate having 2 poachers who do feck all in general play on the pitch.

4478~~~
This is the player he has always been bar one good season. He's never been consistent, but often frustrating. Remember, it's not long ago many agreed he was on a level with Nani, we are just seeing that once again.

4479~~~
I find it a bit strange that Van Gaal is being blamed for a world class players inability to control the ball, pulling out if it even looks like a tackle is going to be put in, taking terrible set pieces and constantly trying things that arent on or running down blind alleys when better options are available. These arent things that should be effected by a players role or position on the pitch.

4480~~~
I'd like to see us try starting a team without him in it, just to see if he really does bring enough to the side.

4481~~~
Well this one is on him. Di Maria is shite at corners, he shouldn't be taking them ever yet the manager is the one who picks who takes them. Just like jones was taking them a few weeks ago.

4482~~~
Ok now he should played on the wings? I thought everyone agreed that his best position was somewhere behind the striker centrally. These are just lame excuses tbh - he's due to a world class performance for a long time now.

4483~~~
They are effected by confidence though, which is in turn effected by the way the manager uses you.

4484~~~
I'd take a good performance to be honest.

4485~~~
Yup. Been getting the basics wrong far too often this season. Been a really big problem for us too. For the money we paid this guy should be our talisman. Supposed to be at the centre of all our best football but actually been closer to the opposite.

4486~~~
What is he doing out there? Genuine question. I've no idea what his instructions are, he seems to be everywhere and nowhere. Performance today was awful.

4487~~~
He has a completely static side around him.

Last year he had Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo all constantly moving around pulling people out of position. He couldn't be marked out as easily as he can be in this United side.

Putting it out there that the likes of Hazard, Sanchez, Silva etc wouldn't look any better in this awful side.

4488~~~
I've always thought of him as a winger. He had an awesome season at Madrid in that position but who wouldn't playing behind Ronaldo and Benzema. Personally, I think his left foot and dribbling ability is too good to not be used out there. Plus, we have Mata, Herrera, Fellani, Januzaj and Rooney who can also play in that position.

4489~~~
AKA "the Kagawa excuse" <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

4490~~~
I think every single one of them would look better. Hazard and Silva can consistently control a ball properly, for starters. And are two of the least wasteful ball-players around. Sanchez is much better in front of goal and would grab the games where we aren't on top.

4491~~~
Disappointed in him lately. Needs to do a lot more than he is doing.

4492~~~
Hasn't been at it for a while now, disappointing considering what he's capable of and the fee we paid. There are times when takes on players and looks good but ends up trying too much or the end product's just not there. 

No idea why he's still taking corners by the way, that should have been ditched back in November when had a load against City that were sub standard.

4493~~~
Yes, the Kagawa excuse. None of our forward line looks for quick interchanging passes. We've played zombie football for years now and this has been a major factor behind it

4494~~~
Yep. Yes, he should be doing better. He looked a lot better earlier on when we had Herrera and Mata in the side and Rooney playing up front and all of them playing quickly and passing it around to each other well. Was absolutely brilliant in those opening games. Since his injury we've completely changed the way we play and everything is too slow, he's not getting on the ball in the right positions and he has nobody around him making runs so he can only do so much. You can't have one player transform the way we are playing when our strikers are so static and useless, and I'll keep protecting him as he's the only one in our team who looks dangerous and actually makes things happen that isn't a hoof forwards. Also our only fast player in the attack. What we should do is put like minded players around him, those who like to pass the ball around quickly so we can up the tempo of our game and actually stretch teams and get the most out of him. Not put Falcao and Van persie in front of him. Maybe them in their prime would work, not the 2 overrated and past it shite strikers that we've seen for the past 6-7 months.

4495~~~
I'd say signing creative players who don't live up to their reputations is a big factor too. Players like Kagawa and Di Maria. Which is always a risk when you sign them on the back of just one really top class season.

4496~~~
Was ineffective on corners (1 for 5) and setting up chances (1).  Passing accuracy wasn't horrible-84%.  To me he's a tweener-not an out and out winger but not a #10.  Thought his best games have come from the left in a diamond-and so I don't understand why he played Januzaj there and AdM as a # 10.

4497~~~
Another victim of Van Gaalism.

4498~~~
Imagine he would be on loan like Falcao... I guess we would discuss if he is worth the money.

4499~~~
Could have saved 60 million and just kept Nani.

4500~~~
I don't really want him sold either (of course, in a fantasy world if you told me that I could straight exchange him for someone like Bale, I'd probably do it.) That doesn't change the fact that he's been at best, above-average this season (and that's being generous.) I was thrilled with his first few games here (I even went on Facebook and bragged that we'd signed a top-5 player in the world...) but he hasn't come close to replicating that form since, even when played in his correct position. 

We can keep making excuses that he's being let down by the poor performances of his teammates, but then we could also flip that logic around and say that he benefitted immensely from the superior performance of his teammates at Real. Instead, I'd rather judge him on the merits of how he has actually played, particularly with regard to aspects of his game that he has direct control over, such as final ball, shooting and set-piece delivery, and on all those counts, he's been very underwhelming.

4501~~~
Quite a few similarities between the situation ADM is in now and the one Ozil found on his arrival to the PL. You'd have to say Ozil has done a lot more to live up to his price tag thus far, which is quite worrying given that he certainly hasn't been an unqualified success himself...

4502~~~
I'm not worried. Most of the time he's the only fecker who looks likely to do anything.

4503~~~
Without ever really do anything? I find it incredible the leniency that is shown towards Di Maria's performances, while a guy like Mata, who while far from his best, has actually been far more consistent, yet gets slated and is felt by a number of people to be one of the players who should be sold (god that was a long-winded sentence...)

4504~~~
Probably our worst player today.

4505~~~
He's pretty lousy at corners. Anyone figured out what his hand signals are supposed to mean? 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/458736676-angel-di-maria-of-manchester-united-prepares-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=GkZZ8bf5zL1ZiijUmxa7QVDHXTCvzUM8Dui4F1BllHysmHiRr70H9xwrWQ7jwBhI7%2FrUZgXZw5a5zyXpAj06FQ%3D%3D" src="http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/458736676-angel-di-maria-of-manchester-united-prepares-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=GkZZ8bf5zL1ZiijUmxa7QVDHXTCvzUM8Dui4F1BllHysmHiRr70H9xwrWQ7jwBhI7%2FrUZgXZw5a5zyXpAj06FQ%3D%3D"/> 
"I'm smashing this one knee-high into the first defender"

4506~~~
Looks frustrated to me.

4507~~~
Didn't benefit much in all the seasons leading up to the last one, by all accounts. That's what really concerns me with all this stuff about how he'll be fine so long as he plays in central midfield. He's had one really good season for them, which coincided with him playing mainly in central midfield. This by no means guarantees that playing him in that position again will get an identical level of performance. Definitely possible the change in position was just a coincidence. 

The game is littered with one season wonders. For the type of money we spent I'd rather have signed someone with a bit more of substantial body of work on his CV.

4508~~~
Have to totally agree.

4509~~~
Well I think he was always a good player for Real (at least from what I saw of him,) but it always felt like he was a player at the level of 2009-2011-era Nani. In other words, a very talented difference maker, but not necessarily someone you'd build your team around. Sadly, the early returns support that suspicion.

I think we have to keep him at least for another season, but we need substantial improvement, and I'm not sure how confident I am about seeing it.

4510~~~
Thought the knee jerking wasn't that bad today until I came into this thread, People really suggesting we sell him after 7 months? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

He was awful today there was no excusing it. In fact I'd say he has been pretty underwhelming overall since coming back from injury, but man give the guy a chance. He is in a new country and having to adapt to a new style of football and in a team that is very static in comparison to Real Madrid. I'm not excusing him for his poor form because things like jumping away from tackles today really angered me but I think until we get the midfield / forward line correct and in sync with each other we may see plenty of hot and cold moments unfortunately.

One positive I will say for him is that he is a massively self determined guy and he will want to get this right and prove himself here. He just needs a good game or two and he can turn this all around.

4511~~~
He is asked or he wants to be our main player whereas he never has been before for his teams. Too much responsibility on his shoulders.

4512~~~
Two or three years ago, half the people on this place wouldn't touch him with a barge pole. Nani was rated as by far the better player. Would be beyond mental if we've broken the PL transfer record to sign a player no better than another player already in our squad, who we're actively squeezing out of the club because of the same inconsistency and crappy decision-making that has plagued most of Di Maria's career. That shit be crazy.

4513~~~
That'll tend to happen when everyone around him is standing still. I think both he and Mata should be starting every game. Even in this shower of shite he still regularly assists and scores the odd goal.

4514~~~
No argument here. Given the choice, I'd rather have Nani and spend that money on a player with a shred of consistency to his game.

4515~~~
Seriously? It's to tell people he's about to take the corner so they can start making their runs. Everyone does it.

4516~~~
He does seem to be playing at half pace now, Im wondering if the recent events in his life have affected him at all.

Im not trying to say I told you so but I did suggest at the time of the ADM  and Falcao signings that they may not be the best signings because of the balance of the squad, and that  Beniata and Vidal were better required, but the excitement of the signings meant I was ridiculed. I guess when ADM  has a season like he did last season you dont shirk the chance.

4517~~~
Someone said "Kagawa excuse" and to be fair it's not a excuse! If you want a player to create chances then you need to fecking make a run for him to make that pass, some people think it all happens by magic...

4518~~~
Maybe we need to ask ourselves why every attacking very good to world class player looks almost useless once he joins us ...

4519~~~
It's just that after such a good season, we expected a lot from him. And he really delivered for the first few games, shame he looks nothing like back then.

The Falcao hype was just for the name alone.

4520~~~
I'm with you. Not worried about him at all.

4521~~~
I still think we needed a player like Di Maria as much as anyone, with great pace and the ability to create chances. He still does do that every game even if his confidence is low, it's just our strikers keep missing the chances he makes. Falcao was pointless though.

4522~~~
Yep. He's the type of player we need to have going forward and will definitely come good. He's world class, the only one in our squad with real pace, constantly makes chances for the forwards even on his poor days... If he can get back to his consistent level of last year then we'd be perfectly fine but you don't ever see a player putting in consistent performances in a struggling team. Once our team starts to click and we put out more normal lineups, he'll become a lot more consistent. As of now, the one consistent player in our squad is De Gea, in net, and a couple defensive players like Blind and Rojo. The rest have been very up and down, regardless of how good they are.

4523~~~
Three times he backed out of 50/50 challenges today which is unforgivable for him. I don't care if we sell him to PSG for 50 million at the end of the season. He does not look interested. It does not look like wants to play for Manchester United. It does not look like he wants to be in this country full-stop. For the amount of money he's on, he's been shit.

4524~~~
You're kidding, right?



I see there are lot of experts on body language here. People can detect if he wants to play for us and if he likes it at OT, England and similar. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4525~~~
I've defended him a lot this season, but I think its becoming more and more apparent that he's just not really up for the battle here.

4526~~~
It really doesn't help him that we play so narrow. He wants to run through the middle and it's being overcrowded by us not playing any wingers at all. Di Maria is best when he has space to run into, seeing him constantly run into a crowded central area is infuriating, but he's just doing what he knows. We need to play a formation that will stretch the pitch and make space for him. He was just voted into he world team of the year - he is anything but shit.

Sell Mata, get rid of Falcao/van Persie - if not both - and play a 4-3-3 with him either in the middle with Blind/Carrick and one other or as one of the wide forward roles and we will see the best of Di Maria. He needs space to operate in and we need to create it for him.

All this nonsense about him not caring - he was the only one who sprinted back to help Valencia on that West Ham counterattack in the first half - the only one. Sure, his head may not be in the right place after what happened to him and his family, but give it time and he'll get over it. Having your house burgled will shake you up a bit, it's natural, it doesn't mean you want to leave and be gone forever.

4527~~~
I haven't taken to him at all since he came out with the "I might have been at PSG if they wasn't restricted by ffp" comments. But his performances have been awful lately, today he didn't even challenge for 50/50's which isn't a good sign in the Premier league.

And who keeps letting him take corners? He's absolutely dreadful at them.

4528~~~
Couldn't agree more. Too many players going for the safe option and retreating back and even when they do make a run forward they just fling themselves into areas where they are heavily marked. Its almost like they are saying 'don't pass it to me'. We really need work on our movement off the ball and to do that we need players to communicate with each other so they can develop a telepathic understanding on the pitch. 

I still see a team of strangers who are just guessing where to pick out their team mate rather than instinctively knowing what that player is about to do. It wont always work out because at the end of the day, a player only his own brain but from the beginning of the season, I've seen very little progress in that side of our game. Whether its LVGs tactics, I don't know but the players need to make more of an effort to work collectively and not individually and then we can start to remove this plague of predictable football that has been left to fester for far too long now.

4529~~~
He did some good work at times today, attempting to turn and take the ball forward, but its clear hes just not comfortable playing so high up and its getting to him.

4530~~~
Agree entirely. Bar the first month or so he has been awful. Shouldn't have lasted the 90 minutes. If he's sulking because he didn't get to Paris then he needs to get the feck over it. I'm furious with his performance. We wasted 60 million on this guy! The constant excuses about being played out of position and stuff looks like nonsense too. Even in this LCM role he gives us very little. Would rather Nani back and play a 4-3-3.

4531~~~
id snatch your hand off for our money back and re investment in other areas. He's not the player we needed.

4532~~~
If you look at the top of the screen his stats actually don't look bat at all, contributing to 11 goals in 19 games is actually pretty good going. He's still been largely poor though.

4533~~~
He'll be a brilliant player for us once our team gets settled. We needed a lot of players in the summer and a player like him is exactly what we needed as he showed at the start of the season. He lost some form and has been on and off since then (but of course people making it sound like it's been all poor performances) but in general, a player like him won't ever be consistent in a team that is as disjointed as we are. We don't push forward very often and the movement of our strikers is non existent. How do you expect him, a creator, to make the most out of that then? Saying shit like you'd take the money back is pure stupidity as he's shown he's one of the very best players in the world in a working system if used properly. Put Silva, Sanchez, Hazard, Bale, Iniesta, and whoever else you want in our team that isn't named Ronaldo and Messi and they would struggle. Hell, both Ronaldo and Messi would struggle as well because of how slowly we play. The problem is with the whole system and how it basically relies on Di Maria to do something out of nothing to create a chance, as nobody else tries anything other then a long ball. That or a set piece. He's a great player, but he can't carry us on his own and every game when he does make chances, our strikers tend to miss them.

He's the only one in our team (bar Herrera) who actually looks to create something every time he gets the ball and looks dangerous. Yes, lately he's had one good game then one poor one and been very inconsistent, but that's what it will always be like when you have a player like him in a disjointed team. One game he can do really well, the next nothing will come off. Until we get a working system going where everybody pulls their weight and we start playing with more pace and getting the ball to Di Maria in the right situations, he won't be consistent. 

Anyways, it's not like he's been any worse then our other attacking players. Van Persie and Falcao have been awful. Rooney pretty useless. Mata good one game and ineffective the next. Fellaini knocking down long balls. Herrera constantly on the bench but the only one who genuinely looks really good every time he plays (limited time though). Januzaj very "meh". Surely it's down to the system rather then Di Maria when every single one of our attack minded players have so drastically under-performed?

4534~~~
At the moment he is screaming Ozil to me. Great start like Ozil, but not been that great since. 

Plus his workrate for Madrid was a lot better. Just like Ozils was.

4535~~~
People are being ridiculous in here. He's going to be a great player for us.

4536~~~
He's just failing to cope with the great defensive nature of English Football.  He needs to reinvent himself to succeed here.

4537~~~
There is nothing great about the defending in England.

4538~~~
Get back to me when he has forwards to give the ball to who can offer more than a training cone. RVP and Falcao are beyond atrocious and with performances like that are playing like the worst forwards in the entire league. Ulloa can play like shit and miss sitters too. Oh but wait I'm pretty sure he's also outscoring our strikers.

4539~~~
Now, as I say, I don't want him sold.

But what I find pretty funny here is that you speak of it being "pure stupidity as he's shown he's one of the best players in the world in a working system if used properly" .. then you speak of the likes of Van Persie, Falcao, Rooney, Mata as being awful, rubbish ... have they not shown they're pretty darn good players in the past? In fact, I'd go so far as to say each and every one of those players has a longer history of the very top level of play - although I'd also agree that maybe none of them quite hit the heights of Di Maria last year, but not far off. 

All the same, it's ludicrous that you'll make one argument in his favour, yet lambast players who have also shown great ability in the past.

4540~~~
Yeah...I think Di Maria will be one we look back on and wonder what happened.  Not impressed at all.  He had a good few games for us.  Never watched him in La Liga...I wasn't all that impressed with him in the WC either.  We have RvP, Falcao, Rooney, Januzaj and Di Maria in the same squad and we cannot do anything with the ball.  At all.  It really is a shame to see so much talent in this squad and see so little end product.  It's as if we have no idea how to create chances anymore.

4541~~~
Well first of all I said they were all performing poorly, not that they are poor players. Some of them blatantly aren't what they were though. With Falcao, he is turning 29 soon and is coming back from his 3rd ACL reconstruction. Hard to come back from that whoever you were, and anyways, even if he was at his best, we still wouldn't need him. He was never the fastest, and we already had 2 strikers with world class reputations. With Van Persie, he has been off form for a while now with a few good runs here and there. Again with him now being 31, you have to wonder is a combination of age and injuries catching up to him and this just a normal decline? I thought that for a while and he hasn't been the same player since Fergie retired.

Now with Rooney, he has been playing poorly almost definitely because he's being played in midfield and the slow passing of our team. Mata being in and out of the team constantly and same as Di Maria, having no movement in front of him isn't helping him at all. All 3 of these players would benefit from each other on the pitch along with Herrera as well, and being part of a working system where we play at a higher tempo and they would all be a lot more consistent and perform at a higher standard. Like I said, it's not just Di Maria performing poorly and these "excuses" apply to all of them. Van Persie and Falcao I think are past it, but the rest of the the squad can form a fantastic team that would be winning titles with Fergie in charge. They just need to be part of the right system and in the right positions. 
Just seems more logical to me, that the reason Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, the strikers and everyone else is playing poorly is how they are being told to play rather then them all being individually poor this season through their fault. That doesn't account to poor touches here and there, but one thing leads to another and the more disjointed a team, the more the things that should be bread and butter for them goes.

4542~~~
We had 18 shots today, that's more then enough. Problem was awful finishing from Falcao and Van Persie.

4543~~~
Looked like he legitimately didn't care for most of the time and was a huge pussy going into a lot of challenges.

Really not impressed with him at all today.

4544~~~
There were few instances where he had no one in forward area to pass to. I don't think we have the personnels or the tactics to get the best out of him nor does it look like he wants to give his all for the team.
It feels more and more that this signing for that big price was a dick measuring competition where the other big clubs weren't that excited.

4545~~~
I'm seeing 11 shots with only 5 on goal.  RvP had a couple of good strikes on goal...Di Maria had one out from distance...Blinds goal.  That's about it.  Falcao had a couple of chances that were poor in the end.  Whatever the tally is it's not good enough when you consider the quality on the pitch wearing United shirts.

4546~~~
Considering we did feck all in the first half, we did pretty well in the second to get that many shots off and the chances created really weren't the problem. West Ham away is always a tough game no matter who you are, and if our finishing wasn't so poor the result could have been different.

4547~~~
He's struggling to adapt into a team that just isn't set up to bring the best out of him right now. 

We should be basing our tactics around him, he's our superstar £60m signing. No excuse really for the level he is playing at but he looks like he has got the weight of the world on his shoulders.

4548~~~
You're right...and I mentioned this in another post...to go to West Ham this year and get a point is not easy.  That being said...I felt the team let itself down.

4549~~~
Yes, it was a joke, as most of his corners tend to be low and cleared by the first man, regardless of which signal he gives.

4550~~~
He will be a success but it is clear that he needs the right players around him. With a lost Rooney and a non-existent Blind and unavailable strikers, it just doesnt work for him. I think yesterday he didnt even know which position he plays.

4551~~~
We can’t exactly say if he’s still hurted by what happened last weeke for him, but he was absolutely rubbish yesterday at Upton Park. His worst game for us. Whether the formation doesn’t suit him, or he wasn’t in great form, he was poor, very poor in a lot of choices.

I repeat that we added a world class player, but he will be world class only if he’s the number 2 or 3 in the team. He needs leader around him, like Ronaldo, Xabi Alonso, Ramos etc… He will not make us win the League alone.

 But I’m really upset with his performance yesterday…

4552~~~
He'd look a lot better if he had Mata & Herrera around him and Rooney in front of him... 

He definitely seems to require someone to play off... possibly why he hasn't looked completely shite when Fellaini's around, as he then actually has a focal for point for his wayward ball wanging.

4553~~~
our only player who can inject pace going forward. not defending his performances because he has been poor for his standard.

but just ask him to turn down taking corners ffs.

4554~~~
About a month ago, I just accepted I'm not going to give much thought to Di Maria's performances at places like West Ham, Cambridge, Yeovil etc. I'm going to look at what he does at places like the Nou Camp. I think he will run the show in Europe when he doesn't have to worry about what direction the next pair of studs are coming from.

Not trying to defend his poor performances but he just isn't a player for tough Premier League games, he wants and needs the big stage in regards to world football in my opinion.

4555~~~
If so, we should get rid. We can't afford to devote such a large chunk of our wage bill to a luxury player, who can only be relied upon in a tiny fraction of our fixtures each season.

4556~~~
Not up for the battle?

Ridiculous.

He demanded to play against Cambridge despite his house getting robbed 24 hours earlier.

I think he is tough enough but if you wanted someone jumping into tackles we should have signed Lee Cattermole!

I think he is trying to hard to justify the price tag, settle down, relax and hopefully this Nani type form will go away.

4557~~~
Think we can call it as a Manchester United syndrome. Ashley Young, Robin van Persie, Juan Mata, Angel di Maria. All of them are now shit corner takers.

4558~~~
We have a number of high quality players who are not performing especially in attack, so this would suggest it's more of a tactical/team problem rather than individual. Once LVG get's a settled team he will get a lot better imo.

4559~~~
His corners remind me of Srna ones. He used to be the best set piece taker at NT,yet nearly all of his corners would be crap and hit the first defender.

4560~~~
Right now, I'd rather have him on the wing in all honesty. I feel as though he needs two world class (excellent) midfielders alongside him to be truly effective as a LCM. I know he had his best season there, but he's only ever played there for one season. LVG clearly doesn't trust Herrera, so I think we need a Pogba or someone to the ilk alongside di Maria and Blind/Carrick in midfield for it to work.

4561~~~
Why is he taking corners/free-kicks ahead of Rooney/Mata?? Mata statistically has the best free-kick ratio in EPL.

4562~~~
well said. 

i used to fear ashley young corners back then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4563~~~
Holy shit I've just seen this now. What a twat!

4564~~~
Going out on a limb here but wouldn't we better off breaking our transfer record to sign a central midfielder who doesn't need us to sign two other world class CMs to do all the hard work for him? Maybe sign a central midfielder who can can play, you know, as a central midifielder?

4565~~~
Don't agree with getting rid but I accept and somewhat agree with your idea. However, when playing at the elite level (Champions League), that's what it's about.

As much as I want to win the league, I would take 4th and a European Cup. I'm not saying that's what I think could happen but world class players help you at the highest level and we will hopefully need that next season.

Di Maria will learn from games like this, it's still a new league, in tough circumstances so I can't be too critical at the moment. Lets see if he is dealing with these challenging games this time next season and then we will know if he is worth it.

4566~~~
Anyone else think we could have saved a load of money and bought Depay?

4567~~~
Wow deserves a medal for this

4568~~~
Some wouldn't have.

Getting your house robbed with a young baby in it? I would imagine he would be pretty shaken up, not coming from the country either an all...

4569~~~
no

4570~~~
Im sure it wasnt easy. But I would expect any player to still play a game of football a couple of days later

4571~~~
I think he might be the thickest footballer on the planet. His decision making makes Nani look like Paul Scholes.

At one point yesterday Rooney played him in behind the entire West Ham defence, and he decided the best option was to cut back and then try to beat 3 defenders on his own, who weren't even in his way until he'd purposely ran 10 yards in the wrong direction in order for them to be.

£65m for someone who you can count on to play the wrong pass or try the wrong thing 90% of the time he gets the ball is not good.

4572~~~
Was really poor yesterday. Made one or two of his trademark bursts, but end product was really wasteful. I liked him on one side of the diamond. 

But I do question whether he would be better for us out wide or as a wide man in a front 3. He scored 3 against Germany from a wide position and although has been good over the last year in a more central midfield role, I do wonder if in the current Utd team its best to go back to basics let him run, create, cross. And pace to our play etc, instead of trying to make things happen through the middle.

4573~~~
He was shitting it so he obviously wanted to be under the spotlights so the thieves couldn't target him!!! Don't you know Di Maria is the biggest coward in the world!?!?

4574~~~
Di Maria never scored 3 against Germany, he assisted 3 and scored the 4th.

4575~~~
Agree with this.

Yesterday barely anything came off for him but at least he kept getting on the ball and being positive with it. Much rather that to players who will either hide or just always play the safe option. He still created one good chance for Van Persie who hit it straight at the keeper. Clearly struggling for form right now but we have a lot bigger problems than him imo.

Should never take a corner for us again though, I don't think he's put in a good one all season. It should be Mata/Van Persie and Rooney taking them.

4576~~~
You're right, was a while back and forgot the stats, either way he was brilliant, as he was for us during this period playing more centrally to be fair. BUT he played off the right for the majority of this international and was excellent. As he was from wide positions when he first joined Real.

Just think its an option for him to give him that space to work players, and allow him to run at a man beat him and try to produce end product rather than in the middle where even when you beat a man you've still got the CB, or a midfielder still to go past. Seems to run into dead ends a lot of the time.

4577~~~
He has to play in the midfield. He does his best bursting up and dribbling past players. We paid 60 million for him and they way we're playing him won't allow us to get much of that.

4578~~~
Yeah agreed, why are we playing him and Rooney out of position? Shouldn't we just swap them round?

4579~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4580~~~
He'll come good eventually, I have no doubts about him as a midfielder as long as the other pieces in the jigsaw come together. He is the least of our worries.

4581~~~
Wrong question. Is he in incredibly wank form? Yes he is.

4582~~~
I still don't think he's happy here and I don't even think he wanted to come here, he was forced into this move more than anything. 

given the opportunity I reckon he would jump ship straight away.

4583~~~
I reckon you'd be better off trying him from the right. Not sure if he's had a proper chance there (or if van Gaal is even willing to switch to 4-3-3) but he was great on the right for Madrid too. Just wasn't as consistent as he was for them centrally.

4584~~~
I am not exactly seeing any major impact he has made on the team as a £60 million signing, although i think we should give him another season to prove himself

4585~~~
The shooting accuracy being so low isn't a surprise when he takes so many shots from long distances and difficult situations. He's trying to be at our club what he really isn't, a leader of men, the team's main player.

4586~~~
He was never worth £60m, even based on his form last season. No point judging him on that now, best to just accept you overpaid and assess his form without considering the transfer fee.

4587~~~
Regardless of rather he would of preferred to go to PSG or not,  I honestly don't buy the notion that he had no idea what he was in for when he signed. The word 'project' was mentioned by a lot of our new signings and they would have been well informed that it's their job to fire us back into the Champions League. Di Maria being the most expensive signing out of all of them, we should be expecting a whole lot better.

4588~~~
It's beyond stupid at this stage. What's the point in having him in midfield if we can't get the best out of him. Him and Janujaz need to be played on each wing with Rooney up front, Mata at 10 and any combination of Herrera/Blind/Carrick behind them. Fellaini can be used in games where we need more physique (however Herrera is definitely a better ball winner than him anyway). 

I don't care if Di Maria's best position was centre mid for Real. We are a different side and at the very least he'd be easier to get on the ball and run at players form a wide position. Nothing stopping a team with players like that from being able to interchange positions either.  Di Maria simply isn't as good with his back to goal as our other midfielders and we lose the midfield battle because Blind has to pick the ball up constantly by himself.

Can't blame him or Rooney for that matter. it's LVG's fault for playing 2 motionless statues up front. Painful to watch especially since Di Maria is being snuffed out of games and on a side note I reckon Rooney would have taken both chances that fell to Falcao and RVP yesterday.

If/when we acquire the players to put him back in midfield then fair enough but for the moment 4231 is by far the most suitable formation to get the best out of our current players.

4589~~~
Not judging him mainly on that, i am also judging him based on his past performances, he was a Real Madrid player and was a key member of the team that won La Decima, other players who have left Real Madrid have gone on to make their new teams better over the years... Robben,Sneijder,Higuain,Ozil,Seedorf,Makelele etc

When you sign a player from Real Madrid who was arguably their best player for that season, you kind of expect more from him...it doesn't matter if you signed him for £1 million or £100 million.

Nani in the 2010/11 season performed better for us than Di Maria is doing now (i am well aware they are different scenarios,it is just an example)

4590~~~
I was under the impression him and his agent were very much aware of this, wasn't that the reason we gave him our coveted #7 shirt in the first place? as the key man in the Van Gaalactico's?

4591~~~
Oh yes, I'm not denying that you need to pay top wages to get players, money speaks and they're professionals at the end of it, not playing for charity or as a pastime. My point was that quite a players would pick top clubs over ones that are not even if wages are<i> slightly lower.</i> Key is slightly though, no amount of history allows a club to be cheapstakes.

The City v Milan offer is an extreme one though. I'd be surprised if most players who had both Real and City chasing them didnt pick the former even if they offered say 10% less.

4592~~~
I'm confused. It's been said his best position is top of the diamond, but after yesterday it is now said he should be playing wide on the diamond. Whatever his best position is supposed to be, the one he played at Madrid, he should be placed there. Which was it?

4593~~~
That's fair enough, don't disagree with that.

4594~~~
The position he played for Real Madrid last season doesn't exist in your set up. In a diamond the closest would be on the left of it though, with freedom to get forward and move wide.

4595~~~
Right. Thanks.

4596~~~
LCM. I don't think many people have said his best position would be at the tip of the diamond. I have seen a lot of people say his best position is central.

4597~~~
Nani in 10/11 was one of the top 3 wingers in the world, with only Ronaldo being definitely ahead and there not being much between robben, Ribery and him. Was brilliant that year until he got injured close to the end. Same with the second half of 09/10 and most of 11/12. At his best he can still be a fantastic player, so its not like that's a ridiculous thing to suggest that at his best nani was better then what di maria is producing right now. At his best he was comparable to di maria at his best.

4598~~~
Ahh. Then that's my misinterpretation of the "central" comments. Apologies.

4599~~~
Still creates 2 chances a game even when he's in poor form. If rvp and falcao didn't have wank finishing he'd have like 10 more assists for the season so far.

4600~~~
Not sure how he'd do on the right in a slow, possession oriented system where he has dribble from a standing start instead of running with the ball from deep. We just need to up the tempo of our play considerably to get the best out of him and a few of our other players IMO. He's wasted in a slow style of play that let's the opposition get 10 men behind the ball and there aren't quick transitions. Its no wonder that every time during games where we have quick periods of play and go on counter attacks that he comes alive and is at his best.

4601~~~
Change formation to 4-2-3-1 and play him as the RW in the system, cutting inside and firing those tremendous crosses he put in earlier on in the season. Then buy another winger who is right footed and has pace to burn doing exactly the same on the other wing, they can both change wings when required.

Play Mata behind Rooney, Rooney in his best position, Mata in his, with blistering pace either side of him he would thrive.

Play one of Blind/Carrick alongside Herrera for the easier games or purchase an absolute unit like Wanyama.

I think we need to accept Di Maria for what he is, forgot last season, he is better off as a winger, a level up from the likes of Nani, all be it with similar traits.

4602~~~
Doesn't help that he's been given instructions by a manager who openly admitted, that he has no idea how to use him. Funny how we performed a lot better when Herrera was with him in midfield with Rooney as no.10, two players who always look for space to move into. Get Herrera back in midfield and Wilson instead of Falcao and we'll see a more flowing attack.

4603~~~
Farewell Angel.

4604~~~
It begins. Or perhaps it doesn't. Basically, who cares?

4605~~~
I'm sure those comments are old.

4606~~~
He's struggling to control a football at the minute, nevermind the weather or the language barrier!

4607~~~
Finally we got our hands on a world class player (at least last season, even though he didnt play too bad before), and this shit happens. We just have no luck <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4608~~~
Said <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/%C3%81ngel-di-mar%C3%ADa-2014-2015-performances.395692/page-100#post-16993036">here</a> that he's possibly been struggling with the weather. Early mornings in northern Britain in mid-winter are not very fun at all, even when you've grown up with them. They are endlessly dark, cold, damp and windy. Nevermind if you're used to a more tropical style climate.

But I walked home from work today, and Spring is definitely in the air. Maybe he'll start to improve as the conditions and the pitches do.

4609~~~
Yep, signing a crock like Vidal would have made us much better.

4610~~~
Except Vidal has been relatively healthy this season for Juve. He has started 20 games for them so far.

4611~~~
And according to a lot of people looks half the player he was before the knee injuries. Sounds like someone already at the club...

4612~~~
I really hope he stays but if he decides to leave in the summer id say it will be to PSG and we should look for at least the same price we paid for him.

4613~~~
Don't forget there was always 3 men marking ronny in most games adm played for madrid giving him more space . Falcao and van persie couldn't lose a bag of cement at present .

4614~~~
Actually, from what I heard, he had recently started regaining his form. Which makes sense when a player is recovering from a knee injury...

4615~~~
So does that make us all hypocrites then for saying Falcao is done at the highest level? It's easy to say now that Vidal would have been a signing we should have made but coming from a slow paced league like serie A and seeing another player like Falcao struggle as badly as he has done with a knee injury of his own, would Vidal really have been worth the gamble? I'm not totally sold on Strootman yet either.

4616~~~
I don't know. But I wouldn't be surprised at all to see Falcao be quicker and generally sharper next season with some other club. Coming back from a knee injury and playing at a really high level immediately never really happens (unless the player is a freak athlete). Vidal's playing style is more suited to EPL though, he's a very physical player. I think we should go for him again next summer.

4617~~~

Regardless of how much United paid for him, expectations should be lowered during his first season.

4618~~~
Ever since we signed Di Maria, people have been saying "he isn't happy" or "he doesn't feel at home" even before he signed he was said to be on his way to PSG but had to settle for United due to FFP rules... of course after the season we had under Moyes we were willing to pay £60 million and give him the #7 shirt he outrightly demanded albeit through his agent ... it all feels like we are catering for a player who doesn't want to be here and we are giving him too much respect and we haven't gotten anything in return, at least not on the football pitch, i am well aware of his performance against QPR and how good he looked before his injury, but that was a while ago... if we were willing to break the bank for a single player then we shouldn't have to worry too much about his problem with the language or how comfortable he is(after the incident ),i understand these are genuine problems and they may hinder the progress of a lot of people - but Di Maria is an adult at 26, Ronaldo had to face the same problems at 18 years of age, a new country,language,weather etc so i don't see how this should be a major problem for our record signing.

Perhaps its all being exaggerated by the media and the player doesn't even want to leave but i don't trust Jorge Mendes, i still think Di Maria has a lot to offer to our team, i really don't want him to leave but wouldn't feel distraught if he did, i can see us signing players in the summer.

I think LVG is the biggest problem, although i won't make excuses for Di Maria's terrible performances(yes terrible for someone with his ability, if we wanted a mediocre winger we could have signed Charles N'zogbia). LVG seems to be mishandling the team atm with players being played out of position and the weird formations.

Oh get a grip, you're a professional, so its cold and dark so what. You're not a kid to get sad every time its cold. Play football and take your paycheck. 

It seems to me thought this story has been invented by the media who nicely gets it out every once in a while. It has been going for a while, he's unhappy, he's cold, he regrets not going to PSG and similar. Him being out of form doesnt help it either.

4620~~~
I don't like that article, it makes it sound like he's incredibly miserable because of the weather and language barrier. In this one he laughs it off.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=2/news=di-maria-god-s-will-for-me-to-miss-final-2522127.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y...-god-s-will-for-me-to-miss-final-2522127.html</a>

4621~~~
FFP basically ties him down here.

4622~~~
Agreed, every single foreigner complains about the English weather, heck even people here hate it ... doesn't seem like a major problem after reading both articles

4623~~~
As far as the weather goes, isn't it pretty similar in Argentina? They have very cold and dark winters don't they?

4624~~~
I was wary about these two signings and said so on here only to get laughed at. So many fans just love them muppet signings. Whereas Id prefer the Blind type transfers. 

If these reports are true it would certainly go along with his lack of effort we are seeing on the pitch. 

Also ready made stars haven't worked for us in the past, but I'm also starting to think we are cursed with South American players 

One good season from Tevez and Heinze is all we have gotten out of that continent

4625~~~
For those who keep saying he isn't committed to United. There is NO way we are selling him.

"The next step will be to return to Rosario Central, another giant of the game! Truth be told, I've played for Europe's biggest clubs, competed in two World Cups and won the Champions League,” said Di Maria.

"I represented <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/spanish-liga/real-madrid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Real Madrid</a> and before that was with <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/portuguese-liga/benfica" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Benfica</a>, which, while a slightly smaller club than Madrid, is a giant of Portuguese football.

“Now I'm with another massive club in <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/english-premier-league/manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a>.

“When I finish here, I think it might be time to return to Argentina. Hopefully that happens"

Without being an expert, it probably depends where you live, but i dont think it is very cold there in the winter, probably around 10 degrees. With the dark winters, i think they have more hours of daylight in the winter too, not that much more, but a few hours more than in England i guess.

4627~~~
I didn't realise the break in robbery was quite that serious. He had to fight them off with his family in the house? That'd shake anyone up.

4628~~~
Watch him b
Must have been terrible, especially when you don't even understand the language in the first place

4629~~~
i think this will end badly as the robbery is going to push him out! I won't blame him either as that must be something he won't get over especially with a young child.. Fecking gutted!

4630~~~
Well he has till the end of the season to decide, we can't afford to have an unsettled star player going into our title contending season

4631~~~
I know it's been said a million times, but I don't think we are using him properly at all. He's absolutely world class at linking the defence to the attack, something we cannot do for the life of us. He's most effective in the middle of the pitch not in the final 3rd, the lack of movement from the strikers probably makes him try and do something himself.

4632~~~
Knowing us we'd sell him for £18m and sign Gundogan for £58m.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4634~~~
It got lost amongst all the silly over-reactionary drama about his dossier on long balls but LvG commented on Di Maria in today's presser.

4635~~~
I may be blasted for saying this, but I don't think he's particularly enjoying his time here. He'll be off within 2 Summers.

4636~~~
Not blasting you but, and a few have said this, why do you think that? I've seen no sign of this, so I'm either blind or people are seeing things that aren't real.

4637~~~
Everyone here lacks patience and is confined to doom, that's why. A month ortwo of bad form for our new player means he can't wait to get away.

4638~~~
I really struggle to explain why. I could simply be mixing it up with him just trying to adjust to the league, but from the way he's playing he just doesn't seem to be expressing himself. Whether that's due to tactics or just not enjoying life in England, I don't know.

4639~~~
True that. We see it with the forum and foreign players, it's a weird inferiority complex.

4640~~~
This is way too close to the bone to be funny.

4641~~~
Yep. Happens with all things regarding united on here. Last season has made everyone on here so annoyingly insecure and void of any sort of confidence that we get one good player and they think he'll run off first chance he gets.

4642~~~
Most fans here enjoyed the continuous success from SAF and they have not really experience not competing for the title. These people wants results immediately and therefore lacking in patience. You can see the joys of these people when Moyes got eradicated.

4643~~~
I don't think he'll be going anywhere this summer, but I don't think he'll be here for years and years, or that this is his last European move. 
I think he was signed/targeted by Woodward first and foremost. We wanted a marquee signing, and he was relatively convenient. It was convenient for all parties involved. 

That's probably why their seems to be little attachment. It feels more like a business transaction in a way.

4644~~~
What's with this weird fan obsession with selling off all our brand new players?

4645~~~
His head at the top of this page says he's got a 4 goals and 7 assists in 19 games, is that correct? Because that's a lot better than I was expecting, he's been pretty average which coincides with the average team we've seen lately.

4646~~~
Can't confirm whether those stats are true or not but I suspect they're very front-loaded. Looking at the most recent dozen games or so would not be quite so encouraging.

4647~~~
That's true. Started like a house on fire.

I miss that Di Maria.

4648~~~
So does the team!

4649~~~
Great ball for the 2nd goal, and another very dangerous ball earlier in the half, but I thought he was pretty poor again, first half. Directly at fault for the goal too. 

Only thing i could say in his defence is that once again the two lads up front are non existent. Only time we see Falcao is when he's giving the ball away. Has he kept hold of it more than twice?

4650~~~
Is he really that good? Yes he stood out for RM but that was a largely different role, essentially he was doing a lot of donkey work for Ronaldo, and doing it well. We need more from him at Utd, and I'm not sure he is really quite capable of providing it.

4651~~~
To the posts above 3 assists of the 7 were miss-hit shots. Mata vs QPR, Herrera vs Leicester, Falcao vs Everton.

4652~~~
Probably our only player who has created chances for us today. Needs to be given free reign on the wings to whip in those crosses.

4653~~~
No player would stick out in this side. Ronaldo would be invisible 9 out of 10 games I'm pretty sure

4654~~~
I doubt that.

4655~~~
In this side? Just think of how little we move the ball forwards with pace or how little we create.. He just wouldn't get on the ball enough or when he did, he'd have too many opponents in front of him

4656~~~
This is his best game in ages IMO. Not amazing but easily our best player.

4657~~~
He has been truly woeful in recent games.

4658~~~
He's definitely having a good game. His lame shooting is really annoying though.

4659~~~
Yeah he's been comfortably our best attacker.

4660~~~
Miles better this half

4661~~~
Well done, son.

4662~~~
He can play good after all, a few months late but at least it's a start.

4663~~~
Been very good in the Last 20minutes MOTM for me.

4664~~~
Playing well as a winger, no less.

4665~~~
Much better second half. The position doesn't matter, we have to accept that he'll be inconsistent and will have his great moments.

4666~~~
very very good tonight....playing him wide and he's been able to use his pace and great delivery from wide

I think our best formation is 4-2-3-1 with Rooney at 10 and Di Maria wide - finally getting behind their defence with a good chance of scoring

4667~~~
Yep, he's been our best attacker by a mile. His quality has finally shone through.

4668~~~
He just needs space. No matter where he plays if he can get at a player he's one of the very best in the world at getting past them. We need to make him the main man.

4669~~~
Pretty much all our good plays involved him in some way. All 4 of them.

4670~~~
Did well that second half. Drove forward with the ball at any given opportunity and in the end he's got us two goals.

But it was Burnley, and that performance was his best for a long long time. Has plenty to do in the coming weeks

4671~~~
Very good performance from him, loved him tracking back at around the 88th minute and the tackle he made which earned him a yellow, showed a bit of passion, funny how he seemed to play a lot better as a winger though.

4672~~~
I don't think "we" need to do anything. "He" needs to play like that more often. Such a good player when he's fired up like he was tonight. Think he was pissed off at the ref, which brought the best out of him.

4673~~~
He may not be 'at his best' out on the wing, but good lord you can't stop him with one defender. Would quite like to see him and Janujaz both stuck actually wide to stretch defences.

4674~~~
Was the reason we got into the opponents half. Great Performance. Looked good out wide today with 2 assists to boot

4675~~~
This. In the current diamond formation he'll find the most space out wide, not playing as a number 10. We as a team need to create the space for Di Maria.

4676~~~
Our best player. Better out wide imo

4677~~~
Our best player, by a mile.

4678~~~
I still feel his passing is very average. I don't know if he needs a bit of composure, that the pace of the league means he is rushing his passes a bit. But he does tend to give away a lot of possession in dangerous areas.

4679~~~
Cant wait for global warming to kick,Ice age in Spain,24/7 Sun in England.

4680~~~
His passing is sloppy as shit but he's a joy to watch running with that ball and after looking soft against West Ham it was good to see him playing with passion and tenacity tonight.

4681~~~
Fantastic in that second half. Back to his best. If he can keep it up I really fancy our chances of the top 4.

4682~~~
Grew into the game and was our most dangerous player. Hope that gives him a bit of confidence. If he had 2 proper midfielders behind him, he could really bring out his best

4683~~~
Very good second half, on the wing. As long as he's running at people, that's where he's at his best, midfield or as a winger, give him freedom and he'll produce.

4684~~~
Was great as a floating winger. Seemed to play wherever he wanted. Ran at players and caused problems. Won the penalty, got an assist, really should have scored. Decent.

4685~~~
He was a menace. Especially when wide in the 4-4-2.

Put in a shift too. Chasing down, shepherding out of goal-kick, and didn't shy away from putting himself about, including picking up a booking I couldn't be less arsed about.

4686~~~
Really did put a shift in taking players on, and bagged himself a few assists. Did he look like he doesn't want to be here tonight, guys??

4687~~~
Him and Januzaj the only good attacking players in the first half, while in the second he become really good, both attacking and defending wise. A huge difference is made when he can attack from a deep and has the freedom.

So long he decides to cross (brilliant crosser from open play) and not shoot, he should do really well.

4688~~~
Just got to get used to the inconsistency. Fantastic in the second half, finally felt like we had a player of United standard and ilk on the pitch, running at pace at defenders on the counter, great to watch.

4689~~~
Definitely. The thing I was most annoyed with in the West Ham game was his lack of usual tenacity and determination, but that was definitely back tonight. Hopefully he'll go from strength to strength from here. His impact on the game was undeniable even if he blows very hot and cold.

4690~~~
So. Can we put this crap about him needing to play in central midfield to bed?

4691~~~
I think basically he just needs to play in a position where he isn't backed up against defenders and having to hold up or shield the ball too often. As long as he has space to turn and burst up the field terrorising defenders, that is all that matters.

4692~~~
Was awful in the first half, him, Januzaj, Rooney and the inept duo up front constantly losing the ball or having problems with completing 5 yard passes constantly put our 'defenders' under threat and if it wasn't Burnley we would've ended the first half with like 5 conceded. Didn't like his lack of effort in chasing his (Adnan's?) right back for the first goal as well.

He's done well in the second half though, two assists from today, needs to feck off with those silly long range shots though.

4693~~~
Had a good game today, finally. Bit soon to say he turned the corner though.

4694~~~
Probably our best performer today, but didn't really have much competition, to be honest.

4695~~~
Thought he was much improved today. Looked dangerous driving forward with the ball, and will be a huge danger in games where we  play a more a counter-attacking style.

4696~~~
Good performance today, and he keeps on getting assists when playing cm.

4697~~~
More of that please.

4698~~~
His passing accuracy is really awful. If we criticise anyone for giving the ball away too often it's him. He's still trying things too much but is getting better slowly. He was one of our better players though and I liked how he tracked back and won the ball at our corner in the second half..

4699~~~
Wasn't great, but showed very positive signs in the second half when played on the right wing. The way he countered was reminiscent of the way we used to play with wingers. Hope to see more of this.

4700~~~
As pish as he was in the first half, the 2nd half was great just for that feeling of watching him run at and commit the defenders.  We found him on the counter and he ate up the pitch towards goal.  Hopefully getting back to his best and after months of shunting him centrally and up front, please can we keep him wide.

4701~~~
Thought he was very good. The only one of your players who looked a threat going forward and he was your best outfield player by a mile.

4702~~~
Very good second half, much improved upon a pretty poor first. More of the same please.

4703~~~
This game showed as much as any how he needs space to run with the ball to be at his best and for us to play at a quick tempo and get the ball to him quickly. First half was still dangerous but second half was much better all around with Herrera on getting the ball to him in situations where the others would just pass it to the back 4.

4704~~~
Was impressed with his work rate in the 2nd half. Definitely a better performance. Nothing spectacular, but decent enough. Hope he can just keep improving now.

4705~~~
A real positive tonight, thought he was excellent in the 2nd half. Much more confident running with the ball and committing defenders which his how he won the penalty. Lovely assist for the second goal too.

If he can maintain this sort  of form it would make such a difference to our play.

4706~~~
Always looked to come centrally and as a result made things happen.*

*Based on the the second half, missed the first.

4707~~~
That was a bit more like it.

4708~~~
More of the same please. Much better tonight but can still do more.

4709~~~
He certainly grew in confidence in the 2nd half and that was more like what we want to see from him. His dribbles and runs inside the box were something we missed from our players for a while.

I hope his teammates will take notes on how he attacked the box. Defenders will eventually bite if our players do that inside the box.

4710~~~
I have said all season that he needs to play in a midfield three, but I am wondering whether that is actually an option at the minute. We do not have the players in front of him to create the space/make the runs which enabled him to be so good last season.

Considering form, etc. I would put him on the wing with Januzaj on the other and with Mata at CAM and Rooney up top. With Blind and Herrera in behind, we would probably see some very very good performances, especially from Di Maria, who will be less congested on the wing. 

If we were to get some top wingers/wide forwards in the summer he can go back to CM, but at the minute both he and Rooney are wasted in the 442 diamond.

4711~~~
I'm excited every time he receives the ball. Yes he can be wasteful and hasn't reached the heights of his first few weeks but my god we would be so boring to watch if he wasn't here. Our games would probably be R-rated.

4712~~~
He was everywhere today, great effort from him.

4713~~~
R-Rated just means for adults, its not quality <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4714~~~
I know what it means, it would be a harmful viewing for little souls <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4715~~~
I see, those with a lily-livered disposition?

4716~~~
So no body language experts today who want to claim how he doesn't look happy and will be off in the summer? Good ... until of course he has a "difficult" game again, but at least until then I can enjoy this thread.

4717~~~
Only body language I saw from him was an ecstatic fist pump when he won the penalty like it was guaranteed United would score form it. Probably used to Ronaldo constantly scoring them back in Madrid <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4718~~~
If you looked closely at his runs, he clearly leans slightly in the direction of Paris.

4719~~~
Looks like he enjoyed himself tonight, I thought he was unhappy? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4720~~~
When he gets back to the hotel and his wife is Still bitching about the break in he may not enjoy that so much <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4721~~~
He won the penalty didn't he? Does anybody have a gif of the run?

4722~~~
My MOTM, he put in a lot of effort and caused mayhem when he ran at them. I hope he gets over his personal problem and starts getting back on track!

4723~~~
This goes to show the Premier Leagues superiority.. In Spain he was winning games by himself and if not, had Ronaldo there to clean up.  Needs to be quicker with and without the ball coming back..  Specially when we have Rooney playing as a 6..

4724~~~
His decision making let him down again. At one point he had three United players in the box against one defender, and for some reason tried to corss the ball with the outside of his foot when the angle he was running at meant he didn't have to. I seriously can't believe how stupid he is at times...he's worse than Nani when it comes to stuff like that.

On the other hand he managed to be our best player in spite of this.

Him and Januzaj would be good playing from either side as wide players in support of the front man. Pity we have a maniacle spanner as a manager. He'll drop one of them soon so he can carry on playing some kind of unworkable formation.

4725~~~
I wasn't overly impressed, to be honest.

He's a danger on the ball, but too often he slowed the play and it led to nothing. He also can't fecking pass. And other than the assist, his crossing was shite. In fact his range of passing is shocking for a supposed midfielder. I was willing to accept that his natural position was in the middle of the park because I rarely watched him for Real, but the guy doesn't have the technique of a Paul Scholes or Xavi. Let him loose in the opposition half and he becomes a different proposition. The problem is that he isn't going to play there as long as we go two up front.

4726~~~
You're serious ? I hope not.

4727~~~
Loved his performance yesterday

4728~~~
You thought he was the completely wrong type of midfielder then. He's not a center mid per se, he's at his best playing a half through the middle, half wider role where he has the freedom to run with the ball from deep and link the midfield and attack. He's not a player who dictates tempo or does simple passes, he runs with it and picks out through passes to the forwards making runs almost as good as anyone in the world. 

His crossing was really good as well, not sure what you're on about. Not his fault falcao and Van Persie have been weak and useless in the air or don't put the extra bit of effort to get themselves in the right positions. Di marias crosses were poor vs West Ham but pretty much exactly what you want from your winger every time today.

4729~~~
That outside the boot cross still ended up being a really dangerous cross that the defender did well to clear without scoring an own goal. He is really one footed though which is why he went with the outside of the boot instead of doing a normal right footed one, and it's a bit annoying at times but he's always been really one footed and does a fair bit of rabonas instead of just using his weaker foot.

4730~~~
This. Thank you. Some of the crosses he put in yesterday were bloody brilliant.

4731~~~
4:16 Ball too straight and in front of the defenders
18:02 Too high, looping and easy to defend
19:10 Good cross, tbf
26:14 Shite. No elevation
30:55 Straight into Trippier's legs
46:56 Mis-kicked it about 30 yards into the sky
47:24 Cross for the goal. Good
65:22 Shite. Along the ground into about 3 defenders
75:32 We had 3vs2 and he missed them all
86:19 Counter-attack with Wilson storming into the box. Completely fluffed his lines. Certain goal if he'd found him. Couldn't even beat the first man.

2 good crosses.

I can't believe I just rewatched all of that. I'm wasting my life.

4732~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fair play, can't be arsed re watching anything from that turgid game other then the goals but from what I remember, most of his crosses seemed dangerous and if we had strikers with better movement or a better leap and not just half hearted attempts, we could have had a few more.

4733~~~
He was excellent last night and that performance reminded me of the performances he put in at the start of the season. Hopefully now he's found his form again.

4734~~~
I'm not sure he's consistent enough to succeed playing 'philosophy'. Louis is not adverse to having a player who plays "outside the lines" so to speak, but that individual has to be consistent in what they do ala Robben.

4735~~~
4 goals and 9 assists, not bad going at all in his 6 months.

4736~~~
That in a team not playing very well too.

4737~~~
Yes but it shouldn't have been a dangerous ball which the defender struggled to clear, it should have just been passed on to one of the unmarked United player's heads. He had a choice of players to pick out with relatively easy balls ffs, and managed to find the only Burnley player in the box because of his compelling need to try and do something flash.

Don't get me wrong I thought he played well and his work rate is fantastic, but he needs to cut shite like that out.

4738~~~
I enjoyed the part where he got kicked, didn't get the foul, got up and went into a stupid challenge that resulted in a yellow card. I honestly liked that, it showed a bit of fight and grit I didn't know he had in him. This was just before or just after a huge run back from an attacking position where he sheperded a ball out of play against a Burnley player.

Overall thought it was a very good performance by him!

4739~~~
I've heard people and reports saying he isn't happy at United but it was good to see his reaction after all the goals last night. He was visibly delighted when each one went in.

4740~~~
He won the UCL last year I'm sure hes not happy with things at the moment, and thats only natural. Doesn't mean he doesn't want to stay and improve things and help us get back to where we belong. If he was happy with the current state I would be worried, I hope none of the players and the manager are happy with it.

4741~~~
Was good yesterday, slowly getting back into his groove, he was unplayable at the start of the season so he is capable in this league.

4742~~~
Definitely his best game in ages. Really liked the way he seemed so fired up and worked so hard. Agree with the comments about his final delivery, though. Extremely hit and miss. More miss than hit, if we're honest. That pass he cocked up when Wilson would have been in acres of spaces was really terrible for a player with his reputation. Still, baby steps. Hopefully something for him to build on from here. I've made the comparison with Nani before and I think it's still valid but I prefer his dribbling style to Nani's. None of that stop start crap which must make it a fecking nightmare staying onside. Just a shimmy of the hips and he's burned past them at full speed. Great fun to watch.

4743~~~
He has the worst pass completion ratio in a World cup game, I think ?

4744~~~
Good assesment, since half the people on here apparently can't remember what's actually happened during a match.

In the end Angel helped us to win. But him losing that ball when Burnley scored put so much pressure on our team, it cost us the first half because it gave Burnley confidence and initiative. Especially if you're playing in a team with Paddy as a right back, Evans & Rojo who looked pretty clueless, a midfield one + Rooney, make two early subs. You can't do that if you're one of the experienced, Champions League winning players. Especially since it wasn't the first time this season he started a match poorly, giving away balls for no reason.

He made up for his mistake though, fought himself back in the match with the assist and the penalty, so I'm not too bothered with him.

4745~~~
Hard to believe that some people are criticising him for last night, I have no idea what such people expect from him.

4746~~~
Player with the balls to try and make things happen, isn't always going to get it right, but when he does it usually leads to a good chance or a goal. Issue is there is quite a bit of pressure on him to produce since most of the rest of the team don't seem to have the balls or the leeway to try and make things happen. You need more than one risk taker in the team to ease the burden and allow their game to flow.

Its no suprise his better games came when Rooney played a more advanced role and Herrera was playing too.

4747~~~
He goes for it. Doesn't always happen for him but he has the ability. And good too see he is taking responsibility to create.

4748~~~
consistent well played football matches. he didn't have a great match he had a very good second half , 45 mins of good football in the last few matches isn't good enough.

4749~~~
We need to see more of this from him and the team in general. The pass from Herrera and subsequent run into the box from AdM was much more aggressive than what we've seen recently.

Burnley were tired by that point, which may all have been part of the master plan, but it would certainly be nice to us mix up the approach a bit. Obviously I don't want to go down the "long ball" route, but balls in the channels for the wingers/forwards to attack. RvP and Falcao aren't quick enough to get in behind, so something has to change, and AdM up front wasn't the answer either.

Hopefully LvG saw what happened when he switched the system and will make the changes needed for the next match.

4750~~~
In facts, he had one assist and won a penalty. If you’re relying on statistic he was good yesterday.

But in my opinion, he wasn’t good enough because of the system, and a bit the philosophy.

In the diamond shape, the two wide men, Di Maria and Rooney, have to play centrally when we have the ball, bombing forward for Di Maria, and the must play wide (to counter the full backs) when we lost the ball.

The PHILOSOPHY (it’s important to understand that), include 4 steps, in which Di Maria is great in 3 I would say. He’s one of the best in offensive transition (when we get the ball back), very good when we’re attacking, and always in place when we’re in defensive position…. When he’s less concerned is  when we lose the ball, the example of Burnley goal yesterday. At Madrid, he was surrounded and protected by Marcelo, Xabi Alonso, Modric, and had a winger, in Ronaldo, closing, a bit yes, the full back, but he was more focused on the 2 part of the PHILOSOPHY

I really think that we have to build a team around him, exploiting his flashes the best way we can. Right now, he’s just good when we’re counter attacking, and probably why LVG tried him upfront. I would hope we buy another great midfielder to control more the ball, so Angel can play more freely and hurt midfielders by pace and penetration.

To get back at yesterday, he had too much ground to cover, and I’m sorry but Evans, Blind and Rojo didn’t helped him much, so he had to come inside and go left too many times as we didn’t had enough control of the ball and the tempo. I didn’t like his first half in terms of pressure and activity….

The thing is that when he played wide in second half, he was better, and more natural. Not as good as his preferred position, but nevertheless, he was better and played better. For the sake of the team LVG should just play players at their natural (almost) position.

4751~~~
In a dysfunctional team his performance yesterday was more than good enough. 

Glad he played well. Hopefully it gives him confidence to adapt quicker

4752~~~
If I was left footed and in that position, I would have likely tried the same type of pass/cross. Go and re watch that moment again please, he either had to cross it or pull it back, and no one was there for a pull back. The cross itself wasn't even bad and would have been a goal if their defender didn't clear it. 

He delivered a similar cross for Aguero I think back in November and everyone creamed themselves over it...

4753~~~
Sometimes playing the ball with the outside of the boot is the most natural thing you can do in a position, (when your avoiding using your weaker foot). Haven't seen the incident, but it doesn't neccesarily mean he was trying to be flash.

4754~~~
I no problem with Di Maria trying flash passes. It's the nature of that type of player, once who you want to watch. I'd much rather him be doing things like that, in those positions than what we've seen of him in his last half a dozen games or so before.

4755~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQ-1d4rWQmU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4756~~~
It was a decent enough cross. Kind of bugs when people are so one footed they use the outside of their foot in a really flashy way (think Quaresma) but curling the ball with the outside of your foot is a legitimate technique in football and he actually delivered a dangerous cross. A lot better than some of the crosses he hit with his instep anyway!

EDIT: 05:10s on the video above

4757~~~
Can't watch youtube videos at work so I'll have another look later. I seem to remember him having enough time to basically cross it however he wanted to. I wouldn't consider a decent cross to be one that misses all of your own team mates and finds a defender though...especially not when your team mates outnumber the defenders and aren't even being marked by anyone. That goes down as a fecked up chance.

In fact, it flew over Wilson's head and he was in front of the defender who cleared it. So yeah, piss poor cross.

4758~~~
Yeah can't see much wrong with what he did there tbh.

4759~~~
Why do you constantly make stuff up to back up wildly exaggerated points? 

There were three United players in the box. Wilson was being well marked and their second defender split the remaining two players and made an excellent clearance. Good defending.

4760~~~
I don't. I've just watched it and our players outnumbered Burnley's. Wilson was in front of his man and would have had a scoring chance if the ball hadn't been put over his head, and no one else was being properly picked up. It should have ended in a goal. It's as simple as really. The defender did well in a desperate situation but he shouldn't have been given the chance to clear it.

I don't get why it's so hard to accept that. There's a video of it right there. As well as the whole general point of Di Maria's decision making being really bad, because it is. He tries passes or shots that just aren't on all too often.

4761~~~
I think for that cross he almost had too many choices. Instead of properly picking out 1 of them, he just sort of put it "in the area" for somebody to get on the end of. If it was just RVP or just Wilson I think it would have been more accurate. It all happens so fast though so what looks an easy cross can easily be misjudged, it's tiny margins that make it a good or bad cross.

4762~~~
Seems like hes specifically played it for the guy at the back post who called for the ball by raising his hands to me. Didn't quite get enough height on it and the defender did a job of clearing the danger.

4763~~~
He got an assist, won a penalty and created havoc in the Burnley defense. He was also directly responsible for the Burnley goal and is, in general, a defensive liability. As the good book says, "the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away" - you need to be able to manage the fall out from his accidents to get maximum benefit from his positives.

4764~~~
Are you talking about the cross that he plays at 5.10 in the video? Watch it again. Wilson is nowhere near in front of his man as you call it. He's 2 yards behind him at 5.12 in that video when Di Maria goes to play it. You really are making things up, or just misremembering them.

4765~~~
Yeah I just watched it again as well, during the game I thought it was a lot more open then that but they covered well looking back and Wilson wasn't open at all, the only option was to go for Van Persie at the back post and the outside of the foot thing was a pretty normal option right there.

4766~~~
Yup, have to agree. Thought he played well and put in a few dangerous crosses overall. He made a few pretty glaring mistakes also, but at least he was trying stuff. All that recycling of possession gets pretty boring after a while, so it's nice to see someone try something, even if they mess it up!

4767~~~
Looks unhappy and uninterested. Clearly has a heart set on PSG.

I think he is happy, he's getting paid the money he wanted at Madrid.

4769~~~
Re: the cross. If Smalling had enough gas left in the tank after his surge forward to burst past the penalty spot and into the six yard box, then the ball was his to head at goal unopposed. I fail to see how Di Maria can be criticised there. A good defensive clearance under the circumstances.

4770~~~
Think we should play Di Maria on the right wing more often so he can cut inside on his left foot and shoot more often like Robben.

4771~~~
I reckon, if he is to play out wide, he would be far more effective down the left. Not to say he doesn't have it in him to cut inside but I think he offers a lot more in wide areas as a tradition winger and has a great delivery (from open play not corners).

4772~~~
Robben is second only to Messi when cutting inside from the right to shoot with his left some may argue that hes better! Di Maria on the other hand has a pretty average some times terrible shot its a bit infuriating how many attempts he makes during a game which contribute to him giving the ball away.

4773~~~
My housemate thinks he looks like Dobby from the Harry Potter movies. 

She's got a point. 

And always nice to hear a female perspective on the game.

4774~~~
Is he playing for £260k a week or a sock?

4775~~~
Feel sorry for him, pure average playing around him (rooney, falcao, fellaini)

4776~~~
He's picked out 4/5 very good passes so far. Just a shame it's not Ronaldo that's on the end of them <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4777~~~
The only positive of that half. I think he might be the only one who remembered that this isn't rugby and forward passes are allowed.

4778~~~
He's been our best player comfortably. Not that Martin Keown will notice as he'd decided before the game he was going to be shit and Rooney was man of the match.

4779~~~
He creates chances for fun, pity the forwards are doing nothing with them.

4780~~~
He is slowly coming back in to form...

4781~~~
He might aswell have Hagridd upfront with him..

4782~~~
Is he having a laugh?!

4783~~~
Worrying thing is that he's been our best player the last few games and he's still only putting in above average performances.

4784~~~
Did he even look up then when he seemed to aimlessly fire the ball across? Poor tonight

4785~~~
I was impressed with his running tonight. End product was really lacking though.

4786~~~
Decent game. Nothing more, nothing less. At least he tries to make things happen.

4787~~~
Wouldn't say he was poor. In fact he was our main creative source for the majority of the game until the substitution, he will get even better once he gets a bit of movement from the forwards.

4788~~~
This, players like him will frustrate. His running with the ball is a joy to watch though.

4789~~~
Works his balls off. When he's central we look a bit like a team of players who know he's by far the most gifted on the pitch, so we're just relying on him to do everything.

4790~~~
He was easily our best attacking player in the first half. Luckily others raised their game in the second.

4791~~~
He does work hard and is persistent but annoyed how his dip in his dribbling ability a little bit. Especially since the start of the season when he looked most dangerous when he was quicker, sharper, dribble-ier.

4792~~~
Played well for most part of the game and is slowly getting back to his best

4793~~~
Was he playing on the right in the second half? He looked pretty good there.

4794~~~
Much better tonight

4795~~~
Get the end product sorted and we will truly be seeing some results.

4796~~~
Great in the first half but his performance dropped in the second. This has happened several times this season.

4797~~~
Some good passes that should have led to a proper shot at goal at least, and some strong runs, he looks back up to speed mentally and physically, just needs to be less sloppy at times, not every touch or pass needs to be risky, love watching him play though.

Yes, pretty much the way he played in that friendly where he tore Germany apart just after the season started.

4798~~~
Improving but would still expect more against lower league opposition. Just a matter of time, I'm sure.

4799~~~
Bof.

4800~~~
He's a strange player. Will pull off some sublime stuff and then misplace a simple pass or fire a cross straight out of play.

4801~~~
Loved that spell at the end where he was pressing their defenders from the front. Against Burnley at the end he tracked their player to our LB position to win a goalkick at 3-1. And still people say he doesn't look interested.

4802~~~
For the player he is, he had horrible end-product tonight. Kind of been the story of the season for him, just inconsistent end-product.

4803~~~
Thought he did quite well in the second half? Did quite well all around really, was comfortably our best player on the night. Only one making things happen in the first half and kept being a threat in the second when the rest of the team picked up. Looks very good on the right cutting in. Shame that one pass from Rooney was slightly overhit and the keeper came out in time.

4804~~~
One or two lovely crosses but overall sloppy and poor.

There are flashes of brilliance from him but it's just not enough. Has to improve.

4805~~~
When you give Di Maria room to run at people he's a menace. The balance of the side wasn't good enough to get the best out of him first half, cutting in off the right in the second half though he looked a constant threat. If Van Gaal can set us up to play in a way that emphasises Di Maria's strengths we'll have a super player on our hands.

4806~~~
Hasn't that been the story of his career though? I suspect we're going to have to get used to a lot of wastefulness. By all accounts that's just the way he is.

4807~~~
He appears to be the only player van Gaal dictates complete creative freedom to on the pitch.

4808~~~
Can anyone who watched him at Madrid tell me if he scored a lot of long range goals at Madrid and Benfica? He tries them all the time here and he's fecking shocking at them. It's like being the most expensive player has convinced him he needs to do all of these things.

4809~~~
Remember the beginning of the season when he shanked a couple across the box which we scored from and people were arguing they were brilliant crosses?

4810~~~
It's probably pent up demand from all the times in Madrid where he wanted Ronaldo take pops at goal from pretty much anywhere in the opposition half <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4811~~~
Why has he started to sit so deep? He's best when he's running with the ball and he's not doing enough of it at the moment.

4812~~~
I think Van Gaal wants him to be more of a goalscorer here. Though he is really good at opening up space for himself to get off a shot and he does get good power behind the shot. Just the direction tends to be off. Thought his shot selection has been a lot better the last couple of games though. 
From memory though, he did score a few really good long range goals, clearly capable of it, just inconsistent in his shooting.

4813~~~
He's the playmaker.

4814~~~
Didn't really have many chances to shoot far away for Madrid. He did try though, often with his right foot. It's not surprising to see that he's shooting more now as he has the opportunity with his left. He's no Ronaldo though. You've gotta have goals on your record to justify these many attempts.

4815~~~
He made some super-passes and yes he fails some but that is what you get with having a player trying to make things happen.

4816~~~
I liked the part how he pressed high to win the ball up the pitch when it was already 3:0 This guy has got energy but need to use it more. Him Herrera and Blind covering is a great midfield trio but little bit more of enthusiasm would be great. That's why I'm glad Herrera's back in the side hopefully..

technically he's great to watch but sometimes too many mishit passes. But he will get better hopefully

4817~~~
9 assists and 4 goals in 21 games looks alright to me actually, for someone who has had his ups and downs this season.

4818~~~
He threaded a number of excellent through balls tonight don't forget. With a more lethal striker up front tonight he would have bagged a couple of nice assists with no problem. He was far and away our most threatening player on the night. Some people focus so much on the wayward efforts/failed ambitious passes and forget the good things. Yet complain when we play super safe and slow.

4819~~~
He's been a brilliant signing. Has the odd brainfart here and there but overall he's a constant menace to defenders and never stops trying to create. We should just let him do his thing and build the rest of the team around him.

4820~~~
I wish we would play him in his natural position in the center of attack although hes really our only main option as a winger

4821~~~
He seems a bit selfish at times and you can see that it hasnt clicked with his team mates yet. Still a great signing and once it starts working, it will be great <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4822~~~
Much more than my recollection of him at Real, I guess he really feels like the big man in the team. Which is a bit of a shame, because he's at his most lethal when he's linking up with others and he's better at providing a final ball than scoring himself. His 30 yards shots are a bit boring, he'll probably score one screamer this season, but he's wasted quite a few interesting balls up front.

Thought he was good last night and we've seen improvement over the past few weeks, so that's great. And as I said in the Rooney thread, I feel they both link up very well so I hope we get to see more of that partnership.

4823~~~
I think I'm going to resign myself to him being a slightly better version of Nani. Will be loads of poor decisions and inexplicably poor moments in every game but will also be a constant threat and always capable of winning the game for us. Not quite what you'd want/expect from the most expensive player in the history of the Premier League but a valuable player to have in our team nonetheless.

4824~~~
That's not his natural position at all unless I understood it wrong.

4825~~~
He was definitely greedy at Madrid, at least in his early years up till last season. He'd often go for shots when a pass is on

4826~~~
Thought he played well, he just needs to get that weight of pass nailed down a bit better. Was unlucky when playing Rooney through on goal as the run and pass was fine, just over hit it. Then again he's used to Ronaldo and Bale running onto them, so it's not a surprise <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4827~~~
Last time we insisted on playing Nani through the good and bad form he played much better than di Maria. He was more consistent too during that time.

4828~~~
He was also playing for a much much better team. So you can't really compare.

4829~~~
Tbf Nani played for a manager who encouraged his whole team to take risks, whereas Di Maria is almost the only one trying out something for us. Whenever Herrera tries to take risks he is awarded with bench time for the next 2 months.

And similar to Nani at his best is a great thing anyway, we all know how good Nani was at his best.

4830~~~
The weird thing is, in this side, Nani could be ideal. He doesn't really need to be playing well to be reasonably productive in terms of goals, or more often, assists. I mean, if you're going to watch shit on a stick football, probably better to have someone who tends to get you a dozen or more assists every season.

4831~~~
You didn't really think that through, did you? If taking risks = being benched, why is Di Maria starting every game?

4832~~~
I thought it through Mr smart. 

Di Maria is our record signing and thus undroppable (along with Rooney). But what I meant was there's not much coming out of him taking risks if his teammates are adviced to avoid taking risks, he can't do everything on his own. He has still been out best attacking player. If he was playing under Fergie with his team mates supporting him in the attack much more, he would have much more assists and chances created for us than he already has.

4833~~~
I like him down the right when he found himself in those areas. Lacked a bit of end product but looked dangerous at times.

4834~~~
I've tried pointing this out a few times while explaining why I think Herrera is overlooked by Van Gaal. 

1 risk taking creative midfielder = ok. 
2 risk taking midfielders = a liability. 

To add to that..

1 risk taking creative, attacking midfielder = ok but needs a player who counter balances his risk taking. 
2 risk taking midfielders = added risk and still no balance for the other creative midfielder.

4835~~~
I think the Giggs comparison is probably better - Nani slowed down the play everytime he got the ball, took far too many touches. Di Maria always goes for the kill everytime he gets the ball - more similar to Giggs IMO. Leads to some frustrating moments but some moments of brilliance too. I don't mind that at the moment, this team could do with the excitement.

4836~~~
None of that explains why Van Gaal has repeatedly played Di Maria and Mata, or Di Maria and Januzaj in the same team. In fact, he's played one of those two pairings in almost every game we've played this season.

4837~~~
Yes. Agree with that. Di Maria is much more progressive than Nani, which makes him much less frustrating (even though his final ball seems similarly hit and miss)

4838~~~
It's a different scenario, I know, I just know that Nani was never afforded this much freedom by his manager and yet when he was afforded just bit freedom he was as good as di Maria at his best.

4839~~~
Not sure he was as good as Di Maria at his best (last seasons Di Maria) but he was definately bloody good. Best winger in the EPL he was no doubt.

4840~~~
Finally, someone who agrees with me.

Di Maria is the only one taking shots, the only one trying through balls and the only one dribbling, in the whole team! He is our lone creative spark.Only Cesc I think has more assists than him in the league, and Cesc takes every free-kick and corner for Chelsea.

We simply need him in the team, because everyone else bar maybe Herrera, are too busy playing it safe. Rooney had a very good shot on him but how often do we ever get to see it nowadays? When was the last time RVP had a shot from outside the box?

4841~~~
Because they haven't both been part of the midfield 3 at the same time. They certainly haven't all three played together.

It's been:

Replace Rooney for Fellaini where necessary.

It's always been:

1 DM: Blind or Carrick
1 B2B: Rooney or Fellaini
1 AM/Wide Midfielder: Di Maria or Januzaj
1 #10: Mata, Di Maria, Rooney or Herrera

Herrera was tried as the B2B early on but it seems Van Gaal didn't think of him as complete/physical/defensive enough for that role.

He either battles it out with Di Maria or Mata for the #10, depending on the composition the of 3 behind him or he battles it out with Di Maria or Januzaj for the AM/WM role, both of whom carry the ball forward better and add genuine width and pace to an otherwise narrow formation.

4842~~~
That's definately not true, but I agree with your point though.

4843~~~
That's a very simplistic way to look at it. Nani was afforded just as much freedom as Di Maria for long periods before and after his 18 month hot streak and was maddeningly inconsistent. Di Maria's been up and down but his downs have been nowhere near as poor as Nani during his most hapless spells in a United shirt. Something which is getting glossed over by his many fans on here, ever since he went back to Portugal.

4844~~~
I thought Di Maria was dogshit last night , his passing was shite

4845~~~
Probably because he's our only attacking player who has the combination of pace, dribbling and incisive passing on the team and is a genuine threat on the ball, bar Januzaj who's not an established first teamer and is still raw.

Di Maria's still extremely patchy which is quite annoying but at least it's better than some of the passive stuff we are seeing from some of his fellow forwards. He's the only player who looks like he can make something happen on the ball and actually excites fans when in possession. 

Play Rooney in Di Maria's role with full freedom and he'd probably create feckall with his technique and vision. He's an excellent goalscoring forward with good link up play (further forward) nonetheless. Mata sadly enough, seems to lack that dynamism and verve, thus needing the right system to truly thrive.

Kind of pathetic that Rooney's bang average performance against Preston, was one of the better performances from our strikers in a good while. Hopefully the RVP-Falcao nonsense stops and Rooney's runs up front would provide Di Maria with a better platform to shine. Just imagine playing with pacey forwards like Ronaldo, Bale, Jese and Benzema to playing with RVP, Rooney and Falcao... Rooney still possesses decent pace and can be useful in this regard, but only when he doesn't play like a baby elephant controlling the ball and actually tries to take on players. He still has it in his locker (against City and the penalty against Preston) but lacks the nifty footwork which coupled with the loss of his early days dynamism, means he isn't a great threat on the ball despite his decent pace.

Di Maria's got to improve his individual performances as well, no two ways about it. He was pretty damn good early on in the season and needs to replicate that form. Looks like he might be getting back to it, hopefully.

4846~~~
Nani was criminally underrated by Fergy and paid for his versatility too. Valencia could only ever play RW so therefore, Nani had to fight for his place with Young (LW) whilst Valencia had a clear run on the right.

I also get the feeling that players like Valencia are super efficient in training and great at the drills so therefore managers find it easier to justify selecting them. Could be wrong though...

4847~~~
I agree. If only we had more players doing so.

4848~~~
That's definitely not true. Di Maria probably had already few games this season which could be in contest for worst performances of the season by United player, even though manager played him all the time and trusted him. Nani had lot of poor games, I am not denying it, but whenever he was given run they were never worse than some performances di Maria put in just 6 months here. Nani's worst performances came over last two seasons at United where was being played once in ten games. Nani's worst performance in last 4 or 5 years was against Chelsea away I think 2 years back, and it's definitely not any worse than di Maria's one or two performance in december/january.

4849~~~
Yeah, I agree. Valencia was basically starter for two years for us on wing because he was good defensively, which is ridiculous because he waa terrible attackink wise.

4850~~~
Sometimes I think we don't derserve flair players the way somepeople go on, we should just sign robots who make the right pass at the right time all the time.

4851~~~
Thought he did well yesterday, really dangerous when running at players, the only player who gives us any penetration to be honest. His final ball can improve and it will as he has shown for Madrid. Despite not being at his best he's still racked up a good tally of assists.

4852~~~
Injured his pelvis in training according to the Daily Mail.

4853~~~
FFS

4854~~~
Was he? He put up good assist numbers and was generally a good outlet for us, and often had the beating of supposed good full backs. It was only really his last season under Fergie that he was poor. He'd had a poor spell of form after his injury but mostly he deserved his spot under Fergie.

4855~~~
This sounds like the same injury that kept him out for weeks earlier in the season. 

Lucky that Young is fit again.

4856~~~
Last season under Fergie and then the following one under Moyes I'm guessing are the 2 years he's referring to.

4857~~~
Oh right, maybe. It's cause he quoted a post talking about Fergie that made me think otherwise.

4858~~~
This doesn't seem to be anywhere else, and I clicked on the Mail link and it goes through to a different story.

4859~~~
Would we have trained the day after a match?

4860~~~
Yeah, I was talking about those two seasons.

4861~~~
What???  It's in the paper!

4862~~~
Yeah looks like they've removed the story.

4863~~~
Yeah they've changed the story, its not on there now? False alarm? Or maybe just tidying up links and it'll reappear shortly.

4864~~~
Possibly, but I can't see it on the Mail anymore and the old link goes through to a different story. 

Not saying it isn't true but can't see it anywhere else.

4865~~~
His assists seem to range from 7-9 on various stat websites. Baines has 8, so dependent on which site you consider, he's second in the league, or at the very least joint third with Tadic.

4866~~~
He wasn't terrible offensively between 2010 and 2012, he produced very solid performances week in week out even if he wasn't particularly exciting to watch. It's only in 2012-13 that he started to become worse and worse going forward which culminated in a horrid 2013-14 season.

4867~~~
Not sure how they've managed to print a paper this morning, and find out Di Maria was injured in training which probably didn't finish until 11 this morning?. Sounds like BS to me. Perhaps somebody posted the article by accident.

4868~~~
It wasn't between 2010 and 2012, I was referring to Fergie's last season and Moyes' only season in which he was absolutely terrible attacking wise.

4869~~~
Sorry, someone above said they were reporting it in the Mail (a British newspaper). Looks like they might have been looking at an old edition though!  He had a pelvic injury in training earlier in the season.

4870~~~
It was on Mail Online about an hour ago, however the link is now directed through to a different story, perhaps they heard something, it isn't clear at the moment, not reported anywhere else though.

4871~~~
Nani di Maria

4872~~~
I didn't realise, in that case I agree. He produced very little to nothing in these seasons.

4873~~~
This is all I can find on line 

Di Maria helped United beat Preston 3-1 last night to set up an FA Cup quarter-final showdown with Arsenal.

But the Argentina winger could be an early doubt for that game after picking up another injury.

According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, Di Maria hurt his pelvis in the warm-up for training today.

4874~~~
I guess some sites are counting winning a penalty as an assist, which is fair enough.

There are quite a few players on 7 & 8 btw so its not joint thrid at all:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/23/statistics/assists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/23/statistics/assists</a>

4875~~~
The Google link I found for Daily Mail leads to a different article and one other link goes to an article that was taken down.  No confirm from the club.

4876~~~
I like where he played yesterday. I thought he was our best player alongside Fellaini and Herrara.

The deepish role he played must be so hard for teams to stop. He was putting in through balls and crosses (although his crosses were absolute shit) and was running at players too. That combination coming from midfield is devastating.

4877~~~
It seems LvG had enough trying to fit him elsewhere and will stick with him in the left of the diamond. Aleluya!!! (now he needs to sort the rest of the wrong placed players)

Hopefully, Luke Shaw can stay fit for a good run because they need to build a little society between them.

4878~~~
Has he injured himself in training or something?

4879~~~
A story appeared on the daily mail saying that yesterday, then disappeared shortly after. No other reference to it floating around so it must have been bad info.

4880~~~
Good, just when he's starting to hit some form.

4881~~~
Not letting him away with that, fecking terrible.

4882~~~
Yeah he was generally awful today, looks like his heart isn't in it.

4883~~~
He seems to struggle in this league, in this place. I'm worried.

4884~~~
Get Nani back??

4885~~~
The grass is always greener.

4886~~~
He had an assist and played poorly. The most of you have deemed that acceptable, at least when we're talking the last few seasons of Wayne Rooney. Both need to do much more.

4887~~~
Don't watch games on stream so haven't seen today's match, but this season.

Di Maria
79% passing
2.2 chances created
0.6 tackles
3 goals
26 years of age

Rodriguez
87% passing
2.5 chances created
1.6 tackles
8 goals
23 years of age

4888~~~
Very lightweight. Got ousted off the ball with ease a lot. A good assist and some good crosses, but he is very weak.

4889~~~
Play him on the left wing (or the right wing) and watch him thrive. But oh no, that's much to obvious to our manager.

It amazes me why we insist on putting our best crosser of the ball in a central position? Why not have balance by playing two wingers and one (or two) strikers? Surely we would be much better off and more balanced than playing this diamond horseshit where everyone doesn't know what to do when defending.

Di Maria is being wasted in a central midfield position. This isn't la liga where you are given time on the ball to stroll around. This is the prem and Di Maria needs to be shifted to the wing where he can run at a fullback rather than into a crowd of bodybuilders.

4890~~~
60million. fecking hell. What has LVG done to him that he's lost all his early season form?

4891~~~
Said it before, I'd like us to try a game without him in the side. Just to see if he really adds that much to our play.

His end product is beyond shocking. £60m? Fecking hell.

4892~~~
£60m.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4893~~~
Really average today, I don't know why he's playing wide left, if you are gonna start him wide then it has to be on the right where he can cut in.

4894~~~
Did you leave out assists to perpetuate your agenda?
-
His form is seriously worrying, though.

4895~~~
Sucks buying players based on the current form at the time, he is half the player he was at Madrid.

4896~~~
His best form this season came when playing in the middle so I think you're being a bit knee-jerk here. It's quite likely his lack of form is due to mental problems rather than tactical ones, IMO.

4897~~~
And Rodriguez is playing with the likes of Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema and Isco. Surround yourself with incredible attacking players and you usually raise your game if you're a top player, much like Di Maria showed last season. Not hard to say James is having the better season.

4898~~~
I've said it before, but he just isn't suited to the Premier League - it's just not his thing. I don't think he really wanted to come here, but more than that, he's one of those skillful players who can only operated in a certain type of football. He's a Veron really. I really think he hates it here...even more so after the burglary attempt. I fully expect him to move on this summer albeit for a loss. Sometimes you have to take a punt on a player...and this one hasn't worked out.

4899~~~
He got pushed about so easily too. A gust of wind could send him flying.

4900~~~
I don't think he was bad today at all, if he had better players next to him he would look much better. His overall play was more than decent, I was actually pleased with that performance considering how non existant Rooney and van Persie were in front of him.

4901~~~
There is an unrealistic expectation on him because of his price tag, we paid double what he was worth, he has always been hit and miss and we don't play him in the position where he had his best ever season.

4902~~~
I've said it once, I've said it a few times.

I don't think he wants to be here. Whether we make top 4 or not, I think he'll be looking to go elsewhere.

4903~~~
Sparked but failed to ignite today. There were players around him that were far worse however.

4904~~~
10 assists in 22 is good going, especially when we struggle to create anything. Was awful today though.

4905~~~
He's easily capable of being the top player in the league so I'm not sure what's wrong with him. Combination of the team overall and LVG's hard-on for playing him out of position?

4906~~~
No, not really.  He was pretty much the worst player out there today.

4907~~~
Shouldn't have been taken off no matter what. The team is losing 2-1, have some fecking balls and put Mata or Falcao on for someone less creative. Have we ever rescued any points after taking Di Maria out? It usually comes to nothing, it actually sends a bad message to the players.

4908~~~
it's hardly a new thing with him, so I'm not sure why people are reacting like this. He's always been prone to really dreadful performances where nothing he does comes off, he usually manages to at least get something right though, like the pass to Herrera for the goal.

Remember the World Cup game against Switzerland? Genuinely one of the most awful performances I've seen from a player and he ended up scoring the winner.

He'll continue to frustrate, for sure, but it comes with the package.

4909~~~
He was decent overall in the first half but terrible in the second. Not performing up to his levels of last season at Real Madrid which is disappointing as that is the only level worthy of the price tag. Still it doesn't do anyone good to dwell on prices too much so lets just hope he gets it back together.

4910~~~
He created 5 chances. 2 more than any other Manchester United player. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755561/player-stats/46497/1_PASS_11#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Proof</a>. Here's all of our chances. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755561/team-stats/1/1_PASS_11#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Proof</a>.

Was he really the worst player out there today? No. Clearly not.

4911~~~
Yeah.  It's hard to argue against stats.  It's good he entertained you.  

Pretty much the worst player for me along with RVP and McNair.

4912~~~
I'm not saying he was amazing, "<i>sparked but failed to ignite</i>" was my original line. He clearly wasn't the worst player and unfortunately bringing Mata on for him didn't work as we all hoped it could.

He has most definitely played worse this season.

4913~~~
I don't like the way he's used. 

Allow him the freedom to drift across the frontline. He spent most of the day stuck out on the lef.

4914~~~
Exactly. He is the least of our worries. Did we overspend on him? yes, but there are far more pressing concerns than ADM.

4915~~~
RvP says hello.

4916~~~
He probably has played worse.  

I have no desire to argue though.  We don't have to agree.  But for me he was one of the worst although admittedly, expectations towards him are high.

4917~~~
I don't get why so many keep blaming individual players when the problem is our game plan, or lack of in this case.

4918~~~
Well, tell him hello back.

But look at my next comment though.  I thought di Maria was our worst along with RVP and McNair.

4919~~~
You pay this sort of money for a consistent match-winner... and he isn't one.
The one thing that stood out today was the lack of focal point. The Lack of a match-winner. That player with just that bit extra six or seven times out of 10.

The commentator compared Rooney to Ronaldo, in terms of being the main man, which really drums it home.
That's why someone like Bale would be a no brainer.

4920~~~
Play him on the right, he'll still have licence to come inside. He's showed in the last 2 games that it's something that should be tried out more. Probably his best performance this season was the friendly against Germany for Argentina, where iirc he started from the right but had the freedom to drift. He tore them apart that night. 

I think we need to realise that we're nowhere near Madrid's level of last season, so trying to get Di Maria to replicate his role from there isn't the way to go.

4921~~~
He wasn't a problem at all today. Some poor crosses, some good ones, shit corners as always, got an assist. Was an average performance, by no means poor, not great but not poor. Pushed off the ball a bit too easily late on as he tired and then he got subbed off. He was looking much better in recent weeks out on the right wing and should play there consistently for us as it suits him with us playing with pace and width, IMO at least.

Those saying he was awful today are having a laugh. Van persie was useless. Fellaini was relatively useless. Di Maria was not useless by any means.

4922~~~
Spot on di Maria is too unreliable to be that player, shocking how much we paid for him really, pure desperation on our part. Rooney, falcao and RVP aren't good enough to be that kind of player anymore either and we have been buying other players who aren't quite good enough for the kind of money that should get you a lot more.

4923~~~
Disagree. Thought Di Maria was poor today. Did very little. Gives the ball away far to easily, albeit, he can make passes that other players aren't capable of -- but he didn't even look like doing that today.

He needs to improve massively.

With regards to Van Persie, he did feck all. Probably would have benefited from playing Mata or Januzaj instead. Oh well, on to the next game.

4924~~~
All he does is chuck mediocre crosses into the box and goes past a few players in non threatening areas. When Young came on he didn't look arsed.

He's been an underwhelming signing this season considering his potential.

I do think his manager hasn't got a scooby how to use him. I don't think he's even an LvG type of player. He gives the ball away too much for him.

4925~~~
He's gone from playing in a fluid attacking unit with Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema, Alonso, Modric etc. to trying to make things happen with RVP or Falcao standing around in the box. Ronaldo or Messi would struggle to make things happen in United's static attack at the moment. I'd love to see Wilson being given an extended run up front. He may not get a bagful of goals (or he might), but his movement would open up defences and we can get plenty of goals from midfield with Di Maria, Mata, Herrera etc.

4926~~~
TBH, he also played with much better players as well. Having Ronaldo, bale, benzema in front of him whilst the likes of Isco, Modric is massive. Our players dont like pressure.

His best stuff for us this season came when we had Blind holding, Herrera, Mata, Rooney, Falcao/RVP. Not sure why we dont play to his strengths.

4927~~~
So where exactly is his best position on the pitch pray tell? I have no idea really

4928~~~
He's been absolutely garbage apart from a few early games in the season, yet another top player who we've bought and turned into a complete non-entity because we don't know how to get the best from him.

4929~~~
I think we can put this signing in the 'Woodward's desire for a marquee player' list.

4930~~~

4931~~~
Thought he was sub par most of the game and he really needs to be taken off corner duty, particularly when he's the one taking them from the right and Valencia wins us about 10 a game.

4932~~~
And to think Sanchez and Fabregas went for 60 mill combined, imagine if we had spent money on them instead we`d be competing for 1-2nd place

4933~~~
Nah we'd be misusing them as well.

4934~~~
Both went to teams with CL football which we don't have. Doubt we would have got them for that much.

4935~~~
We wouldn't

4936~~~
Probably with the 150 mill of new players and our current players LVG is doing a terrible job

4937~~~
There's no telling how either of them would do at different clubs. Football's funny like that. Neither Sanchez nor Fabregas were roaring successes at Barca.

4938~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> but also <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4939~~~
He can't handle the physical side of the PL and I think that was a big problem today plus his passing was unless I think Shaw showed him how it's done today!!!

4940~~~
His passing is so off at times. I say this in this thread for some time. Why does he rathe play more tidy and build on things which come up.. he is trying things all the time and is so unsuccessful. I think he should dribble more through middle as it is one of few things he can do even out of form and then try to make some pass after one two nto trying to play hollywood balls like giggs at his "worst"

4941~~~
He did try to dribble through the middle at one point but got out muscled and that must be embarrassing so I think that is a reason for him for not doing it as much...

4942~~~
Top bantz.

4943~~~
Christ Di Maria...did you just fart..

4944~~~
you are spot on but he still can do better with the ball at his feet than hoofing one ball after another to the goalkeeper. I am not the one who thinks he is not suited to premier league as he is tiny and weak, he's got the same stature as Nani and he didn't have much of problem to cope with that.. 

he looks really uninterested, should be told something by coaches or just bench him so he will start to fight again..

4945~~~
He's on a wind up.....He has to be

4946~~~
I agree he should do much better with his passing, on 1 occasion he switched the ball towards Valencia and was completely off and his crossing like you say was straight to the keeper!

I can't get my head round how his  gone from 1 of RM's best players to being at best a Nani....?

4947~~~
Ok, what's his best position? I've seen people say its CM when he has a bad game out wide, then claim its RW when he has a bad game on the left, and it keeps changing. On another note, this is Di Maria, if you're surprised by what he's producing, then I think you haven't watched him a lot over the years. He's capable of a lot more than he's showing, but he's always been very inconsistent, like Nani.

4948~~~
Yep, and like Nani, you won't get anywhere close to the best out of him or anything other then inconsistent performances until we get a settled and somewhat cohesive side. He's being judged incredibly harshly on here anyways, picks up an assist, created 5 chances in total in that game apparently and as always looked a threat, but apparently was awful. He's one of those players that people love to hate because on their day they are absolutely brilliant like Nani, but they aren't consistent. You just have to put up with them because the good far outweighs the negatives.

4949~~~
I'm backing Di Maria and will continue doing so and I think he was okay against Swansea despite being amazingly frustrating. How on earth can he continue to play those cross field balls without realising they are going to have a curl on it.

Anyway...

I hope this is a lesson for all the muppets out there, in the summer don't be banging on about having to spend big money and bringing in the best players. We can bring a player in for 100k or 60m and it means feck all. Some players suit, some don't. So many over the moon with a big name for a big fee but they are the first to say he isn't cut out for it.

4950~~~
The answer to Di Maria's question from us is "not enough" and from Falcao it's "more than me."

4951~~~
I didn't think it was his worse game but he seems to be getting more criticism than usual. I hardly noticed him really, was pretty anonymous. He is definitely struggling and looks half the player he was. People bringing up his assist stats need to remember that about two or three of them were shots that were awful and fell to our players. His long range shooting is awful for someone who takes a lot of attempts.

4952~~~
was a pretty crap game from him , he and rooney are sh1t on corners.

4953~~~
Honestly I was baffled to see how people thought he was anything more than poor in the Matchday thread. Sure he got an assist but that doesn't tell the whole story. Only RvP and McNair were worse than him today. I expect much more from a £60m man.

4954~~~
60m.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4955~~~
Poor today again, his passes were forced and innacurate, when they didn't need to be, didn't get a good run at anybody where he excels but I think he thrives in a wide position, not playing with much confidence not playing in his preferred position, LVG says he doesn't care if a player costs £0 or £60m, I would say the owners do.

4956~~~
Only Fabregas has more assists than him in the league this year. That's 2 more assists than Hazard, in 8 less games. Granted, Di Maria has scored 6 less goals, but he doesn't take penalties (Hazard has 2) and is playing in a much worse side. 

The guy is quality. He tries things that don't come off, but more often that not he produces something that gets us a goal, which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of our players. 

He's forever going to be beaten with the 'but he cost 60m' stick. Who cares, that's in the past. Di Maria is probably our best (outfield) player, and by quite some distance. We shouldn't sell him because he may not be worth 60m. He was the right player for us, like the manager says, it doesn't matter how much you cost, you have to be the right player. He quite clearly is and will get better as we get better.

4957~~~
This

4958~~~
I agree with the point of your post and I'm definitely backing Di Maria. However, the part I bolded isn't quite true. Quite often the things he tries, come to nothing.

4959~~~
LVG is making a real pigs ear with his team selections! I suspect we will be hearing a lot more stories about his philosophy! long after he has departed.

Di Maria looks very confused in a United shirt and having a manager that changes his position every couple of weeks can't be helping at all!

4960~~~
I want us to change to a 4-3-3 so I would play him on the left wing as we need wingers.

4961~~~
I've cut this guy an awful lot of slack but enough is enough now. £60 million and the lad was struggling to make simple passes, yes he got an assist but he needs to be doing so much more.

4962~~~
Keep playing him in CM, he keeps producing with assist or goals. I don't think he was that bad yesterday, he tried Things, some worked and some didn't that's what you get for trying.

4963~~~
Nani had more impact on our team.

If only he didn't have such an annoying head.

4964~~~
He was gash.

4965~~~
I didn't see him as gash though, but each to their own opinion <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4966~~~
Seen him in a Real or Argentina shirt and looks fine to me? Despite what you pay people, they need times to settle. Not sure 6 months is enough in this league and with those players. It's not like he's got Ronaldo et al around him....

4967~~~
He doesn't seem to enjoy his time here at all. Which is a worry

4968~~~
He always looks like the only player capable of making something out of nothing and he regularly assists even when not in form. 

He's brilliant. Genuinely the last player who deserves criticism on recent form.

4969~~~
Seeing as he was arguably the worst player on the pitch yesterday and is the most expensive player ever signed by any club in the Premier League, I have to say I find your last sentence baffling. Jonjo fecking Shelvey looked a better player yesterday. Which says it all.

4970~~~
No one bar Herrera in our front 6 looked good yesterday. RVP was easily the worst of the bunch.

He needs to do more, sure, but the criticism he gets is often over the top.

4971~~~
Yep, I hate it when players are instantly judged based on their price tags. He's playing in a new league, in an unsettled team- he needs time. Silva took a season to settle as well.

4972~~~
He wasn't our worst player yesterday, not even close. If arguments always revolve around price tags then arguments will never get anywhere. Of course he isn't worth 60m, but his performances on the pitch over the last few games, even if nowhere near his best, are better than the vast majority of our players. 

As a team we're playing poorly but if we're singling out players for criticism then I find it ridiculous that Di Maria gets it when the defence is in pieces and Rooney and Van Persie have been anonymous for months.

4973~~~
Of course he needs time. We can still judge each game on its merits though. He was shite yesterday and has been shite a lot this season. Which is a problem for us. Had he settled as quickly as, say, Sanchez or Costa we'd be a lot better off right now. 

That's not to say he won't ever be a good player for us.

4974~~~
I thought he was excellent in his last two games at Old Trafford. Couldn't be more different to the shit he served up in Swansea. Seems to be a poor traveller. Which is probably a big factor in the discrepancy between our home and away results.

4975~~~
The worst thing about the caf is the body language experts that come out of nowhere when we lose a game and criticize players for not looking bothered.

4976~~~
Yep he's been poor ever since he came back from injury. I still think he looks the only one out there capable of creating anything positive though.

This is what happens when you're forced to build a new team in one transfer window. Sanchez and Costa had the luxury of walking into well settled sides. We've thrown Di Maria into a struggling team with loads of new players and he has to shoulder the burden of being our only proper creative outlet. We're asking too much of him.

4977~~~
Or maybe he's new to the league and naturally gonna find it easier playing at home than away? When did we stop giving players new to the league at least a season to settle. 62m doesn't fast track that?

4978~~~
Read my posts. I accept he needs time to settle. I'm just discussing his performances, not drawing long-term conclusions about them.

4979~~~
Probably a fair point but again an exaggeration I think. He's been a little frustrating in some aways but still looks like the only player who can pick up the ball and cause damage, and assists on a regular basis. 

I don't agree that he looks like someone who wants to leave. To me he just looks like the one genuinely world class player in the side, struggling to make his mark when everyone around him isn't remotely on the same wave length. Even if he did want to leave he's got 4 years on his contract so unless someone pumps up about 50m for him he can suck it up.

4980~~~
Gets bullied off the ball way to easily. He needs to understand that this is not LaLiga and you do not get  freekick every time he gets knocked off the ball!

4981~~~
He's more frustrating than Nani imo.

His longballs/crosses are hopeful rather than effective and anything he tries other than the longballs dont tend to come off at the moment. When he first joined he was playing several throughballs a game on the ground, now its just the hopeful high balls.

4982~~~
I'm reading the post you posted. I think it's hard to talk about performances without context, even sort term ones.

4983~~~
I remember Van Gaal explaining at the very beginning of the season why we are not playing with wingers. He explained it is because we do not have the quality of wingers like Robben or Di Maria. So we get Di Maria, we have Valencia, Young, Januzaj and he still chooses not to use wide players in their best positions. Its so frustrating. Di Maria picks the ball up on the halfway line and tries to beat oppositions entire squad, gets crowded out, does not make a pass and gets blown off the ball by the wind. I just don't think he is suited to play a midfield role in the PL. So far its been too physical for him. His best performances for me have been when he's darted down the wing or through the middle on a counter attack and most of the time he's created chances and scored goals himself.

4984~~~
Sorry, I may not have been clear. I meant that over the duration of a game, more often that not, he will produce a goal or assist. Not that most of the things he tries come off, as they quite clearly don't!

Take yesterday for example, he was generally acknowledged as being poor, yet he still produced an assist. Another poster alluded to the Switzerland game, where he was pants and still made the telling difference.

4985~~~
We all knew we overpaid for him.
However at the Moment he does not even look worth 30m. Not only his fault though.

4986~~~
He is offering almost nothing in games at the moment and it's very frustrating to watch, but the guy IS a world class player and he needs games and time.  I'm convinced he will be better next season but for that to happen he needs to keep playing 90 minutes every week to adjust.  There really isn't anyone you could say is better than him to take his place.

4987~~~
Wow!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/manchester-united-fans-view-angel-di-maria-doesnt-care-hes-given-united-huge-problem-1489309?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/manchester...t-care-hes-given-united-huge-problem-1489309?</a>

4988~~~
di Maria suits a fast paced counter attacking side.

We play a slow based possession style. If LvG had always planned to play this way, AdM was a daft signing.

4989~~~
Sadly, not a lot to disagree with there.

4990~~~
Medie recycling the same old story again shocker.

4991~~~
A lot of reasonable points made in that article, unfortunately.

4992~~~
Found myself nodding in agreement reading that, sadly.

4993~~~
Sensationalist article based on the belief that he doesnt care or want to be here. Wouldnt read much into it.

4994~~~
So his attitude is the problem, not that he's out of form?
or both?

People believe he doesnt care and media is carefully bringing that story out every few days to keep it alive.

4995~~~
Don't worry, I didn't, but there are few nodding apparently.

4996~~~
Nail on head. Look at when he joined and was on fire, he was flying on the counter attack with Rooney/RVP making runs off him and Herrera/Mata buzzing about as well.


BTW he still has to do a lot better, he is not even doing the basics right at times

4997~~~
He's a chance taker, that's how these players are, if their risky plays work they look like geniuses, if they don't they look like donkeys, better get used to it because he's going nowhere. These type of players are frustrating sometimes, but you need them to unlock tight games, even the last game, when he was poor he created 5 chances and had an assist.

Anyway, we need to take him off corner duty, he is so bad at it that he makes me miss Nani's corners.

4998~~~
Anyone can find a reason to support their argument. So, Di Maria hasn't set the world on fire in the EPL, hence he must not care, didn't want to come (not even for the money), sees United as a step down, be gone in the summer, cause of all United's lack of fluidity, add more as you see fit.

I thought on Saturday, particularly in the first half that United had clear instructions to give the ball to Di Maria. We did a lot of attacking on the left and he almost always went forward with pace as expected. It was obvious he had little help in that the forward line - even with Rooney up front, was largely static, no movement. Same could be said for Herrera when he got the ball. However, unlike Shaw, Paddy did not move forward and so Herrera hit a wall.

Though Di Maria has not hit the heights he did when he first came, I only worry about his support of the LB. I do believe it was him out of position that let JJS have the space to shoot for the winning goal. As for performance, I am shocked that the majority of his crosses, corners and shots are so poor.

4999~~~
Body language readers are lucky the caf experts don't have the time to stop posting and make great money. We have plenty of experts.

5000~~~
Mark Chapman (BBC presenter) was on the radio yesterday, he was at the Preston game and sat right next to the United bench. He said one thing that stood out was throughout numerous players were looking repeatedly towards the bench as if wanting some tactical instruction, Di Maria in particular was doing it a lot.

5001~~~
Di Maria could overtake Falcao as premier league flop of the season if he doesn't get his act together quickly....it's extremely frustrating as in glimpses looked like he could emulate Giggs but most of the time he just miss-hits simple passes or crosses. I fear that we won't see anything decent from him until next season when he is more settled

5002~~~
You can't judge him for his price tag! We paid that for him because we ain't got CL football and to make a statement.

5003~~~
I'm afraid that could be right. Which is a terrible reason to sign anyone.

5004~~~
I totally agree, we didn't need Di Maria or Falcao but I think it was to make a statement. I'm glad we bought him though because if used correctly he will be a massive player for us.

5005~~~
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Stuff you want</span>
Tackling and closing players down - Half as often since joining United.
Creating chances - Down 25%.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Stuff you don't</span>
Shots from distance - Up 50%.
Dribbles in the middle third - Up 50%
Loss of possession dribbling - Twice as often.

Not saying it's an attitude thing, but he's doing half the defensive work and ball harrying he did at Real Madrid, attempting more dribbles in sillier places and situations and trying to shoot way more than someone scoring 1 in every 12 shots for the last half decade (Valencia's scored 1 in 8) should.

It's like every positive trait has lessened and every bad one has got much worse. His performance at the World Cup was almost exactly like his performance at Real Madrid, in terms of the workrate without the ball and decision making. It's at United that that's dropped off.

Whether that's him, the manager or what, it isn't media invention.

5006~~~
I disagree. We definitely needed Di Maria. If not Di Maria, then a player like him. Fast, mobile, dangerous. Our lack of pace last season was glaring. We looked a better side with Welbeck in the side purely for his pace and graft, but his end product was minimal.

5007~~~
Because I think he sees himself (or with LVG's choice) as our best player and maybe that's why he wants to carry us offensively way too much and not enough defensive work. At Madrid Ronaldo had that special "freedom" status and basically the rest of the team had to work hard with ADM being one of their most hard working player.

5008~~~
Interesting. If that is true then it's probably time for van Gaal to be more vocal in matches, or at least try to get some messages out onto the pitch via Giggs. 

I agree  with this. We needed him because we lacked pace - severely, and quality. For some reason though he hasn't performed since the start of the season. Is it the winter grind? His position? Just a form slump? Lack of motivation? Who knows.

5009~~~
What I ment was a marque signing smashing the British transfer record, to put it in perspective we could have had Fabregas and Costa for the same price as Di Maria!

5010~~~
It was predicted back in August ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

We really do have a unique ability to seemingly ruin players then minute they walk into Old Trafford.

5011~~~
When I said those words I really hoped it would be completely false <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Kinda scary how some of our predictions turned to be so spot on.

5012~~~
Im sometimes reminded of this post of Plech's. He was talking about Liverpool and I dont think he was specifically talking about how Liverpool brought in some good players and seemed to suck the quality out of them - but it fits into that narrative. If a club is rotten, a great player can arrive and soon he will start to rot too. 

I hope we havent got to this stage yet but I do worry.

5013~~~
That's a great quote.

5014~~~
Yeah, terrifying. I was surprised it was from 2012, I thought it was older. It haunts me.

5015~~~
Its unnerving how spot on those predictions were. I'd bet good money there would be posts in the same fashion early on in the Mata thread as well tbh.

5016~~~
He's a massive talent - something we desperately needed.

When the team settles, with some new additions, I think he will shine.

We should have bought Sanchez too!

5017~~~
This is the truth of it all. If Chelsea had signed Di Maria, he would be trashing the league right now. If we had signed Fabregas, we'd have already sold Blind because De Gea would have taken his spot as the sole central midfielder of the team, after having been displaced as sweeper-keeper by Cesc (as passing it out from the back is so important, of course). I don't think Sanchez would be doing so well in this team either. We would make any player look rubbish at the moment.

5018~~~
Just been watching some clips of his first month here. Jesus christ he was electric, on another level to every other outfield player we have. Shame that its tailed off. What are people's thoughts on the reason for this?

Weather?
Injury?
Confidence/not wanting to be here?

Strange how much he has regressed.

5019~~~
Why are people surprised that he's trying to do stuff more himself than he did at Madrid? Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema, Modric etc all could make something out of nothing, all he had to do was consistently feed them in, which he did with aplomb. Nobody in our team can move forward with the ball so it's all on him...

5020~~~

5021~~~
That's fair enough really, we're a bloody mess at the moment. Hopefully he'll feel better about it if/when we get our act together. Hopefully.

5022~~~

</b>
I mean come on.

5023~~~
It's bullshit?......there's no smoke without fire? I dunno, it's been brought up a lot and you do start to wonder, he doesn't look overjoyed here IMO, amazingly Ander looks far more pumped for his stuttering United career than the undroppable Di Maria does.

5024~~~
Understandable. He has commented on how he doesn't like the weather, and that learning English has been difficult. Then there's the attempted break-in, and the fact that we play dogshit football. He can't be too overjoyed right now.

5025~~~
Sounds like a load of rubbish to me.

5026~~~
Obviously we can't trust tripe which says "He has told a friend/someone.....", but I have said for a while that he doesn't look like he's enjoying being here. Then again, maybe the media have just assumed that too and just made up a story about it - very likely.

5027~~~
I don't mind him regretting the move. I really don't want him fecking playing like he regrets it. That's not "fair enough" at all.

5028~~~
I doubt it's true. Yet, he does look constantly miserable and has been playing shite. So who knows. Not fussed either way tbh, haven't really warmed to the guy that much.

5029~~~
No, that isnt fair enough. Im keeping those two things separate at this stage. Both things are speculation to some extent - that he isnt happy and that his performances are poor because he isnt happy. But I think the first one is a safer assumption that the second. Plenty of people would rather be somewhere else but still play well so hopefully, if he is unhappy, we can at least get to that stage. 

Basically Im hoping that everything falls into place sooner rather than later with Van Gaal's management, we start winning, we move up the table and secure CL football, spring arrives, the evenings get longer, his home security system is improved and proves its worth and he starts to feel a bit better about life. Manchester is a great place in the summer.

5030~~~
I don't live in Manchester but I was there for a week in December last year and I absolutely love the city. And he's earning more than enough to be happy living in it. Man up and play your football

5031~~~
Flog him to PSG in the summer.

5032~~~
Some time ago, Rojo told an Argentinian sport journalist (for espn latam) that Di Maria was really affected after the robbery in his house, plus that he was having issues settling in. He also said that the players were not happy inside the dressing room with all the change in tactics, formations, player positions, etc.

It might be true he regrets the move at this exact moment. But i think as soon we stop fecking around as a club (specially Van Gaal), and start giving some continuity to our playing system (hopefully one without Fellaini and including Mata), moods gonna change eventually. Hopefully sooner rather than later.

5033~~~
Wow did he really say that?

5034~~~
Im surprised we havent heard more about that.

Dont suppose theres a link to an english language version of those comments?

5035~~~
If he said that he'd be out on his arse.

5036~~~
Is it this interview <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-united/story/2287983/manchester-united-defender-marcos-rojo-we-will-not-give-up-title-hope" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-un...er-marcos-rojo-we-will-not-give-up-title-hope</a> ?

He sounds pretty happy with LvG if it is.

5037~~~
it was a comment off the record to the ground journalist covering someevent (he was in argentina for some reason... cant remember exactly)

Yep. pretty much. Though he said "some" of the players, so its probably the whole spanish speaking players (doubt he speaks english yet and makes sense because they are directly the players affected).

5038~~~
It's no surprise to me that as the weather has got colder, so has Di Maria's form. Wait until the weather heat's up, he will be on fire <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5039~~~
I didn't read it. I heard it from Quique Wolff on ESPN.

5040~~~
I've been hugely surprised at his lack of impact. The first few games he looked really dangerous, if a bit wild, but I feel like he's shackled himself so as to keep possession more, thereby taking away his greatest assets.

5041~~~
I doubt he'll be here next season

5042~~~
You think Van Gaal will be happy to see the back of him? Someone would have to make a big offer for us to consider letting him go, surely.

5043~~~
I don't expect him to leave but if he did want out due to the robbery/not settling it would likely be to PSG and I'd expect us to recoup close to the entire fee in that scenario. Hopefully it all works out and he settles in and finds top form again. We'll see.

5044~~~
Would be a tragedy if he left, even though he has a bad spell, he is our only world class player in outfield. We would look out of ideas without him.

5045~~~
needs a performance - it's been a while

5046~~~
Can't wait for him to tear it up in pre-season <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5047~~~
I think it's likely that he'll <i>want</i> to go, but whether we'll let him go for an inevitable loss is another matter.

5048~~~
If he wants to leave in summer then so be it. I don't feel like he wants to be at United.

5049~~~
Can we return him and get Bale instead? I hope Woody kept his receipts.

5050~~~
He's happy to be here, some of you are talking nonsense. So a pro Madrid newspaper says a player that left regrets leaving. Yeah.

5051~~~
You all blab on about how difficult the PL is and how players won't survive in it, then bash a player who is new to the league for not wanting to be "here". Do people ever consider that it's his first season and he's getting used to the country, club, weather and new teammates? After Ferguson resigned, United fans are now showing themselves for what they truly are [not different from other club fans], it's easy to be composed and logical when things are rosy, now that things are a bit rough, the negativity here and among a section of our fans is worrying. Talks of replacing a manager who is 4th and in FA cup, Di Maria doesn't want to be here etc. It's all so knee-jerk these days.

5052~~~
Sanchez for instant has been struggling too.

5053~~~
Wanted Di Maria for a long time, but f he truly is not settled and wants to move on, then we need to make sure that we get close to what we paid for him in the summer. He just seems to be in a terrible state right now.

5054~~~
Must be true than.

Just a quick questions for all the body experts here, you think he doesnt want to be at United, based on what?

5055~~~
That's never going to happen sadly, specially if we finish the season very badly in general and him performing like he currently does. If he leaves it'll be for half the price he cost more or less.

5056~~~
This was always going to happen (media wise) if he wasn't playing out of his skin.

I think he will be fine and will be here next season playing much better.

5057~~~
It seems inconceivable to me. Unless Van Gaal loses patience with him. 

I can't imagine Woodward would like it either. Would send out a very negative message.

5058~~~
A massive inferiority complex. But just cause people are paranoid doesn't mean they're wrong.

5059~~~
I dont mean they're wrong but they're basing it on absolutely nothing. 
As for the first sentence bang on. From some of the posts you'd think we're some little low table club, not Manchester fu.king United. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5060~~~
Weather; looks disinterested; came from one of the few clubs more reputable than us (therefore demoted); came from a city undeniably vastly nicer to live in; surrounded my mediocrity; burgled; language. 

It's speculation. But it is hardly based on nothing.

5061~~~
Other than burglary he's a professional. Language, learn the language and go on. City? Yeah Madrid is nicer but you're getting a nice salary to play in Manchester despite the fact its not so nice and sunny as Madrid.
Surrounded by mediocrity? Sure players are not that good as in Real but you could say that for most of the clubs in the world.

I just think it has been a media story blown out of proportions and now people believe it.

5062~~~
The way you people talk about Manchester is ridiculous. He's not living in a bedsit in Longsight ffs.

5063~~~
Yeah, I was there in the autumn and its a nice city. Madrid is nicer but as you said people talk about Manchester like its a worst place in the world.

5064~~~
I am in Sydney, a place that sees so many in the UK visit and want to live but I love being back in Manchester, I actually really like the city.

5065~~~
Well, if you want to argue it like that (which is a very reasonable thing to do) then he should be professional about the burglary too. Get a better security system, get a pitbull, get a night watchman, whatever, he has the money. In some ways for me this is actually the least relevant point. Burglaries happen everywhere and the bigger the discrepancy between what you have and what others have, the more likely it is to happen. This is just one of the prices you pay for being rich. 

These are all things footballers on their salary should rise above. But that doesnt mean they will. There are plenty of depressed rich people out there. Should having millions in the bank make you feel better about living under a cold, grey blanket of Mancunian drizzle? If you look at it rationally it should but I suspect the money is quite irrelevant when you feel homesick for what you had. And the language thing, yes he can learn the language, he probably will learn the language, but it doesnt stop people feeling alienated before they have got round to doing it. He might feel lonely. More to the point, his wife might feel lonely. And an unhappy wife is a more serious problem than an unhappy self - and on that point I talk from personal experience. 

You are right that anywhere he went would be a step down, he was probably reconciled to that. But come on. Stop for a second and look at us. Im sure he was hoping for and expecting better than this, no?

5066~~~
That's all true. I just mean that as I said it has been a blown up, probably made up story. 

Maybe its not made up but I dont like those kind of 'he probably wishes he'd be back at madrid stuff'. People downgrade their own club like that.  Sure he expected better probably but its not that bad. We're in a reconstruction phase sort of and he should get his act together and perform. Him and all of the other players. 

You said it yourself, inferiority complex. I think United fans shouldnt feel that, we're one of the biggest clubs in the world ffs despite the fact we're in a bad patch right now. 

All the stuff you wrote, its true, who knows whats happening. If its that bad he just doesnt feel right at us we should maybe let him go. But lets not downgrade our club while we're at it. I dont mean your posts by all this in particular bu the general mood.

5067~~~
I think people underestimate the effect that weather can have on your mood. On the very rare occasion Ireland has a couple of consecutive dry, sunny weeks I feel on top of the fecking world but when it's relentlessly grey and wet it's a real effort not to feel pissed off all the time. And that's speaking as someone who was reared here. If you've lived all your life in sunnier climes, it must be incredibly hard adjusting to the manc gloom.

Isn't there some club in Russia - which is funded by oil billions - that has loads of Brazilian players on its books and ended up housing them in a massive dome full of UV light bulbs? I'm sure I read that somewhere.

5068~~~
Anzhi maybe? 

I heard they train in Moscow and go to Mahackala or whatever the place is called on game days. Not that the weather in Moscow is so much better.

5069~~~
The upside of it is the euphoria you feel when things turn. Surely there are few places in the world where spring is so celebrated as it is here in the UK. The more depressing winter is, the more uplifting its retreat. Give him a couple more weeks and he'll probably be walking on air, walking around the place grinning like an idiot, beside himself with joy and playing like a kid with his friends on the streets of Rosario.

5070~~~
Could be them. As well as loads of UV lights, they apparently have an indoor beach. They put up the players and all their family and friends, with free food and drink for everyone. All sounds a bit mental but if it works, it works.

5071~~~
You jest but I wouldn't be surprised at all if there's evidence to support a theory that continental/hispanic footballers play their best football at the beginning and end of each PL season. As well as the shitty weather, the short days must take a lot of getting used to.

5072~~~
Yup. Spring is just around the corner. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

What Pogue said, its true. Right now its cloudy and grey outside and I feel like shit just because of it. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Luckily here you get a lot of sunny days though, not to mention the coast.

5073~~~
A true word said in jest. I agree. 

The old cliche about a cold Wednesday night in Stoke didnt come from nothing.

5074~~~
Does make you wonder if the club should take these factors into account in their recruitment strategy. We should have broken the bank to sign that Odegaard kid.

5075~~~
As I've always said. Living anywhere with the money top footballers earn will be amazing. Deep down Di maria might have wanted to stay at Madrid but I'm sure he is relishing his time at United. Where he lives in Alderley edge is beautiful. It is one of the most luxurious villages in England. His house will be incredible and he wont be going out getting leathered every night will he? His children will be in a top school and he will spend most his time with his family at home. He isnt a 24 year old single Ronaldo who wants a lavish lifestyle. There is a heavy latin influence at the club now and alot of established players who join the club mention how the size of the club never fails to surprise them. I think this season just needs to hurry up. We need to secure the CL spot and hopefully the FA cup and then next year we will be all a more confident bunch. Stories like this only come about when we are at our lowest. Don't believe them.

5076~~~
We should build an acclimitisation camp in Patagonia where they can get used to being cold and living with short days. Keep them there for 4 weeks, start them off with a diet of fresh fish, tapas and whatever else feels familiar, but gradually introduce chip barms and lancashire hotpot washed down with a warm pint of ale, until they are ready to live in Manchester full time.

5077~~~
Di Maria did want to leave Madrid. He had a poor relationship with Perez, didn't feel important and knew he could get a lot more money elsewhere. They also wrote to him a day before the World Cup final asking him not to play, when he was doing everything possible to get fit for it, which he didn't appreciate. So those Spanish reports about him regretting leaving sounds like nonsense just like the ones saying that De Gea and LvG aren't on speaking terms.

He probably expected to go to PSG but he's with us now and getting paid handsomely. As long we return to the CL he'll be fine am sure.

5078~~~
Very true, he started very well but has tailed off in recent games, there's a settling in period in the league that people always chose to ignore.

5079~~~
So maybe Falcao is actually still a great footballer but is just cold and depressed.

5080~~~
We never were different from other fans, to be honest. Many just liked to think we were. The response to this period isn't all that surprising.

5081~~~
Why on earth would Man United fans be any different from fans of any other club? Its absurd to think they are or would be. The only difference is circumstances.

5082~~~
We're all a product of our circumstances, though, and I think there are definite differences between fans of different clubs when it comes to stuff like patience with a new manager/player or how quickly they get frustrated in adversity.

Was watching the Arsenal game the other night and struck me that I can't think of any other club with such an uneasy home atmosphere. As soon as their team starts coming under any sort of pressure (or playing badly) the discontent is tangible, with gasps and groans at every misplaced pass. All the more obvious because of the general air of silence. I do think that's a uniquely Arsenal thing.

5083~~~
In a ideal world I think he wanted to stay at Madrid and get paid what he thought he deserved. I thought his issues started because (a) they weren't going to pay him better money, and (b) he felt undervalued/forced out.

The footballing side of things were fine and he had friends there etc. Even the manager valued him.

On the face of it Kroos to Madrid was a similar deal. But then Kroos probably didn't feel as if he was taking a step down, which Di Maria surely did. It's a bit like Ozil's move. Then you factor in that the club he preferred didn't come in for him.
Not saying that he hates Manchester and is itching to leave, but he could definitely be feeling disillusioned with how this has all panned out.

Same goes for van Persie. People always rubbish the 'body language experts', but we're looking at things from a human being point of view. A good number of people would be disillusioned with these circumstances, and footballers are no different.

5084~~~
Right - but when the circumstances change, so will fan behaviour. i.e. we've been shit for the last 18 months at best, rudderless, without the skipper who steered us for 27 years, without CL football this season, risking the same next season... to find it surprising that people are being negative because we're Man United fans and a cut above everyone else is completely delusional. Give it more time like this and we'll end up like the Scousers - that is the closest comparable for sure as they have been through what we're going through now. Football fans are football fans, as you say the product of the circumstances of their team, but given our circumstances have changed, expecting anything different from this kind of pessimistic hysteria was daft. 

Youre right about Arsenal, theyre a bunch of chokers and have been for years so its hardly surprising the fans worry.

5085~~~
I remember reading lots of posts back then on how United fans are different, more "cultured" and a lot of that nonsense, I don't subscribe to BS like that anyway, though its easier to claim such a moral high ground when the going is good, that's what am saying.

5086~~~
Exactly right. 

I agree a lot of people thought that and it was always nonsense and completely laughable. I always wondered whether anyone actually believed it deep down. Could people be that deluded?

5087~~~
Herrera basically conforming here that LVG is trying to change Di Maria's game..


That would go some way to explaining why his performances have regressed as the season has gone on. Ridiculous to buy a player for £60 mil then try and change them as a player, why buy them in the first place if they don't play how you want?

5088~~~
Yea, that was the thing that stuck out for me when reading that interview. Really bizarre.

5089~~~
Just another in our long list of ridiculous transfers I guess.

We do have an almost unparalleled habit of buying players (regardless of talent level) that are completely the wrong type to what we actually need. Our transfer record in the post Ronaldo era is absolutely appalling.

5090~~~
He's not trying to change him, he's just saying that at Madrid, as soon as he got the ball he could attack any space immediately whereas at United we play a possession game and the opposition will sit back against that so he has to wait for the ball to be moved about a bit to create that space. 

Its not changing him as a player, it's just saying that he has to adjust the timings of his attacks to suit the team/league.

5091~~~
Aren't there teams in Spain that also try to park the bus against Madrid? It shouldn't be anything new since all lower teams do that in all leagues and I'm sure Di Maria had his own tricks to unlock bus-parking defenses (doh!). FFS, just let him play, Louis.

5092~~~
I couldn't put it better then this.

5093~~~
Finding myself agreeing with a lot of what you have said lately and this is no different. We spend big money on players that just don't fit. Our lack of cohesion and chemistry is one of our biggest problems. Why sign Di Maria only to change him into a different sort of player? It's just strange.

5094~~~
Well someone has to I guess <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

But yeah, its a massive shame to see players like Di Maria and Mata, who most of us would have loved at United, actually signed for huge money, then just kind of wasted (for want of a better phrase). Add them to players like Berbatov, Kagawa, Fellaini, Herrera etc etc who just don't seem to fit and it seems like our transfer strategy is massively flawed.

5095~~~
Last time I checked, Di Maria and Herrera were not "wasted". There's too much moaning these days. You bring in a new manager, and he has to implement a certain style of play, that is not changing the player or wasting them. Professional players should be able to adapt to such minor tweaks. Di Maria was a pure left winger, only last season CA used him in LCM and after a difficult period, he adapted to the role. Herrera you're talking about also admits in that interview that Biesla and Valverde used him in various positions. You don't just get good players in and tell them to go do what pleases them, you create a platform for them, they adapt and give you results. That's not to say our transfer strategy has been stellar but you're mentioning players like Berbatov and Kagawa, how did we waste these two, Kagawa was just out of his depth here, Berbatov was fine when he played, what are you talking about?

5096~~~
At home against a team like Sunderland, he really should be taking the game to them and putting in a dominant display.

5097~~~
Woeful first half so far. How many times has he given the ball away. Looks a shadow of the player he was at Madrid.

5098~~~
If he doesn't play like a World Class player next season, we need to sell him, he gets a pass for this season - we can't afford to have a player like this in our team next season ...who is meant to be the best player in the team but produces average performances week in week out and gives the ball away

5099~~~
Has done nothing in months to warrant his fee, he can't even cross a ball. You can argue about he's not in his natural position if you want but a player we considered worth £60m should be able to play any attacking position.

5100~~~
He's so bad.

5101~~~
Think he'd be this bad if he'd stayed at Madrid?

5102~~~
Ship him off to PSG and hope we can get £40 million for him.

5103~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5104~~~
Rubbish arguments. Because United paid a lot of money more him he should suddenly be able to play anywhere?

5105~~~
The worst waste of money ever. I don't want him playing here anymore, pathetic attitude.

5106~~~
decision making level kindergarten, shocking, it should have been 1:0 Young

5107~~~
I don’t think I have ever seen such a terrible half from him when he was at Real Madrid. He was inconsistent, poor touch, lost the ball a number of times- that happened a lot, but I’ve never seen him play with such low intensity. This possession game doesn’t suit him but he doesn’t look interested at times.

5108~~~
He played RW for years for Madrid, this isn't good enough. No matter where you play, to be that thick to do something like try and pass to Falcao at the end there is just piss poor.

5109~~~
He's been atrocious to say the least. Terrible form he is in. Zero confidence whatsoever, that fecked up to Falcao was so easy to do.

5110~~~
Yup, him passing the ball to one of his team mates would be a good start, feck being versatile.

5111~~~
He was bad last week too but his loyal fans wouldn't have any of it. Expect to see the same today.

5112~~~
Simply awful. Can't dribble, can't cross, can't pick a pass. Literally offering nothing productive.

5113~~~
Of course. When he played winger from october they said he should play CM and it's not his fault. He played in the middle and was shite as well and then we had people saying he would be winger <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Oh, and the "It's all the other players fault".

5114~~~
Seems like he is trying too hard.

5115~~~
He's getting into good positions thanks to his movement. Struggling with the execution to say the least. But I've got plenty of time for a player that's always positive.

5116~~~
We were ripped off again (after Mata, Shaw, Fellaini).
<a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a>: Remember a discussion we had when I told you he was worth that money ? I have changed my mind.

5117~~~
His final ball was so good at Real. What the hell was that at the end? Young was wide open <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

5118~~~
Having the shocker of all shockers <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5119~~~
We would have been better off saving the 60 million instead of wasting it on this terrible player

5120~~~
It is definetly something at Manchester United that is making him shite. I am confidence to say that if he was still playing for Real Madrid, he would not be this bad just based of his earlier season form and how he has transitioned to such a poor player. It might be Van Gaal that is stagnating his ability, but even then some of the basic that has nothing to do with management, he is doing poor with.

5121~~~
It's the english weather I tell you!

5122~~~
Like some kind of Space Jam in real life scenario.

I don't think it's much of a coincidence that he looked electric ar first and has sharply regressed the longer he's been here. A mixture of struggling to settle into life here and our current footballing woes across the team. Mata got considerably worse after joining as well in my opinion and obviously Falcao. It is worrying to say the least.

5123~~~
We are currently getting the Di Maria that everyone could see before last season. So basically you can expect now 1 world class performance in 10 games and a lot of awful performances. We could have kept Nani if that was what we were going for. I hope for his and our sake that he can find his last season form again or we have essentially flushed 30M down the toilet.

5124~~~
He's always been an inconsistent winger but this is still surprisingly poor.

5125~~~
It happens way too often for players we purchase for it to be a coincidence. The team is sick, there's a bigger problem.

5126~~~
We need to create some space for him to do something. He is not that big physically so cant ram through defenders and can't dribble past 2-3. Our attackers and wide players should stretch the opposition a little bit, however, our off-the ball movement was really off since September. I doubt Di Maria is the player that would perfectly fit in LvGs system, but I am trying to find excuses for Angel. He is miles away from his top form.

5127~~~
Agreed. It's not hugely surprising either - he's taken a massive step back in his career in the short-term and the longer we struggle to play with any coherence the more apparent that becomes to Di Maria. He didn't come here because we was taking a step forward in his career or he wanted a new challenge or he loved the club and the football we play, he came here because he was forced out of a club he wanted to stay at and we were the only ones that could afford him. There were always going to be motivational issues/challenges there and van Gaal's inability to get the best out of him personally and to get the team playing well in general is having a tragic impact on his form and mentality.

5128~~~
I'm surprised he hasn't swapped with Young and had a go on the left for a while  He looks totally bamboozled at the moment.

5129~~~
Horrible half of football from him. I'd be looking to pull him off at half time if it wasn't for the fact you know he is capable of doing something great amongst all the rubbish unlike some of our other under performers. Really needs to work on his decision making and improve his touch at times.

5130~~~
Always gave him benefit of the doubt but getting very hard to defend him now to be honest. I don't know if he has the mentality to make this work to be honest.

5131~~~
I agree.

5132~~~
Worryingly poor. He's looking less and less like a world class player with these performances. There's really no excuse for how much possession he's wasting. Needs to sharpen up and fast. I can't believe his game has fallen to pieces so badly.

5133~~~
Will he be here next season?

5134~~~
Yes.

5135~~~
Hooked by Van Gaal. Wonder if we'll see him out of the team for a couple of weeks while he gets his shit together on a personal level? It might actually be for the best.

5136~~~
Might be going against the sentiment in this thread, but I sincerely hope he stays here for years. Has everything in his locker to be our best player.

5137~~~
I will go with maybe.

5138~~~
I remember watching him for Madrid prior to last season, each time I saw him he was underwhelming and I couldn't understand why he was highly rated. He was a very frustrating player to watch, making wrong decisions all the time, running into wrong spaces. Then last season he was the complete opposite - hard-working, efficient, good movement, top creativity. I don't understand why he went back to his worse self.

5139~~~
I wouldn't say it's going against the grain etc. I'm sure we would all love to see the Di Maria that was so instrumental for Madrid last season.

5140~~~
This.

5141~~~
Shocking LVG took him off. He wasn't playing that well but he still put in some quality crosses and is always capable of creating. Januzaj has been pretty awful this year.

5142~~~
LVG is a buffoon. That is all.

5143~~~
I agree with this completely. Where is the talent, form, and passion that we tried to buy in with these once-great players?

5144~~~
Not one to defend the guy but you can't pin all the blame on Van Gaal. Di Maria, but for a brief spell at the start of the season, has been awful regardless of where he's played. 

I had my reservations when we decided to spunk £60m on him in the summer, when he was worth £40m tops, and now he looks worth a fraction of that amount. Why didn't we just buy a proper midfielder instead of an unorthodox winger-cum-midfielder instead?

5145~~~
Aye, one of the strikers definitely should have been hooked before him. Neither have done anything either.

5146~~~
Yep, but this is the way it works. We ruin good players and the fans turn on them. Literally every player in the team except De Gea and Young is absolute horses**t this season and the players get blamed personally. We'd turn Messi in to a turd in two months and fans would be telling him to fk off after three.

5147~~~
He should no longer be a permanent fixture in our first XI until he proves himself again. We need to stop playing players purely based on reputation. Januzaj or Fellaini to start ahead of him next week please.

5148~~~
Taking him off was a fair (and brave) move on LVG's part.

Januzaj has been an improvement too.

5149~~~
Players go through 
his confidence looks shot to me. doesn't help that we're going trough a bad run atm.

5150~~~
lolwut?

Last time I checked he's been our productive player.

5151~~~
Has he? So you'd start him automatically despite him being largely shite since he came back from his injury?

5152~~~
If he's been largely shite, Januzaj and Fellaini have been worse.

5153~~~
They haven't been great either but Di Maria is woefully out of form at the moment. He deserves to be benched, especially after this cameo from Januzaj.

5154~~~
Oddly enough he looks lost when he has this free-roaming role. Overshadowed by both Young and Januzaj.

5155~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Bringing Januzaj on was evidently the right decision.

5156~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5157~~~
Play him in the hole next match. Leave Adnan and Young on the wings.

5158~~~
Like I said before his performances scream Ozil to me. 

Madrid must be delighted to get £100m for both.

5159~~~
The reverse jynx worked<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

5160~~~
He will come good.. He is suited for a counter attacking system... He will hammer Arsenal next game...<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5161~~~
The club need to cut their losses while they can. I'm sure the likes of PSG would take him for 30 million.

5162~~~
Newcastle next.

5163~~~
I don't care if he cost 60m Januzaj was much better when he came on and it was the right substitution. Hopefully this is a wake up call for hi.

5164~~~
Decision justified.

5165~~~
I think the reason he wont be another Ozil  is because he has pace and skills.... which is suited for EPL.. For right now, he is just not on form..... He still has the 2nd most assists in the EPL this season..

5166~~~
It's what happens if you pay the highest wages in the country and don't have a manager like Mourinho controlling everything. 

He won the Champions League with the team he probably always dreamed of playing for last season. Not surprising he doesn't look as interested fighting for 3rd place and an FA Cup.

5167~~~
He was an up and down player at Real. We over paid. Get used to it. 

He had a completely shit day. Here he's expected to make things happen, at Real he was just a cog in the wheel. He needs to relax and get some patience. He's over doing it.

5168~~~
He's not a play maker he's a guy with a great engine, close control and speed. He will be a great player for us once we are sorted out. But only if he is played left in a midfield 3.

5169~~~
Pace and skills without the brain to guide them are useless and Di Maria plays these days like a brainless player.

Spot on tbh. I think he's feeling the weight of expectation on his shoulders, it's too much for him to play like our best player at the moment. He's a great support player.

5170~~~
He's brilliant at walking about and giving the ball away. World class, in fact.

5171~~~
Doubt he'll be here next Summer.

And it all started off so well <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5172~~~
He's a bloody frustrating winger. Just play him in a midfield three please.


Would love to see that.

5173~~~
He will be here next summer.

5174~~~
Horrible game today. Needs to find form, otherwise keep him away from the starting XI.

5175~~~
I just feel he doesn't like it here...in England. Also, let's face it, he shouldn't have ever been classed as world class anyway.

5176~~~
Hopefully, ADM starts working his socks off after the message Van Gaal gave to him today. You can't ask for anything more crystal clear of a message when ADM was subbed off for Januzaj.

5177~~~
The decision to take him off will only become a big deal if the player or supporters make it such. He may be one of our best players but if he's wasting openings like he did towards the end of the first half then he's just as liable as everybody else to take his seat on the substitutes bench.

Hopefully a lesson learned today and he'll return to the side midweek with the bit between his teeth. Talk of his sale come the summer is just silly.

5178~~~
He's a very weak player, any time an opponent puts some pressure on him he loses the ball so easily.

5179~~~
I'm always surprised by some reactions, Di Maria is fine, he was always an inconsistent and frustrating player. He will be like that for a very long time, unless he follows Robben's path and like him become a consistent player but Robben changed his game and gain a lot of patience.

The thing with Di Maria is that it doesn't matter if he is inconsistent at the end of the season his numbers are almost always high. The important thing is to not build your team for him but despite him, just use him like a satellite player in your system.

5180~~~
Isn't this the main reason we signed him though?

5181~~~
The knee-jerking in here is a bit much. He didn't play well today, tried to do too much. But that doesn't mean that he's not a top player.

5182~~~
Let's give it another season why dont we. This isnt a train smash, he does have resale value and rich suitors.

5183~~~
"I dont thinks he likes it here."

5184~~~
He's very wank do far. Frustrating as he cost a fortune and the lad he more or less replaced is having a great season in Portugal. Was Nani ever quite that bad and frustrating?  I don't think so

5185~~~
If we did we are idiots, with Madrid he wasn't one of the main players the system was built for Ronaldo and Bale. Di Maria was supposed to run on the left and allow Ronaldo to drift inside.
And in defense he was important because Bale and Ronaldo don't like to defend, so Ancelotti figured that he could use Di Maria and Modric to support  Xabi Alonso in middle depending on who comes back from the two wide players.

Di Maria--Xabi Alonso-Modric--Bale
or
Ronaldo--Di Maria-Xabi Alonso--Modric

5186~~~
I hope he is happy at the club, because we need a player of his ilk to go forward.  But if he isn't there is no reason to have a player who doesn't want to play for us.  Seems to be under a lot of pressure atm as well, with the hefty price tag and all.  If we finish in the top 4 and qualify for the CL, I'm sure he will be relieved when more quality players join the club and will play with more freedom.

5187~~~
Very poor today and didn't look remotely interested, LvG made the right call to hook him at flaf time, pretty worrying from him in truth.

5188~~~
Since we've actually seen him have a great impact for us, I'm surprised some people feel like it's not possible for him to succeed at United. He'll get back there and I bet it will happen as the weather improves. Hopefully right in time to guarantee us a top 4 spot.

5189~~~
I dream of a lineup with Janucaj and DM playing wide. If both are on form teams will fear us again. DM has too much quality to not bounce back. We must keep him.

5190~~~
So he is a seasonal World Class player then?

5191~~~
Problem is though, buying more quality players doesn't guarantee he'll be able to play with more freedom, or automatically improve.

5192~~~
Agreed, but it will take away some of the pressure.  That is, fans and coaching staff will not expect him to be the get-out-of-jail card every game.

5193~~~
To be fair though, his poor form has been reaching the stage lately where people are hardly expecting him to deliver and be our get out of jail card. Been off form for a while now.

5194~~~
See that's the thing I'm not to certain about because I think both things aren't entirely related. Everyone who has followed his career before last season knows that the majority of his career actually consistent of games like today with the occasional world class performance in between. Only last season he really found some consistency in his performances. So he might have the quality to be a class player but so does Nani and he couldn't really find a consistent form for the majority of his career either.

I'm not saying he will never get back to his best but given his history we need to consider the possibility that we payed 60M GBP for a slightly better Nani.

5195~~~
Not that I don't trust LVG, but I'm sure this is also manager related.  I'm pretty sure Fergie would have turned it around by now.  What I really would like to see is LVG living up to his reputation, show some ballSH, and drop him.

5196~~~
No, I just think it's been common among players from Spain and South America to see them tail off during the winter months in the first PL season. Especially the "flair" players. 

Not saying it hasn't been disappointing, it obviously has, but I'd be more surprised if this is as good as he'll be the rest of the year.

5197~~~
Always been inconsistent and erratic. Him drifting infield is a hazard in itself as he's prone to giving the ball away which will lead to opposition counter attacks. Said it before he came and I'll say it again, he's never a 60 million pound player and its quite clearly obvious we overpaid handily.

5198~~~
While I think he's done nothing to deserves to start I guess he needs to play in a bigger tempo and our possession games doesn't suit him that much..

 I think we will up the tempo in the course of time so he will get better. Shame he couldn't adapt his game as for example Herrera..

5199~~~
Do people actually realize that players are humans and even if they are world class(or w/e you call it),still some of them need more or less time to adopt on new country,new league,they need to learn new language too etc.? Some need 6 months,some need a 9 or 12,i bet some said tones of bs towards Vidic in his 1st 6 months,hell some would even want him sold/gone/send on loan w/e.

Have a feeling that he might show next season how much posters(including me) are clueless regarding football related stuffs.Just check Ashley Young thread for example,even they might not be comparable due him not being world class on the first place but still.

5200~~~
He should play with less freedom, because it's his decision making that's poor. It was also in the beginning of the season when he showed some good stuff, and in the WC he also started some matches with frustrating bad decisions. When he's got the feeling he's got to force something special, the decisions get even worse.

The do's and don'ts, especially the don'ts, have to became part of his instinct. Then he will be consistent enough and he will be a world class winger.

5201~~~
I thought we overpaid massively in the summer and he is still yet to convince me otherwise, does he even want to be here after all the Paris rumours, maybe do a deal with  psg say 20 mil + Lucas Moura & Veratti, that would be a perfect bit of business.

5202~~~
I've said from the start he didn't even want to come here, he was more forced into this move than anything. I'm sure PSG will pay big bucks for him if it does come to it. Doubt we would lose a lot on him tbh.

5203~~~
Mesut Ozil - leaves Madrid, looks outstanding in the premier league for about a month and half. Average, uninterested and unmotivated ever since

Di Maria.....

5204~~~
That is just ridiculous with all due respect. Can't just get rid because they are going through a bad spell. He showed in his first few months that he can make it here he just needs his confidence back. My biggest concern is whether he actually wants to adapt to England and make it work in the long term, right now no one really is sure.

5205~~~
Would like to see that too. I can still see him as a winger, it was just a bad day at the office. The issue with him is that of team balance. When he starts to roam around the pitch all over the place it affects our set up. When Januzaj came on you can see what changed, Januzaj stayed on the wing and utilised the FB (as did Young) sticking to their position. Di Maria needs to do the same (and more) stick to his position. Once we get Shaw back (+Rojo at CB alongside Smalling) the Balance of the team will be right and we will look a whole lot better.

5206~~~
He was always a supporting player while now he is the 'superstar' of the team. Add to that, he was as inconsistent as Nani for his entire career bar the last year (in fact, I think that only in his last season he was better than Nani on 2010-2012). He should do better and likely will do once we have a better team, but he isn't the player for whatever reasons we thought he'll be.

If Paris gives us north of 50m then we should accept the offer.

5207~~~
Nope. 

He had a few good games. And a bit of luck.

5208~~~
I'd hate to be a player at our club sometimes when you have critics like this. All the best players have an element of luck in their play, Messi a prime example.

The culture of some our own fans seemingly wanting our players to fail baffles me, but hey at least they can say to their Twitter buddies that they were right all along, that's the most important thing...

5209~~~
I don't have any Twitter buddies. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

So lonely....

5210~~~
People keep posting midfield trios with him because it worked for one half of a season at Madrid, totally ignoring the fact La Liga is very different physically, that Madrid had better CM's behind him than we have and much better wide attackers that pushed teams back to give him space to run into.

Add to this the fact LvG likes patient, possession based midfield play and I'd be surprised if LvG has any intention of playing him as anything but a wide player who has license to roam, long term.

5211~~~
Needs to sort out his form soon. Been so wasteful for a long time now. I actually liked the way he ran at Swansea last week, but there wasn't even that today. Correct decision to take him off, a big though since he has the potential to such a big player. Now the question is, will he start the next game? Who thought we'd be saying that about our £60 million signing. I hope that substitution was the "kick up the arse" that he needs.

5212~~~
I bet once spring starts and a bit of sunshine comes he'll be better. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5213~~~
Shocking performance

5214~~~
He needs to go back to doing the basics right. At Madrid he was up and down but what stood out last summer was he finally clicked as to picking his moments. Of course having Modric and Alonso beside you and Bale, Ronaldo, Benzema ahead helps massively but we have players who he can work with too yet he's choosing to do everything himself.

He's not Messi, Robben, Hazard where his ball control is exemplary to get out of spaces. His passing range is pretty hit and miss. He's a counter attack player who has a great engine and can beat players when there is space for him to commit. He hasn't got the variation Nani had to beat players but Di Maria can get from A to B in a flash, is forward thinking and will get back to good form.

5215~~~
I'm a bit late here, but I've just read this. Anyway, it's not fair enough, given that his loss of form has been a major factor in our disappointing play. If he's really said this, then he needs to man up, grow a set and start playing better.

5216~~~
Let's stop signing superstars then, OK? First ppl were on and on for years how we can't attract superstars. But then since the Mata signing we have had a change of transfer strategy and ppl are complaining even more.

I have said it in another thread: Despite being inconsistent he was a starter under Mourinho and I can remember Mourinho claiming how he needs him back in the team when he was out injured.

Obviously last season was something else for him, but even before that he was quality, even if inconsistent, which is what wingers can be. 

At the moment I am not even sure he knows what he needs to do on the pitch. He is used to instructions from Mourinho/Ancelotti whereas LvG seems to confuse everyone with his communication and over complicating things.

Maybe <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a>  or <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> who watched RM and Di Maria regularly can tell more about Di Maria in his first 3 seasons at RM but based on the games I had seen he was still quality despite being frustrating to watch at times.

5217~~~
He needs a good talking to about his decision-making. Very delicate situation for someone that cost us so much money. You don't want to alienate him and have his confidence hit rock bottom, yet we can't afford to play him if he is going to mess up when we desperately need the points.

5218~~~
Was down right poor today and a player of his reputation should be doing better.As soon as we started to click through the gears he played better but that ball to Falcao right at half-time typified a poor first half. 

However, I just think that Di Maria is burning out from what was a BIG year for him. He was a massive player for Madrid and played week in, week out for them in a charge for La Liga and the Champions League. He then played a big part in Argentina's push for the world cup in which he did get a bit of an injury. He didn't get much of a break or pre season but was thrown into the fold with us where he probably has more responsibility compared to his previous club but has been shifted around a lot in search for a balance. I wonder if it has just taken it's toll on him and wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see his best form until next season.

5219~~~
Everyone is blaming this on Seasonal Affective Disorder now?

5220~~~
He's fine, everyone is overreacting, he had a poor game but wan't that bad, still burst forward, and found good space a lot of the time only for him not to receive the ball. Him and Valencia were on different wavelengths today and Di Maria's decision making wasn't great, but he's still a class player, he creates chances (a great ball into Rooney today) and has contributed to 14 goals in 23 games, not a bad return in a very chaotic season. He tries things and gets forward, he loses the ball yes, but I blame that on the players behind him, we pass the ball sideways between the full backs and Blind/Herrera, until we finally pass it to di Maria who has no option but to try and push it forward, or try and cross it in. Other than maybe Di Maria and Rooney, our off the ball movement has been terrible (though the second half today was better)

5221~~~
That's what happened with Elano didn't it? The minute the cold weather kicked in his form went to pot <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5222~~~
People keep banging about him not liking being here, cold weather, food, language, whatever..
Why wont we call spade a spade. He's out of form and that's that.

5223~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5224~~~
Just out of curiosity, is it always us who end up with the South American/Mediterranean background players who seem to have issues with the culture and city?

City have had many players from these cultures and not a peep of "homesickness, unsettled" etc.

Liverpool have had many too and they thrive over there.

The culture and settling in takes time but for the on pitch stuff that's his job and he needs to deliver. No one else to blame.

5225~~~
Rojo seems fine. In fact he mostly always looks happy. Dunno, just our bad luck with the rest probably...

5226~~~
I think it's just a convenient excuse. I highly suspect it could be a management problem though

5227~~~
Are we really doing this whole "he's played out of decision" nonsense? Seriously?

So far this season he's looked excellent centrally and shit centrally. Plus excellent on the wing and shit on the wing. He's just been woefully inconsistent. The position stuff is a complete red herring.

5228~~~
Robinho wants a word with you...

But yeah I do see what you are saying in that our South Americans are generally homesick much quicker than other teams around us.

5229~~~
So what happened to allowing foreign players a season to settle in a new country, new culture, language, team, manager, league.....ect before making any judgement?

5230~~~
Or maybe they are fine and we are paranoid. I read yesterday Di Maria saying that he was fine at Manchester and that he needed to adapt to his new life in England the same way, he did with Lisbon and Madrid where he "struggled" the first season.

5231~~~
This is why simply throwing money at great players isn't gonna cut it.

5232~~~
what on earth happened today that he came off at half time, and half the thread are slating him!?

5233~~~
Ask Costa.

5234~~~
Di Maria has always been like this he is very hit and miss, he was never worth anything like 60m and he will never be able to play at that kind of level week in week out. He had one really good season playing in a different position and we don't even play him there so I think it is unfair to be too critical. Real problem is our transfer policy rather than the player himself, if there is any truth in psg wanting him for close to what we paid or a deal involving marquinhos I wouldn't be Too fussed if we let him go.

5235~~~
Or Alexis Sanchez.

5236~~~
He looks like he badly needs a summer off.

5237~~~
I think that's spot on and explains what we're seeing on the field. He's happy with the pay cheque but is totally disinterested in playing for us. No motivation at all in any of his performances for a while. Like he's just going through the motions.

Doesn't seem to have any desire to achieve anything with us at all. Can't use a player like that, regardless of his ability, if he's not prepared to put in a shift and show that ability with us.

5238~~~
He was dreadful, he made the wrong choices each and every time and wasn't able to pass or dribble correctly.

5239~~~
You can't just turn shit in a few weeks. He is world class but he is playing in a team with confidence as low as the floor. When he was at Madrid last year he was unplayable but so was Ronaldo, Bale and Modric. Atm the club as a whole is a mess. Our star players can't play well together. Falcao, Di Maria, Mata are not shit players (who had a good season or two) ffs. The fact is they are playing in a team where the defence can't play out from the back and where they crumble after an attack. This is the same team which varies week in week out. 
Maybe that's just the way it is that such players are better suited in other leagues or teams. They certainly are not shite though. 
When I watch DI Maria and Falcao play for us I see the same Di Maria and Falcao from 2 years ago but in the same United team from 2 years ago. Not much has changed really.

5240~~~
He's said he wants Manchester United to be his last club in Europe before he moves back to Argentina. Just because a player is out of form (he even admitted he is) doesn't mean he's disinterested in playing for us. He's a class player in a new league going trough a rough phase, it happens. I'm not too worried, he's had these spells at every club he's been at, he'll bounce back.

5241~~~
I know this sounds crazy, but I actually am beginning to think this.
It'll be interesting to see how he does in April and May as these are warmer months.

5242~~~
Is that Costa in the top of the table, CL team?

5243~~~
Before January Di Maria wasn't very good last season and Madrid is not very warm in the winter.

5244~~~
Is di Maria in bottom-half table team who hasn't been in CL for 10 years?

5245~~~
Are you suggesting Arsenal are playing anything like us at present. Here's one for you, how many utd players would start for Arsenal on the last 10 games performances?

5246~~~
Costa is a striker who plays for Hazard and Fabregas, two players who created more chances than all our players together (I'm exaggerating).

5247~~~
What????

5248~~~
Correct.

5249~~~
Argentinian at United, it's something that will never work

Veron
Heinze
Tevez
Di Maria

5250~~~
Spot on. 
We should bring in better players and let him be a devastating supporting player.  He is the type of supporting player we have to have if we want to get back to being one of the best teams in the world.

5251~~~
Forget what he says and look at what he's doing. His performances aren't those of an out of form player, they are the performances of someone unmotivated and just going through the motions.

There is a huge difference between someone trying hard yet not being able to find their touch, and someone not concerned whether they have their touch or not. He's the latter.

5252~~~
You were one of those that had a same opinion of Young. You have absolutely no idea what so ever. Not being funny but how you've come to that conclusion beggars belief.....

5253~~~
And our strikers can use the same argument for di Maria, after all he's known for his creating skills, surpassing the best players in assists tally and so on. People make it sound like he's playing for a fecking Stoke.

5254~~~
So you are blaming a player's performances solely on the team surrounding him not doing well? Even when Arsenal wasn't doing well, Sanchez was performing. He had his struggles, I'll give di Maria those as well, but it's been too long now.

EDIT: And we're still ahead of Arsenal by the way.

5255~~~
Did you followed Di Maria before this season ?

5256~~~
He's one of the worlds top, top players. Proved it at club and international level. He's played outstanding in big games. No question about his pedigree. Maybe some patience wouldn't go amiss by some fans.

5257~~~
Di Maria is second only to Fabregas in terms of assists. He was crap today but still created our best chance in the first half. Rojo and Young both should've scored.

5258~~~
So you think he's deliberately miscontrolling balls and misplacing passes because he doesn't care? If that's the case LvG would have pulled him off after 10 minutes. You could see what he was trying to do with his passes/crosses, but they didn't have accuracy. That happens to every player, if you're out of form this happens more often.

He's going trough a rough patch and he has never been Mr. Consistent. He's been trough these phases at Benfica and Real Madrid aswell, was he not bothered back then either? He might be unhappy at the moment (which can happen in a new country, bad circumstances etc.) but that doesn't mean you don't give your all in every match. And how are you so sure he's unmotivated? People are writing off players too quick here.

5259~~~
It's only stats but Di Maria is pretty good in that department with 44 chances created, that's around David Silva (48) numbers.

5260~~~
The last time I watched football and played at a decent level, the game was played by 11 players. The games also a lot easier when your playing with quality performers around you. Where's Sanchez at present....and despite our league position, how many players would get into the Arsenal side on this seasons form?

5261~~~
Then why bring up the shit 'accomodation in the new league' card up? It's not like people are constantly slating him, he's had a shit game, deserves the criticism, pretty simple stuff really. Not questioning his pedigree either but he's been nothing short of terrible today.

<a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> I know, on top of that he's our top assisting player at the moment, I've got no problem with him whatsoever but I find it amusing that people try to weirdly defend him from criticism when he's had a shocker like today.

5262~~~

5263~~~
Basically we paid 'match winner' money for a guy who isn't a match winner.
We should be looking at bringing in a focal point, and somebody who's proven their ability to win matches consistently.

We overpaid, but what's done is done. He'll still be useful if we can get in a proper match winner like Bale. But anyone expecting Di Maria to handle being the main man will be left disappointed.

5264~~~
Heinze and Tevez did fine for us. 

Veron is an exception. 

It's too early to judge Di Maria. 

In general, it is just silly to say that players from the XYZ nation will not do well at United. It is not the 1980's any more.

5265~~~
I don't think that we defend his last performance, we are defending the player morality some posters who obviously never heard of him before, are creating an alternate reality where Di Maria is a consistent player who is in fact, playing shit because he is not happy or because like flowers only rise under the light and warmness of the spring.
When the reality is that a lot of posters haven't watched Real Madrid play last season or the seasons before and still think that he is a consistent middle of the field player.

5266~~~
It is clear that very few posters on here actually saw his whole stint at Madrid or even the last season one. As a winger he was always an erratic player, he is not someone who is going to have solid outings consistently. Also last season, he did not magically turn into a CM. He was deployed a runner in the midfield who could pick up the ball from deep and burst forward, very important for a CA team. Also the movement of Ronaldo from left to center, allowed him to run that wing as well. He has also never been a slick assist provider, someone who will thread through a pin point pass or even a cross. His run and shot during the CL final, which was eventually turned in by Bale, aptly typifies the type of attacking contribution, he is most likely to affect. 

Problem right now is that he is not having good games in between the bad ones, it is mostly few bad games in between average ones. I think that is more to do with our whole team right now. Di Maria is not a player that can flourish in an average team. He needs to play in a team that is playing well.

5267~~~
Fair enough that.

5268~~~
I don't think he's ever going to fit with LVG's style of play. He's far to adventurous a player.

He needs to play in a team that play fast, counter attacking football. Not slow, safe, possession based stuff. He needs to take risks. That Madrid team was perfect for him, no wonder he's looking like he doesn't want to be here, because, he probably doesn't. Seems like another case of a great player, bought to the club at the wrong time. Ala Veron, Berbatov and Mata.

It is beggars belief that LVG would sanction a deal for £60 million on a player that seems to go against every basic principle he wants in a footballer.

5269~~~
I genuinely believe LvG came in underestimating the job. I think his mindset was that David Moyes spectacularly failed in everything and with his profound self belief in his philosophy, his mere arrival would make us improve. A lot of United fans pinned everything on Moyes, and I believe LvG did too so maybe that's why things took a while to get going in the window. He thought we were better than we were. He was probably shocked at the level of quality we have. He's contradicted and backtracked so much from what he said in the summer.

5270~~~
There were glimpses of his quality and class in this match, but overall, he wasn't that good. He did deliver in some sweet, dangerous crosses that our players didn't convert, and his movement was also quite good, but he was consistently failing to beat van Aanholt whilst Januzaj bettered him, and his deliveries, whilst pretty good, were quite inconsistent. I think the moment when he didn't pass to Young in the first half decided it for van Gaal.

He can still be a great attacking threat and chance creator for us, but his reckless style of play won't make him as consistent as Hazard at the moment. I think what van Gaal's trying to do is to refine di Maria's game so that he isn't reckless and inconsistent, and this will take time. Initially, I believe van Gaal wanted to give him all of the freedom to play his natural game, but after seeing how inconsistent he's been, he's trying to control di Maria's recklessness and convert it to ruthlessness. This is similar to what van Gaal tried to do with Ribery at Bayern Munich, I feel.

Even if he is inconsistent, you could see the quality and class in his game. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5271~~~
Maybe an idea to give him a couple of weeks off, let him and his family have a break, and get some sun on his back.

Hopefully by the time he's back he will be fresh, have some confidence back, and spring will have sprung, and he can have a proper impact for some of the big games we have ahead.

Long term I am of a mindset that he will be a much better player for us next season having had the settling in time, same goes for Shaw.

5272~~~
How on earth do you come to that conclusion? You've genuinely just made all that up in your head.

5273~~~
Rojo seems to be working so far.

5274~~~
Painful watching him. Hooking him was the right thing. Still back him but he needs to wake up and realise the things that are contributing to him having poor performances.

5275~~~
And yet even when everybody is playing poorly, you can still be the one to work extremely hard. I don't see that with di Maria on a consistent basis. Early on in the season, we weren't doing well and in some games, he single-handedly carried us to victory or prevented us from losing. That hasn't happened in a while though, which is why he deserves the criticism. 

Aside of that, you're pretending as if we're a side facing a relegation when in reality, we're still in third place. 

Players who would get into that Arsenal side? Herrera, Carrick, Smalling, Rojo, de Gea are all names I could see in Arsenal's lineup just from the top of my head.

5276~~~
He did this all the time at Madrid. He has games like this where he constantly gives the ball away. In general the solution is to switch the position he's playing or sub him off and get him some rest. Nothing to worry about.

5277~~~
You do know some players in LvG's system have freedom? His so called creative players can take risks, Di Maria is one of them. As long as the rest of the team are rigid and in shape it doesn't matter if Di Maria loses the ball high up the pitch. He wouldn't have played a full 90 minutes at all if he couldn't take risks, because he's way to adventurous for a player who doesn't have this freedom.

5278~~~
I think we need to take him out of the team for a couple of games to see if that has an effect on him. He was very poor again today.

5279~~~
I agree with you. Just how I feel.

5280~~~
How is his average rating 6.2? That is too high compared to a lot of others. He has been awful for a while now. Well done to LvG for taking him off, it was deserved. Wouldn't start him midweek. He needs to sort himself out.

5281~~~
Should be dropped along with Falcao. Januzaj and Mata in.

5282~~~
That's interesting.

However, I wonder if this is an open indictment to all the Real Madrid managers he had, including Mourinho. By his current age (27), you would expect someone out there would have channeled his reckless style into ruthlessness. I'm really surprised that all of that time with Mourinho and then Ancelotti didn't leave a lasting mark on Di Maria's career in terms of consistency.

5283~~~
Think he's looked significantly better in a central position as opposed to a wide position this season to be honest. Don't think it's any secret.

5284~~~
I believe that's because di Maria is so fast-paced and direct in his game that trying to suppress that wild playing style could make him less effective. Look at how his influence decreased when he was playing as a rigid left winger during October when we were playing the 4-1-4-1. Then again, you could see how Ancelotti shaped him up as a roaming, energetic, pseudo-central midfielder, and that made him quite consistent.

I do believe van Gaal can make di Maria more consistent. He did have an influence in making Ribery a very consistent, ruthless wide player. I'm sure he can do the same with di Maria.

5285~~~
His best performances in the last 3 or 4 months have all been out wide.

5286~~~
Yeah, when we first got him I was fully behind the idea of him playing as a LCM/LW hybrid as that second half of last season he had for Real was the best, most consistent football of his career. However I think myself and others forgot to factor in the different league style and the quality of the CM's behind him and forwards in front of him that helped with his success in that role at Real.

I think the one place we can't play him is the left wing, he's utterly useless if all you're using him for is to run down the wing and cross it. He plays much better from the right where he can whip crosses in on the cut back and also drive inwards and look for through balls or one-twos with the striker or AM.

5287~~~
He has the look of a player who has given up a bit at the moment.

I think both him and Falcao are still getting caught out by how much more physical this league is than Spain and how much more tolerant the referees are of strong challenges.

5288~~~
It would be interesting to see how this develops in the summer, hopefully PSG (his first choice destination?) may come sniffing and offer up a large amount or maybe a player swap, honestly at this point I'd take verratti and lucas for ADM

5289~~~
Not that a swap would happen and I am very much backing Di Maria (even after that woeful display) but I would be taking Matuidi from that squad every day.

5290~~~
He can be very good on the right, has been earlier in his career too. But he'l always be ridiculously inconsistent. His most consistent and devastating season was last year when he played centrally. The Nani comparisons will always be there if he plays out wide.

5291~~~
Forgot all about him, yeah a matuidi and verratti swap would sort our midfield out for years. Then if we brought in other youngsters we are linked with like clyne, dyBala and depay then we would be building a properly good young team. At this point we should be doing that, the club needs to go through a proper transition where we shift all the past it players and deadwood

5292~~~
Marquinhos, Verrati and Lucas in a straight swap.

5293~~~
Somewhat agree but I don't think that starts with Di Maria leaving. Willing to give him time. If we make the Champions League, we will need the quality of the likes of Di Maria.

5294~~~
Swaps rarely happen.

5295~~~
Do you not think Marquinhos is a little lightweight for our league? we would need to bulk him up bigtime if he ever came to the prem, Andy Carroll would make him his bitch. De Gea was the same though when he first signed he was like a rake but now he's built up some muscle.

Yeah true that but one can dream.

5296~~~
He's 20, I think he's too talented not to go in for.

5297~~~
So Van Gaal's been getting stick for continuing to pick RvP when he was playing badly. Has the time come to drop Di Maria? Young and Januzaj were both far superior to him yesterday. Seems harsh to drop either of them in order to start Di Maria.

5298~~~
It's a difficult one for me, mainly down to money. It apparently doesn't matter to LVG who costs what and earns what but you surely have to give a £60m signing every chance to settle in to the side and surely games will help that. 

I'd play him over Januzaj again on the prevision that he will be hauled off again if he doesn't step it up. Januzaj is still young so managing his play time and using him as an impact player can still benefit him.

5299~~~
He actually started quite brightly for us. Peaking in the early parts of the Leicester game. I dont think the problem lies in him finding it hard to adapt to the PL like LVG said. I think the opponents found a way to stop him from being effective. One of it is by simply pushing him while he's running with or even without the ball. He's just another Luke Chadwick in this sense.

5300~~~
Can't agree mate, he is far far above Chadwick, in another dimension altogether. The problem lies in LVG's discipline and system. When ADM arrived there were great moments of free flowing footy. Now he is forced into positions that tie him up strange places with what looks like an even stranger role. I get LVG trying to turn Rooney into a Schweinesteiger type role but what he's doing with AdM is unclear. 

The opponents are all pressing us in our area and this has made it difficult in so many ways. We struggle at times to even reach the half way line. The consequences are that by the time the ball reaches ADM or Falcao they are man marked or boxed in. Until LVG gets motion and mobility from the half way line forward these problems will continue. ADM yesterday was a shadow of the player who arrived with dazzling runs and cheeky goals. He runs into boxes on either flank and is stifled in the middle. His long passes have often gone into orbit. He looks lost for a solution. 

LVG needs to rethink his game. Personally I would let ADM take out 2 or 3 defenders and let someone like Ander capitalise on it. However at times we look so square for fear of taking a risk we just end up in a box or losing the ball. We need to get more running off the ball forward, creative pass and movement to speed up our game. Only when we do that will we see ADM's value restored.

5301~~~
He played quite bad yesterday but I think some people are over-reacting a bit. Wouldn't surprise me if he get's dropped for the midweek game against Newcastle.

5302~~~
Not saying that he is similar to Chadwick's quality. Just similar body strength. Easily pushed off the ball. 

You want him to get past 2-3 players but he cant do it consistently. He is good at running fast into free spaces but once the opponents manmarked him, he is easily dispossessed at times. I noticed that he was given lots of space and time in the beginning of the season. He should just play one touch passes first to get him enough space to run into. Like the penalty he won at Burnley.

5303~~~
Ok, I misunderstood you. Agree with the rest. He had lots of time because sides hadn't started to press us in our own half. I first noticed it at Spurs, second half. Now everyone's doing it but LVG has only plan B to resolve it. We're too predictable and this has undermined ADM AND Falcao's impact. We need to restore the rapid pass and movement that's really our game to relieve the pressure all round.

5304~~~
I really can't see PSG selling Veratti easy. Don't they rate him as their best player or one of the best? If we wanted all 3 of them it'd be ADM and £40 at least I think. I would go all out for Veratti though, always said it, the guy oozes class he's just quality.

5305~~~
It's too early to write ADM off. His present play is a reflection of the overall squad/system/games. Things will change and his class will be restored. Quality players don't just become pumpkins in a season.

5306~~~
I actually felt he suffers from the same problem as Falcao. He is trying too hard atm to make something happen. He needs to relax a bit and don't try to make a dribbling, fancy pass or impossible shot with every opportunity he gets.

5307~~~
I can't say I watched him loads at Real so I could be wrong but I just think at the moment he's got too much freedom.

Some players despite great qualities aren't suited to that Ronaldo type role where you do what you want. It's hard to do that and make sure you end up in the right place at the right times. They're better in a more fixed role.

Looking at ADM he to me needs to be doing something specific. Earlier in the season he knew his role was to get the ball and run. He opened things up, pushed teams back etc.

Now he's allowed to drift or ends up on the last shoulder and he doesn't look like he knows what to do. When he goes deep the other team often has the chance to get organised and so its harder to start running at them. He's not caching them on a counter. His crossing is to varied some of that is because he himself has been sloppy and some of it is getting the ball too deep.

For me so far, despite his superstar price tag it doesn't mean we need to play him in such a free role. He earned his price tag being in a more specific role, that's what we need him to do.

5308~~~
Yeah, agree with this. Hererra's had similar issues in his first few games but seems to have adapted quicker than the other two.

5309~~~
Have to say I'm amazed at the lengths people will go to try and blame everyone but Di Maria for his poor form.

5310~~~
What do you mean by that ?

5311~~~
And besides not many young CBs look like physical beasts at that age.

5312~~~
I didn't not blame ADM i think he's been sloppy in his play and selfish in his decisions. I think as part of that he's demonstrating that we shouldn't be treating him as a Ronaldo type, allowed to just play where he wants, which I think is definitely reducing his impact on games.

5313~~~
The way so many comments are excuses based on his position or how he's being used. When he's proven capable of being crap in almost every possible attacking role. IMO the only valid excuse is the fact he's new to the league.

5314~~~
A good thing about him is that he can handle his own inconsistency. He can waste the ball 4 times in a row, and just try something difficult again with the same enthousiasm and conviction. Of course in his current poor form, that doesn't work out but his form is a different problem. Still he had one absolutely brilliant cross yesterday, few players can play a ball like that when in great form. 

He will keep overdoing it and wasting the ball every now and then, but there's a time and place were he really shouldn't. I'm sure Van Gaal will work on his decision making in this aspect.

5315~~~
He's looking less and less like a Premier League player. Is he strong enough for the hustle and bustle of English football? Gets brushed off the ball so easily, kinda like a teenage player that you hope will one day toughen up.

5316~~~
For all the stick he's getting, and rightly so because he's been rubbish recently, but it is worth noting that he's still got the most number of assists for us this season, and is joint second in the overall PL list. That deserves to be mentioned. 

I honestly think he just needs to play in midfield, as the left side of a 3, and let him get on with it. Thats where he'll be at his best. He'll still be inconsistent at times, because he's just one of those flair players that will have games where nothing comes off, but he's going to be far more inconsistent on the wing. His best performances, by a mile, were his early ones where he was playing in midfield. He also seemed to be coming back into a bit more form a few games ago, then was moved back to the wing. The Madrid fans all warned us, that he's is inconsistent as feck on the wing. He's best in midfield, so just play him there.

5317~~~
I'd like Januzaj get a start against Newcastle. He did very well once he came on and caused Sunderland all sorts of problems.
With Di Maria - he would get the ball, start dribbling and then get easily dispossessed. There were times where I felt that even I could dispossess him - he really wasn't up to much and rightfully, got subbed off.

I realise that some people in here want us to give him a chance because we spent £60M, but we must remember that we need to win games and if that means playing Januzaj (or any other player) in his place, to ensure we win games, then so be it.

I have also read lots of excuses being made on behalf of ADM - this is wrong. He is a £60M player, who should now be at the peak of his powers and he needs to perform as such.

5318~~~
meh - not good , not bad.

5319~~~
Nope. The return to form came <i>when</i> he was moved to the wing. In fact, it was half way through the game (against Preston, I think?) when he was shifted to the right wing - after underwhelming in the centre - and finally started looking like a threat.

5320~~~
He's in poor form, and players in poor form make rubbish decisions. Part of the blame for the poor form has to be shared by the manager, no question about that. All that said, it's far far too early to even consider selling him. He's still settling in as far as I'm concerned and LvG has said the same yesterday

5321~~~
You're absolutely correct, but it would be wise to start shopping for potential buyers if he doesn't look like a WC player next season, the good thing about Chelsea is that they know when to cut their losses and get a good amount for players, we can easily get another influential midfield player.

5322~~~
To be honest, I think it's the usual thing. When Ronaldo was at United, people talked about Rooney sacrificing himself to help Ronaldo, and if only that burden was removed Rooney would be liberated to become a Ballon D'Or candidate, then it was Ozil, last year it was Di Maria. Di Maria is being expected to inspire, create, amuse, and score but he isn't that player.

The trouble with the adaptation argument is that he really was better in his earlier matches.

Just inconsistent then? Yes, if he's supposed to be the main man. That's not him, he's not a big goalscorer and he seems anxious under the burden of being the main creative force. I think he's been given some rules by LvG, but all those rules are doing right now are making him hesitant and that extra time he's spending thinking is costing him the chance to do anything.

For Ancelotti, he learned to be the ball carrier from defence to attack, to take over Ronaldo's wing when Ronaldo pulled inside, to take over Marcelo's position or even Bale's. It became very fluid, very fast, very efficient. His best play for them was, odd as it may sound, the middle third of the pitch.

I suspect LvG's rules give him freedom in the final third, but are stricter in the middle third. I think he's trying to learn how to do it. I don't believe the stuff about him not trying, or not wanting to be here. If he hits form, I reckon he'll suddenly be very happy to play for us. I don't know if he can do the job that LvG wants, but if he can then I think it's just a matter of patience, he needs to understand and trust his teammates to get it right.

5323~~~
Agreed with everything here. When ADM gets in the final third he does seem to try too hard. His passes are too hard or often miss the mark. As with all creative players he gets frustrated by failing. He needs to slow down and trust his colleagues more, but I think LVG could influence things here. Ander has helped but Rooney could be a lot more supportive and in doing so improve his game.

5324~~~
I guess it also doesn't help that he's being made to provide for strikers, who are nowhere near the top of their own games.

5325~~~
He's been getting an easy ride from the media, that's for sure.

5326~~~
Well because at least he never hides unlike a certain ... <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

5327~~~
Recycling the ball = hiding, apparently. Hardly Ozil's fault no one moves for him, and once again Ramsey is out whilst Walcott is getting back to full-fitness.

The media were unfairly ruthless on him after his excellent start, yet they're not laying into di Maria, who cost much more and came in with a bigger reputation.

FWIW I think he'll come good, just like Ozil is (though he's had to bulk up, which I think ADM will have to do as well.

They've both come from the same team which is used to dominating opponents, and the players only have a handful of games each season where they are required to actually fight it out. I think for both it's been a big wake-up call to play against teams that constantly fight and try to bully them - so it's no surprise that players like Costa and Sanchez (fighters) have adapted so quickly.

5328~~~
I was half joking, I don't even think Özil has been that bad.
But in the PL a quick explosive player like Di Maria (or even Rooney although he is not that quick anymore), basically players who seem to be involved a lot even if they don't do useful stuff at times just get more credit than players like Özil or Mata.
Even Bale got much more credit for his grand total of 1 great season at Spurs than for example Silva ever has despite consistently being among PL's best players.

Regarding Di Maria I am not worried, he is a quality player and players don't turn shite over night, he'll come good once he (and LvG) adapt a bit more.

5329~~~
I wonder if Di Maria is believing his own hype a bit? As in he feels he can do everything himself because of his giant transfer fee and World XI shit? Just a thought...

5330~~~
What makes you think that ?

5331~~~
A few things... from simple stuff to him taking corners and, more importantly, free-kicks in shooting range (has he ever done this at any club before? What makes him think he's so good at them... because he's clearly terrible at them)... to stuff around his overall play - he seems to hang onto the ball a lot longer then I remember seeing for Madrid/Argentina (but then they do play a faster brand of football), the crazy number of flicks/back-heels, and always trying to play the perfect pass, when a more simple/accurate one will do (see 2 vs. 1 attack with him and Falcao on Saturday).

It's just a theory... probably bollocks... but still.

5332~~~
Ozil gets stick because he plays 'luxurious' football. ADM even when is playing shit looks like he is trying and people love to see that.

5333~~~
I get this feeling as well. I don't remember him taking as many shots for Madrid.

5334~~~
It's a possibility.

Of course, all the stuff you mention there also negates this idea that he's playing far too conservatively under strict instructions from the manager. The opposite, if anything.

5335~~~
He did took a huge amount of stupid shots, it's just Di Maria, he dribbles too much, he tries flicks when he shouldn't, he takes free kicks when Ronaldo or Xabi Alonso don't.

Edit:

5336~~~
They are dumbfounded, scratching their head and asking the same question as we are: Where is he?

5337~~~
I wasn't aware that that's an idea people had? Nothing about him would leave me to believe he's playing it conservative... regardless of whether he's believing in his own hype or not.

5338~~~
It's one of an array of excuses being trotted out to try and blame other people for Di Maria not playing very well.

5339~~~
You could be right, but here is my take on it.

- The one 2vs1 situation the other day - It was a wrong pass rather than the perfect pass. The perfect pass was to Young. I just think he was having a bad day, and didnt see Young. 

- He hangs on to the ball more because no one else in our team actually carries the ball apart from him or Adnan. He is taking a lot of abuse for being the only one in the team willing to try things but I think LVG has given him some sort creative freedom. To me, He has created more chances for the team than anyone else. He should have 4/5 assists from RVP alone.

- Corners/Freekicks - I agree Rooney should really take all or most of them. And whatever happened to RVP taking our corners? It was one of those weird nice surprises about him in 12/13.

- Flicks/backheels - Its the type of player he is. When he was flowing and it was coming off no one was complaining. 

Because at Madrid you had Ronaldo taking 10 shots per game or something. And even Bale loves a pop. Who else at United tries to shoot that often? No one. I still can't believe how little Rooney shoots given the ability he has at long range.

5340~~~
I agree

5341~~~
When on the field, Mata should be taking all our free kicks. Of course, one wonders when we are going to see Mata on the field again (as a starter, not as a last-minute sub.)

5342~~~
Particularly, I think, why he might not be happy. That seems to be the context I see it raised in. Van Gaal is stifling him, therefore he is unhappy and a bit disinterested - and therefore perhaps not playing well. But its certainly been raised as a more direct relationship as well, didnt that Herrera interview last week suggest he was having to adjust his game to suit Van Gaal's system?

5343~~~
The point being, though, there's zero evidence on the pitch of him playing in an inhibited, cautious way. So either the manager is allowing him to take risks or he's actively going against instructions he's been given. Either way the poor performances are down to him and him alone.

5344~~~
Yes. Well, that and the weather of course.

5345~~~
I think the opposite is true though. That there is a leniency with Di Maria that there isn't with others. Players are definitely for the most part more cautious that you'd associate with them, they're not expressing themselves as much. Last year Hazard made a comment about the impact of holding all the creative burden and responsibility, I think it was when Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League. I think the same could be true here. 

I think at the start of the year we played with more freedom of expression generally, which allowed for Di Maria to bounce his creativity off others. The same was true for a few of our other players (Herrera). I think possession has become even more desired since the Leicester loss and our players have had to play within themselves since, bar Di Maria. Di Maria is an instinctual player, and that comes far easier in a fluid team. A more labored and controlled approach encourages thinking time - which doesn't suit Di Maria.

5346~~~
I like how you blame everything on LVG. We know you don't like him but Christ, this is now taking it too far. LVG has always been a BIG fan of attacking wide men right from his Ajax days, players like Robben and Ribery excelled under him. You do realize that Young and Januzaj had the beaten of the fullbacks all day long right? Di Maria needs to pull his finger and sort out himself. If you actually don't know jack-shit about what principles Van Gaal wants in a winger you might actually just give us all a break or do some reading.

5347~~~
Every player thread I go into is about the same stuff - 'damn hes good but its a shame he dont fit in. Good player, wrong club' etc

5348~~~
Well that's certainly a new slant on why Di Maria's poor performances are not really Di Maria's fault but I'm not really convinced.

I can't shake the feeling that we overpaid (massively) for a very talented but perennially inconsistent and unreliable player off the back of one good season where a few excellent performances in big games inflated his reputation out of all proportion to his abilities. What we're seeing at United is the same Di Maria that frustrated Madrid and Argentina fans for the vast majority of his career so far. Compounded by his struggles to adapt to a more physical league (and grim manc weather)

It's comforting to think it's all the managers fault and Di Maria will look like a 60m player as soon as he works out how best to use him. I don't see it myself though. Really bugs me that we seem to have squeezed out Nani to replace him with a player that shares so many of his flaws, at tremendous fecking expense. I think last summer will go down as one of the most cack-handed transfer windows in the history of this club.

5349~~~
I hope this doesn't become another case of Kagawa where it's everything and everyone else fault when he doesn't perform. When I look at players' performances, I judge them by the basic things they do and decide if it's the system/manager or if its the player itself. We broke away with Di Maria, Falcao goes right with a player on his tail, Young is totally free on the left, I mean, do you need a manager or a system to actually tell you the right thing to do in this situation? The only plausible excuse for him is that he's in a new team and a new league and maybe he's getting used to things here, trying to adapt. I don't buy this shit about his position or the system when he can't make simple decisions with any accuracy.

5350~~~
Ridiculous to keep blaming the manager for his terrible performances. None of you were blaming Ferguson when Nani served up shit like this.

5351~~~
That was infuriating. And absolutely feck all to do with Van Gaal.

5352~~~
I totally lost it at that point.

5353~~~
As you already said, when we watched Nani make hare-brained decisions like that how many people blamed Fergie for not knowing how to use him?

5354~~~
His crossing was atrocious! He's overpriced in FPL as well.

5355~~~
Well, the money doesn't really make much difference here though. If you look past the numbers, his performances would still be disappointing had he been 20m based on his reputation alone - even if he came the year before I think. Last season was easily his most consistent, and the ones before might have fluctuated alot but not to the extent of this season. Infact, you could argue he's been fairly consistent. Really good for a while, then poor. Burnley he was decent but besides that it's been either a fairly gradual decline, or simply a ton of mostly equally poor games but with the faith and leniency offered gradually dwindling.

The whole 'managers fault' bit is fair. But I don't subscribe to that thinking either. Sometimes players and systems just don't fit, and won't fit. I get that it's a 'managers job to get the best out of players' bla bla but ultimately it's their job to get the best out of the collective. And unfortunately we've done better results wise since becoming more controlled than at the start of the season where Di Maria looked great. 

I don't think it's a permanent issue with the club or the league either, past the usual new surroundings and settling in lark. I'm confident that in the future we'll see some more expansive football that Di Maria can shine in. He'll still have some shite games, 'cause that's the type of player he is. But that'll be because flair is generally inconsistent and frustrating, it doesn't always pay off rather than a player who looks somewhat lost and isn't playing on instinct. He's thinking too much, trying too hard, it's clear to see. As for the league, <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> made a point earlier that his early games render that point moot (I think?). However, settling into the league is as much about the long term rigorous nature than some honeymoon period of fixtures. It's not going to help things, but it won't last..

Ultimately there's a combination of mitigating factors, which definitely serve up as a good excuse. Whether they're the true cause or whether Di Maria can bypass them it's too early to tell either way.

5356~~~
Anyone got a gif/video of that moment?

5357~~~
Wow!  At last, someone who knows what they are talking about re Di Maria, especially this bolded bit!  Why can't LVG see this though?  Jojojo for manager!!

5358~~~
I don't think that early form renders the adaption argument moot. Sometimes the footballing cliches ring true. There's a big difference between ripping up cannon fodder on a summer afternoon at OT and repeating those peformances on a cold Tuesday night in mid-winter (against Stoke, or anyone else!)

You obviously see his point, though, as per your comment re "honeymoon fixtures".

I also think the fans are much kinder when it comes to a new signings first few games. Getting all giddy about every trick or flick and ignoring the poor decisions or sloppy bits of play that would infuriate as the season wears on. I mean, he was very good in a few of those opening games but rarely for 90 minutes and never without at least some poor passages of play too. He also seemed to have luck on his side in those game, when he could woefully shank a shot at goal, only for it to end up as a pin-point "cross" (which accounts for at least two of his assists this season)

Not to mention that he actually has put in some very good performances more recently too. Just not been able to sustain them.

5359~~~
This is true. But there's a huge contradiction here. Fans are moaning about how United are playing at a slow tempo, that players aren't expressing themselves, that players are playing a controlled game and not 'trying' things. Yet find it infuriating when a player gets things wrong.

Obviously there's a line to be drawn and it's somewhere in the middle of trying nothing and failing everything. But it does seem a tad unfair. I mean, has Ronaldo re-defined the winger role so much that people are far more interested in the effective but predictable wingers now? Only Robben has really nailed that too besides Ronaldo, and only recently. His first few seasons at Bayern were still rife with inconsistency and frustration. It's just the nature of the type of player to me, I expect it. 

Right now Di Maria isn't struggling and getting stuff wrong because it's his nature I agree. But at the start of the season I felt it was more than fair enough that he got praised and had some of his fortune largely ignored. 

This sort of mindset seems to have moved into the crowd. They ask for teams to attack, but then groan when a long run of possession ends. I get it - they wanted quicker football and more risks taken, and it's frustrating as hell to see us keep the ball for ages and then eventually create nothing or have it summed up with something tame. However, the groans don't get this message across, instead they just add to the players hesitancy when trying things. It's like Arsenal syndrome, I'm surprised how quickly it seems to be happening to our fans. It just creates an air of tension which can't be comfortable for the players, which likely won't allow them to fully express themselves.

5360~~~
There's no arguing his ability, LvG has to find a way to get him to perform whether its down to his instructions or a disinterested player. That's a managers job.

We've brought in 3 players for huge fees and LvG hasn't found a way to make any of them provide significant contributions.

5361~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I said it, repeatedly.

5362~~~
Really? Which three players are you talking about?

5363~~~
Di Maria, Herrera and Shaw? Bit harsh on the latter I'd say, he has done ok at left back

5364~~~
I think this is a typical reaction to a team when you bring in several high profile players. It happens all the time. Just look at Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, Chelsea, Man City - whenever they buy amazing players in chunks they end up having to empty the trash can. Usually you have to make buys like this over a longer period and try to hold on the the ones that are golden. It might be that only 50% of our players we bought within a year will be staying.

5365~~~
I would say Hererra has made a "significant contribution" too, even if it's taken him until now to establish himself in our best XI.

5366~~~
From ESPN 

I liked "beautiful chaos" to describe what di Maria does at his best. For me, that's what United created under Fergie and what's been missing since he left.

5367~~~
Has done nothing to show he's worth even half of what he was bought for.

We got rid of Nani and bought another one for the British transfer record, only for the Nani we let go to have an immense season. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5368~~~
I like how every midfielder we buy suddenly turns into shit because "he needs constant movement" around him, starting from Kagawa, Mata to Di Maria. Then the strikers turn into shit because they do not have any service from midfield. This catch 22 shit is unbearable season after season.

5369~~~
<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

5370~~~
That may be so, but that Portugese competition mostly consists of clubs with lesser budgets than Championship clubs. Only the Lisboa and Porto clubs that are on a good to decent level.

5371~~~
It's an excuse to use for players playing shite. Lack of movement should not result in Di Maria deciding to misplace passes, lose his dribbling ability and become selfish instead of playing the ball to open players on the break, he's just a player who is either really disinterested or who was made to look a lot better than he was at Madrid, coming off the back of a purple patch season.

5372~~~
It is a huge reason why we've struggled to play good attacking football though for years now. Our forwards and midfielders combined don't have enough movement off the ball. Too many static players, or the wrong runs being made. Too slow to pass it around and not stretching teams and making space for a through pass. Though Di maria still has the quality to make it happen and does a few times every game, but of course every player relies on the whole team to do well to get the best out of them. It's a team sport after all. He's playing poorly individually, or inconsistently, and should be doing better, but it's not exactly an ideal system for creative players that we use.

5373~~~
Fair enough, but if you'd have watched Nani in the CL his best performances have come against the best teams. He was voted in the top 3 players in the CL group stages, behind Hazard and Messi. Nani has had a much better season so far than Di Maria, there's no question about that. Not to say that Nani is a better player than Di Maria, but he is undoubtedly having a better season.

5374~~~
Only Fabregas has more assists in the league. He's doing at least something. Plus the three goals.
2nd most assists. Falcao.

Weird that. But not so really. Those two aren't performing as well as they could but they do have talent and it takes so little for them to change the game like Falcao did last weekend. He didn't do anything before that penalty.

Have faith in Di Maria. This poor and has 9 assists.

5375~~~
That's the thing though, I don't know who to blame for that lack of cohesion other than the manager but this is the same manager that turned shit into strawberry smoothie at the world cup so has even he got worse after coming to Manchester?

Di Maria had plenty of movement around him yesterday like the wide open Ashley Young who made a great run and should have received a simple 6 year pass to score a goal, yet Di Maria misplaced it.

5376~~~
Assists and goals are such a touchy subject. Nani still to this day is up there with the most assists in the past decade or so in the PL, despite being piss poor for about 6 and a half of his 8 years here. Showing assists and goals aren't the be and say all. Fact of the matter is he's been much too poor for his fee. He was bought to control games and get us forward, not to serve up this shite.


That being said, I'm a huge ADM fan, I've got his jersey for this season and think he's a brilliant player, doesn't save him from criticism though, started off so well and is just getting worse with every game. Breaking the transfer record for a player should result in a world class player who can dominate games and be a team's talisman. He is just another Nani in the fact that he has immense talent and is unplayable when he's in the mood but he's too often just not in it.

5377~~~
Nani was a lot better than you give him credit for.

Assists suggest involvement in build up. Di Maria has very much been involved. He was key at the beginning of the season but now he isn't feeling it.

Personally, I think our attacking problems are down to the manager. He promised attacking football yet everything he says, and what players say about him, suggests that he limits that. He plays it safe and tries to hang on clean sheets despite never playing the same defenders. Way too much lack of emphasis on attack and when anyone says that someone loves to bring up the Leicester game like it's some kind of a barometer for United's performance this season.

How much rotation is there with City, Arsenal and Chelsea players? How many times do they change tactics? United lack tactical consistency and it shows in our play.

5378~~~
If you'd go back and look back at my old posts you'd realise I'm a huge Nani fanboi <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Although, doesn't change the fact that for all his talent he was far too often just not good enough, whether that's down to people's expectations of him or whatever, it wasn't enough, bar an immense 18 months with us. Being involved is fine, Welbeck was a player who also used to get involved a lot too. Is that honestly enough to justify breaking the British transfer record? Also good point, I agree with the static football LVG plays, but tactics should not result in a seemingly world class player no longer being able to pass a ball or to ruin counters and breaks with selfish play, or for him to no longer be as lethal a dribbler as he was. 

The best players can boss games and get struggling teams out of bad situations, that's what I and many others were expecting by signing arguably RM's most important player last season and a World XI player.

5379~~~
You can't underestimate the influence the team form or personal form has on your psyche not to mention moving to a new country and playing in a new league. Di Maria was also great at Benfica but wasn't great right away with Real.

He played 52 games for Real Madrid last season and then all of the WC until he got injured and missed the final. He played a lot. After the WC in 2010 he struggled for the first half of the season in La Liga too.

5380~~~
I don't agree with that in general, and in the case of Di Maria he wasn't RM's most important player, he was probably the 5th player in their team behind Xabi Alonso, Pepe, Ronaldo and Modric.

Modric and Xabi Alonso being the ones who bossed games, Di Maria was their impact player, his energy was a disturbance for the opponents but without the proper midfielders around him and without Ronaldo to score most the chances created and without Pepe to cover most defensive mistakes from his teammates, Di Maria would have been lambasted for all the stupid shots, stupid dribbles and stupid misplaced passes he continued to make.

5381~~~
Di Maria is definitely a big part of the blame, but it's not just him. Just as it was with Kagawa, we weren't set up in any way to get the most out of him, but he wasn't doing enough to get the best out of himself. With Di Maria though it's more inconsistency rather then not doing enough. He gets on the ball a lot, he works hard, it's just one game he picks out the right passes, gets past players, his flicks come off and then the next game they don't. He still makes plenty of chances, even on his off days, which is why he's still an important player to the team even when he isn't at his best, but we know he can do so much more as he was doing at the start of the season and since then only on occasion. 

To get consistent, world class performances out of your best attacking players though, you need a working, cohesive system that suits everyone. We are far away from that. It doesn't matter who you are, you will struggle for consistency and any type of form if you play like we have been. Put Silva, Sanchez, Aguero, Hazard, anyone in our team currently, and they wouldn't be amazing or consistent. Put Di Maria in Liverpool's side last season, Real Madrid, Chelsea, or Arsenal even, and he'd be a lot more consistent in showing his quality attacking wise. Every team who is good attacking wise has fast and skillful players who make runs off the ball for the creative players to pick them out. We have Young and Di maria, but that's about it. They're both creative players anyways, not the ones you want at the end of those passes.

5382~~~
We really should look to copy the Madrid side of last season going forward with pace and power on the counter.

A three man midfield of Blind/Carrick, Herrera and Di Maria, front three of Memphis, Rooney and Bale next season. Nani, Januzaj, Young, Wilson can all rotate in the front positions.

5383~~~
People keep mentioning his assists, but don't forget that two or three of them were just scuffed shots that luckily fell to our forwards. He could easily be a lot worse in that statistic.

5384~~~
True. 

He could easily be a lot better if our forwards weren't doing their best Sunday league impressions as well.

5385~~~
And he could easily be <b>a lot</b> better with it if Van Persie and Falcao didn't miss so many sitters. Would probably be sitting on 15 at least so far if either of them had anything close to their old finishing ability.

If he gets one more assist he'll have the best assist per minute rate in the history of the prem apparently for those with 10 or more (since they started counting them of course)

5386~~~
Yeah, fair point.

5387~~~
That being said, his best form for us when he looked like a real world beater was his first few games, his performances since have declined and seem to be getting worse, rather than better as you suggest. Disinterested? Buckling under pressure? Use whatever excuse you want, won't change the fact that his performances have been nothing like that of someone with such ability. Take Sanchez for example, Fabregas, Costa, all came in and are destroying the premier league for the same continent, we can't keep using that as an excuse for his bad performances. 

Di Maria's performance in the CL final shows what he's capable of and how much he could boss a game. He was the only player in that Madrid team who didn't look like a mug and who genuinely looked like he wanted to win. He was head and shoulders above every other RM player and was rightly so awarded the MOTM award. Also your point about the players he had around him I agree with, which is all the reason more why I find his transfer fee so ridiculous. Maybe it's just a case of great player, wrong team?

5388~~~
Of course the Leicester game is consistently brought up, it's an important example no matter how much you try to diminish it's relevance. We went to score goals with a defence that was unable to deal with the consequences and we paid the price. It's a mystery as to fans still wonder why we play this slow, possession, risk free style of football when the results are there to see. If we played the way we did that game all season, we'd have a lot more results similar to that one, we'd be losing games and contrary to popular belief, "playing exciting football" would not be a satisfactory consolation.

5389~~~
Firstly, both Modric and Ramos were better than Di Maria in the regular 90 minutes, even before the equaliser came. Arguably the whole 120 minutes (though obviously the run for Bale's goal was pretty standout for MOTM honours). Both were major players in that equaliser, without which Di Maria was going down in the same ship along with Ronaldo and Bale, getting a 7 out of 10 mark (if that) for a team that would have just failed to notch a goal in their biggest game in 12 years.

Don't mix Ronaldo being quiet, Bale missing a couple of chances and Khedira having no influence in Alonso's place, for the whole team not playing well (or at least competing and matching a really organised and focused team) or caring. It's stupidly insulting to Marcelo, Ramos, Varane, Carvajal, Modric and Isco at the very least.

Far too much of this downplaying of what every other Real Madrid player did last season in order to raise Di Maria's acclaim higher. Especially when Modric and Ronaldo both had better seasons and other players like Ramos, Pepe, Alonso, Bale and even Benzema, weren't exactly trailing by much. It would be like if United had an amazing run to the end of the season and won the FA Cup, PSG fans claiming Di Maria did it almost single-handedly and was the only one trying, just because Blind, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw, Rafael and Januzaj wouldn't get the same press coverage for their performances.

Interesting to note as far as chances created in the game. Ronaldo ended up with 3 (some in garbage time, as the American fans say), Di Maria and Isco (the latter subbed on only in the second half) 2 each and several other players chipped in solitary chances. Without that assist in stoppage time, the team's main expected source of creativity would have produced just a solitary chance in a 1-0 defeat to their bitterest rivals. A few flash dribbles wouldn't have got him off with the Real crowd, even though Bale and Ronaldo would have probably got hit worse.

Modric won the ball half a dozen times, 90% passing, created the most important goal of the match with a perfect cross and won as many free kicks in dangerous positions with his dribbling in tight areas as Di Maria did.

If we're going for accuracy of how the game played out. The Real defence were pretty solid and efficient all match, Modric was class in midfield and Di Maria outplayed Bale and Ronaldo a bit without creating much until the exquisite move in extra time. People would have forgotten the 2 or 3 nice bits of skill and dribbles he did in the regular 90 minutes pretty quick, if they'd have lost the game and not lead to anything, with him as uncreative as everyone else.

Watch Di Maria realising what type of player he is, without getting misty eyed about this top 5 player in the world single-handedly winning Champions League medals thing, and you won't be underwhelmed by the quality player you have this season. Essentially what he was for 90% of his time at Real Madrid (until those final 6 or 7 months of last season, when Real instantly decided to cash in for a guy like Rodriguez, who gives the ball away half as much and scores twice as often). Difficult to keep playing a guy who gives the ball away constantly in a midfield 3, though I'm sure Ancelotti would have happily kept trying it given the chance.

5390~~~
Amen.

Not to mention the fact that half the caf are wilfully ignoring the fact they spent most of Fergie's last season moaning about our slow paced "zombie passing". And now it was all "beautiful chaos" apparently.

5391~~~
You're arguing about something I agree with. Fact of the matter is Di Maria was voted MOTM in the final and was in my opinion the stand out player, if it wasn't for his incredible individual skill to put bale through they wouldn't have gone on to win, that's the jist of it. That's what we paid for, individual moments of brilliance to win games, regardless of how good or poor the rest of the team is playing. That's how you boss a game, by deciding it due to individual brilliance. Real Madrid as a team were underwhelming, including their giants Ronaldo and Bale. If it hadn't been for ADM they would not have gone on to win as mentioned earlier, regardless of what you think Modric or the others did, as an attacking minded player, he was the catalyst of that final, was all over the place and causing trouble all game, was playing as if he was possessed. Playing well enough in a Champions league final is not enough, defence might have played well, Modric was class I agree, but those moments are what make or break a team in the Champions League. Now obviously that's not what you'd expect every game, but for people to keep making excuses for his bad performances is where I don't agree. The weather and etc talk is bollocks, his best form was his first few games, instead of getting better and improving the synergy with the team he has gotten worse. Now that might be down to the manager or our game style or whatever, he isn't performing nearly well enough, not by a top 5 in the world standards as you claim, as he is at this moment far from that, I wouldn't go as far to say he's been the top 5 players in our team this season, let alone in the world. He's a great player who for whatever reason is not playing well enough. If we wanted and inconsistent, yet brilliant player we could have kept Nani and spent the 70m or whatever it was elsewhere.

5392~~~
People need to consider his fitness. Had a very long season with Madrid last season then Argentina went all the way to the end in the World Cup.

Poor bloke probably needs an extended break from it. Me thinks we will probably see a truer version of di Maria next season

5393~~~
Do you remember what the weather was like when he played those first few games?

Generally agree with your post but I think he can be cut a bit of slack because it's his first season here and it's to be expected that he would take a while to settle, get used to the different way the game is played/refereed and (yes) the weather.

5394~~~
Aye, that thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I remember the criticism well. It was at times, valid too. But yeah, the negativity is spiralling.

5395~~~
The way I see it, there's an awful lot of similarity between the post-Fergie era and numerous "transitional" seasons when Fergie was still in charge. And I would even call his last season, kind of transitional, despite winning the league. Key players (Rio, Vidic, Evra, Giggs, Scholes) were crumbling at the seams and the next generation didn't seem quite ready to take their place. Hence we had lots of not very good performances, very rarely played with any kind of swagger and this place was full of people listing all the stuff that Fergie was doing wrong in terms of team selection and tactics.

It's been a recurring theme over the years. In periods between Fergie's great teams you get an upsurge of fans who imply he's losing the plot by picking the wrong players, getting it all wrong in the transfer market, constantly chopping and changing and being tactically out-thought by all the best teams around. Then, lo and behold, a year or two later we're winning the league at a canter and beating the best teams in Europe. The dissenting voices at the time were - thankfully - in the minority as most sensible heads appreciated that it was impossible to transition from one great team to another without a few experiments, not all of which would come off. Ultimately, we all (well, most of us) were comfortable that Fergie knew best so wouldn't throw our toys out of the pram if we had to endure a season or two of frustration.

We're treading new ground since he left, though. Our security blanket is gone and even the most sensible and experienced fan is going to worry that the manager isn't up to the job if he can't turn things round in his first season in charge. A year or two in transition is not an option any more. It's a horrible state of affairs but we'll have to get used to it. It's the same shit most fans of most other clubs have been going through for as long as they can remember.

5396~~~
'beautiful chaos'

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Classic.

5397~~~
Whether anyone thinks it's an option or not, it's the way of the world. What we want won't change that. Might as well just accept that probably no one could have just carried a la Ferguson. No, not even Maureen or Ancelloti.

5398~~~
Yep, that's a ton of "perspective" right there and well put. Agree with every word there. That security blanket is the single biggest contributing factor, and the scary part for most of our fanbase (including myself) is that we will most probably never get another SAF, and he is all I have ever know at United - we'll have to go through these transitional periods with a "new manager" every so often and place our "trust" in him. As you mentioned, it was a given to place that trust in SAF, even through a difficult year or 2 because we knew that he had a plan and that he had the answers.

Yep, our generation (or well, at least mine - i don't want to give away your age there Pogue <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> ) of fans have truly been spoilt. Success to us is almost a right and not a privilege. Fortunately the club and all the success SAF brought it, has placed us in a very special position where we can have a few years of transition but still have the financial muscle to come back.

5399~~~
Ah the weather was a bollox in those games!

I know it's been a while since we've seen the damn thing but what is that strange, bright light on the pitch? Could it be... sunshine?

5401~~~
It sure can play a role, not just physical fatigue but psychologically too. He has more pressure at Utd to carry us than he did at Madrid when he was a support player.

5402~~~
The sun is always shining when Di Maria walks onto the OT pitch. How anyone can even moan about this guy is incredible. He's playing very average along with all our attacking players this season give or take the odd spark. This is no time to judge any of them IMO. The manager needs to get the right players in first for the set up his see's and then we can judge. If was just Di Maria then fine but its not. Likewise Falcao, RVP etc all class acts looking like Championship players. Its not their fault.

5403~~~
Au contraire. Is is their fault. With mitigating circumstances. I think RvP is just getting old. He's been in a steady decline now under two different managers. Falcao has to get over a sever injury and acclimatise to a new league. So he might come good. He might never get back to his best though. Sometimes a serious injury like that can finish a player. As we saw with Vidic. Di Maria's been discussed to death in this thread but I refuse to blame the manager for any player getting the basics of passing and decision-making as wrong as we've often seen from Di Maria this season. Of course, he's in the Falcao boat of adjusting to a new league. With the additional pressure of the price tag and expectation that comes with it.

5404~~~
“I’ve been happy ever since I arrived at Manchester United.

“Hopefully I can stay here for many years.”

Hopefully people will stop saying he wants to play for PSG

Glad LvG defended him today in his press conference and didn't make a big deal of his last performance!

5406~~~
Sánchez is hardly destroying the league. He won some games on his own and he's difficult to handle but teams are more on to him now and the winter period seems to have affected him like it usually does to new players.
Rooney in Costa's place, I'd expect similar numbers. I really would. He's just doing the job that a good forward is supposed to at a top club. Like RvP has done for us in the past, what Andy Cole did, Ruud and many others. He's a tough bastard and a pain in the ass but he isn't a magnificent player destroying the league. He's a very good player in the team that's walking through the league.

Di Maria's best performances haven't come out of a diamond or playing with 3 at the back and wing backs. You say he's poor yet his contributions is on par with a much better Real Madrid team from last year. He doesn't control his transfer value so it's pointless talking about it. The cost of a player is an upper management burden and has little to do with players or managers.

I don't know why you expect these performances from him. The manager is so inconsistent in his tactical and personnel choices and because of that its very hard for players to be consistent. Try showing up for work an every week on Monday morning your desk isn't in the same place. It's been moved. Or better yet, you have to start your workday by moving it before you move it and next week you don't know if it will happen again or not. You think your productivity or job performance wouldn't suffer?

5407~~~
It was the 2nd game that United played with a diamond. The previous game was QPR at home.

The back line consisted of Rojo-Blackett-Evans-Rafael. Rojo's and Evans' 2nd game of the season. Rafael's third. Blackett's first season and he isn't really good. Together they had played once before where they weren't even tested. Not only that but after 30 minutes a change had to be made because Evans got injured.

The goals were easily preventable. It's by no means a normal game to go by. Leicester also didn't start to play well before the conceded thrice. No matter how you play, if you're 3-1 up you shouldn't lose 5-3. Even if it were Cambridge beating Chelsea 3-1 with 30 minutes to go I would consider it extremely poor of them to lose a game like that.

5408~~~
Yet players you don't rate seem to be, if anything, improving on last season's performances (which were the exact opposite, in terms of consistency of tactics and approach) Players like Valencia, Young and Fellaini. Why do you think that might be?

5409~~~
I personally think that in Fellaini's case and Young's case that their performances are overrated. Valencia hasn't really improved. He's playing further back. It's a simple role for a simple man. He sticks to what he knows and he'll be fine. He's still the same in attack.

Young creates about one chance per game. His defensive stats are worse than Valencia's and his attacking stats are worse than Di Maria's. I think I've even explained it to you specifically in another post. Basically, Young looks dangerous up front but he really isn't effective. Definitely better as a wing back where there is less focus on you than as a winger. He sits deep, isn't close to the full back. Players like Rooney or Mata or Di Maria pass into the space left by the full back who's more concerned with the three forwards that are always playing. That makes for many instances of Young with the ball and a full back that's not in position to be properly prepared. Was it effective though? I don't think so. His passing and crossing has been more about passing into certain spaces in the box rather than finding players and it's a number game that he hasn't won many bets on.

Fellaini isn't playing any better for us than he did for Everton. He was a scapegoat and I think it affected him. No pressure on him now and the only way for him was up. Doesn't help when the manager employs tactic that basically revolve around his strengths.

I also think all three look better by comparison because of different expectations. If you view them from a neutral perspective with no expectations you would just think they do alright. Nothing more than that.

5410~~~
What does that even mean? I'm simply comparing their own performances this season and last. It's not about absolute level of performance, just meeting their own expectations as footballers. 

If constantly changing team selection and formations was as big an issue as you imply, chances are they would play worse this season and last. Both Fellaini and Young have played as a wingback and fullback, looking decent in both positions. Fellaini's played in at least three different positions. All three of them have played about as well as we could expect them to play. They certainly haven't performed far below expectations, which is what Di Maria is doing.

Obviously, he is adjusting to a new team/league. So that's a good excuse. I'm not buying the excuse that he should be uniquely forgiven for under-performing because of inconsistent team selections and formations. Especially when he's played, at most, two games in an unfamiliar position.

5411~~~
Are redcafe's stats correct? Because 10 assists in 23 appearances is quite a remarkable stat

5412~~~
Hes doing alright in terms of assists and chances created. Its his overrall game that has declined. Also he got the vast majority of his assists etc earlier in the season.

5413~~~
EDIT: Given the sitters certain strikers have missed too, he would have quite a few more assists, he'd likely be closer to Fab.

5414~~~
Two of those "assists" were scuffed shots too.

The thing is, he's clearly a bloody good player. So he's being held to higher standards than most other footballers. Which is a little harsh for someone in his debut season. It doesn't help that it's a season where Sanchez, Costa and Fabregas have all racked up amazing stats, mind you. In most other seasons there wouldn't be three such high profile debutants all having such a storming season.

5415~~~
You don't need to be a genius to understand why. LVG keeps changing his role from CM to LW and now RW. We've also got two of the laziest and most static strikers I've ever seen which is a bit of a problem since you can't afford having 2 players who produce no workrate for the team. FFS Falcao and RVP make Inzaghi look like Gattuso in his prime AND on steroids. Nearly everyone is struggling at the moment not just Di Maria.

5416~~~
Sanchez, Costa and Fabregas play with top clubs and have a well balanced + quality setup. Di Maria is playing with a team who ended 7th last season. Can we just stop comparing us with Chelsea? There's a massive gap between the two clubs whether we like it or we dont.

5417~~~
Well, Sanchez is the obvious comparison. Last time I checked we were a whole one point behind Arsenal in the league. Hardly a "massive gap".

5418~~~
Sanchez was always a regular scorer something di maria isnt. Also arsenal with its limits has a balanced and well settled side with most of the players capable of playing 3-4 games without falling into pieces

5419~~~
Sanchez hasn't exactly been that great laterly anyway. However hes been better than Di Maria, hes more of a goal scorer though tbh.
Di Maria despite not having a great season is still the second top assister in the league isn't he?

5420~~~
Di Maria will be fine. He's clearly a world class player, and the fact that he has a good assists tally tells you that he's doing something right. The whole team needs to continue to be improved / changed to van Gaal's liking, then we will see the best out of Di Maria. Let's be honest, going from playing with Modric, Alonso, and Khedira to Blind, Herrera, and Fellaini in midfield is a bit of a step down (though Blind and Herrera are good players and perfectly fit the team). 

I know it's beaten like a dead horse in here, but balance in midfield really does matter and can affect how a creative player like Di Maria performs. Buying a proper box-to-box midfielder will really help Di Maria be unshackled and begin to revert back to his Real Madrid form.

5421~~~
It means looking at it without objectivity and pre-considered notions.

It's not really science Pogue. You know, a team can be playing really well and still lose because 1 player messed up or a team can lose and a player can play well. There are many different reasons for it. I'm pinpointing the tactics and personnel change as they are one of the least consistent aspects of the game. Not just within the season itself but also by looking at previous seasons. These are new tactics for the most part.

Just have a look for yourself. How many players are playing worse, how many are doing better, how many are performing about the same. Personally, I feel a lot more players are not playing as well.

You can compare him with Sánchez but the difference it that Arsenal have used the same tactics the whole season, tactics that Sánchez is used to. He's played with freedom to do what he does best in his favored position. None of this applies to Di Maria. He had never played as a midfielder in diamond before. Also, when he played in midfield he had, get this, midfielders playing with him. Shocking right. Playing with people in their best positions is the way to go.

No, I blame the manager for most it and I do it because of what he has said compared to what he has done. He said he plays entertaining football. He hasn't done that. He said he doesn't shoehorn players in the side but rather builds a formation around what he's got. Hasn't done that. He says he usually starts slow. Has done that. Great. Of all the things he has said, only his faults have come true. Also, from what I can gather from his interviews and player interviews, is that he kind of stifles creativity. The way the players play certainly doesn't disprove that.
He also said one thing, which I agree with, that players usually start of slow when they are new to a team or a league. That's definitely true. For every Sánchez and Costa there's an Evra and Drogba and more.

If he's below your expectations then that's your own fault.

5422~~~
Heh. That last line is a classic. Precisely what sort of expectations should I have for the most expensive footballer in the history of top flight English football?

5423~~~
Although he usually talks shit, Phil Neville tweeted some sense about ADM. He said when he gets the ball he is always trying to be positive with it.
I kind of agree with him on that. His end product has been pretty shocking really but I don't recall him going sideways or backwards just forward. He's not afraid to run at players and attack the space when he's without the ball.
I can't wait for him to get in his groove because he is getting the space, he is attempting runs and always gives an option. His distribution and shooting will come with confidence.

5424~~~
I'm not disputing it was a freak result, and I'm not saying that we'd concede 5 goals every game either if we went out and played it. But the evidence is there; we have a leaky defence and concede one goal pretty much every game we play, and that's when we're playing as safe as possible. With the way our strikers are performing anyway, would you trust them to get the goals we need to win games if we committed to attacking football? I know I wouldn't.

5425~~~
Done well so far. Though this is the type of performance that if he's on form, people will say its a good game, but off form and the moaners will moan. Hes given it away a few times but he's created a few chances as well and dribbled past his defender plenty of times, looks dangerous which is important

5426~~~
He's been lively and certainly better than he's recent lethargic performances. Still lacking in his end product and his decision making could be better.

5427~~~
He had a woeful start to the game, but he's managed to pick it up in the past 15 minutes or so and has put in some decent crosses while looking a bit more lively.

5428~~~
I swear to god he wants to make everything into the hardest thing in the world... like that pass to Rooney, it's a simple 5 yard pass, with either foot, yet he has to hit it with the outside of his left foot... why?! It's not necessary in that situation at all, so why show-off? Again, it's like he needs to prove he's World Class with every single thing he does.

5429~~~
He's been poor again.

5430~~~
All their counters have come by him losing the ball.

5431~~~
Come on angel ffs

5432~~~
Yeah, he loses the ball far too often.

5433~~~
Confidence isn't low, it's in the negative levels.

5434~~~
He's absolute garbage. Shockingly bad. I don't know what he has to do to get dropped. Not cost £60million, I suppose.

5435~~~
Yeah, I think he's been really poor actually. Given the ball away so many times.

Something isn't right with him.

5436~~~
He badly needs to strap on a pair and start taking some responsibility.

5437~~~
he looks utter muck atm.

5438~~~
You always defend Di Maria <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5439~~~
can we move him to the side of the field he's best on please? Put Young on the right, he is right footed, so it's not an outrageous idea!

5440~~~
Needs a goal.

5441~~~
Woeful.

5442~~~
He's trying too hard I think. He thinks he's god's gift.

5443~~~
He's only had about three good games for us.

5444~~~
On the bench? He should be subbed again.

5445~~~
WhoScored has him down as the worst player in the team and the third worst player on the pitch which sounds about right to me.

5446~~~
No wonder LvG don't play him in the middle anymore, it's lethal when he gives away the ball!

5447~~~
I actually think he looks quite threatening at times. But at other extremely wasteful

I certainly do not think we should take him off.

Him and Valencia have linked up well

5448~~~
I feel like I'm watching a golfer with the yips - he looks like he has forgotten how to play.

Curious to see what his passing stats were in the first half...and will make to bold prediction that he comes off at halftime again.

Update:  67% which is worse than last game.  LVG is ruining him.

5449~~~
Looks like a player completely shot of confidence unfortunately. Incapable of picking a safe pass most of the time, which could really have caused us some problems if Newcastle were more clinical on the counter.

5450~~~
Angel you have received the ball, do you:

a) Cut inside but get pressured and try to play a pass to the edge of the box but it gets cut out easily?
b) Attempt a ridiculously deep cross that will most likely evade everyone or be easily cleared?

5451~~~
Can't really help but gift the ball away in midfield.

5452~~~
I'm not sure this is the problem though. I mean, it's not as if he's never <i>attempting </i>to do anything - he often does, which is why he's often giving the ball away. The problem is accuracy and consistency, since in regards to the latter I thought he had a decent spell around the middle of the half.

5453~~~
It seems that the opposition has sussed Van Gaal's philosophy 'sit in, wait for Di Maria to lose the ball and counter.

5454~~~
He's hit and miss, but he's one of those players. 

Anyone expecting 90%+ passing stats is always going to be disappointed. 

That said, he can definitely do better than he is.

5455~~~
Angel: "Si."

5456~~~
What has happened to his crossing ? Is it a Man Utd curse that any winger who had a decent crossing technique will see it turn into crap ?

5457~~~
Its not Di Maria, he's just a symptom of our overall lack of communication in the final 3rd.

5458~~~
Nothing has come off for Di Maria so far tonight. Not sure how long Louis Van Gaal will let it go on for, especially after subbing him at half time last Saturday. Sad to see. I can still remember his performances at the start of the season. Looked unbeatable. Really lost himself since the start of 2015.

5459~~~
Meh. He's been sloppy in possession as he often is (and that's what whoscored uses as a huge part of their rating I think) but it's a far cry from the people on here saying he's been awful. He's still looked dangerous and linked up well with Valencia. He'll only get out of his slump by playing and he's worth sticking through. Hasn't been awful, hasn't been great as well, but certainly a lot better then the game on the weekend.

5460~~~
He's a great player when he's got space ahead of him but in tight situations and build up that requires patience he's useless. That's why he looked so good a lot of the time for Madrid, they played on the counter with speed.

5461~~~
Oh and it might just be me but it seems odd to put him on the right.

5462~~~
He's crossing it to nobody ultimately. Nobody challenges for anything in the box unless they are completely free, not to mention we hardly commit bodies into the box.

5463~~~
Not currently he doesn't.

5464~~~
Him and Valencia put a few dangerous attacks together down that right towards the end. However he's given possession away cheaply at least an equal number of times.

5465~~~
When he has the ball he generally looks forward. I don't think he has enough tonight though. He should be getting the ball and running at his full back all night. He looks scared of any semi physical tackle though. He's so easily pushed off the ball.

5466~~~
Every dangerous attack this game has had him involved. People are fickle.

5467~~~
Inverted wingers are really popular these days and can be very effective, especially with quality overlapping fullbacks. Problem is that ADM doesn't really seem comfortable there, and the fullback in question is Tony V.

5468~~~
Well when everyone else on here is so quick to jump on his back, of course I'll be more positive to try and balance things out... He's trying to do things, linked well with valencia, gone past the fullback. He needs to cut out the sloppy passes for sure but it's a much better performance then on the weekend. Trying to look at the positives instead of the negatives.

5469~~~
Teams just sit in against us in nearly every game and wait for us to lose the ball. Di Maria needs space and a stretched game. It just isn't happening under Van Gaal.

5470~~~
He seems to be going for more crosses tonight, and to be fair he's had a couple where he was unlucky not to pull them off. But yeah, he definitely needs to offer a lot more when it comes to his dribbling.

5471~~~
Very hit and miss.

5472~~~
What the heck have you been watching? He's broken down almost every convincing move with a shitty half arsed final ball. You knew it would be another shite bank of a performance from him when 45 seconds in, he's basically clear on goal and manages to completely feck it up.

5473~~~
This Van Gaals fault period. He should be playing left side part of a midfield three while herrera should be playing on the right. Januzaj should be there in place of Fellaini playing on the right. Ridiculous tactics.

5474~~~
And that's when everyone made their mind up about how he was going to play and ignored him actually doing good things too. People love to whinge.

5475~~~
While I largely agree that he's been played out of position so far, some of his play has just been poor from whatever perspective you look at it. Yeah, a lot of us would like him in the midfield three position, but it's not as if he's being played at centre back. He should still be offering a lot more than what he sometimes is from a wide position - and this is from someone who wants to see him in the position you've said. LVG can only take so much of the blame.

5476~~~
Yeah but were more of them ours or Newcastles? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5477~~~
Don't think he's been nearly as awful as some are suggesting tbf. Our inability to score after dominating that half was always bound to get peoples backs up. He's not been great, but people are overreacting out of frustration IMO.

5478~~~
Basically getting the Nani treatment on here now, although he's been gash he still looks like he would create more than anybody else in the side.

5479~~~
He's not a right winger. Move him to the left or centrally.

5480~~~
This. Yes he's given the ball away and been sloppy, but he's done good things too. Been a mixed bag, not awful, not great, but people love to focus on the negatives and ignore the positives when somebody is off form.

5481~~~
Right side clearly our best outlet. He's not incidental in this fact.

5482~~~
Yes he hasnt been perfect but he needs more movement around him and quicker ball movement. If hes played in the same position with the same tactics it would be easier to improve rather than being switched around all the time.

5483~~~
Im sorry, but I think he's been worse today than on Saturday.

5484~~~
He messed up basically all of our best chances to score and gave the ball away a shitload. Being somewhat dangerous doesn't really make up for that, IMO. I agree with caisenma, I think he's been worse.

5485~~~
Terrible...

5486~~~
Can we get £40 million for him now?

5487~~~
Why not switch wings with young? It's obvious he's far from comfortable on the right.

5488~~~
Great ball then, should have been an assist.

5489~~~
Just swap him for Marquinhos and Rabiot. <span style="color: #ffffff">WUM</span>

5490~~~
That didn't look like the reaction to being subbed of a player who's not arsed and doesn't want to be here.

5491~~~
Played poor but still created our best chances, he's class and I hope he regains form soon.

5492~~~
I think taking him off was a mistake to be honest, he'd just made a few top class passes and is probably the most likely to create something.

5493~~~
Have no idea why he was subbed off instead of Young and Fellaini, started playing well second half

5494~~~
Not happy about him getting subbed off, he looked more likely to make something happen than any of our other attackers.

5495~~~
I don't understand the stick he gets. He is the only way who creates for us. He is the only one who dribbles past players and provides penetration. Stupid to keep subbing him.

5496~~~
Shite decision to sub him

5497~~~
One of the worst substitutions I can recall.

5498~~~
Way too harsh from LVG, he needs trust and confidence.

5499~~~
We've been much worse going forward since he came off.

5500~~~
Attacking play gone to shit since he got subbed. Even when he's sloppy, his pace dribbling and creativity are a big asset. Shouldn't have been subbed.

5501~~~
Would do well to get 40 quid.

5502~~~
Creates two goal chances in few minutes and gets taken off few minutes after. And this kind of stuff isn't even surprising anymore from van Gaal, it's actually very sad that manager with such experience makes some ridiculous mistakes.

5503~~~
It's quite tough to watch this

5504~~~
He is an odd man is LvG. End product was really the only thing lacking, but at least we had fluidity and urgency. Right to bring on Januzaj, wrong to take AdM off.

5505~~~
This. He's our only player that plays with any drive, everyone else is too happy to pass responsibility to a teammate.

5506~~~
64% passing; almost as bad as it looked.

James Rodriguez averages 87%, has a finish on him and makes nearly as many chances.

5507~~~
Those sound like the symptoms of Kagawa Syndrome to me? I did not realize it was so contagious.

5508~~~
He'd just created the two clearest chances of the whole night with exactly the kind of passes that often get cut out. He's been pretty poor on balance, but wingers always get the most stick when games are frustrating because their risk to reward ratio is so erratic. Nani, Young, Valencia etc. Even Giggs before his indian summer shift centrally.

He's definitely been dissapointing of late, but his "troubles" are being exagerated because it's so en vogue.

5509~~~
Had tonnes of movement around him. Just needed to hit it with good final ball.

Newcastle's defence left acres of space for him about 6 or 7 times and he played two good passes.

5510~~~
Exactly, and we've produced the square root of feck all since he went off.

5511~~~
This. He was making chances and looked dangerous throughout. These days, I don't care how the rest of your game is, if we look like we're capable of scoring then he should always be on the pitch. fecking awful substitution.

5512~~~
Yup. In fact our game's regressed.

5513~~~
People want to sell him or trade him for other players now? If he was the only top player struggling, it'd be somewhat understandable, but who, outside of de Gea, has really been consistently good this season?

5514~~~
Shouldn't really have gone off and his confidence is probably completely shot at this point. Not great when we have Arsenal this weekend where his pace on the counter will be greatly needed and LVG doesn't seem like the greatest man motivator.

5515~~~
Blind & Rojo

5516~~~
Don't think he should have gone off. He's the only who really tries to create chances.

Though at the time I thought it would make sense what with Januzaj impressing against Sunderland, but Adnan looked woeful today.

5517~~~
I'd argue Blind's generally always looked competent when he's played, although he's obviously not featured all the time and hasn't always been brilliant as such. I get your point though.

5518~~~
At least he was better than Januzaj.

5519~~~
Played well in the second half and some of his ambitious passes started to come off for him, creating good chances. Should have stayed on at that point.

5520~~~
People can shove passing success rates up their ass. Without him in the side we genuinely don't look like creating anything. He might lose possession sometimes, but he takes risks no one else does.

Isn't he second top in the assists chart yet constantly slated? He should never of been subbed today.

5521~~~
Are you here just to act the dick? Could've finished the game with FOUR assists, at the hour mark. That isn't finding a final ball? You're hopeless.

5522~~~
Blind has been pretty hit and miss in the last few weeks IMO

5523~~~
I thought he played well. No idea why he was subbed off

5524~~~
He put 2 balls on a plate for our players to score, what more can you ask?. Yes he misses passes and sometimes messes up dribbles, but long story short if Fellaini could finish and the linesman didn't mess up we would have been 2-0 up with 2 di Maria assists. 

I was quite surprised to be honest as he made things happen.

5525~~~
I wasn't counting the pass to Rooney as a quality pass, given it forced Rooney to pirouette rather than infront of him for the easy finish. Honestly if Shaun Wright-Phillips played that pass in an England shirt you'd be demanding he was substituted, not adding it onto his key passes total to quote after the match.

5526~~~
The struggle was real tonight. Good energy but general play was short of standard. Thought he found it tough on the right tonight and would have been better on the left hand side.

He's lucky Januzaj wasn't very good, barring one inside pass to Rooney, when he came on this time around.

5527~~~
Why not take him off at half time, if you're going to take him off when he actually looks better, created the sitter for Fellaini/Young and the through ball for Rooney where he was arguably onside. A minute later he leaves Taylor in the dust and actually scuffed the cross but that was at least an opportunity. Newcastle knew his threat, always had Ameobi doubling on him, that created chances for Valencia. Taking him off almost cost us the game. It's amazing most of you aren't enjoying van Gaal's reign, you hate anyone who tries the what isn't the easiest, safest option in a position. Nani was booed at OT, Di Maria will probably be booed in a few games.

5528~~~
Di Maria was improved if not particularly brilliant. Noticeable that all our attacks were going through him though.

5529~~~
Lost the ball about a million times, and still could of had about 4 assists.

Thats Di Maria, on a bad night, in a nutshell.

5530~~~
Should play every game, creates the most of any player in the team (and would do in most teams with high possession stats) and was well worth signing (even if overpriced), but 2 quality passes from all those great positions he got put in wasn't that great. It wasn't terrible either. 6 out of 10 maybe.

5531~~~
Yeah so how about the other 3, no comment on those?

5532~~~
Should have stayed on. He just needs to be a bit more lucky (or better) with his final ball. The rest of his game was great, good link up play with Valencia, injected pace and urgency and was always available

5533~~~
All the evidence points that way.

5534~~~
I was surprised he got subbed when I thought he was better than Young all Game

5535~~~
Not sure bringing him off was a good call, he's a bit like Nani in needing an arm around the shoulder as opposed to a boot in the arse.

5536~~~
Let's not drop our standards here, he was dire. He can't afford to just continuously give the opposition the ball like that, its gonna hurt us against the better counter attacking teams. Try him on the left please.

5537~~~
We'd have 80% possession if he didn't keep giving it away.

Though he did at least make a few things happen tonight e.g. setting up Fellaini with a great ball that should've been buried.

Could understand his frustration at being taken off, but Januzaj deserved minutes based on the weekend.

We're just going to have to persist with him until he regains form. Too big an investment. And he has undoubted quality.

5538~~~
Wouldn't have scored the goal with his right foot though

5539~~~
True but I obviously didn't know that at the time

5540~~~
I actually said he played two great passes on the previous page. The point was he had the ball in space with clear passing lanes and great movement in behind from team-mates about 7 or 8 times and only really found the mark twice how he'd want to.

They were class when they worked, but I can guarantee Suarez or Rodriguez or someone would have got stick on the La Liga thread for needing that many good positions to start finding team-mates in the box.

5541~~~
Has there been anything positive about Di Maria this season?

5542~~~
What a weird performance, giving the ball in idiotic situations, fecking up counters yet creating some very good chances, can't really say I'm angry with him as I was the last match but still looks off the boil.

5543~~~
fair enough

5544~~~
I found it weird that he went off when he did. He was making things happen and our only creative player and his replacement was pretty useless. He really needs to cut out the careless passing though. It's going to cost us a goal!

5545~~~
Thats why he's a much much better midfielder then he is a winger.

5546~~~
He was poor. I'm sorry but he was. We just have to wait for him to settle down. He wasn't happy coming off but he needs to relax and use his experience to improve his final ball. I've seen other players get much worse stick for such performances. He'll coming good but right now he's getting more things wrong then right.

5547~~~
He does have the frustrating tendency to lose the ball which leads directly to the opponents getting a counter attack.

5548~~~
Thought that he started to look more dangerous once Newcastle became more adventurous and he had some space, of course that was right when Van Gaal took him off.

5549~~~
Do you suffer from Alzheimers?

5550~~~
Care to details these easy opportunities he missed? Or are you just going to spout random bullshit?

5551~~~
Strange game, was poor overall but at the same time made some good chances for the team if only we could learn to put them away.

5552~~~
No i don't .

5553~~~
As the team gains confidence, I believe his performances will improve.

He also needs a consistent position on the pitch. He's not dealing with the pressure and responsibility very well.

5554~~~
I didn't appreciate how one-footed he is. Him and Valencia just cannot play on the same wing because the defender already knows what they are going to do every time.

5555~~~
When you're off form, you don't change your style of play. Di Maria is the type of player who will always try and do something productive whenever he gets the ball. He won't look for an easy pass or the easy option, he wants to be effective and take risks. 

Unfortunately that means when he is off form the majority of things he does won't work. But the few great moments and passes show what he would do more consistently if he was off form. 

I'm as frustrated with him as the next guy but I would rather he continued to play with the ambition of always doing something productive and special than go into a shell and play the simple passes. Why? Because when he's on form I would want him to play that way, not be a Di Maria who loses his flair and wow factor.

5556~~~
Right, why does he seemingly want to make everything a million times harder then it has to be? He uses the outside of his foot, when a simple pass with the inside will do... he takes the ball inside and attempts to take on three men, when going outside and taking on one will do. He often picks the harder option, when there is a much easier and just as progressive/threatening pass on. Every pass, every single pass HAS to be played as close to the defender as possible - which is why half of them get intercepted... it's really feckin' frustrating.

Some stuff come off tonight, some stuff didn't... but my god, it's like he's trying to make everyone aware that he's a World Class player. It's meant to be effortless for him - and it looked effortless at the beginning of the season, and when he was at Real... but now, it's like he's trying to prove his worth or - as I said earlier in this thread - he believes his hype.

Football can be simple Angel... try it.

5557~~~
He looked excellent in his first few games, to be fair to him.

5558~~~
When hes on the pitch, basically the team gives him the ball and waits for him to do something...

5559~~~
Quite a bit in his first 10 games.

5560~~~
I'm not disputing that - if anything, he probably sort of feels that weight of expectation himself - and so is trying to do absolutely everything, all the time.

5561~~~
QPR,Leicester,West Ham...thats about it

5562~~~
Read some of the comments on the thread. It's blinkered to try and force the opinion Di Maria put in a fantastic performance just because of 2 nice passes and that one hit behind Rooney after the Coloccini gift.

Don't act like I'm anti-United when I wanted you to win and praise your players when they're producing what they're capable of. Just gave a perfectly reasonable opinion on the way Di Maria played.

5563~~~
Right now his offensive contribution doesn’t cover for his mistakes which lead to opposition attacks. He put in two good balls (not sure about the offside) but other than that he makes an awful lot of bad decisions. Huge risk to play him in midfield in that form, he might be a huge problem for van Gaal in the coming weeks.

5564~~~
Thats not entirely true, people over-exaggerate his first few games, go back to our fixture list and you will see... first 10 games?

5565~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wow.
The first few months of the season? Leading our team in assists? If you want recently, then the Preston game he was arguably our best player, same with Burnley, and then a few others. Sure, you can focus on the negatives, and ignore all the positives, but there are plenty to back him up. Even today, sure, he was sloppy on the ball and gave it away too often. He also made more chances then anyone else for us, had a few lovely passes like the one for Rooney right before he came off which should have stood. 

The moment he came off is the moment we stopped creating anything. That should say it all about how important he is. Even when he's off form he's still our most creative player and our main hope to actually create something.

5566~~~
People need to accept that Di Maria the winger is frustrating. Always has been, probably always will be.

5567~~~
Is it sunny these days in Manchester?

5568~~~
Yep, this is true. He offered some positives today, but he really needs to be offering many, more more to make up for the flaws in his game.

5569~~~
We were dire when he went off. He is clearly a hit and miss player - I don't care if he misses a few passes as long as he's positive. Had Rooney been better today, he would have had one assist and would have been involved in the other goal as well.

5570~~~
He looked like he was going to cry when being subbed.

Some great passes/crosses, but a lot of frustration too with him today. Will be better next game. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

5571~~~
I think the expectation of him has been so over stated that he can't win to be honest. He's not a Messi, not a Ronaldo. He's a guy who's had what...maybe one great season, and when he signed he was seen as this messiah to our problems. I'm a bit pissed off with him because I had expectations of him delivering more than he is at the moment..because what he is delivering is pretty average apart from the odd few moments. However, I reckon, if he wants to stay in Manchester, which let's face it, after his experience here, one wouldn't be surprised if he wanted to be off, he is one of those players who will acclimatise more slowly than some other foreign players. I'm hoping he doesn't turn into an Ozil..where sporadic moments of greatness are separated by long periods of mediocrity in relevance to how much he costs...

5572~~~
Yeah.
Burnley - played very well, came off injured after about 60 mins
QPR - Goal and assist and played well
Leist - Goal and assist and played well mostly
West Ham- Played very well
Everton - Goal and assist and played well
WestBrom - didn't have a great game but got an assist
Chelsea - Did ok in parts but nothing special
Palace - Cant remember much, don't think he had a great game but got an assist for the winner
Arsenal - Setup the goal on the break (I didn't watch this game so cant comment on his perf)
Hull - He got injured early in the game

EDIT: Thats quite a bit of positive for the first 10 games.

5573~~~
Thought he was subbed at the wrong time, just as things were looking to open up for him, He still needs to do more.

In fact, next game id have him as a sub then bring him on second half to use his pace to give him some confidence back.

5574~~~
If these are the only positives you can mention from a player who is supposedly the best in the team and World Class, if this has been a good season for him then we might as well settle for 7th again(with our current form we are headed there anyways). Not downplaying his impact or anything but he wasn't signed to be just another good player in an "Ok" team, he is supposed to be the main man and yet we console ourselves with things like "he had a few lovely passes" and "he is leading the team in assists", this is Angel Di Maria ffs.

5575~~~
He didn't play very well
West Brom was the tipping point
He was had a few glimpses against Arsenal, but overall he was really frustrating and he missed a golden opportunity.

He first 10 games weren't anything special, but people reference those games like he was extraordinary or something

5576~~~
He was our standout player vs Burnley. Should have had two assits but RVP and Mata both missed sitters ^^

5577~~~
Yes, he hasn't been at his best, you don't need to be a genius to figure that out. He has been far from shite. You said has there been anything postive about him this season at all, and there has been loads. A decent amount of poor performances too, but far more good ones. He's out of form at the moment, happens to everyone. It's a lot harder to get out of a slump when the team is so disjointed as a whole. The fans being incredibly negative and on his back about every little thing that doesn't come off doesn't help. At least he still fecking tries. At least he doesn't go hiding like so many do when things aren't working out. Even off form, he's still our most dangerous player. The only way he'll get back to his best is for us to settle down as a team and him to adapt more to the league and keep playing, he'll get past the bad form.

5578~~~
Guess people see what they want to see. Or at least, everyone saw one thing and you saw something else.

5579~~~
Nah I simply replied to you, where you said has there been anything positive...

5580~~~
di Maria was quite sloppy today. He lost the ball a bit too easily at times, and his touches, at times, were quite sloppy. His passing was also inconsistent and sloppy.

However, given that he was sloppy, he was still our most threatening player. His crossing may have been inconsistent, but he was at the forefront of several of our best chances. If we got a goal in the first half, many wouldn't have criticised him like they have been now.

I was quite surprised when he went off for Januzaj. Young wasn't doing much on the left side. In fact, he created barely any chances and didn't make it difficult for Newcastle for much of the match. I was perplexed at seeing di Maria go off when he was starting to improve in the second half and become a bigger threat. Without anyone in the middle to create chances for us, di Maria was vital as he was creating chances from out wide and through the middle.

5581~~~
far more good ones? fecking christ, like who? Fabregas,Sanchez and Costa(all from La Liga) have all gone through rough patches this season and they haven't been as bad as Di Maria - he isn't our most dangerous player (people need to stop saying this) Ashley Young has been more dangerous than Di Maria this season.

Its one thing to support the players during rough patches and i am all for that but Di Maria isn't just any other player, he is the teams record signing, i remember when Rooney got his massive new deal .... every single time he had an average performance, fans called for his head, if this was Rooney he wouldn't get this much support if we are being honest.

5582~~~
I <b>asked</b> for positives and you spoke about his first 10 games, which as i just analysed weren't that great

5583~~~
He was getting better before he got subbed. Not sure I would start him next game.

5584~~~
Safe to say he had a very poor game today, dont really understand where people are getting the positives from. The only way people can pick up good points from his games at the moment is by micro analysing every single thing he does and picking out ANYTHING that went right for him. 

Saying that though i want him to keep playing out wide as on the break given space he is class, and width is something we have definitely been missing.

5585~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No he hasn't. Not sure what you have been watching as fair enough Di Maria has been disappointing but there's no need to exaggerate to make your point.

As for the Rooney comparison, it's Di Maria's first season with the club in a new league which does provide him a bit more leeway than our captain who has played here for over a decade.

5586~~~
Just not good enough. Even if there were one or two moments of class you can't tolerate someone who fecking constantly wastes posession and ruins good situations just because you'll get two or three classy deliveries in 90 minutes. It wasn't enough to save Nani's career here and it's not good enough from Di Maria. 

He's supposed to be one of the best players in the league. You don't see Silva, Fabregas, Sanchez or Hazard being so relentlessy bloody wasteful and then get plaudits because they happen to play a handful of quality balls into the box.

5587~~~
You say that like he hasn't been frustrating in central midfield this season. He has been. Very fecking frustrating.

5588~~~
There has to be language issues with him and the players who doesn't speak Spanish.. The movements and passes just seem odd when say, Rooney or Fellaini or Blind is the closest to him.. Plays with Herrera much better..

5589~~~
He started brightly and showed glimpses of what he can do, then he went into himself again and his play became indecisive, typical of a player low on confidence.

5590~~~
Oh don't get me wrong, he's frustrated in the middle too, just less frustrating and more consistent. His game just suits being in the middle more. The space, the freedom. It makes him less predictable and allows his to try his through balls. Very much like Giggs in his latter midfield days. 

The Madrid fans all warned us in the Summer, he's not a world class winger. He can be brilliant there on his day, but he'll frustrate the life out of fans on the way, which is basically what he's doing. He's so one footed that he's far too predictable on the wing.

5591~~~
More space and freedom in central midfield?! You have to be kidding.

5592~~~
He was awful against West Ham. Really awful.

5593~~~
Get the feeling he'll do much better when (if?) we start playing with a bit more freedom and fluidity. A full back other than Shaw on the left would help him i think, he exchanged well with Valencia a few times tonight.

5594~~~
Not at all. Di Maria thrives with space ahead of him, driving from his own half towards the penalty area, twisting and turning on his way there. On the wing he's up against a full back who knows that, 99% of the time, he's going to cut in on his left foot. He's not restricted like that in the middle. 

But obviously that relies on a certain style of football. The possession based, slow the tempo, kind of style that LVG seems to favour doesn't really match up well with Di Maria's game in all honesty. In hindsight, it was a strange signing.

5595~~~
My main issue with him is that he refuses to run at people at the minute (maybe he would be more inclined to do so on the left.  As frustrating as Adnan also is he at least attempts to put his full back under pressure.

Otherwise Di Maria was the only one who looked like opening them up today and we looked a lot worse going forward when he went off.

5596~~~
Like Nani, you can see his quality but only in very short bursts. The majority of his game is full of frustrating judgement and passing errors.

5597~~~
He was better today, I thought. I think he should understand that LvG has faith in him and will keep giving him chances.

5598~~~
He actually has, Ashley Young is a contender for player of the season, can't say the same about Di Maria. I'm not sure you have been watching the games, i don't even think the word "dangerous" and Di Maria should be in the same sentence as far as this season is concerned.

Costa,Sanchez and Herrera are all facing the same struggles - new club,league,country,language etc and they are all from La Liga... so why should i give a £60 million man leeway even after he specifically asked for the #7 shirt? he was briefed about his role in the team before hand so i don't see what the big deal is.

seems like everybody uses the laughing emoticon to reply to peoples comments now, to make them seem like"experts", and end up not saying anything useful...oh well.

5599~~~
He looks like he plays with fear of LVG now, tbh...

5600~~~
Tbf, for all this 'Young has been so much better' 'Young could be POTY' he's only managed 2 assists and 1 goal (might be 2 with tonights) compared to Di Maria's 10 assists and 4 goals. 

Di Maria is being held to far higher standards (which is only natural given his fee and reputation) but Di Maria has made a far more valuable contribution to the team this season then Young has, despite the latters good performances.

5601~~~
Young's been playing mainly as a wingback/fullback so you can't compare their productivity.

5602~~~
This.

5603~~~
Comparing a Wing/full back to a winger ?

5604~~~
Young's a distance better defensively and a little in possession, but I agree Di Maria's outplayed him all in all (just not to the extent you'd want in a perfect world, with a £60m player).

Thought he was poor today but still wouldn't for a moment want him dropped if I was a United fan. Need his creativity more than neat passing and he provides it in spades, for all the wasteful passes. Cat among the pigeons and it pays off enough to be well worth his place and one of the first names picked.

5605~~~
He was poor again. We do like too much analysis, "taken off at the wrong time" and stuff like that. Him giving away the ball and being careless almost led to a Newcastle goal, twice. That's poor.

5606~~~
As long as we've got experts like you around to correct us all and supply us useful information, we'll be fine then...

5607~~~
It was getting to the point where it seemed like a genuine 50/50 proposition as to whether he could complete a simple pass. Just not good enough for a player of his calibre. I think he needs more time (and hopefully will get it,) but it's extremely generous to say that he's been anything other than a major disappointment so far.

5608~~~
Still expect him to destroy Arsenal though

5609~~~
Good post. As poor as Di Maria has been in recent weeks, the notion that Young has performed better this season is simply silly. Young has improved relative to his previous form and ability, but Di Maria has clearly performed better and contributed a great deal more to the side. It's a non-starter.

5610~~~
Funny you mention Ozil, who has been great since his return (bar Monaco, where everyone was crap). He bulked up, looks fitter and is putting in a shift. He covers the most ground in our team (having said that Ramsey has been out).

Maybe after two long seasons with no break, including a season acclimatising to a new league, he will need a break (like Ozil - though his was through injury) to refresh. Maybe, like Ozil, he will come back looking like the player we all thought they would be when they were purchased.

Personally I think the most important players for Ozil are Ramsey, Walcott and Sanchez. They make runs and provide outlets for a player like Ozil. Unfortunately he's had no chance to play with all of them, but we should see them all on the pitch together in the next few weeks.

5611~~~
He really shouldn't have started tonight, he could've done with being left out. I don't know what's happened to him but I hope he gets back to his best soon.

5612~~~
hes worse than nani ever was! 3 times he have the ball away in the first half that should have resulted in us conceding goals or a penalty

5613~~~
I kind of wish he hadn't been taken off when he was, because he'd just played two passes that were imaginative and which penetrated the defence nicely... Just looked like he was finding his feet. I might be off and that he'd have resumed "normal" service and lost the ball more often than not, but I do wonder...

5614~~~
He celebrated the goal which was good to see. Maybe just first-season-syndrome. Let's see how he is next year.

5615~~~
I think thats on the money tbh.

5616~~~
Awful again, Sanchez is making him look like a fool.

5617~~~
He looked really annoyed when he got subbed off.

5618~~~
I thought he should have gone to left wing and Young come off. Might simplify the game a bit for him to be on his natural wing. 

Positive note was he set up what should have been a goal on the Rooney offside. This phase will pass. I'm not worried.

5619~~~
This really. The difference today with him on the pitch and after he got subbed off was huge. While he was on the pitch, sure he was sloppy in possession and wasted a few things, he also created just about everything we did and we looked dangerous going forwards every time and it was a matter of when we'd score. When he came off, we had nothing in an attacking sense. He was below par today but still as you say creates loads of chances.

5620~~~
Oh, c'mon! How do you think Carlos Tevez sorted things out when we even had fewer Spanish-speaking guys on the team and him speaking almost zero English? There is a reason why players of any team sports discipline use codes and other unique communication systems to make sure everyone's on the same page. I'm sure the Manchester United coaching staff, like in any respected sports club, have their own code for players to use in match situations. So I expect Di Maria to use the same "coded language" as other players can.

If you think Spanish-speaking players have issues with English in football, you should have seen Russian-born ice hockey players trying to make it in the NHL; it's really difficult to break the language barrier. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5621~~~
trash again, drop him.

5622~~~
Home against Arsenal. There isn't a better game to turn things around.

5623~~~
Don't know what's going on with him.

He started so well he was being hailed as the best and most similar player to Ronaldo we have had since, well, Ronaldo.

Brilliant assists, crazy goals, blistering runs...

What happened?

Could see he was proper pissed off about coming off too.

5624~~~
Januzaj should have started with adm coming on later.
Di Maria gave the ball away too many times for my liking.

5625~~~
With the games we've got coming up, his form is seriously worrying. I mean, we should be looking at players like him to drag us through games like yesterday. You know, someone who will give us that spark. I just hope he can sort his form out.

5626~~~
He should have more space to run into when we play Arsenal as they won't be as defensive as other teams. Maybe that will help turn his form around.

5627~~~
Hopefully we set-up against United like we did against City.

5628~~~
Its become pretty clear that he is far better suited to a counter attacking team, I reckon Fergie would have loved him for example, but I'm starting to really worry that he'll never really work in a possession based, passing set up. He'll still rack up assists, but wont hit the heights of last season. 

Its a massive headache really. He's not particularly suited to a midfield role in a LVG team, well he's not suited at all tbh, and he's not a world class (for want of a better description) winger. It is starting to look like this wasn't a very well researched transfer in all honesty, another one of those 'great player, wrong time' kind of signings to file along with others like Veron, Berbatov and Mata. 

Really really hope I'm wrong, and he turns it around. He's such a talented player, and a joy to watch on form. Would be such a shame to see that go to waste and not work out at United.

5629~~~
He's turned into proper shit with us.

5630~~~
I wondered about that. It didn't seem to work as well against Spurs though so I thought Wenger might be hesitant to do it again. 

Agree completely. He gives the ball away too much for a possession game. Well, he seems to anyway. Maybe it's just his poor form doing that.

5631~~~
Nah, he's always been like that. An all or nothing sort of player.

I just can't, with hindsight and more understanding of LVG's blueprint for a team, get my head around why he wanted to buy Di Maria for £60 million. He just seems like the complete opposite to the kind of player LVG would want to build a team around. Unless he saw him as 'his Robben'? As I say, I hope there is logic in the decision and I hope he's here for years to come, but I'm struggling to see how right now.

5632~~~
Will he ever be the best player in the team? realistically?

5633~~~
Someone else said that it was a statement signing from Woody. That we will still spend and be a force with no CL football. Beginning to thnk it may have been because he doesn't really fit. Unless, as you said, the plan was to 'Robben' him.

5634~~~
It is starting to really look like that. I'd honestly love to know what the plan was.

5635~~~
I don't care how often he gives the ball away, he just needs to run at defenders and try the incisive passes more. Playing with a lack of confidence.

5636~~~
On dutch television they did an analysis of his stats,

Di Maria was on the ball 52 times. He lost possession due dribbling, bad passing 26 times. Thats a 50/50 chance he will lose the ball.

Now combine this with the fact that most likely the other 26 SUCCESSFUL passes have a HUGE percentage of simple back/side passes. Its pretty shocking. I wouldn't be surprised if he actually had 90% fail rate in forward passing/beating opponent.

5637~~~
Remember Nani?

5638~~~
He was pathetic, yet still should have had 1 (maybe 2? Didn't see the replay of the offside clearly) assist. Sums Di María up when he has a poor game.

5639~~~
I cant remember the last time I saw him go past a fullback... for someone with his pace and trickery, its rather shocking how much he struggles even in a one on one situation.

5640~~~
Agree with this we have turned him from one of the worlds best player to a Nani clone! Play him in his best position for feck sake but then we are short if we do in behind the striker unless we play a square peg in a round hole (Mata wide). LVG needs to work something out though.

5641~~~
He was always a Nani clone in terms of decision making and inconsistency. He was just as bad as he is at the moment during the World Cup. One of the biggest disappointments of the tournament before he got injured in the quarter finals. It looks more and more like his brilliant 6 months at Real last season were a great run of form and not his actual performance level. He'll have a few fantastic games from time to time when everything he tries works, but it's totally unpredictable when it's going to happen or how often.

5642~~~
I feel like I watched a different game.

Yes, he was inconsistent but at the same time he was our most dangerous player while he was on the pitch.

5643~~~
He's always been the Nani of a few seasons back, with better final ball and worse finishing. Why he was always a £30m valued player until last season when his price doubled and Real Madrid instantly sold to get in a younger and more complete player in Rodriguez.

5644~~~
The Nani of a few seasons back was lethal, ADM's performance this season aren't close.

5645~~~
The moments before he was subbed off was when I thought he was improving his gmae and involment with those beautiful passes over the top.

5646~~~
He wasn't close to being good yesterday, but I liked how he still found himself on the ball more often than most of our attacking talent. Even when he's at his lowest ebb, I still feel as though he has that one moment of brilliance in him to win a game.

5647~~~
Yep but we are not putting his attributes to good use and this is not his fault. Let him run at players from deep. With his speed control and engine he's a player very hard to stop. Play him as a winger and he's doubled up on and his threat drops considerable although still a good player.

5648~~~
Not sure about the more complete player but can see your point.

5649~~~
Clearly not confident and playing in a team a lot worse than his previous one. Yes the price tag is huge but he did not create it. My worry more than his form is whether he actually wants to be here, all that talk about him joining PSG before they pulled out due the fee and FFP leads me to believe we were not his desired choice. 
He will rediscover his form for sure but overall this season he has been bang average just like most of our team and LvG hasn't helped him at all to be fair by playing him all over the shop. Opposition fans are loving it but these are the same fans who thought he was world class at Real! I would personally start him from the bench in the next few games, take him out of the firing line and bring him on against tired opposition.

5650~~~
I don't think there has been any doubt that, ADM wanted to go to Paris before United.

5651~~~
His reaction when he was subbed off made it pretty obvious he wanted to be playing, so I don't really understand these 'he doesn't wanna be here' comments. 

Also, he was our main source of chances yesterday and could have had 3 or 4 assists from some great balls, so the 'no confidence' idea doesn't seem to make an awful lot of sense. 

For me it boils down to the fact that almost every one else is playing percentage passes and risking nothing, which makes his attempts at high risk passes stand out even more than normal, especially when they don't come off. 

He's definitely not in top form, and he could (should) be doing better, but the way we're playing isn't helping him in any way whatsoever, and subbing him off was absolutely insane.

5652~~~
Poor game but still created our best chances. We should stop fecking around and play him in front of a solid middle 2 every game. Give him the license to do as he pleases, not restrict him to a position where he can be doubled up and negated. That said, doesnt absolve him of blame. needs to up his game.

5653~~~
Thats what I thought but I had the impression on here when we signed him that many fans could not believe how he could choose Paris over the great Manchester United and that we can only be second choice to Real Madrid.

5654~~~
I'd rather a player has the courage to carry the ball forward and lose it than needlessly passing it side to side, not creating anything and still losing it.

Btw, I have just checked on whoscored and Hazard for example literally gets dispossesed twice as much per game as Di Maria. I am sure other forwards/attacking mids also lose the ball fairly often, Fabregas for example loses it as often as Di Maria. The difference is that it gets noticed more when Di Maria or even Herrera yesterday lose it because then due to our system and shambolic defending the opposing player can run through all the way to DDG without any trouble. 

Whereas in Chelsea's conservative system if Hazard or Fabregas lose it, most of the time no problem, as Matic or one of their 6 defenders will clear the ball or at least commit a foul, but unlike us they are not that nice that they let the opposing attacker run through all the way to Courtois without doing anything you know.

5655~~~
He was probably our most active attacking player and was doing well on the right flank with Valencia. He certainly did much more than Young did until he went off and it was a much improved performance. Januzaj didnt do much at all and it was not a right sub. Cant share the negativity in here

5656~~~
Of course his confidence is not high, yes he produced a few good passes prior to his substitution but his overall play has showed simple passes being misplaced, being afraid to shoot, over running the ball and carrying the look and demeanor of a man generally having a mare and weighed down by a huge expectation in a faltering team. This has been evident in plenty of games of late. 
He is not prone to a mistake of course just like any other player but this is not the same confident player of the previous season not even the one of the first few months of this season. I believe LvG has not helped his situation either at all by not only playing him in positions he is not accustomed to but also like you said the way the team is set up and instructed with percentage passing does make it more noticeable when cock ups are made. Adnan was the same when he came on hit and miss but he doesn't look to be having any doubts about his own abilities right now unlike Angel, in my own opinion of course. 
Being subbed and looking upset is great to see and what all professionals should show if unhappy with the managers decision (which I didn't agree with either, Van Gaal has done this on a few occasions this season) but I think when saying about him wanting to be here is more to do with his own admission of not realizing how physical and fast this league is, the attempted robbery and the fact he looked very much PSG bound in the summer. 
I really want him to regain his form and get some consistency to his game as such a great player when things are going for him and he could be so vital in the run in. Will this happen though is anyone's guess.

5657~~~
Yesterday, Di Maria found a team-mate with a frankly pathetic 63% of his passes.

Hazard and Fabregas racked up 91% and 82% accuracy respectively.

<b>That</b> is why Di Maria gets more stick than them. Or you could ignore stats and, you know, watch them play football?

5658~~~
Thanks for the advice but I watched the game and just checked the stats you know. And I wasn't arguing about passing here but about being disposessed if you bother to read.

5659~~~
So passing the ball to the opposition doesn't result in lost possession? Righto.

You were clearly implying that Hazard and Fabregas lose the ball just as much, if not more, than Di Maria but nobody criticises them because they have better team-mates to cover for them. You shouldn't need stats to know that your theory is utter nonsense. Just in case you do, though, I provided them.

I also like the way you refer to Chelsea's "conservative" system. You should mention that in the Van Gaal thread. Maybe we need to be <i>more</i> conservative, like Chelsea?

5660~~~
I also mentioned their 6 defenders, but just to spell it out for you, I don't mean by that that they always play with 6 defenders you know. And with conservative system I meant that their system is not a posession system where you get easily exposed once you lose the ball (just like Barca/Bayern) compared to Chelsea's or Atletico's system for example. But I thought that would be clear to anyone who watches some football. Oh and before you now ask questions about Bayern/Barca: We play a possesion game like them but all three still do it in a different way and they of course have better players than us.

And yes passes matter, but I wasn't talking about them, I was just talking about a specific element (being dispossesed), because if Di Maria was dispossesed in Atletico's or Chelsea's system, ppl would not be annoyed that much because those teams would win the ball back asap unlike us.

5661~~~
Good God, if you really can't see the link between passing the ball badly and losing possession I'm wasting my time here. You're on your own.

5662~~~
I can see the link Mr smart, but that still doesn't contradict my statement about being disposessed. There's a link but they are not the same Thing. Rooney for example has better passing stats this season than Di Maria, but at the same time also loses possesiion more often than Di Maria.

Edit: Plus as you have yourself provided Hazard's passing stats, he has much better passing stats than Di Maria but also loses the ball twice as much. (This has probably a lot to do with him trying more dribbles, but that's another point then anyway ...)

5663~~~
Is there a site that does those chalkboards now? Like the ones the Guardian used to have where you could see where on the pitch the player touched the ball, lost it, which passes worked/failed?

5664~~~
Needs his confidence rebuilding. Not sure how we do that, maybe he could do with a game off? 

Perhaps a counterattacking game plan vs Arsenal will suit him?

5665~~~

Gives avg positions

5666~~~
So there was NOTHING positive in his first 10 games... ok

5667~~~
From his face at the end of the game and him not celebrating like the others ( he didnt stand up quickly enough and didnt clap as hard as the other players ) its clear he doesnt want to be at United.

Jokes aside, hope he will find his form.

5668~~~
Paris is a shitehole, just saying. Why would anyone want to live there?

5669~~~
How big effect do you think the break in on January 31st is having?  The reports I read in the papers say that three armed figures attempted to force entry into the player’s house in Cheshire, but despite smashing the windows of the mansion, they left empty-handed after an alarm was triggered and they subsequently fled. 

However, I have heard rumours that the break in was far worse than what has been reported and the the press and United have deliberately watered down the incident. That his agent has informed United that the player's family are unhappy in Manchester and Di Maria wishes, if the club can make it happen, to move out of the country.

5670~~~
Scroll up, i have already covered this

5671~~~
Sounds like complete and utter guff to me.

5672~~~
Not sure about all that dross about the rumours and what not but the break in attempt is likely having an impact on him. Footballer or no footballer, if you're trying to settle in a new country and something like that happens, it isn't likely to be easy. I'm sure it's having an effect.

5673~~~
Hazard probably attempt more dribbles as you say but he also has on average 20% more playing time per game compared to di Maria.

5674~~~
This. Some ridiculous overreactions in this thread. The ball to Fellaini alone was pure class

5675~~~
Rojo had a rough start and both players missed a significant amount of time with injuries as well.

5676~~~
Gabriel is out, i am dead certain he will destroy their defence tomorrow

5677~~~
That's a relief. 

Let's hope he also does it on Monday when we play them too...

5678~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, its not tomorrow ? ffs

5679~~~
Eh? The Nani of a few seasons back had way more assists over 18-24 months than any other PL player. His crossing and final ball was amazing.

Sometimes I wonder if you actually watch our players or just write this shit to WUM.

5680~~~
One thing I took from watching the game live is the amount of times he asks for the ball and doesn't receive it. Herrera, Blind and Fellaini would pick the ball up in the centre of the pitch, and ADM would be out wide right screaming for it but they are reluctant to try a difficult ball, but in reality it's only a 30 yard diagonal ball to his feet, most of the time there's no need to even take out the defender. Give it ADM's feet and let him do that, instead he's coming too short for the ball and then trying to hard.

With players like Scholes and Carrick in the team, our wingers received the ball much higher up the pitch and could target the full-back one on one but at the minute, ADM is receiving it on the half way line and expecting to make things happen, if he got it in the final third with pace on the ball so he has momentum to beat his man then I'm sure he could do that easily enough either on the outside or cutting inside. Getting the ball deep means he's doubled up on, there was a few times where he beat Taylor with ease but Sissoko was tracking back or Coloccini would come across and clear up the danger.

5681~~~
I noticed the same a few times and was wondering if it's because they expect him to lose the ball in his current form.

5682~~~
There's absolutely no way a player doesn't give the ball to the player in the best position because he doesn't trust him, it's ridiculous.

5683~~~
Since I play football, there always were player I didn’t gave the ball. Whether they were not good enough or I dislike them. I think that this kind of things happens in football.

In my current team, there’s a winger (a copy of Ronaldo, we call him CR2…) he’s so bad but thinks that he’s so good, I give him the ball only when he can’t lose it and I never give him the ball because I know that instead of crossing, shooting, playing the right way, he will try to do step overs, tricks from lower league and lower brain things.

For United, I really think that players with big personality such as Van Nistelrooy didn’t gave the ball to Ronaldo on purpose. It’s because they were not friend at all and didn’t had technical relationships. We can say the same for Scholesy. Would he wanted to give the ball the Liam Miller or Djemba*2 ?

Today, I guess that some players will not give the ball to Di Maria because he loses it too many times.

5684~~~
So what's everybody elses excuse?.... because the whole fecking team, every player keeps losing the ball it's only more apparant with ADM because he cost 59m and we expect him to do something with it.

5685~~~
It would surprise me if this kind of thing was going on to any serious degree at the PL level. If the manager noticed it he would surely be looking to stamp it out, it would detract from the efficient functioning of the team if there were players intentionally not passing it to other players. Is there any evidence to substantiate this claim that Van Nistelrooy didnt pass to Ronaldo, or Scholes didnt pass it to Miller? Because I have never heard about it if there is. It is for the manager to decide who has the requisite quality to play in his team, or to instruct a player if he isnt passing it quickly enough. Once the manager has picked a team and put it out, the players have to trust his selection and play as a team. 

Even players who have well documented enmity, like Cole and Sherringham, left that in the dressing room. There was no hint of it on the pitch.

5686~~~
With all due respect, that's a really terrible attitude. The basics of any competitive team sport (in anything other than a really poor quality league) is to have faith in each of the other positions in the team. Without that, it's impossible to function as an effective team.

Don't think this is true at all.

5687~~~
He loses it much more than everyone else. That's just a fact. Against Newcastle almost every outfield player for United was completing nearly 90% of their passes. Di Maria completed just over 60% of his.

5688~~~
He loses it more than anyone else because he's the only player in the side with complete creative freedom, the only other player who attempts risky passes is Rooney, and it's the pass out to Valencia on the right that we've seen for years now.

5689~~~
No. That's just making excuses. He wasn't just losing the ball when he tried high risk passes. He was making a pigs ear of simple, sideways passes. Dunno what's going on but he was fecking shite against Newcastle.

5690~~~
He's been shite for a while, but I'd still expect him to have a higher percentage of lost balls to our other players, even when he's playing well. Like I said, it's pretty obvious he's the one with creative freedom in the side, he doesn't have a fixed position and is one of the few players who attempts anything other than a simple sideways five yard pass.

5691~~~
He wasnt "fecking shite" against Newcastle. It wasnt a vintage performance but he and Valencia were the only elements in our play that created something and brought pace into our otherwise slow and predictable play

5692~~~
Ok, yeah, I'd agree with that. Our creative players have historically always had a lower pass completion % than the rest of the team. I disagree that he's the <i>only </i>player allowed to be creative, though. Rooney and Young would have both also had creative freedom in the formation we played. Fellaini too, to an extent. In fact, defenders aside, the only two players who would have probably been briefed to be conservative would have been Blind and Hererra.

That said, it speaks volumes about Di Maria's contribution that Valencia (at fullback) wasn't much less of a creative force (while completing >90% of his passes)

5693~~~
The talent is there anyway, hopefully as the pace of our play improves we'll begin to see the best of him again.

He is an assist machine.

5694~~~
Question is do we start him against Arsenal? I was all for him being dropped against Newcastle before being brought back against Arsenal with a slight kick up his arse. Now I'm not sure as his pace would be extremely useful against Arsenal's generally high defence but he doesn't deserve to have his spot in the team ahead of Young or Januzaj

5695~~~
We should definitely start him against Arsenal, unless he isn't 100% fit. He's still a magician, he's still shown glimpses of absolute brilliance during this period.

5696~~~
I'm all for picking on form and was wondering if he deserved to start against Newcastle. That said, neither Young nor Januzaj made a really convincing case of their own in that game. So yeah, I'd start Di Maria. Who knows? It could be the trigger for a renaissance similar to Nani's against the same opposition. Dunno about Manchester but spring is in the air in Dublin. Maybe a hint of sunshine is all it needs for him to find his mojo again?!?

5697~~~
Without a doubt, yes. Odds are we'll be playing on the counter against Arsenal, which will suit him.

5698~~~
Spot on.

5699~~~
No its more apparent because he gives it away with careless passes or by trying to take on too many players

5700~~~
If we don't think he'll snap out of this funk in time for Arsenal, just start him on the left and let him run up the line and hit crosses. 

-------Rooney------
DiMaria-Mata-Herrera
----Blind-Carrick----

Would be how I'd play it, or Herrera at the 10 and Young on the right.

5701~~~
I understand a player who has bad decision making but Angel di Maria doesn't seem to do the wrong thing at the wrong time perhaps other than a handful of games where he was shooting on sight but that he hasn't been doing as of late, his decisions don't seem to be a problem that is to say he dribbles when it is the right moment and he does simple passes when he needs or tries a more risky pass too when it's the right time.

His execution just seems to be a lottery, whether it is when he is taking on a player or playing a simple pass or trying a more risky pass, sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it's terrible. I don't understand it, it's like how can somebody so good at free kicks be so bad at corners.

He needs to somehow stop messing up so often and like I said I don't think it's a problem with decision making but consistency in his execution. The thing is when he has such excellent dribbles, crosses, passes and defence splitting passes surely it isn't that hard not to mess up so often.

I'd expect more of it because he did this at Real Madrid.

5702~~~
Gary Neville in the Telegraph reckons the burglary of Di Maria's home has effected his performance. That's just silly. If it was that simple the situation could be fixed by someone sneaking in to his house and putting extra things back. No. I think there's a more serious reason for his decline this season. British shin pads.

5703~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5704~~~
Getting him off early in the last two games will affect his confidence. He is still very much the creative outlet in the team. On the ball, he is unpredictable and could do some magic. Problem is LvG prefer players to play the safe option.

5705~~~
He's got no confidence. He keeps trying low percentage moves which would seem amazing if they came off, but almost certainly won't. It's like he's deferring all responsibility to the gods of chance.

I think if he were in a well functioning team, he'd take fewer stupid risks. It looks like he's attempting the impossible because nobody else is trying to make anything happen.

5706~~~
Anyone else think Januzaj might have staged the burglary? Just me, then.

5707~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5708~~~
Excellent <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Has anyone read that piece btw? Looks like they just needed some column inches filled before they went to press and made up something to go with whatever pictures were top of the pile. Half way down they even use that pic of Ozil that makes him look like he's got rickets!
Link to article: <a class="externalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1APE1ub" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1APE1ub</a>

5709~~~
I agree. I could guarantee that say if SAF was noticing something like this occuring he would drag and potentially banish the player refusing to pass it. You can't have a 'team' operating like that, otherwise it's way just a disjointed collection of individuals.

5710~~~
Against Bilbao, Madrid really lost di Maria directness and urgency in midfield. 

In our recent games, seems like he's been given the role as our playmaker, and he could take many risky passes.

5711~~~
Put up his house for sale. That robbery attempt must have really shaken him and his family.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/angel-di-maria-set-move-8796921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/angel-di-maria-set-move-8796921</a>

5712~~~
I would probably do the same in his case

5713~~~
I see a lot of people calling for him to be benched on Monday....that is just ridiculous, his direct football would be perfect against Arsenal

5714~~~
A Home game against Arsenal is NOT the game you decide to bench Di Maria.

Monday night could be his stage, but i'm not expecting a motm performance tbh but all the same he should start and his pace and direct style will hurt Arsenal if and when the match opens up.

5715~~~
Wouldn't be surprised to see him go in the summer if PSG are willing to pay £50-55m for him. Don't think he should be dropped for the game tomorrow, even though his performance wasn't great against Newcastle we missed him when he went off.

5716~~~
Wasn't his to begin with, he was renting it.

5717~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5718~~~
I think he should be dropped, he has no confidence whatsoever in his game and has been awful in his last 2 games.

5719~~~
Yet is needed for his pace vs Arsenal

5720~~~
Played on the wing in both didn't he?

5721~~~
PSG would have to be off their heads to pay £50million for him in the summer. Not only are they hamstrung by FFP (hence they couldn't afford him last year in the first place), but he's not worth anywhere near £50million. If we sold him now we'd be lucky to get £30million, and I don't think we'd even get that. The mixture of Madrid absolutely fleecing us for him because Woody was so desperate for a "galactico" and how catastrophically shit his form has been for us means that he's not even worth half what we paid.

We're basically stuck with him for the foreseeable future.

5722~~~
Much rather see him start tomorrow than Januzaj.

5723~~~
"Stuck" with Angel Di Maria. 

Managers would give a nut to be in the scenario.

5724~~~
If he doesn't start tomorrow it could destroy what little confidence he has.

5725~~~
Have no idea how the game will go, but you'd think manager would say "This is the sort of game you are here for, go and show the crowd."

5726~~~
Even if he is not in his best form right now, I would still start him to be honest. Our end product is bad and we struggle to create anything, so a player like him is vital for us. Even if he loses the ball and is inconsistent, he will still play his 2,3 passes/crosses who will cause some danger and could be the only opportunity to score. I also think Arsenal could be a nice change in how we play, they will not sit deep like most other teams we faced in the last few weeks, they will attack and will give us more room and freedom for our possession-based play. Di Maria is also a weapon on the counter, which is always a good way to score against Arsenal. So while it's not impossible that he could be dropped because of his form in the last few games, I wouldn't do it tomorrow.

5727~~~
He'll be alot better with the Old Trafford crowd singing his name, this is a game for him to set the stage on fire.

Put him on the same wing as Monrael and Mertesacker.

5728~~~
Of course we should start him tomorrow. Ridiculous question. I can understand dropping him against small teams but he's still one of our most important players and offers us things nobody else in our squad offers anything close to with his pace, dribbling and creativity.

5729~~~
Surely he's got enough mental strength to deal with missing a few games (or half-games). Every player goes through a weak patch, it's not the end of the world. The manager has to play the players who are currently in the best form (even though he hasn't always done that, I'm thinking of RVP for example) and Di Maria doesn't look like he knows what he's doing on the pitch right now.
IMO the main reason for his poor form is LVG's failure to play him in a fixed position consistently. I think he needs to be put wide on the left and given the time to get used to fitting into a system. Unfortunately LVG has messed around with the team so much all season without settling on anything.
I would start with Januzaj or Mata tomorrow with Di Maria on the bench. I think the guy needs some time to clear his head.

5730~~~
He has been struggling more with defenses sitting deep and doubling up on him, but Arsenal will come out and look to attack us. He will thrive with more space and considering how poor Mertesacker looked against Monaco with runners, he should definitely go at them.

5731~~~
He should have more space against the Arse but even if he's on the bench he could come on in the 2nd half and use his pace against their tiring defenders.

5732~~~
Right now I'd say he's looking mentally fragile, he seemed gutted when he came off against Newcastle. The game tomorrow is a huge one against another big team at Old Trafford, the type of game players like him thrive on, plus Arsenal's high-line benefits his pace, something Mata and Januzaj don't have a lot of and it isn't like either of them have done much to warrant a start either, our only consistent wide player has been Ashley Young.

5733~~~
Lol never really understood the concept of a grown mans confidence getting destroyed by not starting or getting games, even though i agree with your point

5734~~~
If he starts i think he will be on fire. Just have that feeling that he will be up for this game.

5735~~~
Without Di Maria against Arsenal we won't be able to conduct a proper attack, the ball will get misplaced a lot, even though he does that enough on his own already, he is still a great conductor

5736~~~
When he signed, one of Di Maria's strengths was the way he played in the so called 'big matches' - this is one of those games. He will start, of that I have no doubt.

5737~~~
Me too,I think he'll play and might have a good game for us as its against Arsenal who arent a physical side which should suit him.

5738~~~
He won't be sold, he will come good

Pray for Angel

5739~~~
Di Maria will surely start tomorrow, a big home game against Arsenal who aren't going to try and be physical or kick him off the pitch. It could be the ideal game for him to get some of his mojo back.

5740~~~
Definitely, I really think he'll come alive tomorrow.

5741~~~
Apart from anything else, it's a home game. He's generally been decent at Old Trafford. It's away from home where he's been at his crappest.

5742~~~
Arguably his worst performance was at Old Trafford in his last game when he was subbed at half time and lucky to make it to then.

5743~~~
That was just one game though, pretty much every other game he has been pretty good actually. His bad form isn't even consistently bad performances, it's just very inconsistent performances with some good and some bad. As Pogue says, most of those bad ones are away and it's part of the reason we have struggled for wins away from home.

5744~~~
I think he's a fabulous player. Hope he stays for a long time. 

If he fails to adapt then playing swapsies with PSG would work. Woody and LvG wouldn't lose face, and it's a way round FFP.

5745~~~
I don't think there's any denying his talent, but I question his desire to be here and play for the club, and whether he remotely suits the league. He's more Ozil than Sanchez - evidently still talented, but doesn't give a feck and doesn't suit the league.

5746~~~
This.
He will be key tonight. We definitely don't want to play possession football (what we struggle at) against Arsenal. I hope we go more counter-attacking tonight.

5747~~~
Again, he's looked very good at times in a league 'he doesn't suit', and the 'doesn't give a feck' are highly subjective.

5748~~~
He'll be fine, he will kick on sooner rather than later.

5749~~~
I reckon we'll see a good game from Di Maria tonight. These kinds of games bring out the best in big players like him.

5750~~~
I sure hope so….

5751~~~
Me too , would be a great time to find some form .

5752~~~
Definitely needs a good performance tonight to get all the media spotlight off him, or at least on him in a good way. With his pace, Arsenal should be an ideal opponent given their propensity to leave huge space to counter-attack into. If he can isolate Mertesacker one-on-one (provided he plays), he could really do some damage.

Hopefully with the crowd behind him he'll rediscover some of that early season swagger that was making him look like one of the best players in the League...

5753~~~
To be fair the media spotlight on him hasn't been as bad as it was on Ozil, i mean besides the Burglary incident,his criticisms haven't been unfair or anything like that, they wanted Ozil's head last season and he didn't cost as much as £60m.

May be due to the fact that the whole United team is struggling though

5754~~~
I think this is a perfect game for Di Maria to shine, I hope he scores one of his 35+ yard shots he keeps trying, it would be a superb way to get him back in form!

5755~~~
He's gonna score tonight. Watch this space.

5756~~~
Im hoping he makes a couple of exquisite goals but Rooney actually scores them.

5757~~~
I don't think he'll score, but I do reckon he will have a stormer. As others have mentioned, his best performances have come at Old Trafford and against Arsenal, he'll have buckets of space to run at them.

5758~~~
That's probably true. I think Ozil's problem has been his outward appearance of nonchalance, which can easily be interpreted as a lack of effort/interest. I'm on the fence with Ozil - he's clearly technically a classy player but does he have the mentality to drive him to really influence games and enforce his talent when it really matters? All too often he looks content just going through the motions, though perhaps it's just his languid style/temperament. 

Di Maria, on the other hand, at least never hides or absolves himself from responsibility. If anything, he's probably trying too much at the moment and would be better served focusing on the basics (such as balls-to-feet, lay-offs, etc) than constantly trying to beat his man. But I think it's promising, at least regarding his character, that he's not taking the easy way out and hopefully something comes from it tonight...

5759~~~
We'l have plenty of chances to break at them unlike other games where opponents sit back so yeah, the kind of game suited to Di Maria.

5760~~~
Di Maria sets himself a very high standard and he hasn't hit that this season. However I find it a little odd when people question his decision making on the ball, yes he gives the ball away a lot but he also produces moments of pure brilliance. Without his creativity we would've produced feck all against Newcastle.

5761~~~
Its amazing how people are ready to throw players of quality like Di Maria just because they dont perform right NOW.

5762~~~
Are people not meant to criticise a quality player for under performing?

5763~~~
One thing to criticise, another to say he should be sold etc in the summer.

EDIT: Not directed at you

5764~~~
An interesting article by Robbie Savage.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31738779" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31738779</a>

I do agree with much of what he has said.
In a nutshell, he has been getting progressively worse and that perhaps he is not cut out for the PL.

I realise that his supporters are stating that he needs more time. I want to remind people that when you pay big money, a club (and fans) expect immediate impact.
An 18 year old, can be given time to grow/adapt/improve.
A 26 year old who is supposedly at the peak of his powers, has to prove himself immediately. Every successful big money player has had immediate impact - there is no exception to this rule.

In fact Di Maria did make immediate impact - scoring/creating goals in his first few games. But as the season wore on, he has lost form, which doesnt support the theory that he needs more time.
If time was the issue, he would've struggled in the first few games and would've got progressively better - not worse.

Looking at the statistics and progression - I dont think this guy is going to improve...but that is just my opinion and I could be wrong.

There are 3 things to consider:

1. can the club afford to have such a huge financial investment tied up in a player who is struggling?
2. can a player, for his own sake, for his own career, afford to be in a place of employment, where his reputation/skill/ability is progressively being degraded?
3. can the club win trophies, when they have an important player on the pitch, who is performing badly?

When fans are suggesting that he should be sold - they are not trying to be nasty, but are making an informed/calculated decision that is best for the club and also the player's career.

I really do think that that American players just aren't cut out for our league and we should stick with European players.

5765~~~
Think that has more to do with the notion that he is unhappy at United, i mean even before we signed him, it always seemed like he was headed for Paris and he only chose us because we were willing to overpay and make him our star player + the #7 shirt, I can understand why certain fans might feel that way, when you factor in the language barrier,new environment,break in attempt and the underwhelming (by his standards) performances  it all seems like a disaster to be very honest (not saying it is).

I am under the impression that he is still one of the best players in the world and should be given more time, it would be foolish to let him go after 1 season.

5766~~~
I'm not sure about that. I guess it depends how you define "big money". David Silva cost City a fair whack and improved a lot in his second season. I'm sure there are more examples if you think about it. How about Essien at Chelsea?

5767~~~
Funny you should say this after agreeing with an Article that mentions a thriving "American player" in Sanchez, not to mention Aguero,Tevez and Suarez i don't think it has anything to do with a players nationality.

5768~~~
Also, Drogba at Chelsea.

5769~~~
The problem with Di Maria is he is skinny and not strong. In the english game where more physical challenges are allowed he hasn't quite got to grasp with it. Stronger players like Tevez, Aguero and Sanchez don't have that problem, as they're used to that already. I do think Di Maria will eventually adapt and get used too it though.

5770~~~
It's funny when you watch the post-match discussion on Sky or BT (or wherever) and one of the pundits will say something like "Every successful big money player has had immediate impact - there is no exception to this rule", then the next day you're almost certain to find a bunch of people saying the exact same thing. This place seems to just regurgitate shite somtimes.

Oh yeah, and Robbie Savage is a shockjock cnut.

5771~~~
I don't see how him being skinny has to do with his admittedly poor performances recently. His problem is he is sloppy in his passes the past few games. I don't see him constantly being barged off the ball more than him misplacing passes. I think he is struggling in confidence. Its more a mental thing.

5772~~~
Im expecting a victory and a good game from Di Maria tonight.

5773~~~
MOTM from DiMaria for me tonight then.

5774~~~
He needs to bulk up a bit. Just look how much muscle Januzaj has put on since last season.

But yes, I think he will adapt and be fine.

5775~~~
So important he has a good game tonight, I think he will be just fine but if he's subbed off again it will really knock his confidence. Obviously it's up to him to step up and find the form we all saw at the start of the season when he was tearing teams apart.

5776~~~
Athletico Madrid are probably even rougher than any english team, yet he ripped their defence a new one in the CL final, think its more of a mentality problem

5777~~~
Yes, but then they were always more open games with him being able to run and dribble, using his agility to avoid tackles. Against defence that are sat deep and doubling up he ends up getting marked much tighter and then pushed about.

5778~~~
The thing he needs more than anything in order to make his mark is speedy counters and space to run.

5779~~~
Not sure about that. Atletico were/are purely counter attacking in nature when facing Real or Barca. The same way most teams we face every week set up against us (not expecting Arsenal to do that, obviously).

5780~~~
Well he's facing Monreal tonight, I fancy him against that type of LB.

5781~~~
Cazorla, ozil and Coquelin is the perfect midfield for him to attack and run at. Plenty of space there.

too bad he is playing up front on the right... gonna be a good battle vs Gibbs.

edit. still think he gonna be good tonight. cmon angelito!!
edit2. it seems lineups are still not confirmed

5782~~~
Its one thing to criticise a player,its another dropping bs,like he is unhappy and he is going to be sold,or mentioning transfer fee,how we wasted 60 mil. like he is on a loan for 60 mil. or something.

5783~~~
Rio at United, I would argue.

5784~~~
Against Gibbs he would struggle as Gibbs would match him quite well for pace. Monreal is too slow, I think. Valencia and Di Maria should be able to give them a good run for their money.

5785~~~
I am not in support of every single criticism towards Di Maria but i can understand how some fans might be frustrated by our record signing's underwhelming performances.

5786~~~
Di Maria has to get used to winger position because he's not going back to midfield with such a heavy touch.

5787~~~
He's back <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/Mpmjk/i6UqqRrwxo2OC_zpsd45cbf1d.gif" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/Mpmjk/i6UqqRrwxo2OC_zpsd45cbf1d.gif"/>

5788~~~
What happened to the Di Maria who puts in a massive shift every match? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

He looks dead on his feet tonight.

5789~~~
Strange performance in a way. He's often looked nervous to take on his man, but nevertheless his crossing has been excellent tonight. Deserved his assist for Rooney's goal, and he's put a few dangerous balls into the box. Arsenal seem to be struggling to cope with it a little bit.

5790~~~
Only for madrid <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5791~~~
I'd like to see him stay out wide.  Give him lots of space and freedom to do what he does best and he can be dangerous.  It hasn't all come off for him tonight but he's looked miles better than in his last few matches.

5792~~~
He's playing well tonight. That ball for the goal was sensational.

5793~~~
He's been fecking fantastic tonight, with the exception of the fact that he needs to take responsibility for the Arsenal goal.

5794~~~
Great cross. Performance is a bit meh. How many fecking times has he lost possession needlessly?

5795~~~
I'd like to see him and Young swap now and again. Particularly with Bellerin on a yellow, Di Maria's dribbling could cause the young fullback trouble.

5796~~~
Great cross, but he's also given the ball away a shitload. Plus their goal came from him just not bothering to be arsed defending.

5797~~~
Bit more life about him tonight.

5798~~~
His delivery has been good but he looks like he's tripping over his own feet when he tries to run with the ball at the moment.

5799~~~
Hmm, not sure I agree. I think he's been maddeningly inconsistent. Outstanding stuff one minute, terrible the next. Overall more good than bad though. But fantastic I don't think so.

Brilliant ball for the goal though, and another great one earlier for Fellaini.

5800~~~
I think he's been brilliant. A constant threat with his delivery. Losing possession is the type of player he is, not that I agree with it.

5801~~~
I think he's looked good tonight. Some fantastic deliveries and always looking to get involved. Should take on Monreal more though, he'd have the beating of him for pace easily.

5802~~~
Blaming Di Maria and not Smalling not Valencia for their goal reeks of someone who's never played a match in their life.

5803~~~
Brilliant crossing in that half. All round game was much improved too, hopefully he can kick on even further. Still don't really trust him in front of goal and I don't think he does himself at the moment.

5804~~~
He's a player you have in your team for his phenomenal delivery and the absurd amount of chances he creates. Not his possession stat ratio.

5805~~~
I think the opposite in fairness

He was standing there staring at monreal

5806~~~
Twice dispossessed and one unsuccessful touch according to the stats. Can't say I noticed him losing it too often, a lot less then in recent weeks. His attacking play has been really good IMO. The ball for the cross was brilliant especially.

5807~~~
His tracking back has been non existent today.

5808~~~
True, although his offensive game has been quite good overall.

5809~~~
Smalling sucked out of position in the build up and doesn't get back in, Valencia shitting his pants and panicking jumping into tackles in the middle ... 2 of the back 4 completely out of position. I agree he could have made an effort to get back in, but wouldn't have made a difference by time the ball was released.

5810~~~
They're all to blame. Di Maria didn't bother to do anything and feck knows where Smalling was going. 

Alright so far for me, the usual bits of brilliance and the other usual bits of pure awful. Needs to use his right foot and he should have squared that once chance for Wayne instead of trying to shoot. He still doesn't seem to realize he has a fullback behind him to offer support.

5811~~~
Yep, multiple mistakes at the same exact moment.

5812~~~
I guess you didn't see him just stand there and watch Monreal score

5813~~~
This.

5814~~~
He doesn't like physical contact I reckon. Afraid of 50/50.

5815~~~
Exactly

5816~~~
Not cut out for the PL long term I suspect. He's been hiding and he'll be away if he gets half a chance in the summer.

5817~~~
You can't convince me that Di Maria will be the player we want him to be in the EPL, he is a good player but not an EPL player

5818~~~
We might consider selling him if any good winger is available.

5819~~~
Strange game to say this, probably been one of our better players today.

5820~~~
What a moronic thing to do. Utterly utterly stupid.

5821~~~
Hate to say it but he can't have any complaints. Looked like a dive to me and you can't touch the ref.

5822~~~
Can't wait to hear <a class="username" data-user="61592, @bosnian_red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61592/">@bosnian_red</a> defend the absolute moron. Joke of a second half from him, culminating in that. Well done Angel, you've done yourself proud.

5823~~~
Not only is he fecking shit, he's also a serial diver and (apparently) a clueless fecking idiot. He's always looked utterly thick like there's nothing between his ears - this just confirms it.

5824~~~
Idiot, what was he thinking?

5825~~~
And one of our worst over the last 3 months.

Prime example there - diving because he's scared of contact. Stupid, petty response. It's too physical for him and he can't hack it.

5826~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5827~~~
Stupid of him there. Not a bad performance, but probably prevented us from having a good chance of getting back into the game.

5828~~~
Bring me Nani back all day long

5829~~~
Shit? What are you talking about, He was our most creative outlet in the first half.

5830~~~
Van Gaal needs to take him aside and tell him to stop the diving or going down so easily. You would have thought that Di Maria himself would have realised by now that the refs in this league allow more physical challenges, obviously not...

5831~~~
Idiot.

5832~~~
Get him out of the club. Sick of him lying on the floor for half the match and what he just did straight after receiving a yellow for diving was just bloody stupid.

5833~~~
bring back nani! what an idiot

5834~~~
That was stupid but he was having a good game. I'm not a blind to idiocy, I support him because he's our player instead of jumping on his back to criticise every second. 
Valencia's the one who cost us today anyways imo

5835~~~
Got what he deserved. He is diving and getting frustrated as he has lost the confidence in his own play. Pathetic.

5836~~~
I can't be arsed with him. £60m eh?

5837~~~
Thankfully he's suspended now.

5838~~~
PSG, show me the money.

5839~~~
Bit of a contradiction to criticise people for slagging off Di Maria before blaming a player for the result surely?

5840~~~
He will receive a long ban

5841~~~
Valencia made a bad pass, it happens.

Di Maria tried to cheat, then made it worse by laying his hand on the ref - inexcusable.

5842~~~
No complaints, he was very stupid.

5843~~~
He wasn't having a good game. He was having an OK first half, with slightly more good than bed, though plenty of screw ups, and he was appalling in the 2nd. And that was sheer stupidity out of him, stupid dive.

5844~~~
Did he get a second yellow or a straight red?

5845~~~
I didnt see but i imagine straight red.

5846~~~
Can anyone tell me the difference between his "dive" and the one where welbeck went to ground?

5847~~~
Misses one game or three?

5848~~~
Well I mean he did pass it straight to welbeck for the goal...

5849~~~
Hopefully the FA charge him with assaulting a referee and he gets a nice fat suspension, because it's the only way LvG will stop picking him.

5850~~~
Lol fans trying to make it sound like he was destroying Arsenal, he was "ok", he wasn't signed to be "ok"

5851~~~
Got a straight red, at least 3 games

5852~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5853~~~
Given a yellow, but then after he tugged at Oliver got another. But imagine they will count it as straight red.

5854~~~
Not exactly a moment of madness, but still daft. Though you have to ask questions of the same ref that let Joe Hart headbut him in a similar situation at the Etihad. Still, can't really play the victim card either.

5855~~~
Maybe they're used to do that in Spain.

5856~~~
I am trying to remember a bigger flop in the P.L - but to be quite honest, I can't. He has to go in the summer - we are a much better team without him.

5857~~~
Falcao is close, but Di Maria wins.

5858~~~
Stupid behaviour. Unacceptable.

5859~~~
You can't think of a bigger flop than a player that's contributed to 16 goals in 26 games? Really? Not even Torres?

5860~~~
Falcao has actually contributed a bit in some games - di Maria has generally been useless!

5861~~~
He is a dickhead

That is all

5862~~~
Red deserved. The ref didnt get him any foul though, Alexis got every foul when he went to the ground. Pathetic from both

5863~~~
If you're going to get yourself sent off for attacking the referee then atleast punch him in his fecking gob instead of being a fecking pussy pulling his shirt, what are you, a lapdog?

5864~~~
Idiot.

5865~~~
Not every straight red is 3 games. For example, last man foul red is suspension for just 1game.

5866~~~
Absolute retard. 

I'm not one to throw around words like that about a player, but how on earth did he think that was an acceptable thing to do? First he dives , rightly gets a yellow, then manages to leave us with a man less after grabbing Oliver aggressively from behind... It's unforgiveable.

5867~~~
di Maria is generally our opponents best player by constantly giving the ball away in dangerous positions and not tracking back EVER (like in the Monreal goal). Has he contributed a best offensively - yes in his first 4-5 games he looked class - if you ignored the complete lack of defensive work which made our team completely unbalanced.

There is a reason why we are a much better team without him.

5868~~~
Stupid boy.

5869~~~
Fecking idiot. Let's hope PSG are still interested.

5870~~~
I think we are looking at a 10 game ban here. 5 for racism, 6 for spitting, 10 for touching Oliver.

5871~~~
Double the price of Sanchez too. Wrong one.

5872~~~
This will either be 3 game ban or even more considering that he 'attacked' the referee. Won't be surprised if he get 5+ ban.

5873~~~
Jesus Christ. The amount of knee jerking on this forum is incredible, player has a run of bad form and suddenly he's useless. I suppose we'll just forget his previous seasons in which he has shown how good he is.

5874~~~
Tw@ttish thing to do. Get a grip

5875~~~
It's so frustrating watching him roll around like he is hacked down everytime he is barely fouled. Suarezesqe.

5876~~~
Whatever his suspension is I don't think we should play him again this season. Last season people were saying they were embarrassed by how we were playing today I had that feeling for the first time as a United supporter and it had nothing to do with how we played.

5877~~~
There's no guarantees he will be settled next season. If Real want to sell Bale which I highly doubt then we should move on Di Maria to PSG sharpish

5878~~~
Thought he had an excellent game up until losing his cool.

Made some great runs, got the better of Mertesacker, provided some great crosses.

5879~~~
ADM has 4 goals and 11 assists this season ffs as average as he's been in a few games recently there's no way in hell he's been 'useless' and worse than Falcao. Fecking hell.

5880~~~
fecking cretin. Still don't know how he didn't get booked for the dive. If he didn't, though, getting sent off for grabbing the ref is unforgiveable. Can forgive him for not being used to the league but that was a whole new world of stupid. Wanker.

5881~~~
he did, and got sent off for it.

5882~~~
Dont think what he did warranted a red card

5883~~~
Knee jerking ? What annoys me about him isn't his poor form - it's his poor work ethics. And besides it's not a case of a 4-5 match poor run - it's a case of 4-5 months bad run.

5884~~~
You can't even make your point to the ref anymore.. Both legs were bleeding but no, that's not enough 

You are either with Di Maria or get the feck out..

5885~~~
He is discontinuous and full of fears as well

5886~~~
Seeing it again it really didn't look that bad, he grabs his shirt to hold him up and carry on talking to him. Silly thing to do but hardly worth an immediate yellow. Oliver had it in for him all night, he went down incredibly easily but it was no different to the way Sanchez had been buying free kicks from him all night. A slight hand on the shoulder, a grab of the wrist. One is a free kick the other is a yellow card for diving apparently.

5887~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5888~~~
Really timid player

5889~~~
We really aren't though. Which is sad enough. God I miss Nani

5890~~~
Say goodbye to any semblance of creativity then. Even though more than half the things he tries don't come off, there's at least two or three chances he creates every game. As he did in this one and another moment where fellaini chests it down in the box but overhits the pass to Young.

There are a few who just aren't cut out to give calm analysises after a high octane match.

5891~~~
Had he ever played as RW before?

5892~~~
It was a dive. And he put his hands on the ref. Like it or not, you can't do that in football. Complete and utter red card. Moron.

5893~~~
Not this again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. He should play left back, that's his best position. It's never his fault.

5894~~~
Yes. A lot.

5895~~~
He was booked for the dive.

5896~~~
Maybe he got reprimanded for letting Hart off and told to start handing out punishments in the future.

5897~~~
He hasn't been bad for 4-5 months. As for poor work ethic, he generally keeps making runs all game and we are relying on him being our main offensive outlet so he probably gets a bit of slack when it comes to defending.

Now I'm not at all suggesting that he has been great or that he has lived up to expectations but when you see people posting some of the drivel in this thread then I feel I should defend him.

5898~~~
I am asking a bloody question just answer it

5899~~~
He has always been a diver, was known for it in Spain. Big blow to our top four hopes losing him for a few games now, he is hit and miss but we don't really have anyone else to come into the side who can add the pace we desperately need.

5900~~~
Christ, get a grip.

5901~~~
Is that why he was sent off? I'm not sure.

5902~~~
I didn't see during match but it is being reported that he got 2nd yellow there not straight red.

5903~~~
Is that sarcasm?

5904~~~
Only has himself to blame. Such a shame as he played well in the first half.

5905~~~
He was booked for the dive but it's unclear as to whether he then got a yellow or a straight red for grabbing Oliver. Cameras didn't seem to catch it.

5906~~~
I'm so massively disappointed in him. Can't remember the last time I was so underwhelmed by a new signing. Falcao's at least only on loan here.

5907~~~
He was definitely booked for the dive. I don't know if Oliver gave him a second yellow or a straight red for the push though.

5908~~~
It was a second yellow not a straight red. Stupid of him, but he was good before that.

5909~~~
He's been poor but there are clear signs of quality, just needs to change his attitude a bit. He clearly has the natural ability to cut it here so let's be patient with him. Also fans need to stop thinking about the 60million quid, he was never worth that amount of money and I said as much at the time. He'll come good lads, let's be patient a bit.

5910~~~
With all the attention on the red card it's easy to forget he was also totally at fault for their first goal. Great cross for the equalizer but he's turning into more of a burden than a genuine match winner for us.

5911~~~
Why does he dive so much? Such a dislikable guy. Hated him at Madrid but warmed around to him when he first arrived but he's been useless in recent weeks.

Yep.

5912~~~
I'll be calmer tomorrow but tonight - he can go to PSG in the summer.

5913~~~
He was already on a yellow when he dived but the ref only got the card out after he grabbed him. Was all a bit confusing.

5914~~~
Hit and miss, looks frustrated with his form and started going down too easily even though he was fouled when he was booked for diving.

5915~~~
Ref is a prissy little bitch, he barely touched him

5916~~~
The commentators had no idea what was going on which made it all a bit confusing, but I think it was Herrera who had got booked for the earlier challenge, not Di Maria. So the yellow the ref showed him for the dive was his first.

5917~~~
He wasn't, Herrera got the yellow in the first half not Di Maria but the two clowns on BBC kept getting mixed up.

5918~~~
Didn't he get a booking for the dive and then a second one for grabbing the ref?

5919~~~
He wasn't on a yellow. Herrera was. He was shown the yellow before he grabbed Oliver. What were you watching?

5920~~~
Unfortunately, it's not easy to forget at all.

5921~~~
Obviously hard to defend his actions leading to the sending off, but he was better today and, for me, he was often our most threatening player amid all the rubbish that was the Newcastle match. 

He's just not the same player playing out wide for 90 minutes. Yes, he whipped in some great crosses and diagonal balls today, but how often have we seen that? 

Up until his moment of madness, the only real hole in his match today was his lack of a right foot. We may very well have had a 3-1 advantage if he was more comfortable with his weaker side. As such (and going back to last season with Real), the fact remains that he's at his best on the left side of a three man midfield (with freedom to roam and run at pace, of course). It's not only that he isn't as comfortable striking a ball with his right, but even moreso that he won't control a ball or dribble on that side. 

Anyway, I know we're all disappointed with his lack of composure tonight.  Sadly, utilizing him still remains a task for the management after he serves his ban.

5922~~~
He got booked for the dive, which is why he grabbed the ref mate

5923~~~
Really?! Well then he's a retard.

5924~~~
He made a mistake,it was silly,maybe in Spain he would get away with it.

5925~~~
Idiotic red card, but thought generally he was looking good with his play. Oh well, 1 step forwards and 2 steps back. Hopefully he can get out of his slump soon. Hopefully he's only banned for one game and not more.

5926~~~
Not an improvement on Nani

5927~~~
I think the yellow you're referring to was the Herrera yellow in the first half. They showed that Di Maria had gotten it but they corrected it afterwards.

5928~~~
Oh right. Di Maria is a moron, so. Wanker. Like I said.

5929~~~
So how much did you value him at Real Madrid then?  there are clear signs of quality in almost every player, we are talking about the best outfield player in the team

5930~~~
He wasn't on a yellow. Herrera was the one booked for the challenge where they both went in on an Arsenal player at the same time.

5931~~~
The ref was following the rules of the game, and rightfully sent him off.

5932~~~
Cheating twat, how many times has he rolled around looking for fouls this season? 

I'd happily take a loss on him at this point as long as we can recoup the majority of his transfer fee. Not Knee jerk either, he has frankly been shocking for us.

5933~~~
He's an idiot alright, you just don't do that but I genuinely feel he was playing well before that.

5934~~~
I'm sorry, but his antics piss me off so much I'm almost at the point of wanting to get rid. What a stupendous red card, and his diving is a fecking disgrace. He has been pretty much useless for months, the odd assist aside.

5935~~~
Then the rules are ridiculous.

5936~~~
Played well tonight but needs to get his head out of his ass, this is the EPL not La Liga what he did all night driving with the idiotic end of all cost us the match.. And on my birthday Di Maria you owe big time..

5937~~~
Said it a few times already, but he was quite good at times tonight. Arguably our most effective attacker in the first half.

5938~~~
Should give some of our "fans" sth to think. Nani was two or three levels above Di Maria (atm).

5939~~~
Diving and rolling around crying when there's no need. Nani with less balls.

5940~~~
Bringing to think that the Di Maria that is playing for United is clone from the planet Zorge and the real one has been whisked away, because the one we have has not a clue how to play football

5941~~~
He got 2 yellows, I'm 99% sure of that. First for the dive, second for messing with the ref. I thought they showed he got a yellow on TV (instead of Herrera), so maybe they mixed it up.

5942~~~
Was he £60million good though? It's more his diving and rolling around pointlessly that annoys me, rather than his performances tbh.

5943~~~
Two yellows apparently, so no 3+ matches of suspension, just one.

5944~~~
Oh no, not at all, he's been absolutely nowhere near justifying his hefty price tag. Just think some of the criticism about his performances have arguably been a bit excessive today when it's been one of his better performances.

5945~~~
He's incredibly stupid, but this has similarities with the outrage at Rooney when he got a red card earlier in the season. "Should've sold him in the summer", "will never be captain material", "letting his team mates down again". Fast forward a few weeks and people realised he'd simply made a mistake and it's possible to move on from it.

Having said that, what an absolute complete retard he is. Just hopes he starts showing his first half form today more often when he returns.

5946~~~
Straw that broke the camels back.

5947~~~
Dive if your gonna lose possession but not for the sake of getting a free kick! He has pissed me off tonight and if he doesn't sort himself out he can feck off, we will be lucky to get £30m at this rate!

5948~~~
Not really

5949~~~
Possibly. Either way I don't really blame him. It's hardly a Nani vs Madrid situation. It's one of those that we could've easily gotten away with and no one would've cared, but that you also can't really complain that we didn't. He touched him, the ref was in that kind of mood, c'est la vie. It's certainly unappealable.

5950~~~
Totally at fault? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Really? Not anything to do with Smalling and Valencia completely losing their heads,or our other defenders letting Chamberlain casually stroll between them as easy as you like. It's <b>totally</b> the fault of Di Maria not tracking the full back?

5951~~~
How many TOP teams would actually want to sign Di Maria? we are stuck with him for a while, might aswell expect good performances, i haven't seen an overall outstanding performance form him since the Everton game and that was 25 matches ago

5952~~~
Yes really

5953~~~
A player is supposed to touch the referee in that manner? (forgive how sexual this sounds)

5954~~~
Next season cant come quick enough. Angel will bounce back. He reminds me of Fellaini in a way, you know when both are having bad games, they dont hide. Any one see Mesut Ozil tonight?

5955~~~
If someone was so damn ignorant as to turn their back on me and walk away while I was talking to them I'd grab them as well.

5956~~~
Pathetic.
Himself and Januzaj can both apologise for shaming the club tonight or both can feck off in the summer.

5957~~~
It's a real shame for him because he was having his best game for ages. The going down easily and acting like he's had both his legs sawed off each time is incredibly annoying, but still it wasn't a booking considering the precedent the ref set for the game with Welbeck/Sanchez. The grab was silly but not as bad as being made out, and nowhere near as bad as Oliver's fanny reaction made it seem. 

This will really set him back again though. Probably with the fans too they will be on his back more than ever. Not a pretty situation at this point.

5958~~~
disgraceful. can't believe we have this kind of player. So many ridiculous dives and rolling around, someone should have a word with him soon

5959~~~
Well yeh, if Di Maria had tracked his man they wouldn't have scored. Valencia was out of position but it was Di Maria's man who strolled past him

5960~~~
Played well, better than he has for ages, obviously then backed it up by getting sent off. Not his year so far is it? Still class though and is too good to struggle for much longer.

5961~~~
Chill the feck up.  We only have two players who can take on their defender. By these standards Young should have committed suicide long ago.

5962~~~
Yes. Basics of playing on the wing. A pub player wouldn't get away with that shit.

5963~~~
He was pathetic.

5964~~~
He wasn't totally at fault, but he was at fault.

5965~~~
Yes, not a referee though

5966~~~
What's the point in taking on a defender if you're going to dive once you're past him?
When was the last time either of them taking someone on led to a goal?

You might be OK with United players diving but I'm not. I hold our players to higher standards and have no interest in watching divers in the shirt.

5967~~~
I thought overall he had a decent game, until the and sending off.

5968~~~
Absolutely he should have. I was laughing at the 'totally' at fault claim, considering the farcical defending from everybody that was on display in that goal. Which they also don't teach as far as I'm aware. Or maybe that's why England is so behind at grassroots level <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nor would they have scored if any of the other defenders had done their job would they? If any one of the three players relaxing near Ox had tackled him would they have scored? Obviously not.

5969~~~
Somebody tell him please he is not playing in fecking la liga. Too easy to go down and lose his head easIly

5970~~~
Agreed, he was quite good. A bit heavy on the diving and grabbing of ref jerseys but other wise he also created our goal from next to nothing.

5971~~~
Yes a referee too, the fa can't expect players to respect refs when they don't respect players, never mind grabbing him, should have smacked the smug tosser

5972~~~
Probably his best performance in a few months up to getting sent off.
Diving in that position with the ball at your feet is stupid, no defence. Stay the feck on your feet. 
That goes double for januzaj who was in an even better position.
His reaction to a deserved booking was idiotic.

On the goal ... i would have thought smalling should have stuck with him?
Not really sure on how a cb should react in that situation. Di maria isn't the kind of player to be entirely reliable in that regard.

5973~~~
I haven't been as angry with a player since Antonio Valencia decided to feck up a perfectly simple back pass to David De Gea. So not that long ago, then.

He actually played well going forward tonight, but his horrendous tracking back and stupid red card blankets that. Out for an important game against Spurs, too. Idiot.

5974~~~
I hate the diving. I wouldn't kick them out of the club for them though. I'd kick out the manager first, who's ruined their confidence by either playing them out of position or not playing them at all.

5975~~~
I get what your saying and it did look a bit calamitous, but in the first half we were staying tights and pressing hard with aggressive tackling and the only free arsenal man was Di Maria's, Angel was literally just stood still watching the game.

5976~~~
Ok

5977~~~
Didn't pick up monreal's run for his goal when Valencia got sucked in, also gave the ref the chance to send him off other the those two big feck ups he did ok

5978~~~
It's really hard to like him isn't it? Just as well I don't think he will be staying for long with us.

5979~~~
LVG on BBC was very honest regarding Di Maria . Guessing he was given the hairdryer.

5980~~~
Will he miss Sundays game then? Chance for Mata maybe, although the lack of pace in the side will be depressing.

5981~~~
He has been going from bad to worse over the past few months. Its like his moral is abysmal in FM and we cant do anything to improve his morale or his performances.

5982~~~
When he played for Real, I saw him as the Suarez of that league. They almost look like they could be related? He's been playing below par too long to act like a fecking diva now. 

Di Maria: Man up (you don't have to change your name, just don't whine like a little bitch when the ref is spot on)

5983~~~
Good thing you're not a football player then, because you'd be sent off all the fecking time.

5984~~~
Nah, after a few broken noses I'd have refs running scared <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5985~~~
It's only 70% for the diving. It's 30% for playing shite. 

Young has redeemed himself somwhat by not diving in a long time and putting in consistently good performances. Had he been sold last year I would not have shed a single tear.

If Di Maria and Januzaj aren't sold and put in several months worth of good performances, without diving, I'll get back on board.
But sod backing underperforming, overpaid and immature idiots who can't keep control of their emotions on the pitch.

Januzaj has played 46 times for Man Utd. He's been booked for diving 5 times. He probably could have seen 3 or 4 more cards in that time.

5986~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5987~~~
Should have spat on the floor near him.

5988~~~
The guy is obviously an idiot, but he seems to be the only one that creates anything in the last few games and we have a must win game with Spurs in the weekend. We are fecked in the one that comes in for him is Falcao. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5989~~~
But does the club fine players who get suspended for doing stupid stuff ? like Di Maria today

5990~~~
We have Mata, maybe he'll get a game.. maybe

5991~~~
I want to see how he plays in his next few games.
It could be that this red card is the start of a resurgence - who knows?

I doubt he will be sold in the Summer - he will get next year to prove himself. Earlier in this thread, other people pointed out that there are some players who take time to settle in, as opposed to giving instant impact. Perhaps Di Maria is one of these players.

He's made a mistake today and he knows it. LvG will almost certainly give him a rollicking for it and Di Maria will accept it.
Lets move on and hope that Di Maria goes on to become the best footballer in the EPL next season.

5992~~~
Sell him if he doesn't want to be here.

5993~~~
To who?

5994~~~
My gut feeling is that Falcao is done at this club. Too many other players are now ahead of him.
Playing with Falcao is like playing with 10 men, and I'm sorry Falcao, but one good touch against Sunderland isnt enough to save your Man Utd career.

I think Januzaj or Mata will replace Di Maria, while he serves his suspension.

5995~~~
PSG? It would probably be at a loss

5996~~~
<a class="username" data-user="4448, @devilish" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4448/">@devilish</a>
He played 90% of his madrid career at right wing.

5997~~~
In which team? Our team? Certainly isn't playing like it. I'd say he's a 35million quid player at the most.

5998~~~
PSG are also looking to rebuild and get rid of the deadwood in their team, i don't think they would want him tbh, but the french ligue might suit him - we won't get more than £30m though

5999~~~
Great cross for the goal. Was his usual awful self aside from that though, with the added bonus of getting sent off.

6000~~~
So Mendes made us pay an extra £25m and give him our #7 shirt? back in September it seemed like we had the best transfer window ever, its looking more and more like we got ripped off and I'm not just talking about Di Maria

6001~~~
If it was actually an option and we received a £60 million bid from PSG i'd bite their hand off. Get someone in who's passionate about playing for the badge.

6002~~~
If you didn't know what he had done last year for Madrid - and you thought we had bought him for £500k from Dagenham - you could believe it on tonights performance. 
One good cross all night, plus a sending off - even if the sending off was somewhat understandable.
How a £60m player cannot go down the wing and cross with his right foot is facking incredible. LVG has facked him.

6003~~~
Hes left footed....

6004~~~
I am not even mad at him. I can't be as I have already wasted all my energy by being mad at LvG's negativity, his subs and above all him playing Fellaini ahead of much more gifted players.
I'd still much rather watch Di Maria than Fellaini who really wouldn't be playing for any other top team, especially not as a plan A.

6005~~~
he was actually having a decent game until the red card incident - probably his best game all year in fact

6006~~~
Di Arrhea more like.

6007~~~
I reckon PSG would easily give us at least £45 million for him still if Woody and LVG decide that they want to cash in. Reputations aren't lost that quickly unless players look absolutely physically past it. Di Maria is still a very good player going through a very rough patch, and I'm sure he is still considered a world class player on the continent.

6008~~~
I don't think PSG would waste £45 million on Di Maria

6009~~~
Was ok in the first half. Nothing special, though. Apart from the assist, he was easily dispossessed again, and fecked us over when he got sent off.

6010~~~
No way. Not even close. Has had maybe two or three really good games this season. Tonight was not one of them. And that's before the stupid red card.

6011~~~
I didnt say this season, I said this year

6012~~~
It is PSG we're talking about here. Plus who's to say it would even be a waste, he might hit the ground running there and play up to the standards he set in his last season at Real which made us buy him for absurd money in the first place.

6013~~~
Massive overreactions on her as per the norm.

Sell Di Maria, Sack LVG. Give me strength.

6014~~~
Yeah I reckon they would, not that I want him gone at this point, but if he can't settle down and get himself sorted pretty soon then it might be the best thing for him.

It boggles the mind to think we are paying a guy to play for another team in Portugal who could probably have done twice the job Di Maria has this season.

6015~~~
I surely don't need to remind you what they did in the market last summer?

6016~~~
Oh right. The definition of faint praise. I thought he had a better game against Preston fwiw.

6017~~~
We should probably be celebrating a second successive season without silverware

6018~~~
Yes, it's not like real unhappiness at Di Maria's form and LvG's management have been simmering for a while or anything, is it? It must all be knee-jerkism.

6019~~~
He was definitely good in the first half. Not brilliant, but he was hitting in some very nice crosses and of course one of them got him an assist. Faded out in the second half admittedly, and then had his stupid incident.

6020~~~
Luiz offers a whole lot more than Di Maria to a team, he is a utility player - he should be nowhere near a £50m price tag though, and having wasted that much on one player and with the FFP rules and all i don't think they would waste £45m on a one footed winger

6021~~~
It's difficult to win stuff. There are better teams than us right now. Selling Di Maria after not even one season is just a ludicrous idea.

6022~~~
Was looking much better tonight.  Ok, maybe he could of filled in for Valencia on the first goal, but I don't really have any defensive expectations from him.  Cross for the goal was perfect.  Shame that he went on to cost us the chance to at least force a replay.  Hardly giving us value for money but I'm sure it'll come.

6023~~~
Hopefully not, which is why they will offer us Matuidi or Marquinos and some cash (wishful thinking of course).

6024~~~
Goes from bad to worse, even when i didnt think it was possible. Still expecting him to turn it round but does he have the mentality? Think he works better with a star player taking the lime light off him.

6025~~~
For an attacking player of his price-tag, he doesn't nearly threaten the goal enough either. He is clumsy and nervous when in shooting positions, thus more likely to score the odd brilliant goal as opposed to be a regular scorer. Oh if only we had gotten Sanchez and Arsenal had gotten him instead!

6026~~~
Dream scenario, i rate those players highly

6027~~~
Let it continue to simmer then. No one has any patience anymore. It's this sense of entitlement that gets me. 

We can be disappointed in Di Maria's diving or whatever, but seriously proposing to sell him after not even one season? That is knee jerk.

6028~~~
Van gaal's poor man management is not helping his case. He was bound to snap like that sooner or later

6029~~~
He doesn't look like he will be here much longer, so why not shop for possible buyers now - we would probably get half of the money we spent right now, i'm not against him staying .... i just wouldn't want a scenario where he would spend 5 years in the team based on his reputation and not present performance

6030~~~
Lets hope its a good snap

6031~~~
Personally I didnt think he was having a good game even before he was sent off. He did put in a couple of good crosses when he got the ball onto his left foot, that much is true, but he was very one dimensional, sloppy in possession and left Valencia isolated on several occasions.

6032~~~
He's like a skinny little boy playing in the big boy's team.

He needs to bulk up and man up, or else he will never be able to replicate his La Liga form in the Premier League.

6033~~~
He def doesn't need to bulk up.

6034~~~
I think he was involved in all but one of our goal scoring opportunities in the first half.
He wasn't brilliant, but he was decent. I agree with regards to the defensive duties though.

6035~~~
He needs to get his fecking head in gear and realise you can't take as much out of the ball as he does. The amount of times he just blindly sprints into an opposition player is pretty staggering for someone supposed to be a top footballer.

6036~~~
The first goal was on him, zero awareness.

The dive was shameful, and the red card was fully deserved, it's a shame because i had a feeling he's going to bounce back after that beautiful assist, but he's a moron and i hope the club fines him for that.

6037~~~
As good as he's managed to play for us in a while. Was responsible for most of our attacks, and got an assist. Very stupid to get sent off, but an improvement I think.

6038~~~
Thing is, we might not even have a choice about selling him - I think he might be pretty committed to leaving. He hasn't settled, his family are terrified and hate England after being burgled, his form is crap, he's getting loads of stick, and he feels victimised by referees.

6039~~~
You just know whether it's when he finishes, or if he does move on sooner than expected, he'll be asked that age-old question "when was your least enjoyable time in football?" and his response will be Manchester United. His worst manager - Van Gaal. I think the latter will be the case for a lot of these players. They don't seem enthused at all.

6040~~~
I don't know what's up with him.

When he first joined he was like a mile ahead of his teammates. Now he seems to be playing more like Valencia and Young. Never seems to take players on too.

6041~~~
Good coaching...

6042~~~
Does anyone know how long he'll be out for?

6043~~~
does he even lift?

6044~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6045~~~
1 game apparently

6046~~~
Great. Missing the Spurs game, just what we need<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

6047~~~
Even if he wants to leave, he must realise that playing utterly shite isn't going to get him a good move. He would want to show some decent form.

6048~~~
You just have this feeling after looking at our fixtures that this thread will be very active, well this and the "bye bye top 4"thread

6049~~~
If he thinks footballers are not burgled in other countries, he is mistaken. If he thinks he's the first professional footballer to get burgled, he is mistaken. He better sort his own shit out and start growing a pair, or he can bet he will end up in a shittier hole than Manchester after all other big clubs are very likely to say no to him.

6050~~~
He was half decent in the first half (though his runs down blind alleys aren't half annoying... as is his knack of dribbling forward and somehow forgetting to take the ball with him) - but kept acting like a bit of a bellend with his constant rolling around and what not - culminating in his grand stage of idiocy and getting sent off.

He needs to sort his shit out... or LVG does, either way...

6051~~~
His awareness isn't very good, his brain isn't very good I'd say (definitely not good enough for a midfielder). That's nothing new but at Real he was making up for it with constant running, chasing, pressing. He doesn’t seem to be that player right now, not sure if van Gaal wants him to be our main offensive threat or he just isn’t interested.

6052~~~
For me, no more superstar signings. Just get good technically proficient players with a strong mentality, who will give their all for the club. We haven't got time for egos.

6053~~~
Disagree tbh, I think hes on a different wavelength to most of our players, which is why he ends up creating the majority of our chances.
His execution though lately has been off, poor at times. Even when playing deeper, he seems to be one of the few who can pick out the forwards runs of RVP/Rooney/Falcao.

6054~~~
That’s not what I said. I said his awareness isn’t good, that’s why he loses the ball a lot, and isn’t contributing much in destruction. He was a different players last season for Madrid.

His long range passing from deep areas is something he’s been very good at recently, but that would be all I guess.

6055~~~
In all honesty, most clubs would take him in a second. Especially as we'd be selling for less than we bought. He's a world class player, quite literally. Just needs to stop rolling about like a pansy every time he gets touched.

Ronaldo did the same thing when he first came here. Januzaj is still doing it. Just would have expected Di Maria to know better considering he's 27.

6056~~~
Awareness to spot the runs that others don't... Anyway I think I know what you mean. However the difference is that in THIS team, he feels the pressure to be the one who creates, and thus he seems to force it at times, hold the ball too long, I don't think hes playing well, but his sending off was unfortunate as I think we'll struggle to create without him

6057~~~
He's as one footed as Valencia but cost 4 times as much.

Watching him is incredibly frustrating and not entertaining in the slightest. Replacing him on the wing with the utterly ineffectual Januzaj had me kicking my table with frustration.

6058~~~
I generally agree with you, but what I said was only about his defensive contribution, which is non-existent. He still creates though.

6059~~~
Think he can be a good player for us eventually.  
Needs to strengthen up and cut the bullshit out, but he isn't someone we should be getting rid of in a hurry and is certainly the least of our problems at the moment.

6060~~~
Should be dropped for a while now I think.

6061~~~
Did the ref give him a second yellow for the shirt tug? If so then it will only be a 1 match ban, if it was a straight red for the shirt tug then it could be a 3 match ban. I think Di Maria is looking worryingly lightweight for the PL right now.

6062~~~
Precisely. He is world class at what he does, and that is to create chances. That cross for Rooney's goal was top notch.

6063~~~
Going to be a big miss for the Spurs game, only player who could feed Rooney.

6064~~~
Actually quite sad that after spending £150m in the summer, there is only 1 player in the team who can feed our main striker

6065~~~
Don't think there was anything lightweight about him today though. His red card will get all the headlines obviously and it was idiotic, but it was a silly mistake, nothing more. His actual performance was much better then in recent weeks and in the first half at least he was very dangerous and making plenty of chances. A shame how it panned out and it will for sure set his confidence back more after looking better earlier in the game, but I don't think it shows he can or can't cut it in the premier league. He'll be fine long term, we just need to play more like we did in the first half more often and he'll be fine. The second half showed he can't have much of an impact if he hardly gets the ball and if we revert to passing it around very slowly and doing a lot more long balls.

6066~~~
I think a majority of posters in here are choosing to forget that once again, he was one of the few players tonight that actually looked threatening. Are people completely ignoring his assist? Or all the great runs he made? He was the only one that looked like making something happening. 

Was his dive stupid? Yes, it wasn't very smart of him and I think that's a condition of him playing in La Liga for so long. But people are seemingly basing his entire performance tonight solely on the dive, which is nonsense. He <i>will </i>adapt to the league and he <i>is</i> a world class player. 

Some of you are just so fickle and childish.

6067~~~
I think it was his best game in a long time. Stupid to get sent off, but people claiming he was poor are just wrong. Other than Chamberlain, he was arguably the best player on the pitch tonight.

6068~~~
Yep. Though unfortunately that was one of the key moments of the game and is what will be remembered. He did show plenty of positives though I thought, it's just you can't ignore the stupidity of the red card.

6069~~~
And he usually is.

6070~~~
Well, in fairness, he's been pretty poor recently. Good tonight, but his form dropped massively after his start to the season. Our worst player in the two games before tonight.

He'll get there eventually, but he's capable of a lot more.

6071~~~
I realize that it cannot be ignored, but some people are acting like he committed some murder or something. I'm more angry at Januzaj's dive to be honest, considering he was clear on goal.

But yes, I can understand the anger over Di Maria's dive since it was during an important moment.

6072~~~
I just think he looks unsure of taking his fullback on as he doesn't want to get clattered or fight for the ball, the tenacity we saw in the early games seems to have disappeared and he doesn't look like he fancies digging in.

6073~~~
Yeah. Many on here are so quick to jump on his back though. No patience at all to wait and give him time to show what he can actually do... Everyone just seemed like insecure little girls about his transfer since day 1 though. Like he was "too good" for us, and that he didn't actually want to be here so they resent him because of these preconceived notions and are quick to criticize him and don't even give him a proper chance. He has obviously been well below par, but even then, he's still our most dangerous player on the ball and makes far more chances then anyone else we have or have had the last few seasons. Yet everyone is so quick to want him dropped.

6074~~~
I think he's the only player <i>instructed</i> to feed the striker - as our midfielders seem to be taught to be cautious in possession.

6075~~~
I wish I can be as optimistic as you are. It's just that his decline in performances has been so steep, and I don't like the way he thinks he is victimized. I mean: he's 27, he has more than enough footballing experience for not falling into traps for beginners, and that includes facing different styles in La Liga and on the international stage. When a player is a "young veteran", you would expect him to know better and I'm sure everyone expected better from him.

His pass for Rooney was great, no one will take that away from him. Still, I want him to play and act like a true young veteran, nothing less.

6076~~~
I think when he's on the right he just likes cutting in all the time as he's not comfortable on his right foot at all. It's a real question mark where his best position is and he has to do more individually but I can't help but feel our tactics are stifling him a lot. We put in so many crosses every game because we have Fellaini up top so it's like we tell him to cut in and cross it into Fellaini every time, there's very little variation. Same with Young on the other side, though he's more two footed (but did nothing today tbf). I'm not sure what his best position is, but we should look for where he'll be the most consistent. Which IMO is probably the left flank with the freedom to roam inwards. There he can go on the outside or cut in and do outside of the foot passes which he loves doing anyways. On the right he pretty much always cuts in, which he can be devastating at like against Germany at the start of the season, or on occasion for Madrid, but is far too inconsistent because his shot when he cuts in isn't that great.

6077~~~
I think he's good tonight.People need to forget the price tag.I reckon if Ronaldo is back this season he will have plenty of shit matches also.

When too many players with obvious/proven ability failed at the same time in a same team,you know who's the one to blame.

6078~~~
Where to play him is a big conundrum, I think LvG feels he is too weak to play as part of the midfield 3, but as you say on the right wing he becomes very predictable and I think LvG is hoping to turn him into Robben. The worry with playing him on the left is that he doesn't seem to like it and I've not seen him have a good game on that flank since his Benfica days.

6079~~~
It was 100% 2 yellow cards, so just the 1 game ban. Still can't believe he was that stupid. His rolling around pissed me off quite a few times today.

6080~~~
Ramsey places his hand on Di Maria, and its a dive.
Di Maria places his hand on the referee, and its a yellow.

6081~~~
Just take the handbrakes off him and let him take some chances. The 2nd half approach completely neutered the team.

6082~~~
He deserved his second yellow and did leave us playing 10 vs 11. However, my main concern is that he will never make a 60 million quid winger, as he is a world-class midfielder. LvG is not using his most gifted player efficiently and is basically limiting him.

6083~~~
He's allowed to do whatever he likes. He's got a free role and free creativity. He tries risky passes, he goes through the middle, the left and the right. What more freedom can you give him?

He needs to step his performances up and man up a bit. It's a tough league, get used to it.

6084~~~
thanks

It kinds of strange. Never seen him play there. There again, I dont follow real very much

6085~~~
To be fair, if I was van Gaal and saw how often he was giving the ball away I'd be hesitant to play him in CM too (his best position apparently). But he has a free role in this wing position anyway, he just needs to improve.

6086~~~
He doesn't want to leave.

For some reason our fans seem to get on his back after every loss when he was the only player that tried to risk and create something.

6087~~~
I don't think he wants to leave either, I was just saying <i>if </i>he did want to.

Fans get on his back because he has been crap. I understand he is trying to create but that is his job. He also gives the ball away too much, dives, rolls around on the ground, makes the wrong decision etc etc.

6088~~~
If he was English and from our youth academy he'll be applauded. 

I mean Welbeck dived, scored and celebrated a goal against us and got that treatment.

6089~~~
I thought he was having a decent game, up until that moment of stupidity. 
He has all the ability in the world. Needs to man up and just concentrate on his football.

6090~~~
He's got it in him to be a decisive player in the biggest games. We saw that at Real Madrid. He was the motm in the CL final after all. He fluffed his lines yesterday though. Seems bereft of all confidence and belief in himself. Had 2-3 good chances to make the difference but in the end his actions removed every chance we had of getting back into the game. I may be reading into things too deeply but he doesn't seem comfortable or happy here and it's affecting his performances. At half time I said I hope he's subbed off for Januzaj. My Dad said he needs a goal and we should keep him on. Hindsight and all that but I wish we had done the former.

6091~~~
If we want him to be a decisive player, we have to surround him with even better player. With Argentina he has Aguero and Messi next to him, Higuain scoring goals, Tevez, Mascherano behind, Zabaleta making runs etc.... 

At Madrid he had Modric and Alonso, and up front the BBC.

Then he can ride and run like a headless chicken. If he manage a good cross, there's a goal, if he loses the ball, there is a shield behind

He is so poor at the moment. He costed us 75M this summer ! And he doesn't produce anything, his transfer is an absolute failure

The facts is that he's been paid that much and doesn't produce enough from a player of this caliber

6092~~~
Di Maria does not seem to be wanting to leave. He does, however, seem to be uncomfortable in that winger position, provided that his full back does not offer much of overlap. Playing in the center opens Angel twice as much space and opportunities to use his skills. I am not using this an excuse to justify his yesterday's performance, he let us down that is for sure. Nevertheless, if we want to see the best of Di Maria, he needs to play centrally, he is fantastic there.

6093~~~
Jesus, all this kneejerking <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yes, the dive and then pulling the refs shirt was stupid, but the reactions in here are way, way over the top.

Noone would deny he hasnt lived up to the expectations. But he has 4 goals and 11 assists this season. Which is pretty damn good considering how shite we have been. He is also our most talented player by some marigin and people want him gone? Get a grip

6094~~~
He was good last night. Silly decision doesn't change that.

6095~~~
Just saw Di Maria's red card. Anyone who thinks that wasn't a dive has got to be watching a different game. That minor tug at the wrist had nothing to do with his tumble. That's a clear dive. When Matic was sent off against Burnley, I could understand why the player shoved Barnes to the ground. That challenge was indeed horrendous. In Di Maria's case, he had no reason to pull the ref's shirt as if the decision was atrocious. Twat. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6096~~~
It was very stupid, but he played a good match imo, played some brilliant crosses, took on players and he shifted play from side to side frequently.

6097~~~
Thanks for showing us the light.

6098~~~
Rentboy?

6099~~~
Tbh the way I see it is that his reaction to the ref was all about pressure and frustration. I think if he were left alone to get used to things he would eventually be fine. At Madrid, I would say Ronaldo for e.g. is the main focal point for the press and fans. Here he hasn't got anyone to hide behind - he's the focal point here - and it's difficult for him. Also think he's quite sensitive and the constant bashing in the stupid press does not help. He needs to obviously step up with his game, but he also needs support, not being bashed by the fans as well. In short, I can see how things would get to him.

6100~~~
Big players are there for a reason, to keep their heads when things are not going well. Funny that Rooney the hot head kept his cool, while the fannies decided to lose it on the day. Our players actually  did what I normally expect from Arsenal players when they play us or Chelsea [roll about on the floor crying for non-existent freekicks, Fellaini was big as he is actually got in on the act]. Rojo was kicking everyone and was lucky not to be sent off etc. And then, your top player, whom you expect a little bit of magic from somehow gets himself sent off with a moment of high level thickness. Apart from the baffling subs, the level of stupidity shown by our players yesterday and sometimes this season is worrying me.

6101~~~
he's always had the diving and playacting in him and it comes to the fore when things arent going well. He had a great season last year and it was almost non existant but now he's struggling all the old tricks are coming out.
in a way the sending off might do him some good, maybe he'll learn he wont get away with it as much over here, i dunno
Its a shame as he played pretty well compared to other more recent performances

6102~~~
I still wish we would have bought Alexis instead but I have faith that ADM will be much better next season once he hits the weights with Valencia.

6103~~~
He really wasn't good at all. One great cross doesn't change that.

6104~~~
An incredibly frustrating player to watch. I mean, even Nani actually remembers to take the ball with him when he goes on his random dribble/trick-shows.

6105~~~
Who is having an absolute blinder of a season btw

6106~~~
True, he was really bad, Sanchez took the piss the few times he faced him. ADM looks completely shot in terms of confidence, he has zero goalscoring instinct and threat too. The good chances he had, I never expected him to seriously test the keeper never mind score goals. He is just not good nor consistent enough to be our main player.

6107~~~
Except he forced a decent save in the first half, and pulled a shot wide in the second?
I dont think he had a great game, but <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>  to say all he did was one good cross is not true tbh.

6108~~~
I meant even if when he has chances, you don't get ready to celebrate the possible goal because you know he isn't ruthless. No real expectation to see him hit the net.

6109~~~
Ah I agree on that part, its an apect of his game he needs to improve (finishing), although I don't think hes as bad as you say tbh

6110~~~
It's the lack of effort that drives me crazy. He keeps doing this thing where he reacts to getting dispossessed by doing a little flounce, instead of chasing after the player who tackled him. Couldn't be more different to Sanchez in his attitude, which goes a long way to explaining the difference in their seasons so far. 

It's even more frustrating when you consider he came to us as a player willing to run himself into the ground for the cause. There's been glimpses of that work-rate (especially in the early weeks) but he's looked less and less bothered about putting a shift in. Which is unforgiveable IMO.

6111~~~
That "decent save" was a selfish and stupid decision. He just needed to roll it to Rooney for a tap in.

6112~~~
I'll just say your not being balanced in your view, and leave it there. I get it thought everyone is fraustrated with him, me too btw.

6113~~~
Even Ozil was working hard last night, he recovered a ball he lost stupidly. When Mesut does that and Di Maria doesn't, like you said, there are reason to go crazy.
The worst part for me is when he is on the ground, acting as if a bomb destroyed his leg, abandoning his teammates when everyone and himself included know that he won't get the FK. That's also unforgivable for me.

6114~~~
he's an incredibly frustrating player and always has been. I'm surprised more people weren't aware of this when he came here.

6115~~~
Lack of effort is the frustrating thing, the rest like you said, was the norm.

6116~~~
I'm more annoyed by him not tracking Monreal than his red card to be honest. I can understand a heat of the moment decision, but losing your marker like that is inexcusable

6117~~~
But the ratio - at least from when I watched Madrid last year and in the World Cup - was something like 80/20 great to shit... now it's the inverse, and its diabolical to fairly decent.

6118~~~
Not sure I'd call it lack of effort. He failed to track back for the first goal, yeah, but overall I think his workrate was good. People seem to be turning on him and thus focusing on this lack of effort, but I haven't noticed anything different than from his Real days or early games here. He wasn't bought for his defensive qualities.

6119~~~
The same Di Maria who gave away the ball 51 times vs Switzerland before scoring ? He is nowhere near an 80/20 player..

6120~~~
Was it feck. There was one WC game (Algeria maybe?) where he had an abysmal performance only to score the winner in the 107th minute or something. I agree in the big games for Real last season he was mostly great, but that was in a great side and his confidence was as high as it could be. It's an altogether very different scenario for him this season.

Seriously, he's always been unbelievably frustrating, I said it as soon as he got here that if Nani frustrated people on here, Di Maria would too.

6121~~~
I meant more for Madrid to be fair, I remembered one World Cup where he was really good, so that's why I threw that in there.

6122~~~
It is clear for me that at Real, he was performing better in that particular aspect. He wasn't bought for his defensive qualities indeed but there is a minimum to expect from any player, like make a little effort when you get stupidly dispossessed.

6123~~~
I think it goes back to the believing his own hype theory... now he's not the wheel in a cog of stars anymore, he's the star himself (or he thinks he is) - thus doesn't need to track back.

6124~~~
He always seems to take the fanny option. Rather than running at his man and risking getting hurt, he prefers to take an unnecessary touch out of harms way or play a Hollywood ball. When it works it's brilliant, but far too often it doesn't. 

He needs to either bulk up or grow a pair. It's incredibly obvious that he's shit scared of English football at the moment.

6125~~~
He was great on the left of a the middle three featuring two of the best midfielders in the world. he was also pretty damn good there when he first came here, then he got injured, then LvG decided to use him up front, which didn't work, so he used him on the left, which didn't work, so now he's on the right, which isn't working. All the while his confidence is getting more and more shot, we're playing worse and worse, and he's, unsurprisingly, becoming more and more frustrating to watch again.

LvG logic, buy a player for 60m that you say you need, use him correctly, he plays well, then decide, feck this, I don't like him here, so err .. I'll play him everywhere but here, and he goes to shit.

6126~~~
That's the system though, that's how LvG does it. Di Maria is one of the special four who have creative freedom. I don't believe he's suddenly decided not to make the effort anymore. I think that's just people making excuses to get pissed off at him for his poor form.

6127~~~
He was certainly talked up as an incredibly hard worker when we signed him.

6128~~~
Going forward, yes, he definitely is. Tracking back? Not really. That's never been his role. Though when he was being used more so 'box to box' at Real he was pretty damn good at it. He's not being used in that role here though.

6129~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6130~~~
Obviously no player will decide "I'll stop running back to defend" but it is obvious to see, it is happening though. I don't think it has anything to do with the system because ADM is seen as a midfielder/winger like any other at the club, LVG doesn't hesitate to sub him. For a player who would have special treatment, that's weird.

6131~~~
The same LvG who makes the weirdest decisions known to mankind in pretty much every single game we play, you mean? The LvG that bought Di Maria because he said we really needed a great player like him and then actually didn't have a fecking clue how to use him or where to play him once we bought him. 

Personally, and this may sound odd, I think the main reason LvG is subbing him here is cause he wants it to look like Di Maria's the underperforming twat in this situation and it's not down to shambolic management by he himself that his form has dropped to such a terrible level.

6132~~~
Like I said, I'll forgive any player a bad performance. Being stupid and/or lazy is unforgiveable though. Especially a lack of effort, which is the bare minimum we should expect from every footballer. Nothing boils my piss like laziness.

6133~~~
Well, that's one original way of looking at it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The scary thing is that you may be right.

6134~~~
I think you're blinded by dislike if you think there was a lack of effort on his behalf last night.

His red card was inexcusable though.

6135~~~
He has been an underperforming twat though. A reputation he's earned all on his own.

6136~~~
He didn't make much of an effort to get back and defend for their first goal to be fair.

6137~~~
no it's not, as I've already said, LvG is very heavily responsible for his form turning to shit. not completely, but heavily. I also don't see, how aside from that moment of idiocy last night, he's been a 'twat'? Certainly not enough to warrant the abuse you're giving him.

6138~~~
He wouldn't have needed to if the three players covering Monreal and The Ox weren't so fecking awful defensively. It's not like there wasn't enough cover to stop the ball going in. *cough* Valencia.

Not that he shouldn't have tracked back or anything, but I still think the defenders should've dealt with that goal pretty easily.

6139~~~
Persistent diving and exaggerated "injuries" got my goat up but what really wound me up was him making zero effort to do any defensive work (even fecking Mezut Ozil did more to help out his fullback) and the way he would lose the ball and make very little effort to win it back.

6140~~~
I think that was more of a lack of awareness to the danger than lack of effort tbh.

6141~~~
Aside from the goal (which our defenders should've dealt with comfortably) I don't believe that's true.

6142~~~
There was no cover because he was doing his job. Standing within a couple of yards of the player he was supposed to mark. A pity this is evidently an alien concept to Di Maria, what with his man making the most of the acres of space he had to score, under no pressure whatsoever.

6143~~~
Do you know where to get stats for FA cup games? Would be interesting to compare his defensive efforts to Sanchez, Young and Ozil.

6144~~~
Whut? Valencia was right beside Monreal and he inexplicably decided to fly in on Ox instead leaving him wide open. 

Look, Di Maria should definitely have tracked back here, no doubt, but all of their players were still marked, it's not like Monreal was free, he wasn't, not until Valencia had a moment of idiocy.

6145~~~
Good first half, but I'm really annoyed with him for what he did in the second half. Stupid bastard.

6146~~~
Lets be fair, the first goal was a combined effort of shitness from many players... starting with 4 players not wanting to tackle Chamberlain, and then to Valencia/Di Maria.

6147~~~
Our entire front four wasn't defending much most of the game, we were defending with 6 men and after 10s the front four was strolling from the corner of my screen without any urgency, I ended up asking myself if it wasn't an instruction.

6148~~~
Sanchez was Valencia's man. He was following him when he drifted infield. You should never have a situation where a fullback is marking his opposite number.

6149~~~
He was following Sanchez by diving into Ox? 

Didn't do a very good job then.

6150~~~
The defensive shape was also messed up by Smalling charging out of defense on the initial ball and cocking it up. He actually fouls / blocks off Monreal as they run back to the box, then seems to totally forget about his existence and leaves the Arsenal player alone whilst he runs blindly back towards his position, not noticing Valencia has dropped into the centre to cover for his absence so no one is left to defend where a right-back should be.

6151~~~
So he is a player who can play only one position good, right?

If that's the case he's not very good.

And he's excused of tracking back too.

6152~~~
Di Maria should have covered Monreal, but it wasn't actually his man. Smalling was with him, then he left him alone. Its lack of communication Monreal makes the move on the Blind side of Di Maria at first, then Di Maria is slow to react to the danger when he sees him. In honest I don't really think Valencia was at fault, Smalling was out of position and Valencia covered him, Smaling then leaves Monreal on his own to get back to the center, doesn't give Di Maria the shout to cover, Di Maria when he eventually sees Monreal is slow to react.

Its a cluster feck, its not something that you can lay on one player, its lack of defensive organasation and absolutely no commincation between the players there.

6153~~~
Yeah, there was a cluster of errors from United players. The two most heinous were the woeful efforts to tackle Ox at the edge of our box and Di Maria failing to track Monreal. You'd need a serious agenda to try and stick that goal on Valencia.

6154~~~
This is all true but I just think a winger should always know where the opposition fullback is. That's one of the most basic jobs for any winger. Just keep an eye on him. It's not a big ask.

6155~~~
I agree. Out of all of the players involved, Valencia is the least at fault, if at all. He moves into the centre to mark Sanchez and cover for Smalling. Frankly, it comes down to both Smalling and Di Maria totally ignoring Monreal's presence, and the utter lack of defensive communication to let that happen.

6156~~~
You're right, he went to sleep, he was watching the ball rather than looking for Monreal, when he eventually saw him, he was slow to react.
He was at fault, but he wasn't soley at fault is what I was saying. Smalling is as much responsible as he was, why would Smalling run away from Monreal and not shout to Di Maria that he was doing so for instance?

6157~~~
In the first minute he ran at full pelt from one side of the pitch to the other chasing the ball down, and was doing an awful lot of pressing high up the pitch. His tracking back was poor and he is useless at winning the ball back but accusing him of being lazy overall in this game is a strange thing to throw at him.

There were actually a few small positives to build on from last night: he had our 3rd highest passing percentage after Herrera and Jones (something you wouldn't really expect from him), 3 key passes (most on our team), 6/6 accurate long balls and 4 out of 6 crosses found a United head (obviously the assist and a couple of nice ones to Fellaini).
It was a much better performance than we'd seen in recent weeks from him until the craziness of the sending off. Frustrating how easily he hits the deck obviously but he's always been like that.

6158~~~
I believe that moment of madness would be good for him in the long run, at least it showed passion (as stupid as it was), maybe i'm being optimistic but i still think Angel Di Maria will be terrorising defences next season and will go on to become a great player for us 









or a flop who will end up in Estudiantes

6159~~~
They were all out of positions, one player was covering another and in the end it was a disaster. They played defense like I play with my friends on weekend. No communication, just run around to get the first attacking player.

How much games he will get cause of the red and that transforms to the league right?

6160~~~
Talent is there, but needs to improve his attitude. I know it's been hard for him, but we really need to seen an improvement.

6161~~~

Cant help but think the red card might actually be for the Adidas campaign, i mean it started with Diego Costa, Adidas are trying to create rebels to sell their products.

6162~~~
To be honest, I'm not <i>too </i>bothered about the lack of tracking back (though it would be nice to see some effort).  If there's one player in the team who should be justifying being a luxury player who doesn't track back, it's Di Maria.

The problem for me is entirely how awful he is going forwards.  He can still put a decent delivery (which makes me even more baffled as to why Rooney takes every free kick and corner, when he could be in the box looking for goals), but I am genuinely shocked by how bad he is at running at defenders.  I honestly don't think he beat a man once last night, loses the ball every single time.  Even Valencia looks more likely to come out of a challenge with the ball.  
The only unknown when you see ADM approaching an opposition player with the ball is whether he'll chose that moment to do one of his spectacular dives and feign injury, or if he won't be bothered to on that occasion.

6163~~~
And some posters LVG ruined him and turned him into a pub player. 
If he's not good going forward then its not cause of the system. He's just out of form.

6164~~~
He was beating players for fun early in the season. When your form is poor, things don't happen for you. He was starting to take players on a bit again, but hes obv lost some confidence there.

6165~~~
how many games he'll get?

6166~~~
Seriously? Silly me for thinking the Newbies section was off the wall shtupid.

I'm pretty sure burglary thing is causing some portion of his bad form, I suppose his wife must be pretty terrified and that'd reflect on him as well.

6167~~~
See it in few threads, yeah.

6168~~~
Two yellows = one match.

6169~~~
Thanks. 

He then has enough time to get his act together. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6170~~~
His wife hates Manchester, the burglary was the icing on the cake. If I took my missus from Madrid to Manchester and the same things happened to me my missus would be right on my case. So he's getting shit at home, he's struggling at work, he's in a bad place at the moment. You can see it in him.
Unfortunately I think it was a bad move for him and a bad move for us. Shame, but I can see him gone this summer.

6171~~~
I don't mind if he goes tomorrow  if we get what we paid for him. There are many players  suitable for EPL at his position.

6172~~~
We'd most likely get half.

6173~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> some of the reactions here are so ridiculously over the top.

Retard, wanker, should apologise for shaming the club etc, caf hysteria in full overdrive.

6174~~~
I don't think my comments belong in the same category as people calling him a retard or a wanker.
If you think diving isn't something worthy of being embarrassed about fine. I disagree.

6175~~~
only from PSG

6176~~~
I'd agree with that.  Though it could be to do with other aspects of our club - coaching / fitness etc.

We've signed quite a few players for quite a lot of money over the last year and a half, and very few have managed to live up to anything like their ability, which is worrying.

6177~~~
Pretty much all our players have dived before. I didn't see the yellow card incident as a dive either. Welbeck did the exact same thing in the box earlier but he's English so it doesn't diunt as a dive of course. But that's besides the point. I do agree yours is the least over the top one.

6178~~~
Well that sure as hell won't happen.

6179~~~
How do we know that his missus hates Manchester?

6180~~~
Agreed on the Welbeck dive. I've said as much elsewhere. I've also said the same about our other players in the past.
There was a stage last year I would've like to see Young out of the club for it.

It's one of the shittest things about the game but everyone seems content to complain about it but do nothing to fix it.

6181~~~
I was at the game last night and one thing I noticed that I doubt was picked up on TV, was his regular tantrums every time someone didn't pass to him. And I mean very regular. 

It's good to see a player keen to get on the ball, but this was like watching a child having his sweets taken off him. It was even when his team mates chose to play to the opposite full back instead of Valencia. That'd set him off again holding his hands up as if to say do you not know who I am?!

I honestly have no agenda against di Maria and have every hope he hits form here, but I really didn't like the tantrums that I saw last night.

6182~~~
I seem to be in the minority that is amazed that he'll get away with a 1match when putting hands on the ref. We should count ourselves lucky really.

In terms of mad minutes, that was right up there last night

6183~~~
hand on the ref or not he got 2 yellow cards so that's that.

6184~~~
For me there's a difference between diving and going down the easily. Di maria did the former. It's the way he's been brought up playing the game with a low pain threshold, like Nani. It's not a big deal in Spain i don't think. And I don't have issues with it. Referees don't seem to give anything when players stand their ground either. Inwouldnt expect that from the morons who red premier league games anyway. Then you have the proper diving like what Januzaj did yesterday. That's terribel imo.

In an ideal world both wouldn't happen but the former is commonplace now. Most arsenal players would have gone to ground as well. Welbeck already proved he would.

I personally feel a but for di Maria because it came across as differential treatment towards him as he fixed into one of the stereotypical boxes the ref drew up in his head. If rooney or welbeck had gone down in the same situation they would have either gottten a foul for it or not gotten a foul but not gotten booked and singled out as a cheat.  Of course he was really silly grabbing he ref (well it was a grab or sorts I guess) but I don't think the whole incident is as black and white as a lot of people are treating and going ape shit in this thread as a result.

6185~~~
He was never the player we needed for our squad imo. Obviously he is immensely talented, but the whole thing feels like it was a statement and he was the best marquee player available at the time.

playing as the attacking midfielder in a 3, he has shown he has all the promise to live up to his price tag with the right players around him, however we didn't need a 60m investment into that area of the pitch, we had just spent 37m on juan mata the january before and 30m on hererra this summer, both players who could quite easily make that position their own. we needed a proper world class no.8 and a pacey wide forward/winger. players who will make up the "spine" of the side for the foreseeable future. As pretty much everyone has stated di maria out wide is an absolute waste and has never really dominated in that position.

man oh man i wish we took sanchez.

6186~~~
Argh typing issues.

6187~~~
Come on. It was a blatant dive. I'm not even that bothered about the dive tbh. Grabbing the ref afterwards was fecking braindead though.

6188~~~
It sure was. Sadly, players do lose the plot and their sense of perspective sometimes.

6189~~~
Well then you'll understand why people are angry about the most expensive player in the history of English football losing the plot/sense of perspective in our biggest game of the season so far.

It's an unusual enough thing to do anyway. Can't think of when another player last got booked for grabbing a ref. To do it at that moment, in that game, (immediately after being booked for a blatant dive) was very hard to take.

6190~~~
I've made exactly your argument in the past. Funnily enough, for Januzaj on this board somewhere I think.
I didn't think Di Maria was as innocent as you did tonight though. I thought it was a deliberate and as bad as Januzaj's, who probably was fouled, if several yards earlier.

If it was Suarez or Sterling that went down like that, we'd be mocking Liverpool fans for it and slamming those who condoned it.

6191~~~
Things like this don't happen when refs do their job properly. He Should have made it worthwhile and punched him.

6192~~~
Not sure when a player got booked for it, I remember Hart on Oliver earlier this season got nothing (and was labelled a pussy by a lot of people for letting hart get away with it) and then there was the Sterling on Webb last year where he got away with it I think. No idea what goes through players' heads when they do it though.

6193~~~
I agree with you. Embarassing stuff and it smacks of desperation to boot. I don't mind us getting beaten but it's how we get beat and the tactics we resort to that get my goat and I'd happily see cheats shipped out.

Interesting. I think the suspicion is growing that all this is a bit too much like hard work for him.

6194~~~
Would not mind it one bit if he was sold in the summer. He might be one of the best players around but i would rather have a team full of players like Fellaini and Evans who might no be the best but at least tries their best when they are given a chance.

6195~~~
Sterling did it to Webb. He just let it go. 

Sometimes, the ref using a bit of common sense wont go amiss but unfortunately, the way Di Maria made contact, it was never going to be let off.

6196~~~
Ohh, the body language posts again.

6197~~~
Sterling was a silly boy too. Although I don't think he did it immediately after he'd been booked for something else.

6198~~~
Nope, iirc it was for a foul Sterling wanted which was not given. Neither could have had any complains about being booked but the ref using a cooler head like Webb did would be good to see.

6199~~~
We had two players do daft things yestwrday - Valencia and di Maria. Shit happens sadly in football. I hope they both become stronger due to it. But I'm not going to single out one of them out because he happens to be a top player WE paid huge money for.

6200~~~
I don't put a terrible back pass in the same category as grabbing the referee. The former is a badly executed skill, the latter is just completely brainless.

6201~~~
He is under immense pressure and for all the talent that he has, doesn't strike me as the sort of person who handles pressure well.  You can see how desperate he was last night to prove himself.  Great player but he's nothing like, say, a Ronaldo, doesn't work as hard and is nowhere near as determined.  Mental strength seems to be his greatest weakness.

I really wish we could have recalled Nani in the winter transfer window if there was ever an option, we really could have used him last night as Young was totally ineffective on the left.  Nani and AdM on the wings in a 433 could give him more space so that he is no longer the team's only source of creativity and threat, a responsibility that he often struggles with.

6202~~~
I thought an extra yellow (or was it straight red?) for that was harsh. It didn't seem aggressive, just a little tug to get his attention.

In terms of performance levels, I thought he was immensely better last night that the utter dross he's been for a good few weeks now, albeit there were still issues.
I would dare to hope that he can carry on that improvement - except is there a likelihood he's going to get an extended ban as an example?

6203~~~
Everywhere I look I see the red card has totally changed how his performance prior to that incident was seen yesterday. Taking away the red card, his performance was much better than what we've seen recently, he created the goal with as good a cross as you'll see, made a fantastic run where he was unlucky not to score moments before Valencia gifted them the winner, and had two good crosses for Fellaini in the first half. Now people are saying they're glad he's banned for Spurs because he's so shit. Some say he isn't even trying.  Yes, he fecked up on the red card, but his general play was much better, he seems to be the player that creates the most every time I watch our dire performances, but people seem happy to get on his back. He can do much better of course, but we should get behind him.

6204~~~
Why is Smalling getting a pass on his role on the first goal?

6205~~~
First goal was more Valencia and blind then smalling. Valencia first of all moved out of position completely, but then put in a terrible attempt at a tackle, same with blind. That's the reason chamberlain was allowed to get that far in the first place. Smalling was dragged out of position but it was a consequence of blind and Valencia's role in that play. Also Valencia obviously had the back pass which is why he is rightly getting criticised more.

6206~~~
Smalling was covering Valencia yes, he had Monreal with him, then he completely left him alone and moved centrally. Whilst he did that, he didn't communicate to anyone that Monreal was free. Either he stays with Monreal or he communicates to Di Maria to pick him up. Di Maria also should have seen it, but he was ball watching (he did actually track back) but then wasn't paying attention. They are all at fault.

6207~~~
Valencia covered for Smalling who was out of position.  Not that I fault Smalling  for tracking his player out to RB.  but once there, Valencia did the right thing and covered for him.  That means Smalling should have stayed at RB and was responsible for Monreal.  Fortunately, football isn't netball and is a fluid game where players must be able to cover for each other.

6209~~~
Well his £4m mansion is up for sale...

6210~~~
Astonishing you can blame three different United players without even mentioning the main culprit. The bloke who was standing fecking watching when the player he was supposed to be marking strolled into the box and scored an easy goal.

6211~~~
Why would he spend 4 million on a house in Manchester!

That is the a daily mail gossip colum story to fill a few pages.

6212~~~
Sorry Mrs. di Maria, no club in Argentina can afford anything close to the fee required. Guess you're stuck in Manchester.

6213~~~
What I love about this is, if it's true, did he not think to ask Ronaldo, Modric, Aguero and various others what Manchester/England is like?! 

All about those £ signs

6214~~~
He was probably too ugly to even consider asking that kind of question.

6215~~~
His house is actually worth £4m it is not a gossip story, a lot of media outlets are carrying the story not just the DM, his wife isn't comfortable anymore

6216~~~
We should be able to break even on him in the summer anyway. I'm sure there is a club out there willing pay £60million because he is a quality player. Maybe if PSG fail to get to deep stages of the CL again, they might want to splash the cash on him, Straight swap plus cash for Cavani perhaps?

6217~~~
It's in Prestbury and that's probably around average for the area.

Believe it or not there is more to Manchester than the 2 mile radius around Piccadilly station.

6218~~~
i really don't want him to leave just yet, but i guess he has to do what he has to do, although i must admit - going into another window with a £100m+ in search of quality players is quite exciting, we don't have to build a team to accommodate ADM anymore, we could just get the right players in this time.... i hope.

6219~~~
Oh he was at fault for sure too, I was answering the guy who was saying smalling should get more blame I think.

6220~~~
Di Maria doesn't own his house, it's rented.

6221~~~
It's obvious.

6222~~~
What is wrong with people, even I would marry Di María if that meant I could sit on a £4m house doing nothing all day. Is it that harder for an heterosexual woman who presumably loves him?

6223~~~
Take a look, Smalling runs by Monreal.  He glanced at DiMaria, but I don't think he said anything to him.  Di Maria on the hand does not look to his left although I suspect he knew Monreal was there unless he believes Monreal  has just magically disappeared.  BUT, there was no need for Smalling to leave Monreal and take up a position among all the other players.  Therefore, in my opinion Smalling gets the most blame followed by Di Maria and then Blind  for a  poor  play leading up to the pass.

6224~~~
Chris Smalling is the one to blame

6225~~~
there is plenty of blame to throw around in that goal... poor effort from by Blind, worse from Valencia (the rightback, who should had been on Monreal) with an even shittier tackle... Smalling did what he had to do imo. 

Di Maria was really naive not to cover him. He was right there watching all the action so he should have reacted faster instead of standing still.

6226~~~
So the missus is homesick and can't find a way to be more supportive of her husband's decision? I'm sorry, but she should have known better. And for the record, Argentina can have a weather is not a welcome gift from God either (i.e. fecking cold in the Southern hemisphere when it would be hot summer in the Northern hemisphere), so she should be happy she is living in a £4M house doing almost nothing (bar perhaps some volunteering at the most) in her days.

6227~~~
The only thing I wish to see from him upon his return on the pitch is the mindset of a wounded animal with the only desire of creating havoc in the heart of the opposition's half and succeeding by any means. Anything short of that would become a problem.

6228~~~
He wanted to go to PSG, he was holding out half the summer for them, obviously any wife would prefer Paris over Manc, they had the fair play thing going on and couldnt sort out a deal, Real wanted rid of him and his only other option was us, PSG clearly seemed his 1st choice, and wouldnt surprise if he pushes for a move again this summer if his wife wants out.

6229~~~
I hate seeing him play on the right. Always cuts inside and runs into traffic. Guess its tactical though since he can cross into the far post more accurately on to Fellaini's 'fro

6230~~~
First goal was also Di maria not tracking the opposition fullback (the goalscorer) - the job of the winger on any flank. Valencia was out of position but Smalling covered temporarily, Blind failed to tackle as a DM and ADM failed to track his man who scored. That was a team failure for that goal in several areas.

6231~~~
Wouldn't be surprised either but not sure if PSG have the funds, if he is genuinely unhappy and they are willing to give us mosts of the money back I would not be too disappointed if he left, there is no point keeping him if he isn't happy and can't get back to his best.

6232~~~
I'd want £55m at the very least. If they can pay £50m for Luiz, then they can pay that for Di Maria. We'd be taking a small hit, but if he genuinely doesn't want to play here, then it would be for the best. Still, any ridiculous offers and I say just keep him.

Personally, I don't want him to leave. I think he'll grow into the PL and be very good next year.

6233~~~
How long is he suspended for anyway?
I presume the suspension carries over into the league

6234~~~
Just against Tottenham.

6235~~~
How long is he suspended for anyway?
I presume the suspension carries over into the league

6236~~~
Uploading pictures of di Maria on Instagram every day is seems. Slightly obsessive.

6237~~~
Just against Tottenham.<span style="color: #ffffff"> I had to...</span>

6238~~~
I just figured selling the house was based on the previous break in.
Pretty understandable that they / she isn't comfortable there after that.
Not like they've been there that long to have many happier associations with the place.

The rest sounds like baseless assumptions / shit stirring


Sorry for double post earlier, internet in work is awful.

6239~~~
He needs time to settle. Look at the stats above. not bad at all. 

Remember De Gea ???

6240~~~
Is he only suspended just against Tottenham? <span style="color: #ffffff">Hehe</span>

6241~~~
Two yellow cards is a one match suspension as far as a i know so yeah just Spurs at home.

6242~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6243~~~
Whilst Di Maria does have to take blame here, Smalling is in the wrong. When you leave a player free its your responsibility to make sure he is passed on especially when Di Maria wasn't even looking in that direction. Its poor communication.

6244~~~
So what ban is he going to get from the red card? I'm releived to have not seen any mention of it possibly being extended. Is it one game?

6245~~~
Is anyone going to believe me if I claim I did that on purpose?

In my defence, I wasn't sure whether he got a yellow then a straight red.

6246~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZ_TdsdoNwY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Thought this was quite funny..

6247~~~

6248~~~
If we keep him he will become a fantastic player for us if he is played left of a 3 man midfield and has 2 wingers in front of him.

6249~~~
Are you pretending that a player who can't track back correctly or mark a fullback is less dangerous in the middle of the midfield ?

6250~~~
Interesting how the dramatic Tweet headline doesn't really represent the article on the other side.

6251~~~
I said when the news about the robbery broke he'd leave in the summer, real shame but you cant really blame him it must have had a big effect on his life.

Calling a move to PSG with Cavani coming the other way.

6252~~~
Be hilarious if he moves to City on compassionate grounds due to the robbery.

6253~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6254~~~
Yes. Generally through the middle you have 2 central defenders against 1 striker, always 1 man free to pick up any runners. 

There is also more chance of them trying to thread a pass through the middle, rather than have a direct shot on goal. Either way though a professional at this level shouldn't be that lazy.

6255~~~
Your analyze is totally wrong through the middle you generally have at least one striker behind you, 2 central midfielders in front of you and most of the time an attacking midfielder on you, you also have to deal with wide players running inside.

Being a central midfielders is more demanding defensively than being a winger, on the wing he only has a supporting role, he has to support his fullback once in while and follow the opposing fullback on the rare occasion in bombs forward.

6256~~~
I was talking of us playing vs arsenal 433 v 433. Everybody in midfield would have a man to mark, leaving a central defender without a man to mark.

6257~~~
My bad, you did said generally.

And Di Maria having to mark someone decent for an entire game with Blind and/or Herrera next to him is a recipe for disaster, without even thinking about his lack of care regarding his passing decisions and executions.
Last week he made a mistake, like Smalling did and others too, things like that happens and it has nothing to do with the position he was playing in.

Edit: Since the CBs play a zonal marking, you need both free of any individual marking in open play.

6258~~~
I think we can both agree that Di Maria needs to buck up his tracking back! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6259~~~
We can agree on that. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6260~~~
He should no longer be a guaranteed starter imo and be made to fight for his starting place.

6261~~~
If mata carries on like this then Di Maria should be benched indefinitely.

6262~~~
Blessing in disguise?

6263~~~
If I recall correctly, the last time Di Maria was out for a bit we actually played decently well (not great, but some improvement).

Too much impetus on Di Maria perhaps. He shouldn't be an automatic starter.

6264~~~
I had a feeling it would happen. We're seeing a more cohesive unit out there. He really needs to be a part of it rather than an individual and he won't succeed here unless he can find his role.

6265~~~
We're playing better without him because he thinks he needs to dribble past 3 players and make something happen every time he's on the ball. Right now we're linking up and not forcing the glory play.

6266~~~
Quite a debate we're going to have now for the lineup against the dippers.

6267~~~
He needs to fit the team, not the other way round. After today, I want Mata to keep his place and have ADM fight for it

6268~~~
He still needs to play. He is a genuine world class player and you make a spot for those. We saw early in the season when we play well as a team, he steps it up to a level noone can live with.

6269~~~
After the performance of the team today I think he needs to start on the bench next week. The team gelled from front to back. Not to mention the desire to win the ball back was the highest I've seen all season. Nothing overly complicated from the team and both wide players worked flawlessly with their full back.

6270~~~
The competition he's facing now will do him good, he'll establish himself soon enough.

6271~~~
Only if they're performing. I agree he'll probably get back into the side since we're obviously not going to maintain this level every week, but being perceived as a world class player isn't an automatic reason to get into the team.

6272~~~
No debate.

Stop changing it.

6273~~~
Surely he needs to start against Liverpool

6274~~~
No he doesn't, mata deserves his place he has being frustrated for weeks now getting no game time because of ADM.

Mata really stepped up today and put in a fantastic performance, you could tell from the reaction of United fans when he was subbed.

ADM bench, mata start against the scousers.

6275~~~
The problem with Di Maria is that when he's playing we are always looking to get the ball to him. Which means that, if he's playing poorly then we are playing poorly. That said, he actually looked a lot better against Arsenal before his sending off so it's a tough decision.

6276~~~
Really? Why?

6277~~~
i agree

6278~~~
I wouldn't start him. You need someone more reliable, who can keep possession for Liverpool away.

6279~~~
Shouldn't start against Liverpool. We should look to continue as normal next week, and if need be, send him on if, and when, Liverpool tire.

6280~~~
He'll start against Liverpool IMO, add some extra pace and force Moreno to stay deeper.

6281~~~
I'd only start him if Mata's going straight down the tunnel was a sign of anything other than tight muscles, but hopefully that won't be necessary.

6282~~~
Was Mata injured? Apparently went straight down the tunnel. If not, then Di Maria should sit the next game out too.

6283~~~
As we have witnessed in the first half of the Arsenal game and the game today - its not the players, its the style of play, in the game today we penetrated Spurs through the middle which is arguably Di Maria's best way to penetrate - The other 3 games we went through the middle were against Everton,QPR and West Ham which were Di Maria's best games of the season.

Not saying he deserves to start though, but Mata reportedly had a knock.

6284~~~
I agree that he ought to play, just not at the expense of anyone from today's line up. Style or players, I'd rather not take any risks and stick with what's working. Plus, all of the lads today deserved their place for next week.

6285~~~
That is fair, we were brilliant as a team today, but Spurs were also trash

6286~~~
Is it possible that we made them look trash?

6287~~~
It is, but i don't think Liverpool's defenders will fail to make a single successful tackle as Spurs did today

6288~~~
Should be on the bennch vs the scousers, but he will probably start.

6289~~~
Dare I say it, but having him out meant we didn't force everything today. Much more controlled and measured game.

A lot less chucking balls in.

6290~~~
I'd start him against the scousers, his pace on the counter will be a great threat to have and we're not exactly blessed with pacey player options.

6291~~~
You'd fancy him to do some damage running at Liverpool's defence, so I would start him next Sunday. But I wouldn't hesitate to substitute him off should he not perform well.

6292~~~
Well the thing is when Di Maria plays on the right he more often than not tries to cut in on his favored left foot which means we lose width. Especially with Young also cutting in from the other end.

Thing I liked today was that we really stretched Spurs with our wide play. If he plays he has to play either in midfield or out on the left.

6293~~~
In terms of performances, it doesn't feel right dropping anyone from today's team as they really did get the balance perfect. However, Liverpool at Anfield will play the pressing game until we're on our knees so we need to have pace when we break. ADM and Young out wide with Rooney up top gives us a really threat on the counter which will keep their fullbacks a bit deeper.

I suppose it logically means Mata drops out for ADM and everything else remains the same.

6294~~~
I'd rather he start against Liverpool then Mata. United could do with his pace and dribbling ability on the counter.

6295~~~
Liverpool play Lovren on the left of their 3 man backline, right? That's a good matchup for Di Maria to just play on the right and look to streth play.

6296~~~
I would keep Mata in personally. Might do di Maria some good. Mata too. Can always sub him on if we need to change it.

6297~~~
Big decision whether or not to play him. I can see both sides to the argument. If he does play then he has to put in a good performance. If he gives the ball away as casually as he can do, Liverpool's pace will kill us on the counter.

6298~~~
I am very sad. Our best technical player by far, yet we looked so much better without him in the side. I am very sad.

Please di maria, show us what you really are capable of. I still have high hopes of seeing you tearing defenders right left and center.

6299~~~
Nah, I see us targeting Can. With Fellaini obviously going to be the main threat on that side.  

Like I said in another thread, there is no need for us to change it. Di Maria has done nothing to warrant a place in the team and he gives the ball away for fun.

6300~~~
I think Mata has earned his start next week. Di Maria is going through a testing period, his next start should be at Old Trafford not away at Anfield in a huge game.

6301~~~
He should be a super sub, Mata deserves to start vs Liverpool.

btw anyone mentioned this here: 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9760648/louis-van-gall-makes-no-assurances-over-angel-di-maria-at-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...nces-over-angel-di-maria-at-manchester-united</a>

6302~~~
I'd put Di Maria in over Young and maybe Shaw over Blind for Liverpool and leave the rest as is.

Then perhaps bring on Januzaj, Falcao as needed.

6303~~~
I wouldn't play him against Liverpool. We've just had our best performance of the season, it'd be harsh on players who did so well yesterday to replace them.

6304~~~
Why would you want to change that left side after yesterday?

6305~~~
I think it's unfair to say we're better without a player of his ability and class, or if us playing more as a collective team yesterday is down to him not playing. People always seem to look for someone to blame for something. I'd definitely start him at Anfield.

6306~~~
I don't think that he is a Van Gaal type player. Too erratic and unconsidered with the ball, always trying the spectacular.

6307~~~
That would be the plan for me.

6308~~~
di Maria has no confidence as it is it seems, how is this gonna help him?

6309~~~
Assuming it's a confidence issue rather than a motivation issue. Either way picking people based on form can never be a bad idea for me.

6310~~~
Who cares right now? How is dropping Mata for him going to help <i>us</i>?

If he needs to play his way back into confidence, then he can start the Villa game. We can't be using the vital and challenging Liverpool fixture as a training session for Di Maria.

6311~~~
Di Maria also looked good agsinst Arsenal in the league, and in the FA Cup game until his red card and until LvG lost us the game with his subs he wasn't doing badly either.

Spurs like Arsenal also play an open game. I personally wouldn't start him as noone deserves to be dropped currently but wouldn't be surprised at all if we need to bring him on against Liverpool.

Oh and wait until we play a tight defence again where we'll struggle to create anything until the 76th minute when we go behind. Ppl will then post again stuff like "play him, he has his flaws but at least he is the only one trying something and our only attacking threat."

6312~~~
Last week could be the best thing to happen to Di Maria, he'll really need to raise his game to make the side and Van Gaal should make that abundantly clear to him. I'm not suggesting he thinks he's a guaranteed starter or that he's in any way complacent but there is a lot of competition for places and form should be rewarded. Mata had a decent game and Young has been excellent recently. It would be insane to change a winning team when we have spent so long looking for the right blend. Stick with the same lineup and make him work his way back.

6313~~~
Gives him some time to get his head right away from a big game. We don't need to play him from the start. He could be a bit burnt out.

6314~~~
No offence but thats an absolutely awful idea. That left side was fantastic yet you want them changed. Then you want to bring in 2 totally pointless players aswell 

Thank god you aren't the gaffer

6315~~~
He doesn't speak English very much at all yet from his recent interviews. I wonder what he does when Giggs delivers the opponents instructions.

6316~~~
No way there should be any more tinkering done on that side. Di Maria and Shaw have done nothing to warrant a start especially after the spurs performance by our 'young and blind' <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

6317~~~
I'd argue how is it going to help Mata.

What sort of message does it send out? The team plays well and the manager changes it. Di Maria would be better used late on in the game. Because at the moment he has not influenced enough games.

6318~~~
Needed to do what exactly?

6319~~~
To do a Forlan maybe?

6320~~~
He's more than welcome to do that actually <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

6321~~~
He needs to be benched for Liverpool game as it's madness to change a team that played so well. One of our best players and what an option from the bench.

6322~~~
This is a bit off topic but part of SAF success was playing in form players and out of form players no matter how big their name was sat on the bench. I am hoping LVG steers clear from picking a player because of his name instead choosing him on form like Mata or Young over Di Maria.

6323~~~
Muppetry at its finest but the question I put to you all, would you be prepared to sell Di Maria to say PSG in the knowledge that we would sign either Ronaldo or Bale possibly even both?

6324~~~
Definitely not. We shouldn't be in the business of selling our best (or near best) players under any circumstances.

6325~~~
10000000 times yes.

Actually I'd even sell him for take a £10million loss on him and sell him for about £50million in the summer, if someone was willing to pay that of course.

6326~~~
Ronaldo/ronaldo and Bale for Di Maria? Really? Doesn't get easier, I love the guy but Ronaldo is the 2nd best player in the world.  Wouldn't do a Bale for Di Maria swap though, Di Maria is way more talented.

6327~~~
Di Maria is better then Bale. This is just classic cow in another field syndrome.

6328~~~
Haha no he isn't. Bale is miles better and can impact a game more. Di Maria has never had a season like Bales last one for Tottenham.

6329~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6330~~~
Bale is surely a better winger than Di Maria? And a winger is what we really need. Plus as a Brit we wouldn't have the constant speculation about whether he can cope with the weather or our pesky British burglars. So yeah, I'd be tempted. 

I really hope we do see the best of Di Maria here. Those early weeks when he looked really good seem a long time ago now.

6331~~~
He's performing far worse in a much better side too. Even di Maria's fairly mixed season with spoaradic form has been better than Bale. Id have him 10 times out of 10 over Bale.

6332~~~
No he isn't. You have an incredible tendency to exaggerate.

6333~~~
Not bothered about Ronaldo, and don't see it happening at all. But 'yes' for Bale. I think he's better than Di Maria. He's more of a match-winner, is better suited to being the main man, proven as suited to this league. 

Di Maria just does nothing for me, to be honest.

6334~~~
An in-form di Maria is still the team's best player and against a team like Liverpool, which is gonna put a lot more pressure on us than Tottenham, his pace and attacking ability could be vital.

6335~~~
Meh. Never found Bale particularly talented, it was more his pace, power and shooting from range that makes him a very good player. Everything else is a bit average from him IMO. I've never rated him as high as anyone else on here though so you won't find me being quick to praise him. Di maria has loads of talent on the other hand, he's just been inconsistent as hell.

6336~~~
It depends where they are played and what their role is. I think Di Maria was better last year but I do not think he has had a season like Bale did in 12/13 (I also consider Bales season last year to be better than all of Di Marias seasons for Madrid apart from 13/14). I think Bale is better on the wing (when on form, he has not being great this year) and makes more things happen by himself when playing there. Di Maria relies on his teammates more. Di Maria is more versatile however, Bale couldn't do as good a job as Di Maria did last season in midfield. Whoever is better or more talented between the two, there is certainly not a big difference in it. Although there seems to be a tendency to not rate quick and powerful players so highly these days.

6337~~~
I'd prefer to have ADM to be honest. He just needs to find his best form again and the doubts will be gone

6338~~~
I am a little bit shocked that we really need to discuss about selling or benching the man who outshone Ronaldo and Messi at several occasions.
He + Rooney + DdG are our only players I would consider to be real worldclass and who would make it into more or less any team.

6339~~~
He has to start imo. Can hasn't been all that great at the back lately, and Markovic isn't all that as a RWB. Assuming it's either Markovic or Johnson on the right side, with Can being the right sided defender, we need AdM in there running at them.

6340~~~
I think he is struggling to settle especially with the lack of English. People like Herrera and Mata settled fast as they had great English. He doesn't talk English well, and I imagine his and LVG's instructions struggle to get across properly. If he works hard at it though I imagine once he settles he will be fantastic - that's if he wants too.

6341~~~
Young would be playing there. Di Maria would be against Sakho + Moreno.

6342~~~
We have numerous Spanish speaking players and coaches including Van Gaal himself. I very much doubt they leave him standing there like a lemon wondering what everyone is talking about.

6343~~~
Di Maria last season was significantly better than Bale ever was.

6344~~~
I really can't agree with that. Bale's last season in the EPL was unbelievable.

6345~~~
Didn't know LVG speaks spanish, surprising as his English can be a little unnatural. While yes we do have plenty of Spanish speakers, sometimes in a game if he want's to tell a team mate something it could be a problem. I can't see him being able to tell Rooney to track a runner etc.

6346~~~
Those kinds of messages can be easily conveyed using hand gestures, I cant see that being a problem. 

I imagine Van Gaal's Spanish is even more faltering than his English but having coached at Barca he can probably make himself understood.

6347~~~
"Significantly"? Really?

6348~~~
I don't think you can compare the two, as they were two different players playing for two completely different teams. But, if you had to...

Bale was the main man for a decent Tottenham team, and he almost carried them to the Champions League. I remember some the goals he scored that season, and they were either incredible strikes from range or a "Messi" type goal by dribble past the entire opposition defense. He actually tailed off, if I may say, towards the end of the season which may have contributed towards Tottenham missing out on the top 4. I'd say this was the season where Bale became a man, and was capped off by his move to Real Madrid.

di Maria, on the other hand, played for a team, alongside Bale, where he was no were near being the main man, and outshone him, in a season where Madrid won the coveted "La Decima". He was described by many as the "engine" that powered the team towards the Champions League final. Had di Maria not put in that performance in the final, then I'd say Gareth Bale's 2012/13 would edge di Maria's last season for Real. However, his man of match performance will always be remembered as the highlight of that game, and, that too, in a season where he scored 12 and assisted 24 in 44 starts for Madrid. That performance is why we paid £60m (MUFC tax included) and, also, why that year trumps Bale's 2012/13 season.

Whilst Bale's season initiated him for the big stage, di Maria's season was the performance of a life time on that very big stage.

6349~~~
I would say more 'the second half of his last season on EPL'. However, even then I don't think that he was one of the best players in the world, something that Di Maria clearly was last season.

6350~~~
Nail on head.

6351~~~
The Mail are running another Di Maria/Cavani swap story, that would be a contender for one of the worst deals we've done.

6352~~~

6353~~~
When you see a swap deal being proposed you know it's bollocks. How many times do they actually go through? Re: Cavani though, that would be a terrible bit of business, and doesn't solve any of our problems.

6354~~~
He was already giving it the "The future? Only God knows...." bullshit back in November.

If he doesn't want to be here, he can piss off.

6355~~~
If you're going to believe anything the Daily Mail writes, then give up now. They are the masters of spouting bullsh*t. I don't think I've ever seen that correctly predict a transfer.

6356~~~
Yeah once I saw it was the Daily Mail I didn't really care much.

6357~~~
Nobody "wants to play for PSG" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6358~~~
If there was a swap deal for our invested £60 fecking million I'd expect at least Veratti and Marquinhos!

6359~~~
What worse is the "playing in the French league would please lots of players"...

6360~~~
The press always try and unsettle our players, it shifts papers. First we were going to shift DDG because he was shit and now we're going to lose him because he's fantastic, it'll be the same with ADM.

6361~~~
Perhaps a bit disingenuous to suggest the De Gea situation is a press narrative? They're only reporting what is utterly apparent. The club aren't blamerless either. They were briefing for months that they were relaxed about the situation.

6362~~~
The worrying part in all this, is that someone forced him to sign for United, the police needs to investigate on that, he is a free man and should be able to sign for whoever he wants.

6363~~~
Swap deal for Cavani? I reckon Cavani would knock about 10m off the 60m we'd be looking for. Cavani and Veratti, now that's something we could consider.

6364~~~
Benched against Liverpool. And wasn't it deserved?! Hopefully this gives him the kick up the ass he needs.

6365~~~
Huge mistake imo to bench him, he hasnt been great but still our most creative player by far.

6366~~~
Feck Cavani, he's too old now.

Marquinhos + Veratti = Di Maria + 10-20m and we have a deal.

6367~~~
Based on form then yeah, he didn't deserve to start.
Based on what he <b>could </b>bring, i.e. pace on the counter-attack, I'd of put him in.

6368~~~
We'll have to wait and see if it was a mistake... Di maria is a big game player and of course our most creative player and his pace would have been useful but Mata can be brilliant as well and is a more reliable passer. Fair arguments for both players. Using di Maria as an impact sub could work out for the best in whatever situation we are in later on

6369~~~
Right decision. Might have the chance to win us the game off the bench.

6370~~~
I feel we will miss his pace today but its hard to argue about changing the side that won 3-0 last week. He will be a good player to bring on in the second half anyway.

6371~~~
I wouldn't have started him, I think the intensity of this kind of game would be too much for him.

6372~~~
Would have started him. His pace on the counter would have been absolutely vital.

Does show Van Gaal wont hesitate to take big calls, which is good going forwards once RVP is fit.

6373~~~
I would want his pace on the counter attack today.

6374~~~
How good is Cavani?

6375~~~
Everyone knows RVP gets special treatment, when RVP is fit he'll be back in the first 11 regardless of how bad he is.  

Glad he's benched ADM though, he will be much better to bring on in last 20 mins if we are struggling and need a goal.

6376~~~
Would swap for Marquinhos + Verrati <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Would even throw in some $$$ too!

He'll be good to bring on in the second half if we're chasing the game.

6377~~~
i can see the only reason of his missing is the lineup produced very positive result at the last game, so to have it continued.  really need not to think it too much

6378~~~
Could be the beginning of the end for him. You guys look so much more balanced and creative without him, in the game against Spurs and so far today. Seems less rushed and more fluid.

6379~~~
He could easily come in for Young though, wouldn't read to.much into it.

6380~~~
I think the absence of Van Persie and Falcao is the biggest factor in that as Hererra gets to play and he knits everything together. Rooney not being in midfield is a big plus too. But yes Mata and Hererra really link up play well. Di Maria loses the ball a lot because he always tries something special.

6381~~~
Totally agree. He could replace either Mata or Young when they start to tire.

If we can keep a clean sheet for 20 minutes in the second half, then the dippers will need to start throwing players forward. Putting on Di Maria at that junction would make us dangerous on the break. Similar to how we did against the gooners and so'ton.

6382~~~
I think that's simplifying it a bit too much personally. He's just not in great form, as happens with a lot of players and especially in thier first season. He'll get back into form and prove his worth in good time.

6383~~~
He wouldn't offer anything close to the defensive protection Young has offered. It would be a disaster to replace him unless we are chasing the game

6384~~~
Exactly, I just think LvG is going by form (as he should) but wouldn't read too much into it. Bigger players have been dropped and it might actually be good for him.

6385~~~
Yes, Young should be on the pitch.

We look so much better without ADM in the team.

6386~~~
Look at how Mata has responded after being out for a few weeks. I hope ADM shows the same type of desire to make it here at Manchester United.

6387~~~
Tracking back and workrate are some of his strongest aspects. I think it has to do with tactics and form. Atm He looks sluggish and lazy but an on form Di Maria is far from a defensive liability.

6388~~~
ADM for Young please! Lets put them under more pressure.

6389~~~
What the feck was Di Maria thinking? There is no way he would/should have thought it was out. Shocking brainfarts. 

And as I say that, what a pass to Mata.

6390~~~
Beautiful pass for Mata's goal, but than he still seems like he is a step behind and he makes stupid, simple mistakes

6391~~~
Brainless

6392~~~
Good assist for the goal but otherwise he's been shocking. Looks a liability tbh.

6393~~~
I don't get how his passing is so sloppy when he's not even under pressure

6394~~~
costing us

6395~~~
You should know whom you're dealing with. PSG will only sell when they want to. I don't think anybody can force them, not United not Real.

6396~~~
He's a waste of space.

6397~~~
Losing the ball too much, should stay up front where it won't cost us.

6398~~~
Other than the assist he has been our worst player.

6399~~~
Take him off again Louis. Useless.

6400~~~
We're saying that all too often.

6401~~~
It is absolutely painful watching him make poor decision after poor decision. Something is wrong upstairs.

6402~~~
Sometimes it is better to just hold our hands up, accept that it didn't work out and move on. Falcao and ADM have both failed this season (ADM less so, but recently he has been dire).

We don't need to keep playing players just because they cost a lot of money and are on big wages.

6403~~~
I think he may have set a new record for number of times ball given away in a single half.

6404~~~
We also don't need to sell a player immediately after he's had one bad season. Aren't you the guy that's a massive Fellaini supporter?

6405~~~
This guy pisses me right fecking off.

6406~~~
Such a stupid and careless player. Again when he lost the ball, he made little effort to run back.

6407~~~
His terrible but with style, gives the ball away 90% of the time (don't give me that his job is not to keep the ball crap), hope he gets his shit together next season.

6408~~~
Terrible today, kept inviting pressure on us.

6409~~~
He plays on a different wave length to some of our players, always goes for passes that nobody else would even think of chasing. LVG might not like this. Sometimes it can be a killer pass and other times it can look awful. Similiar to a winger out on loan maybe? Anyway, he created our 2nd goal with a peach that nobody else bar maybe Mata could pull off in our side, and also with the ball that led to the penalty that should have made it 3.

6410~~~
I'll repeat myself I don't want him near our midfield three. He plays on the wing or he stays on the bench and with Young and Mata being better than him, he stays on the bench.

6411~~~
He was awful today. I know it was a sub forced by an injury, but he didn't suit the game at all. Maybe he'll learn the league and come good, but away against Liverpool was totally the wrong time!

6412~~~
Got an assist but was awful today really.

6413~~~
His assist was very nice though. Got to do a hell of a lot more.

6414~~~
Well he did well for our second goal but appart from that was rubbish.

But I do remember how our record signing back then (yes the brilliant player who was man of the match today) only a year ago against the same opponent got called all kind of stuff when they trashed us 3-0.
Players don't become shit over night and Di Maria will perform much better (assuming he wants to be here).

6415~~~
The assist was amazing...yes, but i think it was the most obvious thing to do, Mata started the play with the 1,2 and Di Maria reciprocated i don't think it was that spectacular that only him and Mata would have been able to do it.

6416~~~
He's the only player in our team that can pick out passes like that each game regardless of how he's playing. He played lots of beauties into RVP earlier in the season, and the cross for Rooney was unbelievable against Arse.

6417~~~
Rooney had a bad game, Di Maria has been giving us performances like this since the Everton game

6418~~~
Set up a goal, and nearly had another assist off of Rooney. Played the ball that won us the pen. 

What are people expecting. A bit sloppy at times yes but one of the most creative players.

6419~~~
Exactly what <a class="username" data-user="64875, @Bwuk" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64875/">@Bwuk</a> said.

6420~~~
Not denying that, but 1 or 2 good passes cannot justify a whole half of misplaced ones, he does more harm than good to the team most times and that is a problem.

6421~~~
Yep, it's something that he can certainly curb a bit but we have to allow him to show some creativity or what's the point? Those kind of passes get you goals in big games.

6422~~~
Yes, but then it works both ways. Do you want a player who tries nothing or a player who can create something from nothing?

6423~~~
Great catch over the shoulder, got to admire the judgement on that!

6424~~~
What the hell was he thinking of when he caught the ball with his hands <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ?

6425~~~
It's now between him and Torres for the biggest transfer flop. No wonder Madrid sold him.

6426~~~
Don't even let me get started with Rooney, his performance today was worse than anything by Di Maria this season and to top it he even denied Mata a well deserved hattrick.

6427~~~
I think most of his passes were excellent today, often their was nobody on the end of it, but that was because they were in the wrong position. What annoyed me was that he was taking risks at the wrong moment, inviting pressure when Liverpool started to get their hopes up and United had difficulty keeping posession. In those spells all players should just keep it simple, keep posession and regain control.

6428~~~
He was bad (not Rooney bad), but without his sub we wouldn't have scored 2 (and it should have been 3). Brilliant pass to Mata and Blind for the penalty and it seems that not many players are able to do that in our team, today was just another example where we couldn't produce much and that is the reason why he is so important. I still don't want him to start the next game, our formation right now works and we shouldn't change it imo, but he will be our first sub and can be a game changer and I am still excited to see him in a better/more balanced team in his best position.

6429~~~
I want a player who is consistent, especially someone of his calibre, not one who has 1 or 2 great/good moments in a game and does feck all for the rest of the game, he certainly derailed our attack to an extent, i mean we were better in the first half and against Spurs, but i'm just happy with the 3 points to be honest, i will overlook Di Maria's 2014/15 season and just expect a better player next season.

6430~~~
He was misplacing his easy passes too.

If he were English, people would be questioning whether he was good enough technically. He hasn't looked it so far at United.

6431~~~
People don't realise that this is a player off form yet he's capable of magic as seen today. A lot of people will be eating their words when he clicks.

6432~~~
Awful but in a way that half summed up why he is the right type of player for United. Not many players could have executed that pass to Mata, confidence is low and his decision making is poor but he's worth persevering with. He does look scared to me at times however, pulls out of far too many challenges for my liking.

6433~~~
Won't even try to do some defensive work in his close vicinity, incredibly frustrating.

6434~~~
We looked worse when he came on. Didn't offer the protection defensively that Young did and constantly gave the ball away. Lovely ball for Mata's goal and for Blind for the peno, but apart from that, he was absolutely awful and put us under needless pressure.

6435~~~
Im not saying to sell everyone as soon as they go through a bad patch, but we are talking about a £60m player. He looks a nervous wreck and I am not convinced he has settled here, on or off the pitch.

I'm not saying sell him straight away, but I think he - and Falcao - need to work to earn their places in the team. We nearly threw away 3 points today and we looked a far worse team once ADM came on.

Not sure on the relevance of Fellaini but yes, I am "the guy who supports Fellaini".

6436~~~
Yes he gave away the ball in some cases. However, he also takes the risks that create the goals. Don't forget he picked out Mata perfectly and also put through Blind for that penalty. A bit hit and miss today but he will get better.

Had a great chance on the break when we were 2 on 1 with Rooney in the middle but underhit the cross. His pace is frightening and the dippers literally sat back for 5 minutes after shitting themselves.

6437~~~
I have seen shocking performances from Di Maria this season, Rooney was terrible as i mentioned in his thread, it was a terrible penalty as well, but he was still right to take the penalty regardless... Mata would probably have scored a hat trick if he had taken it, we will never know - there is a reason for a designated Penalty taker - even Messi misses penalties sometimes.

6438~~~
Like I say, something he needs to work on. Not defending his bad passes at all, but a few of those passes are when he expects players to make runs, which worked at Madrid because they had attackers who always made those runs.

6439~~~
This

6440~~~
If you watch how he seen the space and moved to receive the ball of Mata I think you're being a little unfair. He was wasteful today but is low on confidence. He will be awesome when settled properly a genuine top class player imo.

6441~~~
A Jekyll & Hyde player, fantastic assist and great ball to Blind for the penalty, but every other touch was loose and his final ball was mostly the wrong one.

6442~~~
Mata doesn't give the ball away.

Creativity is not an excuse for sloppiness.

6443~~~
Recently he's been like Nani at his worst for United x2.

6444~~~
If we were still in August or September then ok that would make sense. The season is about to end.

6445~~~
Assist on Mata, pass for the penalty. He was poor but creates 2 brilliant chances.

6446~~~
Perhaps, but i think Mata should get more of the praise for starting the play with the 1,2 and finishing it off in style, Di Maria did well with the technique , but it was quite an obvious pass to be fair.

Di Maria will come good....i hope, we are on course for a top 4 finish *knocks wood*, WE DID THE DOUBLE OVER LIVERPOOL !

6447~~~
Would rather play Januzaj than Di Maria at this point, especially if the rumours of him wanting to leave are true.

He was dreadful but somehow made two positive marks on the game. Football is a weird sport...

6448~~~
I can handle players giving the ball away. The jogging around like it was a fecking training session pissed me off far more.

6449~~~
Januzaj has been one of our worst outfield players this season.

6450~~~
Yes we know.

6451~~~
We will be fine as long as Di Maria doesn't play.

6452~~~
Oh, touched a nerve have I?

My humble apologies.

6453~~~
Frustraing player most of the time. Some flashes of brilliance, then again the sloppiest and laziest player on the pitch. I would sell him to PSG for 50-60m, frustrating. Would be surpried if he could turn it around this season.

6454~~~
It's been brought up before but if we take off our tinted specs for a minute - does he actually offer more than what Nani could have given us?

6455~~~
No.

He plays like a Nani and Ashley Young everyone hated last two seasons.

6456~~~
This. And he wasn't the worst on the pitch, Rooney trumped anything bad he could do in the first half, and then capped it off by missing the penalty. 

His passing was bad, but he should have contributed two goals towards us killing off the game.

This is exactly the way Nani was treated, it's no coincidence that he's actually doing good for Sporting, the attitude here is awful, at times.

6457~~~
Awful cameo, other than the assist. He is an assist machine though, I will say that.

6458~~~
He's a weird one. That pass behind Rooney which should have made it 3-0 and wrapped the game up was unbelievably poor and then ofcourse the countless times he gave it away.

6459~~~
Its not about his individual performances, its about LvG getting him into a role where he can contribute effectively and be the Di Maria we all expected.

6460~~~
Including the pass that gave Rooney a free shot at goal from 12 yards. Swings and roundabouts.

6461~~~
Nani didn't give us anything in his last 2 years here. It was something line 2 assists or a similiar output, so yeah even bad Di Maria is miles ahead. And in his last year's form and in his best position it's not even a debate, Nani has never reached that level.

People who want him to sell after 1 season are ridiculous. Build a proper team with a proper defence and midfield, play him as CM with more pace in front of him and then we will see how it will work next year.

6462~~~
Even that pass was off though, just that Mata is brilliant enough to pull off that overhead kick.

6463~~~
I cant help but think he's doing it on purpose. They dont look like genuine mistakes.

6464~~~
People here are so fickle. He is a class footballer. Its his first season. Give him time.

6465~~~
Pretty sure what is said here has no effect on how a player plays.

6466~~~
Nani didn't give us anything because of different reasons though, it's not like he played every week is it? He's showing this season he can play at the top level when he's starting every week.

6467~~~
I actually think back to the game vs Stoke (I think), last year, where Nani was booed off the pitch, by our own fans. Things like that can contribute towards the downfall of certain players, if not all.

6468~~~
He gave the ball away a lot of times that gave Liverpool chances to counter and it's not the first game he's doing it. And ofcourse he also refuses to track back. He has moments of magic but he also has far too many moments where he gives it away in stupid positions.

6469~~~
The ball catching incident epitomises how he's completely lost the plot. We didn't even need to keep the flow of the game going at that point.

Fortunately we don't really need him at the moment. Everyone was impeccable in their roles in the first half (maybe with the exception of Rooney).

6470~~~
This X100.

6471~~~
Spot on. Its depressing reading such negativity after a massive win.

6472~~~
Wasteful in the final 3rd, apart from the assist - but then that's a pretty big 'apart from', and he essentially created the goal that won us the game.

Much better than what he's been showing of late, and if his heart is in it - and for me, unfortunately, that's the big question - he'll be a success.

6473~~~
Indeed he does give it away in daft positions, which is probably driving LVG mad. I'd keep Mata starting. It's probably between Young and Di Maria for the next game.

6474~~~
Get Di Maria watching some Giggs videos playing central. We need to back the lad. A good pre season and we'll see a rejuvenated player. Next season I'd rather Nani outwide for us.

6475~~~
It's kinda strange. On the one had he was absolutely atrocious today. Lost the ball on almost any fecking dribbling and got the easiest passes completely wrong. On the other hand the played that excellent one two pass with Mata for Mata's second goal and he played a great outside of the foot pass that led to Blind being fouled in the penalty area.

I mean the lad still got a lot of brilliance in him he just seems way too rushed in most of his actions as if he is too anxious to make something happen with the ball. Oh and he really needs to help out in defense more. After he came on our left side got hammered by Liverpool time and time again because Blind was mostly on his own and didn't exactly have a stellar day either.

6476~~~
I agree. I guess Villa at home we could afford to play ADM in Young's position but I'd have Young and his workrate vs City.

6477~~~
What a performance ! Nothing average, ordinary or remotely safe. The number of times he gave the ball away in that situation was unreal. Also some super touches too.

6478~~~
Um by that point Nani was already awful for us and of course has nothing to do with what we say here.   Nani was a fan favorite for awhile he lost the fans not the other way around.

6479~~~
It depends on what we want from this position. Do we want Di Maria, who is obviously in a slump but still manages to create a fair number of chances per game or do we want Young, who is in top form atm,  tracks back but still doesn't really create much. We have enough defensive cover, Di Maria should be starting on the left wing for me.

6480~~~
He's just out of form and adjusting to a new league. He'll be back to his best next season.

6481~~~
Seems like a lot of fans got arsey with him because he wasn't Ronaldo.

6482~~~
Now that we are playing well as a team, if he can stop feeling the pressure of trying to be the man and not force things as much, he'll be brilliant. He is still a very good player.

6483~~~
Yea, no wonder Madrid sold him and then added that Ballon Do'r clause. Ridiculous assertions! We have a special player - he's just not confident enough at the moment.

6484~~~
Yeah ok, lets boo our players, if they're out of form, right?

6485~~~
What clause is that exactly? Not sure I know anything about that.

6486~~~
Mostly shocking with a couple of sublime moments (the assist and pass for the penalty).

Standard really.

6487~~~
No matter how bad he plays, he still actually contributes somehow.

As much as I like effort and willingness and everything, I appreciate legit contributions to scorelines a bit more.

6488~~~
Great assist and great ball to Blind for the penalty, I don't really care that he gives it away a lot when he's capable of those kind of passes.

6489~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11079800/Manchester-United-will-pay-Real-Madrid-an-extra-4-million-if-Angel-Di-Maria-wins-Ballon-dOr.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...illion-if-Angel-Di-Maria-wins-Ballon-dOr.html</a>

6490~~~
Was shocking today. After that pass to Mata, he had a period where he played like a drunken whore and couldn't. I generally defend him for some of his stray passes because he's trying to create but the passes he misplaced today were very easy ones.

6491~~~
Superb moments every game but mostly shocking overall and a complete liability when it comes to doing anything defensively. Our left side was instantly wide open as soon as he came on for Young. Get rid to PSG IMO.

6492~~~
I agree that he needs to prove himself too. I think I slightly misunderstood you in that I thought you were saying we should just get rid of Di Maria after one bad season, hence why I mentioned Fellaini.

6493~~~
26 games. 4 goals, 12 assists. Yep what a flop

6494~~~
Nice pass to Mata, but otherwise was terrible. 

Hope he gets his confidence back asap.

6495~~~
It's his (ADMs) attitude that concerns me is all. You mention Fellaini and he is a prime example of a player who doesn't hide, doesn't sulk and still keeps trying even when the chips are down or he is having a bad game. We know how much Fergie used to say about the importance of personality and mentality when playing at United. Di Maria is no doubt a fantastically gifted player, but his mentality worries me. I am not convinced he is the type to dig deep and perform when the going gets tough - and that is a problem for a record signing.

6496~~~
He was really bad today.  Nice contribution for the goal, but could've cost us heavily with the rest of his play.  Losing the ball constantly, linking up poorly with other players making good runs.  His pace is really useful though and he also tends to get in to very useful positions which is why there are times when he is actually....useful.

Put me off him today a bit.  I've thought he just needs United to start playing well to get some better performances out of him, but that wasn't the case.
We can't afford to have key players messing up like that in the future. 
The only excuse he has now is that he needs a bit of time to gel more.

All that being said, we need to see what he's like next season.  Hoping something clicks by then.
He's done enough to warrant that.  If he does want to leave however, I won't be so gutted I cry into my cereal.

6497~~~
His confidence is low that is evident, still produced a lovely ball for Mata's goal. Id play him on the left (in for Young) against Villa, leaving him out is doing nothing for his confidence and on his day he's world class.

6498~~~
Capable of brilliant moments. his work rate has dropped since coming here and his want to score is irritating when he should be running it down the line.

Dont write him off just yet, look at Fellaini's renaissance

6499~~~
I am starting to worry about him. He just looked like a 14 year old player with no clue how to play. I suspect he'll be a sub the rest of the way and he'll have to play his way back to the starting lineup.

I really hop he comes good as I'm a big fan.

6500~~~
This.

At the moment, giving Di Maria the ball is giving it to the opposition more often than not. He's losing the ball a ridiculous amount. I don't know if his head/heart are still in it. You see the stories in the paper and you think to yourself someone's talking to the papers. It could be PSG but it could just as easily be Mendes. Di Maria's not playing like he's comfortable in a United shirt that's for sure.

6501~~~
I was seriously angry at him when he chose to whip the ball in instead of taking it to the corner at the end - but he did provide a great assist for the winning goal, so we'll just have to cut him some slack and hope that he can slowly come back to form towards the end of the season and then really kick on next year.

6502~~~
And what the feck was with catching the ball whilst in play?

6503~~~
Poor again but still productive, he just needs to cut out giving the ball away so much and he will be fine.

6504~~~
Dunno where his head is at mate.

6505~~~
Januzaj should be ahead of him in the pecking order let alone Mata and Young.

His one player who needs the summer off by the looks of things. Even the simple things he is getting wrong.

6506~~~
He's quite simply lacking confidence. He's not a lazy player, some of his best attributes are his work rate and constant tracking back; something he demonstrated brilliantly, last year.

This season should be his settling in season, even though his stats are very, very impressive. We seem to be clicking, and he'll play a massive part in the next few games.

6507~~~
Played terribly but got the assist for Mata and that fantastic pass for Blind to earn the penalty.  Seems everyone forgot the last one but had Rooney put away the pen that would have made 2 goals created by di Maria.

6508~~~
All he needs is one good match and then the his confidence would grow. I still believe in him.

6509~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

4 goals and 12 assists, yeah he's been nothing but a disaster

6510~~~
I do hope your joking

6511~~~
Di Maria is one of those players that will have a moment of brilliance one second, then the next second you want to strangle him for doing something brainless. 

He has always been a very mercurial player, just have to get used to it.

6512~~~
The fact he played wank and still assisted a goal and should have been responsible for another goal had Rooney not cocked it up, says it all

6513~~~
That assist made the match a beautiful spectacle despite LFC destroying the game in a butthurt rage.

He's not fully settled but absolute class is there.

6514~~~
I wouldnt start him any time soon. Keep feeding cameos off the bench for now.

6515~~~
Lovely assist for Mata's goal. He deserves praise for that..
..however, maybe now people will understand why van Gaal tried him out up front. So that he is as far away from our goal as possible when he inevitably gives the ball away. Could he have given the ball away any more than he did today? It was ridiculous because a lot of the time he wasn't even under pressure. He just dribbles for that bit too long, or plays an unnecessary sloppy pass. I watched him a lot for Madrid but maybe you don't the the faults as much when it's not your team and you care less about the result. He has qualities I love, but he seriously must be a nightmare for LvG given he is almost the antithesis of LvGs possession based philosophy.

6516~~~
Foolish to consider him as a flop. Played alright when he came on bar catching the ball before it went out which was daft.

6517~~~
I'm not very fond of him. I think he has a shit attitude.

6518~~~
Still laughing at the handball but he really was not awful today

6519~~~
That was great <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6520~~~
I don't think even his ball to Mata was that good, the finish was amazing precisely because it was very awkward to hit it, he hardly served it on a plate. 

We looked better before he came on.

6521~~~
Not a flop by any means but he shouldn't be starting ahead of Mata or Young come to think of it.

6522~~~
Even when not playing well, he pops up with assists. We expect more from him than he is delivering, but once he gets over this phase and settles, he can be awesome for us.

6523~~~
His confidence took a massive hit after how they treated him at Madrid after unquestionably brilliant season.

The overall attitude in CL final was a proper summary of his team work. He took Atletico by storm.

6524~~~
It was actually quite good, and Mata's finish was even better.

6525~~~
That was not his fault, although he did contribute, as did the entire team. We sat back and let them play; had we continued to dominate and kill the game, they wouldn't have scored and di Maria might have fared better.

6526~~~
The handball was really weird, I mean he was standing about a yard in from the line what the hell was he thinking?! 

Still a bit hit and miss, but another assist and the pass that lead to the penalty was lovely. 

I'm confident he'll kick into gear properly next season

6527~~~
Not someone that can deal with being knocked off stride, literally and metaphorically. I think he'll find his gears again after a good settled summer.

6528~~~
He doesnt want to be here anymore....after the break in and shite season hes having, just biding his time until PSG comes calling.

6529~~~
Very frustrating player the second half of the season. You have to imagine he'd not have come on once it was 2-1. I feel like he negated a bit of our advantage at time, taking too many chances and being far to careless with the ball. He's esssentially Nani these days.

6530~~~
Thanks for the information. 

As it stands, he has next to no chance in winning the B-dOr.

6531~~~
The way he messed up the chance to square a ball to Rooney says a lot about his form now. I think for the money United paid, those numbers should be double. Even Fellaini is doing more than him this season. Not about goals/assists numbers, but overall impact in the game.

6532~~~
It was alright. I can live with "quite good". It wasn't brilliant tho.

6533~~~
That handball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I've always thought it'd happen eventually with people trying to catch the ball ASAP to get play restarted before the opposition gets into place, but that was something else. Assist aside (which he can thank Mata for - it was a good pass, but 99 times out of a 100 it'll be just that) he was shit today. I still think he'll be good here, but he needs to sort out his attitude and get some confidence back.

As a sidenote, the number of people (including the commentators on my <span style="text-decoration: line-through">stream</span> TV channel) claiming that the handball should be a booking is quite laughable. Deliberate handball isn't a booking in itself.

6534~~~
Still a valid assist that in the end was worth 3 points. People need to serious chill out with the depressing negativity about Di Maria. He will improve in time as Van Gaal finds the appropriate role for him.

6535~~~
Normally I'd say just feck him, get rid.

But after seeing his first few games for us it's hard because I know the absolute brilliance is there.

However if he carries on like this then jesus, get rid.

6536~~~
If someone will give us over 40million we should take it. He clearly has no interest in being here.

6537~~~
He's going to be a very good signing for his next club.

6538~~~
Had to check; and you are right it's not a yellow, I would have swear that it was.

6539~~~
I'm sure he will. And when he does I'll give him any credit he is due.

6540~~~
Does the difficult things easily and makes the easy things look impossible. Provides assists and opportunities no other player can, then proceeds to give the ball away instead of making a simple two yard pass. Sloppy, inconsistent and brilliant is how I'd some his performances up thus far.

I think he'll come good, give him -- like Van Gaal -- another year.

6541~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> Never thought YOU would rather play Januzaj than a player who still created 2 good goal scoring opportunities.
Grow up!

6542~~~
Oh come off it. Not every pass can be a perfect one. He did play 2 that led to a goal and a penalty though, at anfield, you know a ground we play shite at year after year?

6543~~~
Amazing how some throwing player under the bus without looking whole picture,i mean "feck him,get rid,sell him for 30 mil" etc. Its not enough to say how it is,yes he is out of form AT THE MOMENT,what that has to do with his future form but no,you just write people off,like we or most did with Afroman and some others.

Its his first season...he needs more time to adapt,learn language and if he does not want to be in United,well he will leave simple.

6544~~~
In a season where we've struggled for large parts, 4 goals and 12 assists for a player moving to a new league is just not good enough. Sell him for giving the ball away, forget that he contributed towards what should have been two goals.

6545~~~
The most disappointing aspect for me is the lack of work he is putting in when we lose the ball, at Madrid last year he was a terrier, but now he seems to have no interest in getting back to help out a lot of the time.

6546~~~
I get annoyed with his loose passing too, but he still contributes with things other players in the side are simply not capable of. Young is solid and tracks back well, but his creativity is very poor.

6547~~~
Apart from his great assist for Mata's second, he didn't really impress. Again, I felt he lost possession cheaply and his decision making needs to be a lot better.

6548~~~
Got the same impression, we're far better off with him not starting.

6549~~~
Di Maria is one of those players who just will never ever adapt to the pace and relentlessness of the premier league. It's not as though we signed a player who had 4 or 5 great seasons...it's what, one? He'll never have time on the ball here in any part of the game..or perhaps very sporadically. He's not world class...and even though he did that lift for Mata..well..if that is what we are paying for, then it should happen several times a game and more...

6550~~~
That's why all the people who know Di Maria are convinced that he is the only responsible for that, he loses his concentration and his application way too easily, he doesn't play every ball with the same care, like Ancelotti said he is too often careless with the ball.

And it has nothing to do with confidence, he is like that all the time, the only difference is that when he is totally confident he tries crazy things a lot more.

6551~~~
He's Nani without the work ethic.

Astonishing we broke the English transfer record for someone who is so similar to (and arguably no better than) a player we were so keen to get rid of we ended up paying all his wages on loan.

I've seen nothing from Di Maria going forwards that Nani couldn't do, combined with blatantly failing to do a lot of the defensive stuff that Nani would do, even when not at his best. Annoying.

6552~~~
I agree...we are no better off on the field, but financially so much worse off...

6553~~~
Good assist, but that was when he was central.

His footballing brain is lacking especially in circumstances. When you are winning 2-1, under a bit of pressure, some of his decisions were simply baffling. Running into a crowded area to get tackled and then hitting crosses when we had 1 in the box rather than keeping the ball was mad. If we needed a goal fine, do that, but you could see he hardly covered Blind either. Im surprised Liverpool didnt try and play from the right once he came on.

6554~~~
When you're looking to take <b>risks</b>, you're going to lose the ball. It's a shame we started playing the way we did after going 2-0 up as that, somewhat, contributed towards his loose passes. di Maria looked to be making passes where he could initiate an attack, whereas, the rest of the team thought the game was over. We should have completely killed the game off before being so complacent. His pass to Mata was terrific, too; there aren't too many players who'd have attempted that pass, but he was looking to be positive. His pace was a massive problem for Liverpool, and he should have put Rooney in, however, it didn't work out. He also set up the penalty with a very good through ball to Blind. Yes, he was poor, however, remember that, it was during a time where Liverpool were having a go. In a fixture, where many have struggled, he created a goal and troubled the Liverpool defense, in a short stint.

6555~~~
He had an assist but that's all you could say positive about his game today. He lost possession way too easily and he generally made poor decisions. 

I think he is a world class player when on form and confident, but based on form right now he should be benched. I am happy that LVG also recognizes this.

6556~~~
Yeah, I had to check myself to make sure. It's one of those that has become a truth because commentators, pundits etc. say it all the time.

6557~~~
I agree with this and I actually prefer players that take risks rather than play safe all the time because they have the creativity to make something happen. However in this game he was just very very wasteful with possession and nothing he tried worked except for the assist. He also lost the ball in plenty of situations were he wasn't trying to make stuff happen. He just lost it in situations were he simply had to shield it better and keep possession by passing it somewhere in the middle of the park.

6558~~~
I have to agree, to me he looks very disinterested and is not showing any consistency in his general play, as you say it's very like Nani in every way which does bring into question the fee we paid. It makes me wonder if LvG thought he could play in the midfield 3 in the same way as he did for Real Madrid, and then when he's gotten a first hand look he's changed his mind.

6559~~~
The difference between playing in a 3 for us and for them is that the rest of their team is better than ours.

6560~~~
I was wondering recently whether the work rate he was so highly praised for at Madrid was all that impressive by English standards, where it's expected that you run around like a blue arsed fly, or whether he's just not putting it in (or appearing not to, as he's low on confidence). Either way, he's not the first player to find England tough to acclimatise to. Hopefully we see a bit more next season. A summer off might do him the world of good, considering he spent his post WC time recovering from injury last summer. Let's hope he doesn't get the break he needs and the promptly feck off to PSG.

6561~~~
Well he mostly played in a midfield 3 last season, however them having a better team than us doesn't really excuse his amount of wasteful possession and lack of tracking back.

6562~~~
And they are not a possession team.

6563~~~
Would need to see a gif of this again, but i thought Rooney should have done better with that pass from Angel. It wasn't the worse ball ever, and Rooney had all the time to track that pass and re-position himself for the shot again

6564~~~
Rooney mistakes was that he was too flat, he should have been 2 or 3 meters behind.

6565~~~
Well, it sort of does in a way. He had Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema ahead of him with Marcelo on the left. He always had an outlet so his passing was less wasteful and he worked his socks off too, so that part of his game has been a bit of a let down here so far.

6566~~~
It's fair enough he had more options but then he needs to learn when to release and when to keep the ball until we have more options, however it doesn't really excuse the lack of workrate, he just seems out of sorts here.

6567~~~
Think at his best he could be great for us, but he has been far from it this season. Nani at his best could be brilliant as well and a player who would also cost 40m+ as he was between 2010-2012 though. The problem with him turned into injuries while with Di Maria, I have no idea really. Could be confidence, not used to new league, motivation after winning the CL last season, off field issues, etc.. I think he still has it in him to be a brilliant player and if he finds his form then it will be great for us, I don't believe that last season was just a one off for him.

6568~~~
The assist aside, that was a really shite performance again. What makes it even weirder, is how he messes up the easiest things, whilst doing the hard things right. 

I disagree with the people who says he can't handle the league though. He has shown plenty of times he can make things happen.

6569~~~
I was actually thinking a more agile striker might have done this, but I might be wrong. I'll need to watch it again.

6570~~~
The passing thing like I say is obvious with a complete different set up, and his quality shining through in patches rather than consistently. Sort of like his performances on the wing for Real Madrid. I still have massive hopes for him here, and I hope he can improve.

6571~~~
Got an assist so won't hate on his performance.

What annoyed me was early in stoppage time I think, Blind had the ball at left back, had no options and need Di maria to run closer to the touchline (was in an inside-left position) for the release ball. It was a painfully obvious run to make but he didn't make it. Forced Blind to kick it long and we conceded possession.

6572~~~
Did Nani ever get such an impressive assist return? For all his faults, I get the impression Di Maria's end product in terms of goals and assists will be far superior to Nani's.

6573~~~
Yes, he nearly hit 20 assists in 2010/11 along with 9 goals. People forget how good he was for us during that period.

6574~~~
In 11/12, he had 10 goals and 12 assists
In 10/11, he had 10 goals and 14 assists.

6575~~~
To me though I look at Herrera and how he has changed his game across this season to adapt to the team he is in as opposed to the team he used to be in, Di Maria hasn't done this. I hope he can still come good for us but I personally don't think the unhappy stories are just made up, he doesn't look the fired up player I watched last season for Real Madrid.

6576~~~
Di Maria's assist to Mata wasn't actually that good. He played it to the wrong part of the box and forced JM to pull off a world class finish.

I know that's a churlish thing to bring up since we scored anyway, but I don't consider it an example of a 'good' pass when it was actually mis-hit.

6577~~~
Had he not "miss-hit" the pass, Mata may not have scored; and there'd be no goal or assist to speak of.

6578~~~
09/10 - 6g/15a from 34 games
10/11 - 10g/20a from 49games
11/12 - 10g/15a from 40games
12/13 - 3g/6a from 21 games

too many injuries and inconsistency but great numbers by Nani I guess

diMaria's on similar numbers so far, different money, more ugly and can't do backflip celebrations...

14/15 - 4g/11a from 27 games

6579~~~
Luck has always been a factor in football. That's no revelation. But it wasn't the great pass that people are claiming it to be.

6580~~~
Doesn't have to be. It led to goal and that's all that matters. If, and when, we finish in top 4, we won't be talking about great passes, we'll appreciate the contributions made by players both in terms of numbers and performances on the pitch.

6581~~~
I personally thought we looked worse when he came on but the ball to Mata doesn't get played unless he's on the field. LVG needs to decide whether he wants Angel's brilliance, his tendency to give the ball away and his poor defensive ability or whether he wants to go with predictability.

6582~~~
That's a completely different point to what I'm discussing. The quality of the pass relates to Di Maria's form, which is shit at the moment. Juan Mata's ability to turn it into an assist doesn't make his passing good all of a sudden.

6583~~~
I think all this criticism is massively overblown myself. He's been an important player for us this year and on the whole he's had a good first season. Inconsistent, flaky and careless, yes, but then so was the player we brought him in to replace (Giggs).

6584~~~
Yes, and I'm saying it doesn't matter... He got the assist and that's more important than the quality of the pass...

6585~~~
I'm talking about Di Maria's form. The quality of the pass is the only thing that's relevant.

6586~~~
Yeah it's been way over the top for me. 

Nice pass for the assist today and played another lovely pass for the penalty. Did what he came on to do.

6587~~~
he did ok, but he did ok in a great match for us to win.....

shows the high standards when he plays ok he has an assist and wins a penalty

a nice international break followed by another big performance vrs Villa and we may see the best of Di Maria creeping back in

6588~~~
It was a very good pass. Everyone expected him to go left or shoot and he went the other way and pulled it off which through the defenders off. Of course nothing compared to the increible finish but it was still a very good pass. He did the same for the penalty. That's basiclaly what he came on to do. To stretch liverpool, exploit the space and create some chances. That's exactly what he did do.

6589~~~
Travesty that one of the best counter attacking players around was bought for a team that plays with little pace and prefers to hold  the ball.

Will always be a hit and miss player like Nani but needs to be in a fast system that plays in the counter. 

He was decent today. Nice assist along with so easy dumb moments but that's what he does all the time so get used to it.

6590~~~
The pass for the penalty was better, imo. But Di Maria does have a tendency to play his passes too far ahead or behind the man. He did the same thing for the cross to Rooney later in the game. This game did nothing to convince me that he's got a top class passing game in his locker.

6591~~~
If this bad form continues, yet he still manages to get assists like today and the one against Arsenal; then I wouldn't mind this form.

6592~~~
He's not a playmaker if that's what you're looking for. He's like giggs in that regard. He'll always get a few wrong but he's capable of opening teams right up with some gems which makes him very very dangerous. I'm not sur you need convincing in this regard. He's never been an ozil like passer. What he is, is an attacker who is capable of defense splitting dribbled, passes and crosses who also has a terrific engine. The more comfortable he gets well hopefully see more of the latter.

6593~~~
Thought he was pretty good today. I don't understand people who think he's going to be sold. It's his first season, he's always been a player who's out of form from time to time but it looks like he's getting a bit better again. 

Had the assist for Rooney against Arsenal, his wonderfull assist for Mata and he played in Blind who won the penalty. Does he have 100% pass accuracy? No, but he's one of the players who can lose the ball in van Gaal's system. He's on the pitch to make things happen and he does if he's in form. I'm 100% sure he will be here next season and he will be better.

6594~~~
He just needs more time. I'm sure he will find his best form soon enough and LVG can help him like he did with so many other players

6595~~~
Played a vital role in a goal and a penalty so the criticism shouldn't be too over the top today. We all know he is far from his best at the moment, don't see the point in beating that drum over and over. He's still got an end product on him even now and hopefully next season he'll be back to his roaring best (which is a phenomenal level).

6596~~~
Always frightened, the most timid player of all times.

6597~~~
Awful again yet still assisted one and played the ball to Blind for the penalty.

6598~~~
That's the thing with him... Even way off form, he still makes so many chances (had that moment where he played it just behind Rooney as well). A Di Maria at his best will be lethal for us I think. He just needs his confidence back, which will make the biggest difference in terms of actually going past players 1 on 1 and his normal passing I think. When he finds himself in positions like for Mata's goal, you can always count on him to pick out the pass playing on instinct, even off form.

6599~~~
His decision making was also poor in the beginning of the season, he had also a lot of stupid mistakes. I don't think it's a question of form either, he doesn't seem susceptible to form like normal players. It's not that didn't have his touch today or something like that. His 'form' can change within a match, within a few minutes even. It's not that if he hits a ball completely wrong, he starts to doubt his form or something and loses confidence, no, he just tries again. 

What he should work on is a becoming a bit more solid, and learn that there are moments and places he can't take on a defender, but needs to keep it simple. He should know where and when the leash can come off.

6600~~~
Neither here nor there. But definitely not awful.

6601~~~
He makes things happen but his play has become far too careless. Needs to work harder with his decision making and tracking back. He will always lose the ball on occasions because he's very attack minded and creative but I'd just like to see him get back quicker to help the team when he does lose it.

6602~~~
Hes low on confidence and out of form, we needs to be out of the lime light for a few weeks and he'll be back. 

That said, if PSG wanna pay 60m for him this summer that would be nice, we overpaid for a second tier footballer imo (still our best player) that doesn't seem to suit LVGs style. If we're back in the CL surely we can put that money to use on a more suitable and younger player.

6603~~~
But Adnan doesn't have anywhere near the assist rate or effect on the game as Di Maria

6604~~~
Definitely pretty awful in my opinion. Gave up possession numerous times and once in particular could have cost us a goal.

6605~~~
Watching the Mata goal again, the pass was actually pretty poor. Mata was running full tilt and expected the ball to be played along the floor in front of him, if not for his fantastic technique and agility the ball would have been wasted.

6606~~~
Fair enough, he wasn't as good as the rest of the starters which is to be expected since he was coming off the bench. Still managed an assist that wound up getting us 3 points, so I would say he was in the slightest bit awful. He will come good in time once he is played in the right position under this new revamped side.

6607~~~
Don't doubt he'll come good in time. if he sticks around that is! Brilliant player.

6608~~~
He's not really trying. Obviously regretting coming here

6609~~~
Definitely looks that way. He was just jogging around most of the time he was on.

6610~~~
Irony is that Moyes signings are looking good. Maybe it just takes a season to acclimatise. He'd probably be OK next season if he was up for it. Burglary obviously freaked out his family too much.

6611~~~
Apparently he went straight down the tunnel after the game and one of the coaches had to get him back out to clap the fans. Is that true?

6612~~~
If that's true and along with his piss poor performances I'd take Veratti for him.

6613~~~
it was inventive at best but not a good pass. mata made it by doing the unusual. he'll get an assist but was pretty sh1t and did pretty much fuc4all.

6614~~~
Highly doubt it. Another made up story to try and play on the AdM doesn't want to be here nonsense.

He looked happy enough after Mata scored, and in the pictures in the dressing room after the game.

6615~~~
How is his confidence low? Players lacking confidence hide from the ball and don't play the type of passes he does. They play much easier and safer. He simply tries too much and makes a lot of sloppy passes in the process. This is what he's like. I've seen it loads of times at Real. He completely lacks any patience, but the bonus is he never gives up trying to make something happen.

I'm more pissed off by his lack of work off the ball. He worked his nuts off at Real and he's been lazy here in that regard.

Genuinely think LvG must hate the amount of passes he gifts teams.

6616~~~
Coming on as a sub against 10 men was like cheating.

6617~~~
Falcao and him must have great conversations lately.

"Do you know how much they pay me to sit here?"

"Look at Gerrard, at least I waited until towards the end of the game."

"Mata learned how to score like that from me."

6618~~~
I love how his supporters here claim how fantastic his ball was for the 2nd goal. It was a simple pass that I would expect any half decent premier league midfielder / attacker to make. Other than that he was absolutely appalling. Brutal pass to Rooney when we broke and should have made it 3-0, and misplayed pass after pass other than that. I'm not saying we definitely should sell him, but if we do, this summer, I really won't care all that much. Obviously very talented, and the ideal would be for him to turn it around, but I really couldn't care if we sell him. Would like to see him left out for a while. Really don't care what it does to his confidence. Can't play players just to try and get them confidence. He doesn't deserve to play right now.

6619~~~
Guys, he is a class player. Only his first season new league and new country. Give him time.

6620~~~
It's not just that.

It's the fact that with his attitude, the off field shit, the break in etc... you can see he just doesn't want to be here.

6621~~~
Very poor when he came on. Nearly fecked up a simple pass to Mata for the goal, it was only Mata exquisite skill that made the pass look decent.  His attempted pass to Rooney when clear was atrocious. Countless times he lost position either by being outmuscled or by overrunning the ball.  All in all he was very poor.

6622~~~
He just needs to cut-out those lazy passes and make simpler decisions overall, i can understand him loosing the ball when he is trying to create, every winger does that.
I think a nice vacation will do him good, it's not like has been bad in terms of numbers.

It is a bit funny though that suddently we are clicking without him, considering he is our most expensive signing.

6623~~~
Unless he publicly says something to that effect, I think its best we avoid the mind reading.

6624~~~
I just think he needs a good summer off, getting his act together and come back next year with CL football and fresh legs/mind. By that time, hopefully he has acclimatised to the team/country/culture/language etc. 

If he doesnt want to be here for various reasons, sell him for 60m and invest the money in other players. I dont see a problem if everything was a bit too much for him on and off the field. I have no doubt that he will be at his best again next season. Even if he played at PSG this season, he would probably have a hangover. He needs to accept that Real is the past and start finding his motivation again.

6625~~~
I praised him for the assist but I guess the pass was actually made to look better from Mata's technique.

6626~~~
I really can't. Do you mistake his being out of form for not wanting to be here? Because he's always been a player who relies on that. He wasn't consistent for Real Madrid either.

Of course he's had his struggles whilst settling in, but he's already stated he wants United to be his last club in Europe before moving back to Argentina. The rest has been pure speculation without facts. I doubt the club wants to sell him (unless it's for a huge profit). I'm sure he will be here next season.

6627~~~
It's amazing to think he's played his way out of his starting spot. For such a talented and expensive player, his level of concentration and commitment is lacking right now. His attitude and performance have gone from a minor worry to an outright problem. We were so much more disorganized when he entered the game.

6628~~~
Di Maria strikes me as a very instinctive player who needs the game to be played at a high tempo. When he has too much time to ponder he just seems to make so many careless mistakes in possession.

6629~~~
Nonsense. He was our biggest threat in the second half as shown by the fact he created the first goal, created the chance for the penalty and was inches away from setting up a third for Rooney. He's a brilliant threat on the counter. The criticism about the pass for his assist too...wow. It was a little bit behind Mata, sure, but there's no-one else in the team that would've played that pass in the first place, and why not praise him for intelligently pulling off Skrtel into space and creating that opportunity in the first place?

6630~~~
He will come good because class is permanent.

6631~~~
So you are saying the break in was part of his attitude problem? Makes no sense.

6632~~~
Send him back over to Madrid or fecking PSG. How can anyone be that stupid to wish to be at PSG??? Do you even realise you're at one of the best clubs in the world? We pay huge money you little prick! Is there any stop in this greed? It's becoming an epidemic, you wave a slightly higher number infront of a footballers eyes and they get depressed just because they're not allowed to follow that money due to a contract and want to get out of it by behaving like a spoiled brat??????????????

6633~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think he needs a break. Have him acclimatise to his new surroundings in the summer and come back fresh with CL football next season.

6634~~~
Wasn't really Rooney's mistake as he was expecting the cross to come in front of the defender. It's usually a cross like that, that results in a goal. I felt Di Maria should've have crossed earlier. Still, you can blame the one and the other so I guess it's even on the account. Pity it didn't end in a goal though.

6635~~~
His decision making has been shot but that's completely down to confidence. I'm confident we'll see Di Maria that we saw at Madrid next season.

6636~~~
This. The ball is played behind him, so its not exactly a fantastic pass either. He really needs to get his shit together, because right now, i would not have him start over any of Herrera, Mata, Fellaini, Young or Januzaj, which is just sad considered we broke the bank for him

6637~~~
This drama queen mind reading bullshit seriously needs to stop

6638~~~
People were saying the same shit about Mata and look at them now. Di Maria will be fine. What encourages me about him is that despite his poor form he's still wanting the ball and trying to make things happen.

6639~~~
He'll come good. Its like everyone has forgotten his first few games before he got injured. He was outstanding. Coming after a long season and a long summer into a new league...I'm more than happy to give him time.

6640~~~
It's quite clearly a confidence issue. At the beginning of the season his confidence was up in the sky and he tore teams apart because he's obviously a very talented player. If he manages to weather the storm and sticks around for next season I'm sure he'll come good again. With these types of players when they're good it's breathtaking and when they're bad they're borderline liabilities. He almost cost us the game yesterday.

6641~~~
I'd like to see ADM just get on the pitch and have a dozen or so simple touches to get a feel of the game. He seems to get on and immediately set off on a run that at the minute is invariably ending in losing possession. He's disrupting our flow and while I understand his keenness to impress I think he will be better advised to just get on, see plenty of the ball but keep it simple. We weren't chasing the game yesterday, we were up against ten and simple possession football should have been the remit for Di Maria.

He is the epitome of a footballer trying to hard to make up for a string of indifferent performances. Relax, keep it simple and the performance level will return - hopefully.

6642~~~
Like so many around his age in world football, he needs a break.

6643~~~
That's debatable. 

He certainly helped Liverpool pose a threat though. Almost every chance they created was on a break triggered by Di Maria losing possession cheaply.

6644~~~
Yet, if anything, bringing him on for Young helped Liverpool back into it.

6645~~~
No I meant more like it affected his mental state.

6646~~~
I do think its a confidence issue, yes he might show for the ball but he doesn't know what to do when he gets it, he's just blindly running into a defender or playing a sloppy pass. Those things will be cut out if he gets a few decent games under his belt imo.

6647~~~
That was as bad a performance as I have seen from a sub.... he was woeful, would love to see his stats. 

Gave the ball away, no effort put in either defensively or attacking, poor decision making. Really not sure whats happened. Looks as far behind currently as he did in front at the start of the season. Think its just a blip but wow that was bad. 

He did get an assist obviously and fair enough but maybe one of the two good passes he made. The other a cross as far as Im concerned.

6648~~~
We can forget about him in midfield. Van Gaal won’t let it happen, and I would probably agree with him. To me he’s a player who does a lot of instinctive things excellent when his confidence is high, but at the same tame can feck up simple passes when he has time to think. Our team vs Spurs and Liverpool was very intelligent I would say, positioning and link-up play was excellent. I would say that are Di Maria’s attributes at all.

That said, I believe he will come good next season after a summer break. But now I hope Young starts over him because I’m shit scared every time he gets the ball near the middle of the pitch. 

It is. He probably adds another dimension when we want to counter but he doesn’t seem to fit this possession based football.


Exactly. It’s like he has only one thing in his mind, and that is to get the ball close to the goal as fast as possible. There is no half-measures.

He’s not like Mata though. Mata wasn’t very influential but he wasn’t losing the ball time and time again. He kept it simple, what is the exact opposite to what Di Maria is doing now. I do believe he will come good, however I don’t expect it to happen this season.

Agreed 100%, that’s how I see it. He knows he hasn’t been good this season, so he’s trying too much to impress. In a result he loses the ball a lot and it becomes even worse.

6649~~~
Read somewhere that he went straight down the tunnel and didn't stay on the pitch top clap the fans?

6650~~~
Some would say that's a foul but it is still a contact sport after all.

6651~~~
Yet he created a goal and had a massive hand in winning the penalty which should've killed Liverpool off completely. The only goal they scored was from a mistake from Carrick, not DM.

6652~~~
I really really hope LvG can turn him around. Him back in his best form together with Herrera and Mata behind Rooney would be massive. With Fellaini adding some steel and Blind/Carrick behind we could have a great mix of creativity and power we have missed for some years now.

6653~~~
Exactly. 

I don't understand the hate for di Maria at all. It's like people buy into the he doesn't want to be here newspaper nonsense.

6654~~~
Me neither. I guess it's either fickle or impatient fans. Let him settle down and continue working with LVG and once he hits top form again, he will be our top player no doubt. People need to chill and be less picky

6655~~~
He seems to provoke nothing but admiration and annoyance, there's nothing in between, with every single touch. That's the kind of player he is, in the beginning of the season the annoyance was overshadowed by the admiration, allthough he made a lot of stupid passes to, and now it's the other way around. 

The solution is quite simple, by training the annoying moments should be limited. Limited in numbers, and limited to parts of the pitch and moments in the game. But we must allow a few, because that's the kind of player he is. When 100% keeping of posession is demanded, he'll probably lose his sting.

6656~~~
he was wasteful and i did post it was inventive if you read the post. he was also a div for catching that ball. he also wasted the chance to put rooney in. he gave it away over and over again. he was a threat but didn't do enough v 10 men. that's why the only reason he came on was an injury to young. and right now mata and young are ahead of him. that pass was behind mata and without a wonder goal from him we aren't talking about it.

6657~~~
According to whoscored, our worst passers from yesterday:

Young: 68.8%
di Maria: 73.9%
Fellaini: 74.1%
Blind: 74.2%
Rooney: 77.9%

Created Mata's goal, nearly put Rooney in (who should have collected the pass, regardless) and put Blind in for the penalty. It's a myth that we turned bad when he came on, as he wasn't the one who instigated our decision to sit back and let Liverpool come at us. Definitely not the worst player on the pitch.

6658~~~
Nah, that was just a crap pass. Mata was lucky that a similarly misdirected pass was slow enough that he could adjust and strike a ball that was behind him. 

Good pass in the lead up to the pen though.

6659~~~
Very harsh. To dig that out from a standing position over a couple of player's heads in a short 10 yard distance is very, very difficult. I think every player on the pitch apart from Di Maria and Mata himself would have held onto the ball for 3-4 seconds and opt for the easy square ball to Blind. Even if Mata decided the ball was too difficult to attempt the spectacular, he could have volleyed it over the top in the direction of Fellaini at the far post, which would have been a decent chance.

6660~~~
Agreed. I think he will have a few moments of brilliance this season but next year, we will see him out wide in a 433 with (whisper it) Nani on the other side, or a new signing, and he could be devastating.

Hes a bit of a liability at the moment because we're still playing with caution, and he seems incapable of that approach.

6661~~~
What about Mata?

6662~~~
The thing with the pass to Mata is that, had it been a "better" pass, Mata, most likely, would have been forced onto his right foot, and the opportunity to score may have disappeared. In my opinion, the movement from di Maria was brilliant, he's the quickest to react to Mata's movement; makes himself available for the exchange of passes, and is probably the only person on the pitch who would have attempted to chip the ball back towards Mata. Ok, it probably wasn't as he intended, however, it directly led to the goal and we can't ask for more. 

I have to watch the pass to Rooney again, although he screwed it up, Rooney may still have scored, had he put in more effort to retain the loose ball. 

His pace was a massive threat, and without him, we wouldn't have even had a penalty.

6663~~~
I think he could have easily have put the ball into Mata's stride. Which was, presumably, what Mata was expecting.

All's well that ends well, though. So I'm not really complaining. Just pointing out that the pass was slightly behind its intended target (ditto the pass behind Rooney, referred to above)

6664~~~
This is true. Like I said, all's well that ends well!

6665~~~
In that case it made no sense paying £60m for him on the back of a great season in midfield.  As a winger he has always been inconsistent and sometimes frustrating (and not a £60m winger!)

6666~~~
Agree with the Rooney pass, but think it's very harsh on the pass in question. To get the ball to Mata with that type of ball in that tight a space from a standing start was impressive enough. To expect it to be inch perfect as well would be highly critical, I think Di Maria would have expected Mata to side foot volley it to the back post for a Fellaini header, Mata had other ideas though <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>.

6667~~~
Think the fact that he still doesn't speak English good is another big factor. Yes there's people who speak Spanish at the club, but living in a country where you don't speak the language is probably very difficult for someone.

6668~~~
He came on when we were already struggling. It was impossible for him to change that but of course, didnt really help much either. Still, he had 3 good passes at least and due to his pace brought the ball forward and deep into Liverpool's half. It wasnt vintage di Maria but also not as horrible as some say (who think he was responsible for our poor 2nd half)

6669~~~
There was a difficult 15 minutes in the 2nd half. Liverpool was getting back in it and DiMaria's loss of posession encouraged them. The smart thing to do was to keep posession and slow the game down, smother the fire. Later on he could have a few go's and risk loss op posession but not there and at that moment. That's a matter of reading the whole game, not just tactics and positions.

6670~~~
I think this is a little far fetched. I doubted myself when I first read this but since watching MOTD last night I have to say, no, the pass was not that visionary, Mata was in space and it was the right pass to make, other players would have seen it as well. Really it is quite remarkable that Mata managed to make anything of it. Not criticising Di Maria for the pass, it wasnt easy and it at least found its man, but Ive read so many comments on here that this pass was something special and I just dont see it. The finish was special, the pass was just as pass.

6671~~~
On the other hand, he wanted to show the manager that he should be starting and therefore played to risky. Not an excuse but an explanation. In addition, he had 3 quality balls which should have resulted in 2 goals at least

6672~~~
This is correct. Many have called the pass a bad one, which it, most definitely, wasn't. If a pass leads to a goal, then it was good enough to create the goal. The pass may not have been special, however, di Maria's movement, speed of thought and vision was very good, in the lead up to the goal.

6673~~~
He can move into the middle and Rooney becomes lone striker. LVG loves to tinker and i dont think we will see a set 1st XI but rather a 13-14 who rotate regularly.

6674~~~
I saw Ashley Young was hobbling yesterday during the match in the 2nd half. That's why Di Maria went on. 99% sure LvG was just being cautious and taking Young off. Sorry if this is obvious but I've seen people post that this sub was bad but it was done out of necessity.

6675~~~
His effort, or lack of it, yesterday was pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. There was one moment where he was just walking back from an offside position, all the while Mata/Herrera/Rooney et el were busting a gut to get back into position.

I can take bad performances, mis-placed passes, poor shots etc etc It happens. But not even trying is just criminal, and unforgivable, especially in a game like yesterdays. If he wants to carry on like this then he can stay on the bench as far as I'm concerned.

6676~~~
Other than a goal, and probably half the others. Exaggeration doesn't help here.

Overall he was so off his game it was crazy. Yet he spotted Mata's run and had the vision and technique to play that pass, the pass to Blind was inch perfect (outside of the boot) and if Rooney had waited for a second/di Maria passed it a little in front, he would have ended up with 2 assists and a pass that lead to a penalty. If we can get him in any sort of form this team will be deadly.

6677~~~
feck the assist - I gave him a rating of 3. He gets those smart moments, but the fact that he was so careless in possession when the need of the hour was to recycle the ball clearly shows that his mind is just not on the game anymore. He nearly cost us the game with his ridiculousness. Its unfortunate, because he was never so callous at Madrid. Yes, he did have long range shots and extravagant passes at times; but he knew when he had to maintain possession - he was an intelligent player there. When the game was screaming for some calm, he tried to be oversmart.

6678~~~
Thats what I thought too. But yesterday he was the laziest player on the pitch, despite having just come on.

Its unacceptable. At one point he was just blatantly just not trying.

6679~~~
Oh come on, who here wasn't hoping for us to slaughter them once Gerrard went off and when ADM came on, hoping that he'd cause them nightmares. I certainly wasn't thinking, oh look here comes ADM, he'll help calm us down and just hold onto the ball. Instead was hoping he'll help us drive them back. Which he tried to do and my guess is that he was sent out with those instructions.

We'd already conceded the impetus prior to him coming on and was not the sole or even primary reason for Liverpool looking more threatening with 10 men. ADM's problem was not that he didn't take care of the ball by playing the safe passes, it seemed to make the wrong choices on a few occasions in attacking and that I put down to him just wanting too desperate to make things happen. I think we are going to see the best of him very soon with the whole team playing well, he'll be a little more patient when needed because he can be, he won't need to be the one does everything.

6680~~~
Agreed. It was a good sub from LVG telling them that we weren't going to sit on our lead, and he helped with the assist for the 2nd.
It was like he was under instructions to make something happen every single time he got the ball (Or he was desperate to make an impact), but mixed with that he was also very careless and not on the same wavelength as the rest.

6681~~~
I think it's a mental problem; I distinctly remember him, during the early parts of the season, constantly tracking back and never giving up. Like some have said, the international break will do him some good, he'll be able to refresh as well as getting out of the country, and sort himself out. I do think we're just picking on him, at times; he's still putting in the effort, as seen in his attacking play over the last two games. All players will be guilty of lapses in concentration, especially those who seem be suffering from off the field issues.

6682~~~
I'd like to see him start against Villa. It's a good chance for him to find form and we should beat them easily even if he underperforms

6683~~~
Mata's pass was a 1,2 it was really the obvious thing to do
The Rooney pass was a bad pass
The pass to Blind was a good one, but when Blind is open with a lot of space running into the box and you are being marked on the left side, i really don't see how you have any other options except to pass it to him.

Seems like Di Maria is being praised for making obvious decisions (albeit in a fancy way), our attack was relatively worse when he came on, which is not entirely his fault, as we became complacent and Rooney had a terrible game, he still lost the ball a lot though, and you can go on about how he is meant to lose the ball and all that crap - it doesn't justify the fact that he loses the ball way too much, he is our main man so naturally he gets to receive the ball a lot and only has 3-4 great moments (being generous) and a host of crap ones.... do those 3 good moments justify his other bad ones? are we supposed to be excited that our star player can only create 2 great chances a game and do feck all for the rest of the game?

6684~~~
Is his finding form more important than maintaining our current team chemistry?

6685~~~
The differing of opinions on him is hilarious. Some people saying his pass to mata was a bad one? Blaming him for trying to spot runs instead of doing a turn back tony every time he gets the ball. Fair enough he should have worked harder but we didn't sign di Maria to be this safe player. His pass to mata is clearly one only he would try and pull off in our team, and it wasn't just the pass it was the vision and speed of thought to put it there in the first place. Something he has a habit of doing in almost every game he plays yet you would think he screws everything up going by some comments. I can live with daft moments but if he delivers match winning assists then feck it. He can clearly play better but I can't believe how much he's getting slated.

6686~~~
Exaclty. The pass to mata was such a great spot. Di Maria has that cutting edge going forward that we lack. Good form, bad form, he always creates chances.

not entirely true. Young didn't make mistakes but offered very little going forward and rooney was rubbish.

6687~~~
Rooney won us the game by simply being on the pitch. 
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

6688~~~
Di Maria and Falcao are this season's version of last season's Fellaini and Young. You just watch them prove everyone wrong next season

6689~~~
There was one moment yesterday where he made a run into the area, the ball was intercepted, and all our attacking players started running back to get into position...expect Di Maria, who just casually started walking out of the area, despite having come on just a few minutes a go. He clearly couldn't be bothered. 

I've defended him a lot on here, but that sort of behavior (especially in a game against our biggest rivals) is unforgivable. We've seen him busting a gut for RM and Argentina so many times, so to see him just walking around with minimal effort is unacceptable.

6690~~~
He was better than Rooney and Young but that's not saying much. That was Rooney's worst match in ages and Young didn't do much either.

At the end of the day he was coming off the bench to play against 10 men in a game where we were utterly dominant and the opposition could be expected to tire as the game went on and leave more and more spaces at the back when they pressed for an equaliser. You don't get a better chance for Di Maria to shine than a situation like that. So any excuse based around him being "<i>not as good as the rest because he was coming off the bench</i>", makes no sense at all.

He wasn't awful and had a couple of good moments, in amongst giving the ball away cheaply and messing up a number of promising situations by poor decisions (catching the ball - wtf?) and/or a poor final ball. So, fairly standard for his United career to date and the reason he started our biggest game of the season so far on the bench.

Which can only go down as a crushing disappointment from a player who arrived with such fanfare (and at such cost) Especially when we let go a player who seems more than capable of matching his contribution this season to create space for him in the squad (Nani).

Obviously, debut season in a new league blah blah. So we can expect much more from him next season. The criticism his performances are getting are entirely warranted, though. Saying he's been disappointing is not the same thing as saying he will never be good enough. He needs to improve almost every aspect of his game to deserve the "galactico" tag he arrived with. Hopefully he will.

6691~~~
You can see he has the quality and has shown it at times. It is clear he has struggled to settle into living here, which is usually normal. But with the huge price tag and expectation it is never going to be accepted. He has no confidence at all as you saw yesterday, he was rushing thing and looked nervy on the ball and made the wrong decisions. Hopefully he turns out good for us.

6692~~~
Falcao won't be here next year.

6693~~~
For how much we've paid for him, this is just not good enough to me.  His lob to Mata was very professionally done but he gave it away too many times and he still looks disconnected from the other players when he's trying to execute.  How many times have seen him make passes with no one making the run that he expects/hopes for?

6694~~~
Very different situations though, to be fair. I don't think people were incredibly shocked when Fellaini or Young were having poor seasons. While they're not awful players, their form this season could arguably distract us from the fact that they're generally not top class players, and would generally be seen as squad players who could earn a first team place when in form.

Di Maria and Falcao were bought in order to be world class performers who could be among the best players in the league for us. I still have some faith that Di Maria can turn it around (Falcao probably won't be here so he's very unlikely to do so), but the criticism for both largely stems from how they've under-performed compared to what we've expected of them.

6695~~~
It's home to Villa, it shouldn't matter. If he's poor then put Young back in for the next game.

6696~~~
1) It wasn't the obvious thing - the obvious would be to ensure we keep possession of the ball, by passing sideways or backwards. 
2) The pass was actually more difficult than it looked. If I remember correctly, he had two options: a) either pass infront of Skirtel, which would allow Skirtel to intercept or b) completely neutralise Skirtel by passing behind, however the curl of the ball would probably take it away from Rooney. He chose option B and the ball curled away from Rooney; I think Rooney should have held is run.
3) We created far more opportunities with him on the pitch; the only clear cut chance we had before he came on was the Mata goal.
4) Young lost the ball more than him, Blind and Fellaini were equals; and all three started the game.
5) No, but do you know what risks are? Have people forgotten the days when Ronaldo would take the ridiculously stupid freekicks which involved quite a bit of risk. He missed about 70% of the freekicks he took. However, was it worth the risk? Yes
6) In the <b>35 minutes</b> he played, we scored one and should have scored another. We looked really threatening on the break, too.

I'm not sure why di Maria's receiving most of the criticism. His job was to utilise his pace and hit Liverpool on the counter, on every possible occasion. Therefore, he's bound to lose the ball, as the game completely changed from what it was like before he came on. Liverpool were angered, the crowd was hostile and we were under pressure. He wasn't the only one who gave the ball, so stop acting as if he was. Yes, he was lazy, at times, there's no excuses for that; however, something is clearly wrong and he seems to be going through a rough patch.

6697~~~
Every game matters though, we take a home game against Villa for granted and fail to win then the away game against Everton becomes a must win, don't forget we still have the teams currently ranked 1st,2nd and 3rd in the league to play.

6698~~~
I think the occasion may have got to him, especially given that his first touch was that terrific catch he took. He didn't seem comfortable passing the ball backwards, which contributed to some of his loose passes. The international break will do him a world of good.

6699~~~
I don't think suggesting playing Di Maria instead of Young is underestimating Villa. I'd keep the rest of the front 6 the same. Young is playing quite well but he's hardly undroppable.

6700~~~
Yep. If he finishes the season as well as he started then all will be forgiven. The better weather might help sort his head out too.

6701~~~
When Mata gives you a pass at the edge of the box and runs inside the box unmarked and you have 3 defenders on you, then the obvious thing would be to pass it to Mata, you don't have to be a genius to do that.

The pass to Rooney was terrible, we outnumbered them in the counter he had enough space and time to call his wife on the phone to prepare his favourite dish for him after the game, he should have played it to Rooney's feet not behind him, surely you can't blame Rooney for not being able to score from a pass that didn't even reach him?

Di Maria created the same number of chances as Fellaini, as a team we created only 4 chances in the whole game(so we didn't create far more opportunities with him on the pitch), in the 64th minute alone Di Maria was dispossessed by Can and Henderson and Skrtel in the 61st minute - the most by a United player and he came on in the second half(55th minute), he had 2 failed crosses  and only managed to attempt 1 tackle all game which was a failed one on Sturridge, even Falcao attempted 3 tackles in the game even if only 1 was successful.

It is one thing to be a risk taker, it is another to waste the majority of the balls given to you as the star man of a team, if he had played against Spurs we would not have won 3-0.

6702~~~
We should use some of the adidas money to build a dome around Old Trafford. Keep the stadium warm with an artificial sun, which should keep our warm weather lovers content.

6703~~~
We can go on and on with this, however, that wouldn't be wise.

Fact that matters: He has 4 goals and 12 assists, thus, has been the most creative of all our players. He's contributed to 16 goals in 23 starts. That, for me, is enough to warrant a starting place. He may give the ball away, he may miss hit a cross or an easy pass, however, that doesn't matter if your end product is as good as his. We didn't buy him to retain possession, or make tackles, we bought him to create and he's doing that absolutely fine. Oh, and only one player in the league has more assists. If you're going to criticise him for his distinct laziness, at times, fair enough, but if you're going to bang on about tackles, failed crosses, chances created, then you're looking at the wrong player.

6704~~~
You didn't just underestimate Villa, you said "a home game against them shouldn't matter", well it should, We can't afford to lose our winning chemistry to accommodate Mr £60m, Villa will hit us with the counter, just like Burnley did, and if thats the case Young > Di Maria, Di Maria loses the ball a lot and doesn't track back, Young on the other hand can afford to at least tackle somebody.

We already have a winning formula, i think we should work on maintaining it for now.

6705~~~
Yes, lets just forget his 23 straight games without an assist, if you are going to just throw in assists to justify his performances then you are basically admitting that you know he is shit, but he has good numbers, of course he has 12 assists i gave you stats and you run to his assists , 4 of those came at the beginning of the season when he was fired up, 3 of those came in games where he did feck all, 1 was a penalty he won, and the rest are from set pieces so of course he has 12 assists, 1 was in the FA CUP, do these assists channel his performances ?.......feck no.

Ah..yes, the whole "he can afford to be lazy, he can afford to have failed crosses,no tackles,same chances created as Fellaini" and all that crap because he isn't "that type of player", that is not his job, it certainly isn't Rooney's job but he still does it, it isn't Aguero's job, or Costa's job or Hazard but they all still do it, attempting to tackle a player isn't a job designated to only defensive players, being lazy should not be excused because your job is to assist, what kind of player only knows how to assist? did we pay £60m for a one dimensional player? who wastes more balls than the average player?


Over Glorified Nani™

6706~~~
What? He didn't go 23 games without an assist. He's been inconsistent, but you must be doing something right if you're still able to contribute towards the objective?

Why would judge an attacking player for not making tackles? If they can contribute defensively, then well done, if they don't but create chances going forward, then well done.

If we bought di Maria for his defensive ability, to tackle, and to intercept, then I'm afraid we've bought the wrong player. However, if we bought him to create chances, score the odd goal, utilise his speed and to help defensively, then we're good.

My word your opinion is ridiculous... every player can be afforded mistakes, which is why there are 11...

6707~~~
Depressing that a £60m player hasn't made himself an uncontentious and automatic starter. 

Having to keep reminding myself that there is still time for him to turn things around, new league, settling in, yadda yadda yadda. Because when I don't, my confidence that Di Maria is going to work out as a United player is pretty low.

6708~~~
I am not judging an attacking player on tackles don't simplify my argument, i am judging an attacking player on his overall performance in a game, him not attempting a tackle is just appalling, but that is not my whole point.

We bought Di Maria for his overall ability, who pays £60m for only assists ? yet you act like his overall performances don't matter as long as he can average  1 assist every other game (he doesn't even do that), what is the point of utilising his speed when he will eventually get dispossessed? we created more chances against Spurs than we did against Liverpool so he really doesnt have as much impact as you think he does.

Every player can be afforded mistakes, but when they make more mistakes (lose the ball) than every other player on the pitch they shouldn't be criticised for it? some logic that.... there are 11 players in a team but in our team there are 9 players, 1 GK and 1 star man who must and usually does have the ball for the majority of the game and does feck all with it, its one thing when Fellaini is being dispossessed a lot , we can afford to overlook it because the players will stop giving him the ball, its another when its Di Maria, he will continue to get the ball, infact for every good play from Di Maria we usually get 10 terrible ones afterwards.

Score 1 goal assisted by Di Maria and lose 5-1 because we couldn't create anymore chances, by your logic Di Maria should be praised for the assist and not criticised for not producing more.

6709~~~
i wouldn't change the team unless there's a reason. and his play isn't a good enough reason IMO.

6710~~~
He has apparently justified his price tag by the delusionals on here, we should be expected to spank our monkeys to his 12 assists and 4 goals and act like he has been our player of the season, his performances don't matter, ask them about his performances they reply "what performances" and begin to throw his numbers at your face.

He is lazy? wasteful? easily dispossessed? "not his job mate", he wasn't signed to hold possession, he was signed to assist, he is the only player in the world that shouldn't be concerned with holding the ball or not being wasteful - because "not his job".

6711~~~
I didn't mean the result doesn't matter, obviously. I meant whether it's Young or AdM on the left should not matter as to the result.

6712~~~
Is anyone actually really saying this?

6713~~~
on the contrary, his play is a very good reason to leave him out.

6714~~~
scroll up

6715~~~
CH made some decent points though: he actually has been fairly productive so far, and more so than a number of people would have you believe. He's also admitted that it's fair enough to criticise him on his laziness. Granted, he's probably giving him a bit too much leeway on his performances which have often been quite dire, but simply branding him delusional, and acting as if he's expecting us to worship Di Maria, is a bit extreme.

6716~~~
He has to be better than he has shown us so far, that is obvious. But taken some comfort from the fact that people frequently take a while to settle when they move to England. He's not been good enough so far, but that doesn't mean he never will be. 

I hold onto that thought and I find it provides a modicum of comfort.

6717~~~
Read my posts and your posts, again. Pointless arguing when you say stuff like "lets just forget his 23 straight games without an assist". Lets just stop.

6718~~~
Perhaps, i wasn't referring to only CH though, the delusional comments are even before my argument with CH

6719~~~
Didn't take long for people to turn on him. Really some fickle fans here. As someone else pointed out, 12 assists and some goals is not too bad and just because he's off form doesn't mean he lost his ability

6720~~~
Was under the impression we stopped a while ago, the only thing keeping you in the argument was his 12 assists which don't really tell the whole story, but hey when we signed him for £60 million to do nothing other than assist i guess we should all be happy and hail him as one of the great players this season.

6721~~~
Yeah, depends on LVG's plan tbh, based on the Spurs game we are better off with Young.

6722~~~
You really do like to spout rubbish? I mentioned his assists once, maybe twice. I don't hail him as a king. I appreciate his contributions whilst also considering the problems he's had to face, during his time here.

6723~~~
lol , right. some players take time some don't. some never settle and some play great from the first kick off. his early games were his best , far from settling he's gone backwards. ruud just scored goals from the get go. JSV best games were early on. which will this guy be?

6724~~~
Even if he 'settles', so to speak, what suggests he'll actually be all that consistent, and wont still have people just as frustrated?
Wasn't he really inconsistent/frustrating until last season? Maybe last season was the outlier.

How good should we actually expect a 'settled' Di Maria to be?

6725~~~
That's the big worry. Not all that long ago you'd get half the people on here laughing in your face if you suggested a straight swap with Nani.

One season later and we're breaking the English transfer to sign him, with the consensus being we've done a great bit of business.  Have to say, I would struggle to think of many other playes whose stock rose so much, so quickly, at a similar age and didn't turn out to be having a freak season they never repeated again.

6726~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So true.
We'll see how it goes with him, I guess. I wont be surprised if next season (assuming he's still here) it's still a case of one 8/10, followed by a 6/10, followed by a 4/10.. rinse repeat.

By the sounds of it, what you can expect from Di Maria, even at his best, is quite a lot of frustration, quite a few misplaced passes, but a moment of magic via an assist or two. Last year at Madrid seems to have involved this specialist role, and maybe a degree of playing for a pay-rise.
I'm guessing what we're now seeing is closer to the usual Di Maria who, as you say, wasn't considered any better than Nani 18 (?) months ago.

6727~~~
Once again the damn train line behind the south stand would get in our way <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

6728~~~
He's being left out right now.

6729~~~
I re-watched the match and I wish I could change my rating for di Maria. He really was awful apart from the assist. Just gave the ball away constantly.

6730~~~
This is what I noticed as well. di Maria was frequently a threat on our left side whenever he received the ball on the break, but his decision-making let us down so many times. Even then, he caused several problems for Liverpool's right side with his dribbling and adventurousness, but his poor decision-making meant that he couldn't be as dangerous as he could have been. Even then, he got a good assist and played a sweet pass for Blind to win the penalty.

He seems to be trying too hard at the moment. He just needs to relax and not worry too much about trying to put in a perfect performance. If he can focus more on his own game, I'm sure that he can get back to his best.

6731~~~
He helped us bringing the ball out of our own box and make sure Liverpool couldnt press all the time. He wasnt very accurate with his passing or decision making, but still, he was not as bad as some make out. 3 good passes which should have or should have led to 3 goals

6732~~~
For sure, he was still not as bad as many are making him out to be, but I just thought that, if he was more reliable and better in the decisions he made in the final third, we'd have made more of the 1-man advantage than we did in the second half.

6733~~~
I honestly think he's going to be one of the best players in the league next season.

6734~~~
Duncan Castles has written an article saying he wants out and has instructed Mendes to get him a move, LvG is happy for it but Woody not so much.

Quite clearly gone in my opinion, doesn't look arsed and think it's only a matter of time before the PSG links spring up again - obviously his 1st choice but FFP screwed it up last summer.

Still think we will get good money for him, or at least dibs on one of their players - weren't we linked with Marquinhos? Maybe Lucaus or Zlatan <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Edit: link <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2892/transfer-zone/2015/03/24/10134442/van-gaal-fall-out-prompts-di-maria-to-seek-summer-manchester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2892...ut-prompts-di-maria-to-seek-summer-manchester</a>

6735~~~
Pretty much this.

6736~~~
Nothing so far has supported that though, he's becoming steadily worse.

6737~~~
Quite clearly gone based on a Duncan Castles goal.com report <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You must hate April fools day.

6738~~~
Nah, he's said that he wants United to be his last club in Europe. We're not moving him after a year.

6739~~~
I wish someone would do a poll asking who thinks he will still be here next season. The only way he is still here imo is if no one will pay the fee or wages for him, he doesn't want to be here imo, this isn't just bad form.
He's a shadow of the player who looked amazing in those first 5 or 6 games and his lack of effort is obvious to see, he doesn't even attempt to run with the ball anymore.

I hope i'm dead wrong with this by the way because he really could destroy teams if he gets his form back but i don't think its going to happen.

6740~~~
When you've tasted Madrid and Spanish life and have no affection for United then I can 100% see why he would be unhappy here.

6741~~~
I agree with that, he just doesn't look like he wants to play here anymore and is just going through the motions.

6742~~~
Don't think Aguero gave a feck about City before he became a club legend, he still executed his job perfectly and he came from said "Madrid and Spanish life".

We signed the wrong player from La Liga last summer

6743~~~
I genuinely don't think Aguero saw City as a step down though. They (at the very least) looked better placed to win trophies in the next few years than Atletico. Whereas, frankly, Di Maria <i>did</i> see us as a step down.

And yeah, they come across as completely different characters too. Whether or not Aguero "gave a feck about City", he sure gave a feck about getting himself a few of the trophies within reach. Arguably, Di Maria doesn't even have that worry, with what he's won.

I'd say Toure's move is more comparable to Di Maria's, and for all his supposed character faults, you can't question his commitment to the cause once he joined City. He looked as fired up for it as anyone.

I don't know what to expect, to be honest.. maybe a few warmer months and a break will do Di Maria some good.

6744~~~
Probably should have used Sanchez for that analogy, but yeah he doesn't seem to care about United, but what exactly is a player who cares about United supposed to do to be fair? perhaps we are misjudging his character, he seems laid back, didn't really look like he gave a feck about the World Cup back in June, perhaps its just a matter of your previous point, where we bought an average player off a golden season... which would be bad P.R for the club.

*Fast forward to August where top agents are queuing for us to break the bank for their clients...because,Di Maria*.

6745~~~
No I said he is quite clearly gone in my opinion (not based on this report). He clearly doesn't give a feck and is only here because he couldn't get into PSG, he almost has to be dragged to clap the fans after a game. 

Re Castles, like most journalists he spouts shit, but he also gets stuff right, not saying either way in this case. However Di Maria being unhappy surfaced long before this report.

Anyone that thinks Di Maria actually wants to be here is kidding themselves.

6746~~~
It'll be interesting to see what Woodward does if PSG come in with a resonable bid. You'd assume (either behind the scenes or publicly) Di Maria will angle for the move. The ball would be in Woodward's court, and he'll be anxious to save face.
Quite frankly, there's no positive spin you can put on selling a £59.7 million man after a season. Maybe that's where Bale would come in?

Di Maria or no Di Maria, things are looking positive for next season. I'm excited about the window. I don't think van Gaal will lose sleep either.

6747~~~
Watched the game again last night. He was absolute wank. Even worse than I remembered from first viewing. Sure, there were two decent passes (the second of which I reckon even I could pull off) but almost every other involvement ended in him losing the ball. Often in very promising situations. Plus his work-rate was non-existent. On at least two occasions he was literally walking back from an offside position, forcing us to play a couple more passes while waiting for him to drag his arse onside.

Dunno what the feck is going on. How much is him acclimatising to the league, how much his head being wrecked by the burglary, how much is him wishing he had never moved and how much is the inconsistency he's always had as a player. Possibly a combination of all four? Whatever, it's <i>very</i> hard to be patient with someone who simply isn't making enough effort on the pitch. That's just unacceptable.

6748~~~
When I was a kid we got burgled, I was probably around 8 years old or so. 

I reckon I would have probably gone to Oxford if that hadnt happened. Extraordinary trauma. Quite shocking, looking back, that my mum still made me go to school and didnt send me to a villa in the Mediterranean for 12 months R&R.

6749~~~
Hopefully we don't drive a player who actually wants to be here away,wouldn't care about his well being if he was putting in decent performances and not 2 good passes and feck all.

6750~~~
He reminds me a lot of Di Maria I used to see for Real Madrid around 2011, very frustrating to watch and almost exclusively taking the wrong option. He should still be capable of the odd brilliant play - he would have had three assists on Sunday if Rooney hadn't been ahead of the ball, which truth be told was because of a poor pass, and Can hadn't fouled Blind - but it's not enough to warrant a starting place in a side that functions much better as a team without him.

There's still a part of me that believes that he could still turn this around and go back to his self from last season or early stages of this season where he was frankly excellent, but this hasn't been working out for him. You of all people should be well aware that I've put his form mainly down to wrong position/team not playing well, both points are moot right now as given his current form he couldn't possibly excel in any position on the pitch - he doesn't seem to possess the basic tools of a footballer, let alone a €70m one.

Funnily, if Madrid hadn't sold him to us and we got one of their Summer signings instead - preferably Rodriguez because I don't really see any need for Kroos in our current team - we'd probably be much better off and so would they.

6751~~~
Sanchez was a steal for Arsenal, mega shame we didn't get him. Immense value for money.

6752~~~
Pity Sanchez actually seem to want a move to Arsenal as well, maybe if we had Champs League he would be at OT today.

6753~~~
Genuinely starting to wonder whether or not Di Maria has decided he's had enough of being a Man Utd player. The recurring speculation about a move elsewhere, and Van Gaal's willingness to tell the press he wouldn't stand in the way of him leaving United, makes me wonder whether Mendes has already come to some sort of understanding with United about what it would take for the club to let him leave.

I don't think its true he doesn't care. He looked delighted to beat Liverpool in the post game photos, and the picture Herrera's El Pais interview paints of him is of someone who isn't skulking about Carrington. However, I don't think he loves working with Van Gaal so much that he would stick around if offered a chance to go somewhere sunny. Especially after the break in.

6754~~~
Apparently the draw was living in London. Hence he also rebuffed Liverpool.

6755~~~
Still can't believe we spent a whole summer chasing after the wrong Chilean.

6756~~~
Are you talking about Vidal?
His performances for Juve have been subpar this season and is not worth anything near what Juve were asking for him.
If we want a solid box to box CM from Serie A then Nainggolan is probably our best bet this season.

6757~~~
Yeah, thats my point, we should have chased Alexis instead

6758~~~
The rumor is that he wanted London and a club in CL.

6759~~~
I was nervous with him on the pitch. We were already virtually playing with 10 men as Rooney was stinking up Anfield as he usually does. If he's going to stay long-term he needs to sort himself out over the summer. But hopefully between now and the end of the season he can still contribute.

6760~~~
must have worked out for him in the end

6761~~~
He always seem to play his passes behind the man. It's like he's an NPC from Goldeneye 64. He can't predict where runners will end up.

6762~~~
Well, he made a choice.

6763~~~
LVG allegedly told him to bulk up, we might see a new and improved Di Maria next season. As far as this season is concerned, we can manage a couple of cameos and golden assists from him.

6764~~~
I've never seen a United player more terrified of getting hurt. Maybe it's got something to do with altered priorities after the attempted break-in. If he can't fix it, he doesn't deserve to be at the club.

6765~~~
If we play Di Maria as winger in every game, yeah we should have signed Alexis instead. If we use him as the flexible player he is in the right system and as a CM/CAM like Real with the right attacking players in front of him, I still think he will be brilliant. People also shouldn't act like he was shit at Real except last year, even in his first season he was good, his second season was very good and consistent as winger too, his third was disappointing and frustrating, but then he delivered his best season there, so we shouldn't write him off after one year.

Also I can't agree that he doesn't look arsed, it's the opposite for me, he is trying too much, especially against Liverpool, you could see that he was desperate to do something of note and especially when you are not great in form a lot of things are going wrong then. Of course he is frustrated with his current situation, but that doesn't mean he will look for the first exit and I don't believe for one second that we will sell him after one year. van Gaal also put him in the "Robben role" and there are rumours that he is the only one who is allowed to dribble in the training, so he obviously knows how important he can be when he uses his potential.

6766~~~
I dont think he is going anywhere. He is really our only X factor. That only guy who when on the ball, you don't know what to expect. Assisted in the emirates, Anfield and I think it was his freekick that led to the equaliser vs Chelsea wasnt it? Thats a lot of big moments for a flop.

The talent is there, the decision making will improve.

6767~~~
Watched the match from start to finish again last night. Convinced his issue is a psychological one related to his decision making, which many creative/flair players have. They take more creative chances than your ordinary run of the mill attackers. When things work they look like Gods, when they don't the fan pitchforks come out (see Nani). LvG and staff just need to refocus his creative senses towards the overall strategy of retaining the ball and making better choices. At that point, Di Maria will seem like a different player.

6768~~~
For me its just a settling in period. Di Maria didn't get to the level he's been at the last two seasons by being inconsistent this isnt him. He burst onto the scenes here too. He's just like the team in some ways taking time to now bed in. Often the case with foreign players lets not forget that.

I think we'd be stupid to sell him and we wouldn't either way. Once he hits top form he'll be a huge player for us.

Dont get me wrong I gave him a 2 for his performance on Sun, he's nowhere near this currently.

6769~~~
It's funny how so many of you keep saying, "it's so obvious he doesn't want to be here, he'll be off in the summer, etc."

Ah ok, so you've spoken personally to him then? He has told you that he's getting out of Manchester ASAP and absolutely hates it here? Please.

If there's any indication from the interviews (can't recall which specific one) he's done this season, he's here to stay. Some of you read way too much and place way too much credit on body language. Was he shit against Liverpool? Yes his general play was pretty frustrating, but he still managed an incredible assist that made the difference. He also made a great pass to Blind that led to the penalty.

All things considered he is obviously a very talented player, and I think he will really make a big impact next season for us. Just wait. no matter how good a player may be, all players take different times settling into new leagues and a new place to live. He'll be just fine.

6770~~~
Yeah all the "he's off in the summer, he doesn't like it here" stuff is getting a bit tedious.

6771~~~
There is nothing incredible about Di Maria's pass to Mata. Watch it again, he plays it behind Mata forcing him to do the scissors kick. Mata's quick thinking and skill made the most out of a very average pass

6772~~~
Its true nobody knows what is going on, its all speculation. 

But him not wanting to be here makes a lot more sense to me than "he's trying too hard." Talk about clutching at straws.

6773~~~
Did you not see:

"PSG, I think they had a money problem and they couldn't buy players," the Argentine said in an interview with <i>Telefoot</i>. "<b>This is the main reason I didn't go there</b>. Playing in the French league would please a lot of players"

So if he had the choice he would have gone to PSG.

6774~~~
Ok, it was like half a yard behind Mata. Why does it matter? It was still a very good pass that I would argue not many players (besides Mata himself and Herrera) are capable of making. 

It's like people are doing anything they can to discredit what Di Maria does sometimes. He has 12 assists this season and consistently creates more chances than any other player on our team. Clearly is doing something right.

6775~~~
Fair enough. Though he also hasn't come out and said, "Yeah I really dislike Manchester United and I hate the city, so I'll be looking for a move this upcoming summer." 

Again it's all speculation, but it's clear that Real Madrid didn't want him anymore. So if PSG was his first choice why does it matter in the end? He's still playing for a top club, and arguably the most prestigious club in the world. I would take a bet and say that he's pretty content at the moment. It's not like he's stuck at a club like Liverpool.

6776~~~
I would argue the opposite. People are trying to give Di Maria credit, which is natural considering what he represents, an expensive, galactico signing we are all desperate to see succeed. But do you really believe only three people in our squad could have made that pass to Mata? Really? People are desperate to credit Di Maria with this extraordinary vision for spotting it but I honestly think plenty of others could have done it. Blind, Carrick, Rooney, RVP, Fellaini as long as he was using his chest... and others.

6777~~~
He needs to start v Chelsea in a few weeks.
Chelsea will have Terry / Cahill and Matic up against Fellani. The Ariel power he had over the last few games will be largely nullified.
They're a tired team so the pace of Di Maria with the movement and quick passing could be utilised more effectively.
That's almost a month away but I guarentee Van Gaal has already thought about it.

6778~~~
Ok, that is fair. 

My main point being in all of this is that Di Maria still creates a lot of chances and does it consistently more than any other player in our current squad. Even with his "shit" performances, he is still making a quantifiable impact nearly every game.

6779~~~
OK, yes. He is. We need more but he is making an impact. Which is hardly surprising seeing as he has such fantastic ability. 

This really is a rerun of the whole Nani thing. Obviously held to quite exacting standards but that's only because his ability is so bloody obvious.

6780~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6781~~~
Like wise, those who speculate he wants to leave are fabricating bullsh*t. If it were true, then I'm positive the club would be aware, and he wouldn't even be on the bench. We have Radamel Falcao, although seriously out of form, who genuinely wants to be here and needs game time to imrove, yet doesn't get to start much as someone, who wants to be in Paris, is playing ahead of him. There's Wilson, Januzaj, Mata who have had very little game time, in recent months, who would be starting ahead of di Maria if there was a hint of him wanting to leave. Then there's training, which occurs 5 days a week, where he's obviously doing something right to continually be in the starting eleven, week after week. We're all aware of past instances of LvG demonstrating his attitude to those who challenge him, he comes across as a guy who doesn't take sh*t from anyone, and if he believed that di Maria wanted to leave, then he would not play him, as much. 

I think you posted, a few pages back, about a burglary which, you stated, never really affected you, and you got on with life, as normal. I, too, went through something similar, and it actually affected me without me every realising. I got on with life as normal, however, when I look back at it, it took me 6 months to fully recover from the incident. People will manage certain situations in very different ways, and some may take more time to recover than others. It's something that's obviously playing on his mind, which has seen him move away from he house he was living in. 
Give him time, let him recover both from this bad patch of form and the break in; we'll see the best of di Maria, next year, as he's not going anywhere.

6782~~~
I was being facetious with that post, I understand it affects people completely differently. OK Im trying to be sympathetic, I dont really feel it but that's my issue, I accept it is reasonable. 

There isnt much for me to disagree with in your fist para. I said in the post you replied to, we dont know what's going on, its all speculation. Tho there are parts of it that confuse me, Ill be honest. Like, who said anything about Di Maria challenging Van Gaal? Challenging his authority and being unhappy and wanting to leave are quite different things. I dont know if Van Gaal has a reputation for ruthlessly punishing those who are unhappy or whose families are unhappy? I imagine Van Gaal makes his selections on merit, on who plays well and does what he tells them to do. But then I cant claim to know what's going on with his selections, Mata was out for ages based on nothing I can fathom. So no, Im not claiming to understand what's going on there. But I dont think anyone has suggested Di Maria has challenged Van Gaal. If they have it wasnt me. 

What I did say is I dont buy the "he's trying too hard" line. But if you want to come back and say I am basing that on nothing I will only hold my hands up and admit it. I might say in my defense, I dont know, Fellaini looks like he's trying quite hard too. Hell, the whole squad looks like they are trying. Managers usually demand that. If trying undermines Di Maria's form that is somethign that is going to take some very experienced managing to overcome. Hopefully Van Gaal will have managed players with a similar inverse correlation between trying and achievement.

6783~~~
Yeah, that part about ruthlessness was worded horrifically, my bad. van Gaal strikes me as the type of character who wouldn't be starting di Maria if he wasn't committed to cause, especially, given that we have a shed load of talent/promising talent, in those named previously, who could be playing ahead of him.

With regards to your second paragraphs. I think there's a difference between trying hard and trying too hard. Most of our players are trying hard, in the sense that they're following instructions to every detail and giving 100% when doing so. Di Maria, on the other hand, seems be trying too hard to make something happen, when ever he gets on the ball. I felt, during the Liverpool game, that most his bad passes, including the backwards ones, were rushed so that he could initiate an attack. Most felt like a give and go type of pass, where he was in such a rush to get forward, he wasn't fully focused on ensuring the pass reached it's intended man.

6784~~~
Yeah, maybe. If so he needs to sort that out. In the end it doesnt matter anyway. If he isnt living up to the standards he has set for himself and expectant fans have set for him, it is irrelevant if it is because he is moping about the pitch wishing he was in Paris or if he is trying too hard to do everything himself or taking too many unnecessary risks. Either way, the end result is that we look better without him which is a problem. But I havent given up on him yet. If he is committed to the cause Im sure Van Gaal will get him back to the levels we expect - and are entitled to given the investment we made in him (yes I am one of those annoying people who brings up how much players cost, for me we wouldnt be having this debate YET if he had cost £20m as we would all be a bit more relaxed about giving him time to find his feet.) We'll have to wait and see and I hope you are right that he is indeed committed to the cause.

6785~~~
He's also said this:

<b>For your part, you’ve played for Real Madrid and now Manchester United. Is there anywhere else you’d like to play one day?</b>
The next step will be to return to Rosario Central, another giant of the game! (<i>laughs</i>). Truth be told, I’ve played for Europe’s biggest clubs, competed in two World Cups and won the Champions League. I represented Real Madrid and before that was with Benfica, which, while a slightly smaller club than Madrid, is a giant of Portuguese football. Now I’m with another massive club in Manchester United. When I finish here, I think it might be time to return to Argentina. Hopefully that happens.

So he didn't go to his first choice country where he would've had nicer weather, that doesn't mean he doesn't want to be here. 

I don't think the club wants to sell him anyways, unless he desperately wants out and the club can make profit on him. Not being in-form surely wouldn't drive him to push for a move, because he always was this kind of player. Whilst van Gaal said he was willing to let him go if he desperatly wants this, he also said he doesn't expect him to leave. He says he's happy here with his family and likes the fans.

He can be frustrating but also have moments of brilliance, that's his game. He never scored much in his carreer either, he's more about assists and still got 12 this season. Which isn't great and he has to do better, but for a first season with injuries and problems settling in he's done OK. 

I'm sure he will stay and do better next season.

6786~~~
Di Maria has 9 assists already in the league and is signed until 2019. Even if he's sort of unhappy, unless we get a truly insane offer from PSG I don't see why we'd sell him. He's so positionally versatile and productive that he'll always be useful.

6787~~~
He'll stay, simply because of the outlay we've spent on him. No way are we going to recoup that in the Summer, and in the days of FFP every penny counts, even for us.

I think he'll thrive in Young's position in this current 4-3-3, and he'll be given the chance to blow the cobwebs off against Villa in time for City the weekend after...

6788~~~
He's been quite reliable whenever I've followed him. He swaps a lot of information with Guillem Balague who has an in with Di Maria's agent.

6789~~~
To be fair, a lot of our players tend to do that and it can be annoying as hell when we are breaking and then someone slows the attack down completely by passing 2 yards behind the player, like a donkey.

6790~~~
He's generally very reliable when it comes to stories re Mendes clients. That being said, he does appear to harbour a personal dislike of both Van Gaal and Woodward, and possibly United.

6791~~~
We could have chased Sanchez till the cows came home but he wanted Champions League football and London. Its a shame he will waste his career at Arsenal.

6792~~~
Some people just want to specialise in failure. Nothing to be done about that.

6793~~~
Surprised to notice today that Silva and Hazard are the only two midfielders with more fantasy league points (using 3 for a goal, 2 for an assist) than him this season.

6794~~~
Now he's on international duty, I wonder what day some 'quotes' will come up that he is looking to leave. My money is on Sunday.

6795~~~
I had sympathy for him until that ridiculous red card. Now he can just do as he's told and start performing. He's clearly far too stupid to be trusted to do anything else.

I mean Nani was bad, but he wouldn't do things like catch the ball to take a throw in while it's still about half a metre on the pitch.

6796~~~
Stories of a bust up with LVG?

Though given the way he's been playing he really shouldn't be complaining if the manager is less than impressed with him.

I don't think he'll be going anywhere any time soon but if things don't work out then he'll hardly be the biggest loss either. His one outstanding season came in a position and set up we're never likely to see him in here. If you ignore that season then he's a very replaceable player.

6797~~~
I think I trust Pilib enough for him to not make bs up. I think there was a bust up, Di Maria clearly isn't happy with something but he's not leaving. 

Just hope he gets his act together and puts his heart into the club.

6798~~~
Pilib also was saying a few weeks ago that Herrera was definitely going in the summer.

6799~~~
He's hardly a reliable source, just one of many.

6800~~~
No, he was expressing his own opinion that said he would be surprised if he was still a player here next season. He marks what he hears/gets passed on by agents/reps and what his own opinion is.

6801~~~
There's no way any could tell if it actually happened and I'm not trying to say it 100% did, I do trust/believe him though.

6802~~~

6803~~~
oh god

6804~~~
It would actually be no surprise if LvG was unhappy with him at FT. Looked like just the sort of individual performance he would hate. I would hope Di Maria has the character to deal with it though. If he chooses to runs away at the first sign of trouble, he's not worth keeping anyway.

6805~~~
What does the tweet say?

6806~~~
As far as I'm concerned, PSG was his first choice and he's never looked happy here so I don't really care whether he stays or goes.

6807~~~
LVG most likely criticised him. Quite rightly as he was sloppy. 

And now people think because of that he is leaving.

6808~~~
Here come the body language experts again...

6809~~~
That sentence really gets on my nerves, should be a ban. Did you guys watch too much Lie to me and are now facial expression readers? Unless you know him personally you have no fecking clue how happy he is or not.

He's currently out of form but still a world class player. But I guess someone just needs to be the village idiot where all the negativity can be thrown at. He's still our most productive player this season btw. I'd rather find a way to get him back on track and bring the best out of him

6810~~~
If his blatant and bottomless depression, which we can all be reasonably sure he is suffering with at the moment, is in any way tied to the weather, maybe we're close to things turning around? Not sure how it is in Manchester at the moment but where I am it's been mostly very sunny for the last week.

6811~~~
I don't agree that he has "never looked happy here". He looked pretty thrilled earlier in the season. Those goal celebrations, he looked like his head was going to explode. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/2014/09/15/soccer-england_kfd114.jpg?itok=BOQbDV07" src="http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/2014/09/15/soccer-england_kfd114.jpg?itok=BOQbDV07"/> 

He looks happy when other players score as well, especially when he assists them, but quite rightly he's not looking too happy with himself because he's not playing well. 

Imagine if he was still grinning like an idiot and running around doing the love-heart thing after he'd blootered a cross out for a goal kick, or given the ball away which resulted in conceding a goal. How is anyone expecting him to look?

6812~~~
Not just body language. His last two matches include a ridiculous red card, a ridiculous handball, and half hearted performances against two of our biggest rivals. Maybe it's just frustration on his part and nothing more but he's not done much lately to suggest he actually wants to play for United.That's the stuff that goes beyond just bad form and worries me.

6813~~~
Build on your point <a class="username" data-user="73228, @OnlyTwoDaSilvas" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/73228/">@OnlyTwoDaSilvas</a> Di Maria looked plenty happy in the post-game celebration photos. As you say, there's plenty of evidence to suggest Di Maria's fine with being at Man Utd.

However, as has been suggested by the press, it's possible that he finds it hard to operate within the restrictions of Van Gaal's rigid tactical set up. It's also possible that he found the English winter difficult to deal with, Ronaldo was here for years and he never got tired of complaining about it. It's also possible that someone breaking into his house has unsettled his family, which is in turn unsettling him. None of that sounds that hard to believe. 

To me, Di Maria has the look of a man who is doesn't mind being at Man Utd but wouldn't need much persuading to move back to the Mediterranean if the chance came along. I don't think he's itching to leave but I don't think he's desperate to stay either.

6814~~~
It doesn't have to be black or white.
I doubt he's desperate to leave this early on, but given the chance (to PSG specifically) he probably would.

If PSG don't come calling, I'm sure he'll get over it.

6815~~~
I'd echo those sentiments. Lest we forget he pretty clearly said he would have gone to PSG if the money had been sorted. It wasn't so he came here instead - hardly a  massive commitment to the cause.

If he leaves for PSG or anyone else for that matter so be it as far as I'm concerned and we more than likely recoup most of our money as he hasn't massively blotted his copybook a la Falcao.

6816~~~
The whole 'body language experts' thing is a bit annoying.

We might just be a bunch of people on a forum, but we still know human nature.  It's like van Persie last season. Our experience of human nature (even as unqualified armchair psychologists) suggests that a guy who leaves a club he loves to join a rival, primarily to play for a legendary manager, will feel pretty disillusioned if said manager leaves after a season and things go completely and utterly tits up. The majority of people (footballers or not) would feel that way. Especially when you consider the sort of person van Persie comes across as, and the way he appeared to view Sir Alex. It doesn't take a 'body language expert' to read that, surely.

In Di Maria's case, I'm not sure if he particularly <i>wanted </i>to leave Madrid in the first place. He then had a preference. He makes a move to United, doesn't hit great form, gets sent of in what he probably feels is an example of him being targeted, and has his house burgled. Hardly crazy to suggest he's also pretty disillusioned.

It's the same body language expertise that allowed loads of people to predict Rooney wouldn't score that penalty on Sunday... or countless other penalties for other players.

Going back to Di Maria, I'd say the move is quite similar to that of Ozil. The same Ozil who quite often stops in his tracks and slaps the air with his head to the floor when he loses the ball and Arsenal aren't playing well. Or who had to be dragged to clap the Arsenal fans by Mertersaker.
I think both are quite fair-weather, and for the majority of their time in England, will only be as 'happy' as their current form is good.

6817~~~
I'd quite like to trade him for Bale plus £20 million, if Madrid want him back.

6818~~~
Im not saying he's happy or unhappy. But when you arent happy, say you hate your job, it doesnt mean you have to scowl ALL THE TIME when youre at work. A smile or a goal celebration isnt evidence of being fundamentally happy on any fundamental or non transitory level, any more than looking pissed off in one photo proves you are completely miserable and want to leave the country. 

This whole body language dissection / analysis thing is equally ludicrous whichever way you try to argue it. Millions of depressed people walk around smiling and laughing and hiding their feelings from people around them, just as plenty of reasonably happy people are inclined towards a rather grumpy demeanour (our Tony V is an example of this.) 

Unfortunately we're all going to be in the dark until we see what he does, either pouring out his soul to journalists in his own country or more likely whether he stays or goes this summer.

6819~~~
I agree with that. There's certainly plenty that is likely to be affecting him, but the whole "never been happy" is a lot of noise.

6820~~~
Good points. A lot of this isnt about body language at all. Its about making an educated guess about what's going on. Although there are people out there taking these opinions and looking around for evidence that confirms the view they already have. That is also human nature, but its worth remembering that is what is happening and not taking it too seriously. Because at the end of the day it is all educated guesswork. 

The Rooney penalty thing for me is a bit of a red herring. Every time a penalty is taken a million people predict it will be missed and a million more people predict it will be scored. One group is always right and assumes that is because they read the signs right. More likely it is just luck. Sometimes you can predict the future because of a body signal but more often than not you cant, its just when you get it wrong you tend to forget about it instantly and it doesnt then come up when you are chatting on an internet forum.

6821~~~
Yeah, fair point about the penalties. It definitely applies differently.

6822~~~
why i think this is his agent whose the one trying to unsettle him here?

6823~~~
I'm sure his "body language" will change when he and the team are flying next season. If he doesn't want to be here or thinks he's too good for us, then him and his agent need to convince PSG to pay 60m and he can leave.

6824~~~
I am alone in wondering if a straight swap is on the cards this summer - Bale for Di Maria ?

6825~~~
What a great way to run a football club that would be.

6826~~~
Bale for 60m would have been a great business in july 2014.

6827~~~
I've not seen anything half-hearted about his performances. If anything I think he's trying a little too hard, which is a very normal response to a period of bad form from a top player.

6828~~~
Well, that's debatable, but what does it have to do with my post?

6829~~~
Bale for Di Maria without money involved, equate to an exchange of goods with approximately a value of 60m, that's not a bad business for us, Madrid will lose a lot of money, though.

6830~~~
Not really buying into the "bust up" story. He probably got a bollocking from LVG for his sloppy performance, rightly so too. Unless he is a super sensitive guy, I don't really see this so called "bust up" being an issue. If he actually wants to leave, it'll be for other reasons I'd imagine..

6831~~~
Yeah, you've entirely missed the point of my post. Actually, you've sort of summed it up. A football transfer is not just an exchange of goods. You can't just constantly swap players of equal financial value and think that's a good idea. Di Maria, as we are seeing, is going to take a while to bed in. You want to invest in that difficult first season and then, just when he might start to put it together, get rid of him and bring in another new player who will probably take a season to get going and to find his place in our system?

Football isn't an xbox game.

6832~~~
I'd have Di Maria over Bale every day of the week. 

Bale's ridiculously over-rated on here in my opinion.

6833~~~
Clubs dont generally swap players. They buy and sell them. If and when Bale and Di Maria leave their respective clubs, they will almost certainly be swapped for a sum of money, not another player.

6834~~~
Still offers more to a team than Angel

6835~~~
I really don't think he does, and thats the problem. 

He'll undoubtedly score you more goals, thats a fact thats entirely indisputable, and he's a better athlete but in virtually every other aspect I think I'd rather Di Maria. 

Di Maria is certainly more creative, a fact that saw him used essentially as a hybrid number 10 last season and his delivery from wide areas is better.

Di Maria certainly isn't playing well at the minute, but even now he's creating things for team mates that I can never, ever remember Gareth Bale doing. That's not to say for a second that Bale is in any way a bad player, and I'd certainly welcome him here with open arms. But he's never, ever been as good as the hype machine in this country would have you believe.

6836~~~
No chance.

6837~~~
I think that Di Maria is to us what Alexis Sanchez and Ibrahimovic were to Barcelona two great players who play a different type of football to the team, it has nothing to do with Xbox or any other video 'thingy'. I think that Di Maria will struggle to transform into the player that we need.
Now I also think that Bale isn't the perfect fit, so.

6838~~~
Swap deals are very rare, contrary to 'news' about upcoming swap deals. If a paper says there will be a swap deal, you can count on it beeing without any source.

6839~~~
Gareth Bale in Spurs > Di Maria, but that's just me... I don't think the hype machine originated out of the blue, the boy was special, he single handedly carried that Spurs team, he beat RVP to the Player of the year trophy and we all know how magical RVP was in that 2012/13 season.

He might be under utilised right now, but that's the price you pay for signing for a team that has a diva as its best player, Bale has done it in the EPL and UCL and he can easily average goals and assists in double digits.

6840~~~
Van Gaal always has 1-2 players in the team which are free of his rules and have freedom. I actually think Di Maria will blossom if he can do whatever the feck the wants in a well drilled system he knows. He will be the unpredictable factor he likes to be and can be a great asset.

Replacing him for a goalscoring winger solves one problem but creates another. That's why I think Memphis would be a good transfer, he's relatively cheap (buying Bale would seriously reduce our spending power) and can offer what Bale does: score goals, although he's obviously not as good yet. That means we can spend our money on other holes in the squad.

I seriously doubt Real Madrid would take a loss on him anyways. If he's going to be sold it's for a profit, we'd be daft to pay anything close to what they paid for him. Doubt bringing Di Maria back would count as a galactico signing for them, as they wouldn't sell much shirts of him.

6841~~~
What's his assist count for the season?

6842~~~
I think it's very obvious where the hype came from. 

A British player, scoring world class goals week in week out in the Premier League is the media's wet dream, and there's no disputing that he did well. But he's not set the world on fire at Madrid in the slightest, they very obviously overpaid for him, and they'd demand the same sort of money back. 

Put it this way, if Gareth Bale wasn't Welsh and we weren't a British club would we be talking about him at all? I doubt it.

6843~~~
<a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a>, I think that he can emulate Robben a little bit, but I have some doubts. The problem is not about the freedom but what he does with it, I have always liked his unpredictability but he was always playing for counter attacking teams, now he is in a possession and we need another type of unpredictability the kind who is based on great vision and great care.

6844~~~
Last season he scored 20+ goals and provided 15+ assists for Madrid, he could be Pakistani we would be talking about him.

6845~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6846~~~
21 goals in the EPL from the midfield is no fluke, 21 goals and 16 assists for Real Madrid from the midfield in his first season was quite impressive,he is having a bad season yet he has managed to score 14 goals and 6 assists, he would probably have more if he wasn't playing Robin to Ronaldo's batman.

The general consensus is that Di Maria specialises in assists, Gareth Bale does a whole lot more than that for a team.

His 1st season in La Liga was better than Neymar's first season, he is only 6 goals behind him this season and has more assists, if Gareth Bale was Spanish or Argentine or from any of those foreign countries that produces quality players and he had a foreign name, I am sure his stock would be higher than this, how many European midfielders can offer you 21 goals?

Regarding his record fee, I think everyone knows Perez overpaid for him, I don't think any player other than Messi and Ronaldo is worth more than £50m

<a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> Since pretty much nobody is allowed to dribble (with risk) he can certainly be a bit like Robben. He's a different player though, he's not much of a goalscorer, he never was. He gives more assists, if we were looking for goals we've bought the wrong player. He can run at players and make things happen, which is why I think he suits us. He can make things happen in a otherwise rigid and predictable 11. Of course he's wastefull (always was) but in van Gaal's system that shouldn't matter too much since it's calculated in. I do think he needs to improve, but I'm certain he will.

I don't think Bale would suit a possesion based team better then Di Maria. He's at his best when he gets to use his pace in space, he's much more suited to a counter attacking team I think.

6849~~~
11. Ten PL, 1 Cup.

EDIT: Also, stats are in the header of the topic. Thou, Cafe has him on 12 assists.

6850~~~
We're not going to sell him. We just broke the British transfer free, 7 months ago, to bring an unwanted player from Real Madrid; who, at the time, stated his appreciation towards Man Utd for forking out a large amount of money. To me, di Maria looks like a player attempting to justify his price tag. A £60m player is almost a luxury player, and di Maria, definitely, acts that way, at times. When in possession of the ball, he's always trying to make something happen, as the biggest player in the team should, which involves risk and can result in a failed cross or pass. When not in possession of the ball, as he demonstrated last Sunday, he can be lazy; almost, acting as if, sometimes (mainly since the turn of the year), he's not required to fulfill his defensive responsibilities. 

What he needs is a talking to from LvG to bring him back down to Earth. He may have seen us play very well without him over the last two games, which may have contributed towards his wayward, and worst, performance against Liverpool. LvG, also, needs to give the damn guy a proper role in the team, that's definitely not helping. He's our best player and, in my opinion, should be playing ahead of Young (harsh but di Maria is better). 

With regards to selling him and/or him wanting to leave. Won't happen as we'd look like bigger fools than Liverpool, when they bought Andy Carroll for £35m. The whole body language reading is as pathetic and silly as a few ago when all the professionals were out analysing the relationship between LvG and Giggs and the infamous "slap" incident. The media will always put a negative spin on anything and everything.

6851~~~
If Carrick - Herrera - Mata is the winning formula and Depay a dead cert signing, would he maintain a place in the first 11 next season?

6852~~~
As a winger, yes. But that midfield isn't going to happen. Fellaini is playing for a reason: Herrera isn't defensive enough next to Carrick. That's why we're also getting a CM. Van Gaal never plays with 2 attacking midfielders in a midfield 3, unless we play with 3 centrebacks.

One of Herrera/Mata/Memphis/Di Maria would be on the bench, unless Herrera dramatically improves his defending. He's done this already, but I'm not sure if he's done enough to be counted as a defensive player (which van Gaal <i>always</i> has 4 of).

6853~~~
I think he will.

6854~~~
I think he will too (he already has!) but it's not about me. Van Gaal said Herrera was a creative player, the role in midfield he currently has (box-to-box) is a risk-free role in the team. He can't lose the ball and is an important part of defending in van Gaal's system. He's 1 of the 4 defensive minded players.

Unless he changes van Gaal's opinion that midfield isn't going to happen. We're still going to buy that CM, as we're short on defensive minded midfielders anyways. So I think that if it's an option, it will only be used against teams that park the bus (and probably with Fellaini in the team).

That's why I also think we wont see Di Maria in midfield anytime soon. He's too wastefull and on the wings that isn't as much of a problem (calculated in). He will have the freedom to roam anywhere and cause confusion for the opponent. I don't think he was bought for a place in midfield.

6855~~~
Van Gaal is known for making players better. That's mostly learning them better and quicker decision making, because talent to control a football can not be learned. The good news is that the problem with DiMaria is not his touch or something, but entirely his decision making. But that doesn't mean it is going to be easy or a quick fix. 

He's got to marry his instinct with his thinking, and he is a very instinctive player. So it might take him while, as it took him a while to get the rest of them thinking in this instinctive league. But it will be worth it, because DiMaria is very gifted.

6856~~~
I agree with you except for this, you learn how to control a ball it has nothing to do with talent but thousands of repetitions, you can understand quicker but you will still need to repeat the movement.

6857~~~
From a £60m superstar signing to a player that we are genuinely debating whether he should start ahead of Ashley Young <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6858~~~
I think his point is more about professional players. Of course you can learn as a kid (though I'd say it comes more naturally to some than others.) But as a footballer in his 20s, your technique has a ceiling, so to speak. It can be improved, but there's a limit.

A players ability to control and turn and dribble is largely shaped by what's become of them before they even reach their 20s, in my opinion.
However this is probably only the case for the finesse parts of technique (turning, dribbling, killing a ball.) A striker can still learn a new striking technique (for example the Ronaldo free kick, or lacing a shot with more power) later on.

6859~~~
You still can learn after your 20s, the problem is that when you are a kid you play 4-5 hours a day, the number of repetitions is huge,,
professionals footballer don't train much.
If you want a better example you have tennis players or golf players, they train one specific moves a lot, and improves drastically during the course of their careers.

6860~~~
Ah yes oops. God that stat is not too shabby. Even when his form is struggling he can just find goals for you like against arsenal and last weekend at anfield. Must not be sold imo.

6861~~~
Did you see the shove that ref got from Cesc (I think) the other day? compare that to the poke Di Maria gave him. I maintain that the ref was silly to give that red card. What Di MAria did wasnt that bad.

As for the throw in incident, what if he truly thought the ball had gone out and wanted to restart quickly? Players contest throw ins and corner kicks all the time, even when they know fully well that its not theirs. No one calls them stupid.

6862~~~
Hence the phrase "Football, bloody hell!"

6863~~~
This thread has become tedious - once he finds his best form we will read the same crap in another player's thread

6864~~~
Just seen it. You have a point. Michael Oliver's an absolute twat; this incident and the headbutt from Joe Hart prove so.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCtwlk5pzS8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The thrown in incident shows one of two things:

a) wanted to get sent off as he doesn't want to be here
b) him wanting to get on with the game by forcing a quick attack

6865~~~
I think for the right price we'd be mad not to sell him. I was one of his biggest fans after last years performances, but it just doesn't seem like the right fit. First of all he was world class as free roaming 10 last year and had a front line of Benzema, Ronaldo and Bale he could assist. I just don't think we'll ever see that Di Maria, that was the best player in the CL final or destroyed Germany in the friendly ,because his heart doesn't seem to be completely into it. What was so amazing about him last season was his work rate, combined with his assists. He still got the assists in him, like we saw on Sunday, but his work rate simply isn't the same. As a pure winger, he never was THAT good, still very good, but certainly not worth the kind of money he cost.

Look at Fellaini for example, he was this close to getting sold and now is a core player. It can change very fast, but from the stories in the press, combined with the house story, I just don't think it will end well.

6866~~~
Selling him this summer after one season doesn't sit well with me.  He's such a damn good player, he showed it last season and when he started out for us.  I'll never forget that game against QPR at home.  That's the real Angel di Maria.  He's bereft of confidence at the moment.  We just need to be patient.

6867~~~
Nothing wrong with what Cesc did to be honest. Oliver's positioning was absolutely terrible and as far as Oliver knew Cesc ran into him and pushed him trying to get him out the way and attack the ball. If the Ref is going to stand in the middle of play, he's going to have to accept that he might get clouted, which to be fair to Oliver, he did accept it.

6868~~~
The example you provide seems to make the opposite point to the rest of your post. Seems like your point is, he'll never reach that level for us. The example you give shows such a prediction is impossible to make, his form could completely transform as Fellaini's did. Fellaini's example should be telling us to be patient, no? Anything is possible.

6869~~~
I don't know. To me, Cesc sees an opportunity to give to the referee and does so. What would Cesc gain from pushing Oliver out of the way? It's not as if he's getting to the ball.

6870~~~
Those two scenarios are completely different. If the ref had just booked Fabregas for diving and he did that immediately afterwards (while play was still stopped for the booking) does anyone think he wouldn't be sent off? Of course he would.

6871~~~
It's an act of petulance which shouldn't go unpunished. It's not his first time either, Fabregas is one yellow a way from a ban, I believe.

6872~~~
That would suggest that, as long as the ball is in play, you're entitled to needlessly and aggressively shove the referee. I don't see how it's any different from di Maria poking Oliver or Joe Hart headbutting him. All acts of stupidity, and if one is punishable, then all should be.

6873~~~
I can understand Oliver not doing anything at the time because as you say he probably just thought Cesc had ran into him accidentally. Watching the Youtube clip though I think he should be banned retrospectively. It looked very intentional to me.

6874~~~
Well, apart from anything else, we're talking about Di Maria in this thread. If another player gets away with being an idiot that has no bearing on whether or not he was acting like an idiot.

If we're interested in discussing relative idiocy then laying your hands on a referee when play is stopped after you just got booked for diving is clearly a level above Fabregas' actions in the video above.

6875~~~
Yeah, I don't disagree with anything you say.

However, what irritates me the most, having watched the Fabregas incident, is the fact that Oliver makes nothing of it, and the comparison to his reaction towards the poke from di Maria. Then, that headbutt from Joe Hart... Michael Oliver, what a guy.

What's done is done, and hopefully di Maria's learnt from his mistakes {both the needless fall (there was little contact) and the reaction).

6876~~~
A lot of people here constantly wanna spend money, then we do, the player is not performing and they wanna sell him again, failing to realize that we'd suffer a massive loss at this point. We can't just buy ourselves back into the spheres we once were in, we have to be patient and create a functioning team. Before Real was as good as they were know, they had years of stupid transfer business such as this one would be if we were to sell him.

6877~~~
I agree.

6878~~~
any truth in this or is it has I suspect bullshit.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/03/25/angel-di-maria-louis-van-gaal-fall-out-report-84663/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/03/25/angel-di-maria-louis-van-gaal-fall-out-report-84663/</a>

6879~~~
He probably wasn't getting to the ball, but the ref there was the difference between Fabregas putting pressure on the Hull player and having him have time and space on the ball. I'd give him the benefit of the doubt there. He was in the mentality of challenging for the ball and the ref got in his way. No surprise he's pushed him off. I won't argue if Fabregas was retrospectively banned for it as he did appear to be over aggressive in that push, but Oliver made his decision without the help of having eyes on the back of his head.

Completely different situations between that and Di Maria. Di Maria's red was clear cut for me. He was arguing against the ref, and pulled at his shirt. I'd say he might have been demonstrating how he was pulled back but that's just stupidity. No one can blame the referee for sending him off there.

6880~~~
Great source! Sounds very likely

6881~~~
when you put it that way...

6882~~~
10 of Di Maria's 12 assists this season.

Brilliant! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6884~~~
Has to start vs villa, miles better in the final 3rd then Ashley Young

6885~~~
His first three assist on that video were mishit shots <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He needs to bring that back to his game

6886~~~
Anyone see how he played tonight? Or got a vid for his assist for argentina? Failing that are there any body language experts that will use finer details presumably with his relationship on the pitch with lavezzi, to further prove he is PSG bound? Ok seriously now tho,  i just want to know how he played.

6887~~~
This really is a tough call. On the one hand, we'd be mad to mess around with the formula that has yielded two great games, games in which Ashley Young more than played a part. On the other, Aston Villa strikes me as an ideal game to get a sense of where Di Maria is at, particularly with some huge games against top-4 rivals coming up. I'd be tempted to start Di Maria, being ready to bring on Young if things go pear-shaped.

6888~~~

6889~~~
That's what I posted in the Euro qualifiers thread:


How did Di Maria do?
I was switching between Argentina and the Netherland game, but from what I could see he was OK. Played on the right, was captain and took every set piece (Messi was on the bench injured), a couple of great deliveries to Tevez, but also a couple of balls Young and Valencia would be proud of <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

All in all as with us didn't hide, had the ball a lot, was substituted after 75 mins. Was also a bit of unfamiliar line up, the likes of Mascherano, Rojo, Aguero, Messi not playing.

Regarding the body language: I can assure you that his good deliveries were directed towards Paris whereas the bad ones towards Manchester. Based on that he is definitely off!

6890~~~
Some Salvador players seem to wearing gloves, which suggests it was cold; how on earth did they persuade di Maria to play? And how did he get an assist?

6891~~~
Mirror (I know) says psg are ready to offer 60million for him. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/angel-di-maria-transfer-psg-5429839" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/angel-di-maria-transfer-psg-5429839</a>

Who here would accept the deal?

6892~~~
We all know its B.S, but to answer your question.....absofeckinglutely!!

£60m for Di Maria is £25m more than he is worth.

6893~~~
If we can get what we paid for him  then sell him and replace him .

If we can't , then keep him and hope he comes good next season .

6894~~~
I thought PSG couldn't afford him last season due to FFP. What has changed since then?

6895~~~
You lot are all stark raving bonkers. Yes he has had a 50/50 start for us so far, but he will get better and more consistent. You just want to sell a world class player like that?. Mad the lot of you <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

6896~~~
Tend to agree with this. Despite being 'awful' all season and only starting 19 of 30 games, he still has the second highest amount of assists in the league!

6897~~~
Every time he plays he creates something. Against Newcastle he could have had 2/3 more if we finished properly and stayed onside. Yes he recently has lost the ball a lot when playing on the wing, but he is a high risk player. 

Once he learns how to deal with physical pressure without going down asking for free kicks, he will be much better.

6898~~~
I wouldn't sell him, no way in fact. I think he deserves more than one season to prove him self.

6899~~~
Seems very short sighted to give up on Di Maria after one season - these are the people who will be first aboard the bandwagon once he starts hitting form. What we need is stability, not overhauling the squad every 12 months.

6900~~~
No games, paper needs something to talk about. Nothing in it, move along.

6901~~~
I'd keep him for one more season. I don't think we bought him for his re-sale value. We bought him because he's world class, and was one of the best in the world last season. He's under performing, but we've seen numerous players take longer than a season to settle and come good. He's a quality player, and I don't believe he's just lost that ability. We saw flashes of it in the first part of the season.


Totally unrelated, but apparently he has topped the shirt sales for this season in the PL as well, and quite significantly.

Angel di Maria (Man Utd) - 9.59%
Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) - 3.80%
Diego Costa (Chelsea) - 2.27%
David de Gea (Man Utd) - 2.16%
Eden Hazard (Chelsea) - 2.10%
Wayne Rooney (Man Utd) - 2.09%
Radamel Falcao (Man Utd) - 1.99%
Steven Gerrard (Liverpool) - 1.76%
Sergio Aguero (Man City) - 1.46%
Robin van Persie (Man Utd) - 1.20%

De Gea is surprising. Who buys goalkeeper shirts?

6902~~~
Ddg is a very popular player and after last season I'm not surprised. Goalkeeper shirts are good for winter <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

6903~~~
Never thought for a second he'd be as popular as that!

6904~~~
Record transfer signing for the world's first/second biggest club on easily our most famous shirt number. Not <i>that</i> surprising.

Surprising that it's triple the next closest, though.

6905~~~
it depends on factors we cant really know without being on the inside. Is there any truth to the suggestion he is unhappy? Of course it is all speculation for us, but Van Gaal will know. And if he isnt happy Id be inclined to take the deal. Van Gaal has said he doesnt like having players who arent on board with his methods or dont want to be there for any reason. If Di Maria falls into that category we'd be doing well to recoup our money, and to be fair even if he improves its hard to see him improving enough to make that fee seem like good business. 

If its all nonsense and he is happy (except for with his form which presumably is a source of frustration for him - if it isnt that is a different problem) then fine, let's keep him. Though unless he is a complete revelation next season it will still go down as an example of us overpaying for a player.

6906~~~
We should keep him at least one more season, that would be the logical thing to do. But if a 60m offer comes, we probably should take it, he is not a perfect fit for us, will be 28 in a year and the fact that he can't claim one position in the team for himself, shows that despite his assists record, he isn't good enough in the game.

With 60m-75m, you can sign two very good players who can be a better suit for us and our possession game.

6907~~~
Judging by Herrera's recent adjustment and form coming back into the team, I'm suprised many advocate selling such a top player in Di Maria when his output is still decent even though he isn't fully adjusted to the team/setup yet

6908~~~
They haven't bought David Luiz for 50m this season (yet)

6909~~~
You're right. Only sell him if he doesn't want to be here. 

With regards to the bold segment, going back to the World Cup and observing the way in which van Gaal utilised Robben, you can't help but think that di Maria will be used in the same style. Robben was almost excused from the possession based style and allowed to play his natural game; and I'm presuming the same will be/has been applied to di Maria. Moreover, if we were to sell him for the rumoured amount, his reported replacements, Bale/Depay/Moura?, aren't exactly suited to van Gaals style of play, either.

6910~~~
Wouldn't they have to sell, first? And then use the funds to buy di Maria?

6911~~~
I wouldn't agree with that. Van Gaal's Bayern team especially was notable for using players like those you mention - pacey wingers who try to take their man on. That's part of the reason he shifted Schweinsteiger (who was a slow right midfielder) into the centre and opted for Robben/Ribery on the wings when he was there.

6912~~~
Even some of his biggest supporters have said he is a world class central midfielder and a fairly inconsistent and frustrating winger. 

It looks increasingly unlikely that Van Gaal envisages using him in the midfield position in which he earned himself all those plaudits at Real Madrid. Van Gaal doesnt like his "risky" players in central midfield. He is the box to box midfielder who caries the ball forward - and yet what is the top of our shopping list for the summer? "A defender!" I hear you shout. Ah, OK. So what is the second top of our shopping list for the summer, then? A winger? OK, damn you, what is the third top of our shopping list for the summer? Right! A box to box midfielder. So Van Gaal doesnt intend to use Di Maria there. Or it doesnt seem so. 

So if the above is correct, we are left with the prospect of having a £65m, inconsistent and frustrating winger. We already have one of those, called Nani. If we could recoup our £65m and keep Nani for free, what exactly have we lost? 

If he wants to stay Id still be tempted to keep him and trust Van Gaal to do something to get those top performances out of him. Maybe he will find a way to get him playing in the position in which he excels. But I have to say the bit of this that seems least likely to me is that anyone is going to pay £65m for him.

6913~~~
No they have the fund, they will need to sell someone only to keep the wages bill reasonable.

6914~~~
Oh yeah, he's definitely very popular, and one of our most loved players. I see Di Maria, Rooney, RVP shirts everywhere. I can't remember seeing many DDG shirts, especially not on adults. I definitely didn't think he'd sell more shirts than Hazard. Good on him!

6915~~~
That's exactly what I meant; should have made it clear. di Maria is more than capable of playing in our team and according to the style. Those saying he can't don't understand the role of wingers/wide forwards. The aforementioned players I mentioned, as replacements, will occasionally lose the ball, and as a result, will be crucified, by our fans, for taking risks and not playing to the possession based style.

6916~~~
I love the player but that's incorrect, Di Maria is a World class assist maker, he has played like a World class central midfielder for 6 months in a counter attacking team with a special organization in midfield, and with an offensive trio who takes 4 players from the opposing team at all time.
He is a very good winger, frustrating because of completely daft choices, but at the same time he is very consistent in term of assists, even out of form he will provide them.

6917~~~
Oh ok, I assumed they had to balance the books, as Chelsea seem to be doing, and sell first.

6918~~~
I fully agree, it's absolutely crazy people want him gone because he has experienced a dip in form since December, when in truth the whole system and players were suffering. He is still World class, just needs to rediscover his form and confidence again, which he will. He doesn't just lose all that ability overnight, I remember not so long ago he was ripping Germany a new one while he was on International duty.

6919~~~
It's not exactly that. PSG are allowed to buy one player per summer for up to 60M € (it has to be spent on ONE player), and then any additional buys need to be covered by sales.

6920~~~
It's not exactly that. They can buy MORE than one player by summer but they can't expend their wage bill. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

6921~~~
This. He's had lots going on that have prevented him from settling instantly. Injuries, the burglary etc. he's still a class act. Go back to his first few games with us and this thread couldn't get enough of him. He's one of our few world class players and the only one with that spark of flair. He will have a good rest in the summer and hopefully come back next season the beast that he was at Madrid.

6922~~~
He was something else at the start of the season, it's true. I was so excited, I was convinced he'd be our player of the season.

6923~~~
I would take the money unless there is no truth he is interested in leaving and we intend to play him in a midfield 3 which is his best position. No matter where we play him he will never live up to the fee (we paid double his value) but in midfield he could potentially be a top class player, as a winger I don’t think he is anything like as good. 

Personally I am not convinced he is happy here, he came for the money and I don’t think he enjoys the physical nature of the league so despite his obvious talent I don’t think it is guaranteed he will rediscover his best form. However I can’t see anyone coughing up enough money to make it worth our while to sell him.

6924~~~
If we could recoup what we spent on him I would take it in a heartbeat.

I actually like Di Maria as a player, and when he signed I thought he would be an instant hit (and he sort of was, in his first few games). Since then however, I have to question his mentality - he seems a bit of a sulker, contrast it to someone like Fellaini who was booed by our own fans but has fought back into the team and it is a night and day difference.

Maybe he just hasnt settled, maybe the off the pitch stuff is affecting him, maybe he just needs a bit more time. If so, fair enough and I am sure LVG knows the situation better than anyone - but if there is a risk that he is going to be a complete flop, then getting our money back isnt the worst thing in the world if it means we can bring in the likes of Bale/Sterling, Pogba, Clyne/Coleman this summer.

6925~~~
Nobody else is going to be as desperate or dumb as we were last summer, that's the bottom line. We can forget about getting our money back, its an interesting conversation piece but it isnt going to happen.

6926~~~
Before last season, I would have said he was basically Nani MK2 and would have laughed off signing him. I thought Real signing Bale would mean he would be stuck on the bench all year.

But last season, he really kicked on after moving position. We need to see a bit of that fight from him, he has the quality.

6927~~~
Selling him would be stupid. It also won't happen.

6928~~~
I dont think it would be stupid if he wants to leave and if Van Gaal has absolutely no intention of playing him in the only position he has ever justified his "world class" tag in. 

Both of which are perfectly possible.

6929~~~
I agree. I think we should at least give him another season to settle in. He had a great start but somehow lost his form and confidence after half of the season. But it's too early to completely write him off. Only way we should consider it is if LvG isn't really planing with him anymore and some other team is ready to splash at least 40-50M € for him.

6930~~~
Ah right, sorry for the misunderstanding. With Di Maria in particular I think the problem is that he's shown himself to be far more effective from deep than from a wide position. From what I gather, LVG is happy for players to take risks out wide but less so in the middle of the park, which is why Herrera's had to change his game significantly to get consistent midfield starts. I doubt Di Maria is capable of that kind of transformation, and if he did it'd be a complete waste of his talents. As you say, it seems that for LVG his future is as a winger or wide forward, unfortunately at present he's being rightfully kept out of the team by players who are performing better.

6931~~~
I think it's risk vs reward with Di Maria. If we had an elite replacement lined up then I think there wouldn't be much point in keeping him should PSG be willing to spend such a great amount. On the flip side, transitioning to England into an unbalanced side, competing at a lower standard than his former team and being constantly moved around to fit him into the ever changing systems is bound to have an effect.

We're starting to progress and look like a good side now. A few more signings in the summer to aid that progression and we might see a new side to Di Maria. He'll have had a year to knuckle down, I'm sure van Gaal knows what he wants to do with him now and he can then begin to knuckle down his role in the side and start building some form again. 

Sometimes a player just doesn't fit in at a club, but I think it would be premature to class Di Maria as one of those players purely based on this season.

6932~~~
If true, take it!

6933~~~
The problem being that, in my opinion Mata is a better footballer with a higher ceiling, if Mata becomes even better in the right wing, Di Maria has no chance to dispute this spot. Which means that Di Maria only has one spot to fight for, maybe two if he totally changes, and become a cm for a possession team.

So if we sign 3 or 4 potential starters, let say Depay, Pogba, Hummels and Clyne (the names are just for the sake of the discussion), Di Maria lose almost definitely his spot in the first eleven.

6934~~~
Absolutely this. There aren't many players with the talent of this fella, and people want rid of him after a few months. Nutters.

6935~~~
There's going to be a lot of competition for places next season, but (touchwood) there will also be a lot of games to contest for them in. I'm happy with Mata's recent contributions, but I doubt he'll be holding a right wing spot down for the whole of next season.

We're talking about what was a world class player last season. If we purchase talent that is able to keep him out of the side and we sell him on, then van Gaal has done a fantastic job. However, I think the arrival of high quality player is more likely to please Di Maria and we'd see an improvement in his performances. Herrera and Mata aren't going to play every game, and I wouldn't be saying there's any guarantees that someone like Depay would be a better option either next season.

6936~~~
Not exactly true. Pogba (a defensive BTB player) would allow van Gaal to use Mata in Herrera's place. Freeing up the right wing for Di Maria. He could also play left wing when Memphis/Young aren't in form.

You're assuming Mata will constantly be in good form, whilst I love the guy that's probably not going to happen. Competition is good, we'd have several good players competing for a start.

6937~~~
I don't believe so. I think the system implemented by Ancelotti last year was what brought out the best in di Maria. The triumvirate of di Maria, Marcelo and Ronaldo caused so many issues for opposition teams, last year. Ronaldo would start wide but always cut in, thus bringing the full back with him; this, in turn, created space for di Maria to utilise, where he could cross, dribble, or pass to the very pacey and talented Marcelo. 

Although we haven't implemented a like for like system/formation, what we've seen over the last few games, from Blind, Young and Fellaini, is, somewhat, similar to what Real Madrid used so successfully, for the last 6 months in 13/14. And, I believe, it could bring the best out of di Maria. He'd have Fellaini making the runs through the channels and Blind making overlapping runs, which will, inevitably, create space for himself to run into.

6938~~~
I don't agree, if we sign Pogba or Schneiderlin or whoever, Herrera will take Fellaini's place, Mata will stay where he is succeeding and Di Maria will fight for the last spot.
And Mata being an extremely regular player, he will probably have more game time than anybody in the team.

6939~~~
The current problem is that with the runs he is making, a lot of them isn't used intelligently by him and he has been losing balls, passing bad and not trekking back as he should. 

It's his first year though and look at the difference a year has made for Fellaini. I have no reason to believe that he won't come good. I also think the attempted home robbery shook him. He has definitely been out of form since. Has he even had an assist since the attempt? 

Next season if we make CL, we will definitely need him. 

I say hold on. Unless he wants to leave of course, then PSG should pay up.

6940~~~
If we bring in this BTB player (which we are) van Gaal will have more options. Currently Fellaini is the only player he can field next to Blind/Carrick to provide him defensive balance with Herrera (who does more than Mata). The big man isn't good in a role further back though, unlike the new CM.

We could line up with:
Herrera-Carrick-Fellaini

CM-Blind-Mata

Since Mata can also play RW this gives him more options, this doesn't mean Di Maria no longer has a spot. I doubt he was brought in for the midfield, he probably sees him as a winger (because he's adventurous). This means he could play LW or RW and have competition from Memphis, Young, Januzaj and Mata. In form he should easily make one of those positions his own, especially if Mata plays in midfield.

6941~~~
I said that he had only one spot not that there wasn't any spot, and he is already in a fierce competition with Young, Van gaal has no reason to consider Mata as a first option in the midfield three, when Mata showed more promises on the right wing, which take one spot.

If a 60m offer comes for a player who isn't a guaranteed starter, you at least think about taking the offer, that's all what I'm saying.

6942~~~
If he isn't settled here and wanting to leave then this summer is probably the only chance we will have to sell him and get a significant chunk of our money back. His stock is still pretty high in world football.

So it wouldn't be that stupid in all honesty. Again this is all dependant on his current happiness at the club.

6943~~~
I disagree. It's his first season where he hasn't settled in quite yet, all the reasons why have been mentioned. You at least give your record signing a 2nd season to show himself. The only reason we would sell him is that he's <i>really</i> unhappy and the club could make a profit (we're not selling our record transfer for a loss after 1 year). So far there hasn't been anything in the media about this, so I seriously doubt it.

Just because you don't see a place for him in the starting 11 doesn't mean van Gaal doesn't. Mata and Herrera will compete for #10, Mata can also play RW. Di Maria will compete for the wings and maybe even #10 too. A player with his qualities won't be left out too long, because he's obviously better than Young/Memphis/Januzaj. Mata could keep him out for a couple of matches, I don't dispute that, but he won't keep him on the bench for a season.

6944~~~
Going on what he's contributed this year and previous experiences with Argentinian players who've failed to settle, £60m would be an offer that's hard to refuse. But I'd have sold Fellaini for a bag of chips in the summer...

6945~~~
I'm fairly certain if he wasn't a £60m record signing then this conversation wouldn't be happening and the majority would be saying 'give him time to settle' rather than the minority (or half and half, whatever it is). Sadly he is a £60m signing and people will expect more from him straight away and get frustrated when he doesn't provide it.

Anyway, I'm in the 'give him time to settle' camp, he's too good not to come good.

Besides, it's not like we've ever stumped out massive money on Argentinian superstars who turned out to be failures before or anything.

6946~~~
Im sure youre right about that.

6947~~~
Too many want to "cash in". There was a thread recently asking posters what fee they'd sell him for.

I don't get this line of thought. We have too much money to want to sell a player with Di Maria's talent after just a year here just because we might get 10-15mil less if we do actually need to sell him down the line.

6948~~~
You are right, I wouldn't entertain the idea of accepting a 30m offer, if we had bought him for 30m. The thing is, I can't imagine that no one would try to find value in the market, if his contribution is comparable to the one a 30m player would provide than we should accept the 60m offer and buy two 30m players.

In the mean time I don't think that we should propose him to anyone, he shouldn't be up for sale, because he is a quality player.

6949~~~
that seems like a sarcastic response, which I guess is fair as I suppos it was an obvious point. Still, what I was trying to say amongst my blithering is that money shouldn't really be seen as the great basis for a player's early days at a club, as we've seen all too many times at Utd. A certain Afro'd Belgian being the latest example.

6950~~~
I think your Fellaini reference can be expanded to a lot more players too (Evra, Vidic, Ronaldo even pop into mind specifically).


Worry i guess is that it can happen in reverse as well. i.e they start well and then tail off. RVP for instance is the prime example.


TBH though I just think that it’s rare for even world class players to hit the ground running. What we need to do is be patient and we’ll reap the benefits eventually.

6951~~~
He's a long term investment just like Mata and LVG won't even consider selling him after his own decision to sign him.

We have tons of other players that shall be considered being put on the transfer list. No need for selling the player that can benefit us greatly in Europe.

6952~~~
Can the CAF members currently on the board at PSG (their seems to be a few of them here apparently) let us know if they have offered for him yet?

6953~~~
Whole teams been a bit shit this year, might as well sell them all. De Gea also as his heart isn't in it.

The clubs been a bit shit for the last two years, may as well sell it or close it.

6954~~~
Seriously though. A lot of people here have such whiny attitudes and sound like spoiled children. 

Be happy with what you have and grow up.

6955~~~
Since he has 5 assists since the beginning of February I've heard that PSG are willing to double their offer to £120m and although they realise they have no hope in hell of ever winning the CL they are determined to beat Guingamp and Bastia next season

6956~~~
Wasnt meant to be sarcastic. I was actually going to elaborate on my answer but then didnt because, funnily enough, what I said was obvious and has been said a million times before. But I think youre right, people are less patient because he costs more money. I know I am, if he cost £20m I wouldnt be so bothered but the idea of wasting £65m is harder to swallow. I think that is why the idea of cutting our losses seems more appealing in this hypothetical context - and even then, only because the reason he isnt performing seems more structural than cyclical, by which I mean it doesnt look so much a question of form as of how he is being used. And I dont see that as changing. So it looks more likely to me that he is never going to live up to his cost. Rather than if he was struggling to settle and it was a form issue youd say lets wait and maybe next year he'll come good. 

Thinking about it, that last bit shows it isnt purely about the money as you suggested (for me at least). Its a question of looking at the reasons he is underperforming and asking if that is going to change. In his case it looks like it might not, therefore it makes more sense to think about recouping our money. 

But obviously I could easily be wrong and he could come good. And also, as I said, I dont think we'll make our money back anyway, so maybe we should wait and see, if we end up losing £25m on his resale instead of £15m because we waited (I actually think we lose more than that either way) we can afford to take that on the chin. 

But I do hope Woodward learns something from this experience. Being given the keys to indulge your muppet fantasies can be a costly business if you dont really know what youre doing, which increasingly looks to have been the case here.

6957~~~
How much do you think we'd get if we decided to sell him now? And how much if he has another season like this and we sell him end of next season?

6958~~~
Its about Di Maria´s style. He earned the “worldclass” tag during one year, where he played in a fairly specific lineup with a specific task. Even in this year he wasn´t consistently worldclass. Madrid didn’t finish 3rd in league because everything worked out perfectly…..

We play nothing like Madrid and Di maria is used in roles, where he already proved, that he is not worldclass.

The idea that “he is too good to fail” is unreasonable. In fact it’s fairly obvious that he won’t be worldclass when we use him as winger/forward. He never was and there is no reason to believe that he will be.

In this context you have to ask the question what´s his worth for us (not some hyperbole value related to his performance in some matches for Madrid). A good winger might be worth 30m or maybe even 40m, but that’s about it. If PSG really offers 60m (which I don’t believe at all) we have to consider this offer.

6959~~~
Honestly I have no idea, if I did I would have used something i was more comfortable with in my example. "Value" is such a nonsense concept in football. It derives from what anyone is willing to pay but in football the ability and willingness to pay is so reliant on any number of factors other than the quality of the footballer in question. It means like for like comparisons are often impossible or ends up looking ridiculous. It depends on who is buying, how much they need to fill that position, how many other options they have, how marketable the player is AND, as one factor among many, how good the player is. So how much is Di Maria worth? It depends.

If I had to make a guess in the dark I guess my initial guess of a £25m loss would be as good a guess as I could make - only before I was saying that level if we wait, actually I think we'd do well to get that now, meaning we sell for around £40m. If we wait and he has another indifferent season, maybe we sell him for £25m or £30m.

But as I said these numbers are completely arbitrary, PSG could surprise me and come up with an offer that blows that expectation out the water. Who knows what the world looks like a year from now, coming into next summer. Who knows what kind of a season Di Maria will have had. It may be that his value holds as it is recognised that Van Gaal is a very quirky manager and the fact Di Maria may have failed at United may not reflect as badly on him as it might in other circumstances.

6960~~~
The people that want to sell Di Maria because he's had a difficult season are probably the same ones that then want us to spend £80 odd million on Bale, who's having a difficult season.

Cows in fields and all that.

6961~~~
what leaves people on the fence is the constant debate/rumours if he can be bothered being here. We know the quality he has and dips in form wouldn't be an issue if he was up for the cause in general

6962~~~
Although this is presumably intended to ridicule people with said opinion, couldnt it be justified on the basis that what we really want for our 433 system is top quality winger, which Bale is and which Di Maria, arguably, is not? 

I would be very hesitant about spending £80m on Bale, personally. But at least we'd be getting a player who has played his best ever football playing in the position in which we would be likely to play him. Which would be an upgrade on our current situation.

6963~~~
I'd bite their hand off, 

When the money goes through immediately send it to Italy particularly to juventus and bag ourselves Pogba back and jobs a good un'.

6964~~~
Only way I see Di Maria leaving is via a transfer request.  No way Ed or even LvG would be keen to sell after one season.

6965~~~
laterz.

6966~~~
If PSG have issues with FFP, it might be easy to manipulate them into a player swap situation than transfer money.

6967~~~
I don't think it'd be an insane thing to do, to consider selling him if PSG really came in with £60m!
They'd be quite insane to do so though! And we don't usually sell players for good rates

6968~~~
Insane to want to sell him after one season. We've been crying out for a world class winger for how long. We finally get one, and people say he should be sold.

If you sell him, you're left with Januzaj, Young, Valencia and Nani. I'm sorry, that's just not good enough.

6969~~~
He's played around 20 games, some good, some bad ones. Last year, he was a top 5 player. We managed to buy him and the fans already want him to be sold. It's just ridiculous. On one hand you want our players to stay forever here but if someone is out of form you want to kick him out the next day.

6970~~~
I don't think it's about wanting him to be sold, but if reports are true and he's unhappy here then recouping the money we paid for him is a good deal. I think he'll come.good next season but I only want him hhere if he really wants to be here himself

6971~~~
I've seen loads but was also surprised a bit with the numbers. I think it simply has to do with the fact that we have most fans in the UK.

6972~~~
Both him and Rojo played against Ecuador. He got 73 mins, Rojo played the full game at left back. Valencia a unused sub.

Anyone know how they got on?

Edit - apparently di Maria got an assist off of a corner. Assist machine.

6973~~~
How is that a good job? We lose a world class wide player and bag a potentially world class CM. It should not be either/or.

6974~~~
I agree with this. Tabloid transfer muppetry at its finest.

6975~~~
Football fans are generally idiots. A few weeks back, some wanted Mata to be sold. We have a truly world class player in di maria who's abit out of form probably because he's settling into a new league and country, and some think we should sell him. I blame football manager and Fifa.

6976~~~
Yep, their opinions sway with the wind. Di Maria is a fantastic player and we have only just scratched the surface in terms of what he's capable of. If we're planning on winning the league and CL, we will need players of his quality to get there.

6977~~~
Some in here want him to go so badly that thay have convinced themselves that he doesnt want to be here. 

Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa and Angel Di Maria. What do they share in common? All La Liga Imports who started off brightly and have dipped in form severly in the last 2/3 months. No one at Arsenal wants to sell Sanchez and No one at Chelsea wants Costa gone. But the great United fans want Di Maria sold. And we say Madrid fans are spoiled...

6978~~~
Yep. I think some of it has to do playing without the winter break and in a more physically demanding league.

6979~~~
The winter break can't be an argument there isn't a real winter break in Spain, they 13 days instead of 7, but since he had time to rest during the CL weeks, he had more time to rest this season than in his last 5 seasons.
The fact that he joined a new league, a new country, new teammates and has to adapt to a totally different style of football are more relevant, IMO.

6980~~~
I'd also suggest that an unhappy wife and child can have a massive impact on any man, AIUI they are still living in a hotel as she doesnt want to return back to the house. Thoughts of selling him are utterly ridiculous and you'd think people would look at players like Fellaini and Young who have turned their fortunes around one season later before saying such nonsense, especially when he has more talent than the pair of them put together. The best thing for him is for the season to finish, get his wife and kid sorted, get a decent pre season with the team and he'll be awesome for us next season.

6981~~~
This.

6982~~~
Pogba is already a world class CM Yet still so Young.

Meanwhile we will be stuck with a more expensive version of nani.

6983~~~
You should be very careful when posting logical explanations, could get you in a lot of trouble.

6984~~~
When you're worried about your family, life's priorities change. Di Maria looks terrified of getting clattered, and I wouldn't be surprised if that comes from a renewed sense of self-preservation. Fear about the future will do that to you.

6985~~~
I don't see why fans care so much about how much we spend on players right now, we basically have an unlimited amount to spend, so who gives a feck at how much we spend so long as we get the right player? Nobody really cares we spent 30m on Shaw because hes English and will likely be our main left back for 10-15 years. Di maria is a world class player on form, and we brought him in. Who cares if we paid 10m more then what he was worth? The important thing was we have him and we would be a worse side overall without him to choose from. The guy creates chances more then anyone else. Its madness to want him gone after 1 season where he was below par but still has by far the most assists.

6986~~~
Didn't know that. You sure? That sounds like a massive inconvenience. Not a great start to a life in a new country.

6987~~~
Yeah IIRC they bought a place, he was away with Utd, some people tried to break in whilst they were in the house. They've since been living in the Lowry and she won't return to the house, I think it might even be up for sale. This was all Jan/Feb time I think, so don't know if its been resolved but I don't think so.

6988~~~
I'm taking stats from WhoScored here and they may look completely different if you use goals/assists per minute but you'll get the general picture:

Costa = 13 Goals and Assists in 21 games before January
            10 Goals + Assists in 13 games since January 1st

Fabregas = 21 Goals and Assists in 25 games before January
                4 assists in 15 games since January 1st

Sanchez = 21 Goals and assists in 26 games before January
               7 goals and assists in 15 games since January 1st

Di Maria = 9 goals and assists in 12 games before January
              5 goals and assists in 14 games since January 1st

Looking at the main 4 signings from La Liga, the only player who's goals + assists have improved in the second half of the season is Costa, the other players have all struggled massively and even then there's an argument that whilst stats wise Costa may have been more productive, performance wise his levels have dropped.

There's no way on earth I'd advocate selling di Maria this summer unless it was made absolutely clear that he didn't want to be here, a year ago he was seen as one of the best players in the world, that ability hasn't gone away overnight and even if we were to sell him, who else would we get in? By all accounts Bale is seen as the successor to Ronaldo at Madrid and so they have no intention of selling him and Ronaldo himself must be fairly close to breaking the Madrid goalscoring record so I can't see him leaving this summer. Even talk of selling Di Maria to buy Pogba is odd when it's clear we'd have enough money to afford Pogba without sales. As long as he's happy at United then I'd keep him, no matter what PSG or others offer us.

6989~~~
Completely agree with this. It would be madness to sell one of our few players who can stake a claim to being world class. Look at Ozil, it took him a year and a half to acclimatise to the English league but has been one of the best players so far since the turn of the year.

If it is the same case in 1/2 years time, then fine, think about selling Di Maria. But to sell him now would be ridiculous.

6990~~~
Can't really compare it like that. A goal is a goal and as a striker you're much more likely to be in position to score one.

With the assists, sometimes the assist isn't as important as what happened before. The pass that breaks up the defense and sends two players against the keeper is much bigger than the layoff to the side that follows.

Also, because of his position Di Maria does more defensively than the other three and the stats back that up. All in all, these 4 players have all good stats.

6991~~~
I think they rented the house and, as you say, have no plans to move back.

6992~~~
There's quite a few reasons as to why di Maria hasn't done as well as expected, most of which will be branded as excuses. The league, new team, his position, to name a few, with the most contributing factor being our unsettled team. The stats above show that he's done quite well in comparison to the others, given that he spent the first few months of his premier league career playing in a severely dysfunctional team, whilst playing in three or four different positions.

He's just the flavour of month; next month it'll be another player who's on the verge of leaving or isn't happy...

6993~~~
This guy was Madrid's best or second best player in their decima winning season and he is a more expensive Nani? Based on some rough form in a new league and having language issues while also being affected because of the break in in his house? You must be a tough task master. Anyway, I am sure we won't be selling him unless he himself wants out in no uncertain terms.

Ediy: And Pogba is definitely not world class yet, not for me at least.

6994~~~
Pogba isn't world class yet... People see his highlights and the goals he scores but there's a lot of things he has yet to learn. His positioing and generally his whole defensive side can get a lot of work done. He will be world class one day, but not quite yet imo.

6995~~~
Those bloody vine accounts on twitter.

6996~~~
Saw a piece in The Sun today saying that DiMaria wants to stay and that he's told PSG he has no intention of leaving us for them.
I didn't have time to give it a good read so i don't know if there were any actual quotes or anything.

6997~~~
He is one of the best creative players in the world, when he signed with us LvG said he is a world class <b>midfielder</b>, and i hope we will use him as one next season.
When we buy the box-to-box midfielder we need to create the balance, we can give Di Maria the freedom he needs to be creator of the team, and then i think he will be huge for us.

6998~~~
No quotes.

6999~~~
Can't understand fans wanting him sold.  His settling in period was massively affected by the break in, it's understandable he is pissed with that - it's always going to affect you, regardless of how much money you can throw at moving.
Look at his assists this season when he has played poorly for the majority of it.  There is no way the club would sell unless he really threw his toys out of his pram.  He is the biggest shirt seller in the PL, the club won't let him go easily.
Not that I buy what the papers say, but if there is any elements of truth about him wanting to stay and fight for his place, then we could have a magical player on our hands next season.

7000~~~
Talk of sale is silly. His numbers are very good and his poor form has been overstated. He makes mistakes throughout a game, but that's the player we bought. He makes up for it with guaranteed creativity, which he demonstrated twice as recently as Anfield.

We need to keep and continue to buy the world's best players, not sell them. With a settled team and balanced formation I suspect he will improve in line with everybody else.

7001~~~
As others have said his appearance against Liverpool summed up his season fairly well. He was pretty awful when it came to doing what the team needed from him, but created two goal scoring chances. There's definitely a world class player in there, but whether we can get the best out of him in our system, in this league, is doubtful imo.

Personally, if I was picking the team I'd leave him out, but I'd probably be one of those boring managers that nobody likes anyway.

7002~~~
Madness to even consider selling him. Not have the best of seasons but his quality in undeniable. Its not like he has had the luxury of playing in an already settled team either. We're in transition. Patience.

7003~~~
crazy to even consider selling... The guys a class act and I think we'll see a return to form before the season is out

Look at Fellaini... Now one of Europe's top goalscoring midfield dynamos

7004~~~
This is quite an interesting piece on DiMaria -

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11510812/Why-Angel-Di-Maria-is-not-a-Manchester-United-flop.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...Di-Maria-is-not-a-Manchester-United-flop.html</a>

7005~~~
rather have cesc. no doubts. half the dosh twice the player.

7006~~~
Definitely keep hold of him for now. If he hands in a transfer request then we might have to think about it but I think we have to have some faith that with the summer break, it will click with him next season.

7007~~~
The 2 players really aren't comparable much at all, tbh. Fabregas would have been mint next to Cadrick, but I'm fairly happy with Herrera. 

Also, I'm the biggest matches, Fabregas would have been used as a 10, which would only compound our problems more, than resolve it. We needed pace desperately. A fairer comparison would probably have been with Sanchez, who's been better this season, no doubt. 

Let's hope AdM settles and reaches his level next season/end of his season.

7008~~~
not saying they are just saying i'd have him over ADM - easy too , not even a flinch. i'd have cesc over sancheese too.

7009~~~
Not entirely correct. 
1) They're not comparable, given they play in different positions for two different teams. 
2) di Maria contributes a goal or assist every 107.9 minutes in the league; Cesc contribute a goal or assist every 123.7

Cesc is not twice the player di Maria is.

7010~~~
They play different positions.

7011~~~
Crazy to sell any player after one season. Don't care if he cost 1 million or 100 million. It's incredibly  short sighted to not give a player a second crack. 

And to be thinking of 'value' and 'recouping costs' is demeaning to a club like Utd. 
Look where all those years 'looking for value' under fergie left us

Give him another year, if after that we want to move him on for 10 mill so be it.

Provided of course he wants to stay. And there is nothing but speculation to prove otherwise

7012~~~
Hope he gets the start. Back from national duty and should be fired up for a performance in front of all the fans at Old Trafford and to prove himself for the City game a fixture after.

7013~~~
so they only play football in the offensive half of the pitch? that's odd. could've swore there's a halfway line. just my opinion. and i didn't say it was a like for like just who i'd like.

7014~~~
You said "half the dosh twice the player", which is a comparison, and in football you wouldn't compare two players playing in different positions, as that would make no sense. 

Would much rather have Sherbets over Mangos, as the former are considerably cheaper...

7015~~~
mango sherbet we all win , given the opportunity would you have ADM  or the other guy for half the money?

7016~~~
At his best, di Maria is a far better threat offensively and more suited to us than Fabregas. So I'd take di Maria over Cesc.

7017~~~
okay how about mango or lemon sorbet

7018~~~
Tough one. I liked Sherbets as a kid, but I think I'd take Mangos over them, these days.

7019~~~
Should be but won't be. More likely will mope about knowing he's still getting a fortune but wishing he was at Real Madrid.

7020~~~
i knew you were a lemonist you tw4t.

7021~~~
I would really like to know how many crosses that resulted in goals in open play he managed to make in his final season at Madrid, because I'm sure it must have been quite a few but I think that's the one thing that's disappointed me about Di Maria this season. I always thought he would struggle physically and would need time to adapt but he's put alot of crosses in and the delivery has been subpar. You could put that down to a lack of height in the team which is a fair argument but I've watched almost every match this season and alot of his crosses seem to me a bit gung-ho.

7022~~~
Always helps when you've got Ronaldo in the box who can leap like a kangaroo and wins tons of headers. Also benzema is decent with his head too. 

On second part I agree it's incredibly frustrating watching him cross a ball he's worse than tony v, remember that infamous cross/shot he did earlier on, can't believe any United fan thought that was a cross it was a blatent miss hit shot.

7023~~~
I have to admit I'd think about it if PSG offered money, he's been in horrible form for a while now its hard to remember how brilliant he is.  Remember his first few games? feck me...   

If he settles in, plays his best football and we add quality in the summer to our already ''clicked'' squad in theory we'll challenge for everything.

7024~~~
I think the smart thing to do with PSG is insist that we get one of their top players plus cash if they want their man. Veratti or Lucas Moura + a certain amount and you can have him. If you don't want to lose one of your most talented players, dont try to take one of ours

They would most likely not be interested and we could move on

7025~~~
There is no doubt that Di Maria has been very productive so far and he is probably one of our best players if you look at players highest level. The main problem with Di Maria is his decision making he needs to get better at releasing the ball early when he is in no position to create something. If he can cut out some of these silly decisions and stop giving the ball away as much as he does we will have a world class player in him.

7026~~~
ADM is clearly our creative spark, but thats also by design as everyone else looks like they've had creativity beaten out of them while Di Maria looks free to try and create a chance every time he gets the ball.

While he has created plenty, he's also given the ball away or wasted far more oppertunities than the other players in the league that have created a lot. For example you look at the other players with a large amount of assists this season and from the top 6 only Di Maria is in the 70s (77) for percentage of accurate passes. And despite attempting to cross the ball almost every time he gets it, he's found a teammate with his crosses 1.7 times per match on average, less than 4 other players and the same as Ashley Young who hasn't needed half as many attempts.

In actuality his return is rather mediocre and that still doesnt change that he has been our creative spark, but he could clearly have done a lot better. Especially as often very poor first touches from Di Maria cancel our attacks

7027~~~
Do you think that Di Maria is a CM in a team who base his football on possession ?

7028~~~
Once he settles down I bet he would be a much better passer then Fellaini.

7029~~~
I think that a lot of players (in form) are better than Fellaini, but they aren't all suited for the role he plays for us, he makes good choices and take great care of the ball. Di Maria is a player who is able to create out of nothing but to do that he needs a great number of failed attempts.
I feel that Di Maria in CM, is a source of disruption for the entire team when the team try to be possession based, if we were a counter attacking team, he would be perfect for us.

7030~~~
He would give the ball away more. Though he would also set-up a lot more goals. Double-edged sword really.

7031~~~
Well this is Fellaini second season with us and we all remember how he fared last season. Would it be better if we wait next season and see how Di Maria would fare once he settled down? Also the current midfield cannot support both Di Maria AND Herrera.

7032~~~
Hence why I believe that the midfield need to change. Fellaini is a nice lad but he sticks like a sore thumb in our midfield. Its like seeing Nolan in Barcelona's midfield or Scholes in Stoke's. There again, we are playing him because we need him. We lack the physicality that Fellaini provides.

Now imagine this entire revolutionary concept that is surely a first in football. What about bringing in a DM who can actually provide that physical impetus to the team. That would pave the way to having creative midfielders who are actually creative and technically gifted. I know its so mad that its almost impossible to imagine. I mean who would have thought of having defenders and DMs who can actually defend and win the ball and creative minded players who are more known for their creativity, vision and technique rather than on how much they can physically bully their opponents and head the ball?

I know I am wasted at redcafe. By now I should be leading Manchester United or Real.

7033~~~
I understand you, at least I think I do, but Di Maria isn't the solution. Like Robben isn't a second striker for Bayern, Di Maria isn't a CM for us.

Di Maria played brilliantly in a system where he wasn't really a CM, he was a left midfielder who started his runs from inside to outside, he was playing for a team who was counter attacking and he had for mission to develop a trio with Marcelo and Ronaldo, on the left.
And I don't think that we should copy Madrid's system because of Di Maria, since he wasn't their best player, Modric, Ronaldo, Xabi Alonso, Pepe and Benzema were all better than him.

We are a team who base his game on possession, we don't counter attack, we need CMs who can disrupt the opposition positioning through passes. In our system Di Maria is a member of the front three, in that system he has all the freedom that need if we reinforce the midfield, with a better #8.

Basically do you think that Di Maria can be a CM for Barcelona or will he be a winger for them ? I think that he will never be an option for them at all, because he is to far from their philosophy, who is very close from Van gaal's own philosophy.

7034~~~
With the lineup of Young, Herrera, Mata and Valencia working well, I don't think there's much hope for him this season.

7035~~~
They aren't working <i>that </i>well. At his best he is better than any of them also, so I'm sure he has a smidgen of hope.

7036~~~
Completely jumping the gun. A lot of football yet to be played, so much can happen.

7037~~~
Agree with this. We're 1-0 up at home to a rubbish Villa. Think he's still got a chance, as we've certainly not blown them away with our attacking play.

7038~~~
It doesn't matter as long as the team works best with the other four on the pitch. I'm as pissed off as anybody about the di Maria situation for various reasons, but it is what it is.

7039~~~
It's not jumping the gun when there's evidence from several games now that our team as it currently plays has been at its best.

7040~~~
2 games? He actually played well vs Arsenal (before he got sent off) very much jumping the gun.
He isn't starting today (rightly so) as Young has been playing well, but he will get his chances.

7041~~~
But we're in full control and have created several good chances, something we were lacking for a while this season. It's also not just the Villa game, we've been getting the results we need with our current lineup, so as I said, there's not much reason to change it right now.

7042~~~
He could replace either of Young or Fellaini and we would be even better in this game IMO. Hopefully we see him early in the second half.

7043~~~
If he plays well when he gets on, he'll displace Young for the next game.

7044~~~
He's a better player than most of the starting eleven; he could replace either Young or Mata and we'd probably be an even bigger threat going forward.

7045~~~
His substitute performance against Liverpool was very poor. I think LVG would have rightly told him that it wasn't acceptable.  It will be interesting to see if he comes in the second half if his passing and dribbles will be less erratic. Not convinced that the EPL is where di Maria will do his best work. All of that said I wouldn't sell him for anything less than what we paid for him.

7046~~~
Young has done well, I doubt he'll replace Fellaini since he isn't suited to fill his role.

7047~~~
We weren't when he came on against the bin dippers

7048~~~
It has been a few games, not several. And yes. It's completely jumping the gun. If they go off boil for next few games, he'll be back in. Likewise any injury. Saying there's not much hope is just silly.

7049~~~
I'm not gonna debate that he's possibly the best player on the squad. But Young and Mata have done well and most importantly, the team is working well together, so why would we change it? I want di Maria to work out just as much as anybody, but I don't see it happening right now.

7050~~~
Lol what when he setup the winning goal, and then played that pass for the pen? He wasn't that bad you know.

7051~~~
We have seven games left. Given how well our team is working today, I doubt van Gaal will change it up against City. After that we have six games left, which isn't a whole lot to find your rhythm and impress. That's why I don't see much hope.

7052~~~
All forgotten as he misplaced a few passes, as well.

7053~~~
Another assist...

7054~~~
Exactly why he should start.

7055~~~
Was a poor cross tbh, that was all Rooney

7056~~~
It was an average pass at best that was saved by Rooney's brilliance.

7057~~~
It wasn't a 'poor' cross. It was a standard ball in turned into something by a forward bang in form.

But when you consider Young put in 10 identical crosses that amounted to very little, it was nice to see something come of it.

7058~~~
He can't help getting assists. Good habit.

7059~~~
I really dont know what to think of Di Maria, he seems to play badly every game but still manages to get assists.

7060~~~
I just wish he wouldn't roll around so much every time he gets tackled.

7061~~~
Was it balls, he clearly saw Rooney hence crossing it behind.

7062~~~
And again...

7063~~~
History won't care whether it was pretty or not. It still counts.

7064~~~
Some ppl! Strange why Young or Valencia aren't that lucky to get fluke assists, only Di Maria gets them. Maybe it's just because he is a quality player??

7065~~~
I was close.

7066~~~
Weird how Young or Valencia couldn't find any of our strikers with a cross yet Di Maria puts in his first one and we score.

What did he actually do wrong this time, apart from get kicked from Delph? We looked a bigger threat once he was on, simple as that.

7067~~~
Amazing how some find negativity in us scoring goals.

7068~~~
He'll be frustrating but he is so much more likely to get an assist than Young.

7069~~~
This. It's laughable to say that he won't get games ahead of Young if he will deal with his mental problems (and we all hope that he will next season). He is years ahead of him ability-wise - and, just like that, Young had another good game, but Di Maria came on and get an assist. I don't think that it was meant for Rooney, but it was a clever ball in a dangerous zone.

7070~~~
I was amazed to come in and see that too? He's our top assist maker by a country mile, yet you see quite a few driving away for him to be sold in the summer? Some people eh

7071~~~
I wish we had more players who play shit and come up with a goal or assist every game.

7072~~~
Piss poor. Sell him to PSG.

7073~~~
But you were wrong. Which is all that matters.

7074~~~
I'd take an assist a game with an average performance for the rest of the season, although i have no complaints over his performance today.

7075~~~
He also seemed to be playing much safer, as opposed to trying to make things happen. He's just far more productive than any other player in the team, and he should be starting.

7076~~~
Harsh, but fair.

7077~~~
Thought he did very well coming on today. Showed some desire and enthusiasm, which is good. Means he's not having a strop being on the bench. Don't think he'll start against City, though.

7078~~~
Good performance. Maybe a spell on the bench will have a good effect on him.

7079~~~
He also has ridiculous pace and is a proper weapon when other teams are pushing up. Simply offers us something nobody else in our team can. Can't have a team of 11 safe players, you need someone who is going to try create something, and from time to time it will go wrong.

7080~~~
Assist machine.

7081~~~
He did better today. Which isn't saying much based on his recent cameo performances, but nevertheless it's a step in the right direction.

7082~~~
Unfortunately accurate.

7083~~~
Stop moaning you whining wankers.

7084~~~
People thought he was poor? Had a good game today. Young's end product was severely lacking, Di Maria has the habit of creating chances out of nothing.

7085~~~
I liked what he did today. He created things.

7086~~~
Great assist, well played

7087~~~
He is sooo much better than Young it's ridiculous. All Young does is cut inside and put in crappy crosses, time and again. He and Valencia are both so predictable. Di Maria is anything but. Needs to be back in the starting 11.

7088~~~
I thought he was very good today. Injected some pace into the game when we needed it and stretched Villa's defense, allowing us to score those two late goals.

7089~~~
I think he will in time, but Young has really deserved his run in the side.

7090~~~
Young had a good game but its time Di Maria starts next week. He was very disruptive and hard to defend today.

7091~~~
Thought he was fantastic when he came on, got the assist and made a definite impact. He won't give you what Young does in terms of defensive contribution, but Young won't ever get the assists that Di Maria does. He's an assist machine.

7092~~~
Di Maria is better, but Young started deservedly IMO, and Young actually had a good game today again.

7093~~~
Young and Valencia are the scapegoats of this board, so even when one of them does well, they're still the first ones people want replaced. Young has had a good season and we've done well with Young on the pitch. He doesn't have di Maria's stats, but if the team is more balanced with Young on the pitch and performs better overall, I'll take Young and I'm not that fond of him in the first place.

At the same time, di Maria was average today, but still better than the last time he was on. If he manages to be subbed in against City and Chelsea, he will have to prove his worth against the true top clubs of the league, something he hasn't done so far save for maybe the FA cup tie against Arsenal.

7094~~~
That's his 10th assist in league. Our record for assist in league is held by Beckham with 15. Speaks volumes about this player when we know he is clearly not at his best yet. Pretty sure he will become better next season.

7095~~~
He has creativity and vision, I'll give him that. I'm not convinced his technique is great, though. The fact he puts the ball into dangerous areas is a massive plus, but his passes are often inaccurate. Rooney probably did more to assist himself than Di Maria did. There's still a lot of room for improvement, imo.

7096~~~
I didn't think Young was that great today tbh. Saw plenty of the ball but barely any end product.

7097~~~
Di Maria only had twenty minutes to be fair, its not a lot of time to be more than average, still he did well and got an assist, I think he is slowly coming back into form if he keeps this up.

7098~~~
Me too. Surprised at the amount of people who thought he was one of our best players. His final ball was diabolical.

7099~~~
His passing is a bit erratic because he can be a little sloppy (lacks concentration) miss places some easy passes.
However his passing in general, especially playing balls over the top into the forwards from deep is incredibly good.

7100~~~
Young was the best player on the pitch according to the co-commentator. He had so much space along with Blind against Hutton and granted, he made some good runs but in the end he had nothing to show for it. Blind has one or two opportunities and creates a goal. Di Maria has been performing at an all time low over the last few months, but still manages to create a goal almost every time he plays. 
All this huffing and puffing from Young but Di Maria is just much the better player and from now on has to have the platform to regain his form. An in form Di Maria could propel this already streaking side into top two.

7101~~~
Young and Valencia both had appalling end product today. 

Di Maria comes on and gets an assist, like he almost always does.

7102~~~
I thought he was very good in those 25 minutes,he got an assist and generally looked very threatening with the ball.He also the only player with real pace to get behind defences.

7103~~~
The team being "balanced" led to us creating little and supplying useless balls into the box all game until Di Maria came on. Young and Valencia must've had about 20+ crosses between them today that were all dealt with easily.

7104~~~
Yeah, but it was played a yard behind Rooney at chest height...

Having said that, Di Maria definitely played well when he came on, a lot of purpose about him. I'd still start Young over him for our next match because I feel he gives us more control.

7105~~~
He was outstanding today. Showed his class.

7106~~~
Young got everything right, until he had to deliver a genuinely dangerous ball. When Fellaini struggles to head the ball coming in, you know it's not well hit.

And let's face it, the guy has only directly contributed to two goals in the league. I like him, he's improved, but Di Maria is the one I want to see playing whilst he's still at United. But, I like that van Gaal isn't playing him purely because of his name and who he is, he needs a kick up the arse.

7107~~~
2 assists in his last 2 substitute appearances. Not bad eh?

7108~~~
The amount of negativity towards di Maria is incredible.

7109~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So what exactly did he do wrong today then?

7110~~~
I don't think that changing the team set up when we bring him on is especially helpful. Now we brought Rooney to central midfield and Falcao up front and we brought of Fellaini. 

The entire team looked a bit erratic and didn't seem to follow the tactical plan very much. I hope in the next game that we don't do the same thing, he's going to have a difficult time finding composure and calmness in that case. Young is definitely the starter for now but I hope we can change that soon as someone said, Di Maria out of form and very erratic still produces goals. 

I hope Young can turn his final delivery up a bit because it seems like he'll never find a target with his crosses and his shots are bound to go wide or be well blocked by the opponents. 

Young was the MOTM in the first half though with Herrera, in the second it was clear that Blind and Young were asked to play more defensively as they stopped the overlapping runs and Blind stayed further behind.

7111~~~
Are you from alternate Universe ?

7112~~~
Was class when he came on, what the feck is wrong with whoever is criticizing him. Generally the one annoying thing with him has been the slack passing and cheap give aways and there was none of that today, looked dangerous, got an assist as always... Hopefully he finishes the season strongly. Leaves Van Gaal with a big decision for the City game, him or Young? Young gives us more defensively but Di Maria guarantees chances.

7113~~~
He is so so good when he does the assists and doesn't give away the ball either.

7114~~~
That'll do

7115~~~
You know whats funny about DiMaria?, i'm sure we would all agree that he was brilliant last season but his stats for us actually compare very favorably with last season. Unless the stats i saw the other day were wrong, he has scored only 1 goal less than last season and has about 8 less assists (in the league last season) while playing much less games and way less minutes.
Weird.

7116~~~
Should start as a sub next game and come on around the same time tbh. Young will provide more defensive stability with Blind on the left. Whilst Di Maria can come on after 60 or so minutes to use his pace.

One thing I hate is when hes tackled, he goes down holding his leg instead of getting back up and putting pressure on the defender.

7117~~~

7118~~~
Nice! Hope he starts next week tbh, looked good today.

7119~~~
Wow what a ridiculous stat really, we would be pretty silly to sell DiMaria if he can create to this level while looking a shadow of the player we bought.

Its weird that Beckham holds the record with 15 assists, that team used to walk leagues and bulldoze teams regularly, i thought the record would be higher than 15 assists.

7120~~~
Giggs had 21 one season (in all comps), but I guess the 15 are only league assists.

7121~~~
Another quality assist, I thought he also looked sharp and showed a little more patience today when he got the ball, good signs.

7122~~~
Yeah. Becks got 23 assists in all competitions the year we won the treble (as did Yorke, which is crazy cos he also scored 29 times that year too!).

Still, it is incredible that Di Maria's been injured, off form and on the bench at various times this season and he needs to make just five more goals in our last seven games to break our Premier League assists record. If he starts the last seven would you bet against him?

7123~~~
He woke up and was still angel di Maria.

7124~~~
A quick check shows: 

Fabregas has 0.65 assists per 90.

Angel has 0.58 assists per 90.

Now consider this:

Chelsea have averaged 2.10 goals per game and United 1.78, we all know how well Chelsea have played this season and how poor United have been. We also know how poor Angel di Maria has been overall so the fact he has been so productive despite being so poor really is exciting and it makes you wonder what he will do next season after a much needed rest, a year of adaption time, and in a United team that will actually play football for the entire season.

And even if he isn't considerably better, he's already productive, if he is less wasteful in possession then he will be a fine winger and I'm sure Louis van Gaal will be able to work on him losing the ball so much.

7125~~~
I wouldnt bet against him even coming off the bench tbh

7126~~~
I was hoping for him to come on today and he made a big difference in opening up the game.  Some of his decisions were dodgy but the second goal doesn't happen without him.

I tend to get pissed off when Rojo or one of our midfielders are being pressed on the left and Di Maria is nowhere around for a pass.  He should be making himself available in a lot of those situations IMO but is screwing around farther up the pitch.

7127~~~
He's clearly a genius,  but a massively inconsistent, infuriating, low pain thresholded genius at that.

Whenever he plays he makes something happen, but if he had a better brain he could do even better.

Was annoying he didn't make better of the chance when he was through on goal almost, but then he put a nice cross in for rooneys goal. He is always positive which I like, but he can clearly offer so much more!

7128~~~
He must be the most fortunate assist-maker on the planet. His last two have come due to the absolute genius of those who scored the goal, and there's been 2 or 3 this season that have been shots that turned into passes!

Not that I'm complaining, I'll take his assists however he's prepared to give them.

7129~~~
Pretty much this.

7130~~~
this. another wonder goal. but at least he tried the pass. he has the vision.

7131~~~
The most important thing is to find the man, always gives the chance to score a goal. He's usually very consistent with that and that's why he has high assist numbers. Young/Januzaj/Valencia tend to over hit or under hit crosses all the time or just hit the first man, but rarely do they actually pick out people and that's why they don't have good numbers really (as good as Young and Valencia have been, the final ball is still lacking).

7132~~~
He impressed me as well. A very dynamic and electrifying player when he's on. His control and dribbling in traffic can be magic. I hope we can find the best way to use him and his undeniable talent because he can only make us better.

7133~~~
Really good contribution today when he came on and grabbed another assist!

7134~~~
I was pleased that he did good when he came on today.

7135~~~
He'll regain his starting spot without a doubt, he's way too good not to. LVG just wants him to earn it the hard way.

7136~~~
In limited game time, he got another assist.

Top class. Has to start. Him, Mata and Herrera need to play as often as possible.

7137~~~
An assist that was really created by Rooney's brilliance. Other than the assist, I didn't see much from di Maria.

7138~~~
If di Maria misplaced his pass, then there's no goal, as with the Mata goal vs Liverpool. That's something Young and Valencia fail to do, not only today, but throughout the whole season. They've both massively improved, however, their end product isn't good enough.

7139~~~
Definitely agree. Young and Valencia seem to loft it towards the backpost (usually aiming for Fellaini), or straight at the defenders legs in Valencia's case, which is way too high for the short Rooney. Di Maria just places it at a good level for Rooney to work his magic.

7140~~~
And yet we still had chances. This team has never created much all season long, even with di Maria in the lineup. But today and in the past few games, we weren't headless chickens that were in each other's way all the time. I'm not solely putting that on di Maria, I'm also not saying we can't make it work with di Maria, but right now, the team is performing as good as it has all season long without him in the starting lineup. Young, while not being efficient with his crosses, was nevertheless a threat all game long and working very hard on his flank to constantly put pressure on Villa. It's not as if di Maria played on brilliant pass after another, he had an assist, which was just as much Rooney's good work as it was his pass, but outside of that he didn't do much either.

One thing people have to grasp is, I want di Maria to start and perform well as much as anybody for several reasons:
- He's amongst the world's best and a lot of fun to watch, while also capable of adding a dimension to our play that no other player has.
- We paid a club record for him, so I want him to work out just so he was worth the money we spent on him.
- Following up on my first point, if we can't include a player of his caliber and abilities into our play, then we have serious issues because while the team is doing well right now, it is still not good enough to be the dominant force we want to be again. ADM is too good not to perform for us at one point or another. 

Despite all of those points, the team comes first to me and right now, he has to earn his spot in the lineup again.

7141~~~
Just because Young and Valencia aren't good at crossing doesn't mean di Maria's pass was great just because it was good in comparison to the end product of the other two. Young and Valencia, on the other hand, are work horses on the flanks, that make sure we are solid and don't get run, something di Maria doesn't do. 
As I said though, even if the pass was great, he didn't offer much else and that's the problem.

7142~~~
This. And by doing so Van Gaal helps him. The coach is taking pressure off because starting players are judged more critically imo.

7143~~~
Who cares if the pass wasn't great, the most important thing is that he chose the right pass, a great pass to the wrong player is useless.

7144~~~
The cross was fine. If a cross leads to the recipient scoring a goal, then I couldn't care less about the quality. 

Having been very flat for the first 25 minutes of the second half, we looked much better when di Maria came on, and scored 2 goals.

7145~~~
Di Maria can make as many poor assists as he likes as far as I'm concerned.

7146~~~
And once Di Maria get there, I think he'll do his best never to be benched regularly again. He'll become a better player.

7147~~~
12 assists in the PL, which is excellent. For some reason, everywhere else keeps counting 2 less than this. I assume that one of those is the "assist" for winning the penalty against Burnley, but I don't know what the other one is.

7148~~~
Brilliant post mate.

7149~~~
Isn't it 10 assists in the league?

7150~~~
According to here, it's 13 in all comps, with 12 in the league, but other places say 10 in the league. I'm just wondering where the discrepancy comes from.

7151~~~
Hmm, some places are saying 11 in the league too.

7152~~~
I thought it was 12 assists in total, 11 PL and 1 being the cross for Rooney against Arsenal in the FA Cup?

I don't know if I'm missing a Di Maria assist:

Mata v QPR
Herrera vs Leicester
Falcao vs Everton
Fellaini vs WBA
Mata vs Palace
Rooney vs Arsenal
RVP vs Burnley
winning penalty vs Burnley (counts as an assist according to some places)
Herrera vs Swansea
Mata vs Liverpool
Rooney vs Villa

Rooney vs Arsenal (FA Cup)

7153~~~
I appreciate that van Gaal loves control and structure and all that jazz, but it's genuinely a bit tragic that he loves it so much that he's playing Ashley Young ahead of di María. By the end of this season di María will probably have more assists for United than Young has in his entire United career (15), and even when off form he is so, so, so much more dangerous. 

I have no idea how Young has managed to convince so many people that he is a "threat" for United, when the vast majority of the time his "threatening" play results in a useless cross or a safe backpass. Yes he gets on the ball and runs at people more often than most of our players it results in so few genuine chances being created. Di María on the other hand can look disinterested, brainless and uninvolved and still create multiple chances.

I'm not convinced he's at all happy here and there's a definite possibility he'll be moving on in the summer, but even if that's the case he's still a much more useful asset than Ashley Young.

7154~~~
I think that you are looking at it the wrong way, most of the time Di Maria ball lost aren't made when he tries a killer ball, but when we are moving the ball, for some reason his attention is less sharp when he isn't trying something special.

Last week I said that no top players have a succeeded pass percentage that low, but I was wrong, I thought about Bayern's players like Ribery and Muller in particular and they are no better than Di Maria with that stat in particular the difference is that they lose the ball much higher than Di Maria.

Van gaal can't ignore that, Di Maria can try everything in the final third but like everyone else, he needs to be meticulous in the other parts of the field, and lately he wasn't careful enough.

7155~~~
Plus, our forwards are talented and/or physical enough that perfect passes are not required. Half chances win games, as we have proven once again by creating a goal from a scrap of inspiration.

7156~~~
He will never be meticulous. Giggs played over two decades of football for us and even in his latter years never managed to be meticulous. He gave the ball away with stupid, fancy flicks and careless, straightforward passes right up until the end. Di María is exactly the same. He's an instinctive player and carelessness comes into it when the game slows down too much, and because of that he might never be a perfect fit for a van Gaal team. His attitude at the moment probably exacerbates that. It doesn't change the fact that even though he's not a perfect fit he's still far more useful than Ashley Young.

7157~~~
I genuinely don't agree with the part in bold, which I never thought I'd say.

I don't think we can rely on Di Maria in the long run.

He doesn't seem to have the intelligence to play a possession game, and is too erratic in his passing and overall decision making.

Until the end of the season I'd play Young over him.

7158~~~
1 minute into the game and an assist. I like Young and commend him for pulling his United career out of a gutter but he is 10 pence to Di Maria's pound.

7159~~~
He really is. When the end product is around 10 times better than Young's, I can forgive him for losing the ball a few times more. Just look at the last two matches, Young played quite well but on the end didn't produced much. Di Maria played only a bit and while wasn't that specacular made two assists, and created two other great chances which in the end was the difference between a win and a draw.

Despite him being this 'bad' and missing many games he's our second most productive player and is leading on assists.

7160~~~
I don't think he's playing Young ahead of him as some permanent thing or that he rates him higher in the system, it'd just be harsh to drop Young as he was in good form and did nothing wrong at all, plus he does a lot of defensive work and has a good understanding with Blind. His attacking output is very poor of course but he keeps his width and works hard always which is also important for the general shape of the team. Di Maria started every game until he got sent off against Arsenal (and was in poor form even if most on here went way overboard), then was suspended for the Spurs game and our team as a whole had our best performance of the season. Would have been incredibly harsh on Young to put him back in and wouldn't have sent the right message I think if he just walked back in on the back of a dumb suspension while the rest of the team put out a great performance. 

Since then Di Maria had 2 relatively promising sub appearances (really good today, meh against Liverpool) while Young had just a few decent games. Wouldn't surprise me to see him starting in the next game or two again, but with it being City and Chelsea you could also understand Van Gaal wanting the extra defensive solidity and then using Di maria from the bench later on to change the game if necessary.

Next season I'm sure we'll see him back at his best, or in good form. There were a feck ton of problems with the whole team this season, he tried carrying us at first, but then got injured and since then it's been very stop start for him with everything going on. A proper pre season and a year behind him in the premier league will do him a world of good IMO. Selling him would be a huge mistake, especially considering the money we'd get is completely irrelevant to us as we can afford anyone anyways.

7161~~~
Another assist! He was pretty good when he came on I thought. Would definitely consider starting him in the next game. He has a lot more end product than Young, but is more likely to lose the ball too. It's a risky decision to make.

7162~~~
Wait, he's getting criticised for today?

feck me, talk about agendas. He came on, didn't give the ball away (horrah!) and got himself (another) assist.

7163~~~
Yea but it was a bad assist. Or something.

7164~~~
Angel Di Maria is at 13 assists right now according to the stats in this thread. That means he tied Valencia's best season for the league, Beckhams second best season in 97-98 and he's one behind Nani who is at second place with 14 assist in a season. Beckham 99-00 leads the charts with 15, so Di Maria would hold the Manchester United assist record if he makes two more until the end of the season.

So even with the worst possible season as the scenario, he could still beat the record of most assists in the league in one season for a United player. Even if he doesn't play a game more he's in the top 3 with only Nani/Becks ahead of him.

7165~~~
I still don't think he should start and I don't expect him to either. Keep him coming off the bench to great effect at times ( 2 assists recently).

7166~~~
Its funny how when stats got rolled out to show how under appreciated Mata was everyone jumped on them and said stats mean nothing. For di Maria they seem to mean everything.

He has loads of assists which is great, but 2 were shots that happened to go to players who put them in, and todays was a bad cross turned into an assist by a great striker. Even last weeks chip was a poor chip that was made an assist by an outrageous volley. I can't remember many of his other assists but I think the point is stats don't tell the whole story.

Before anyone jumps down my throat i want him to do well. Personally i think he'll be off to psg this or next summer.

7167~~~
Even if you ignore the stats, you'd have to be blind to fail to see that di María has posed a genuine threat against every team he's played against and is significantly more dangerous than the likes of Ashley Young. For me, all this criticism about last week's "poor" assist does suggest there's some sort of weird agenda here. Yes, that was the only way Mata could've scored it first time and it was a moment of brilliance...but he could quite easily have controlled it and slotted it into the far corner or crossed it to a free man at the back post. It was a little behind him, that's it. He still created the chance out of very little. It was a very creative pass that required a quality finish - di María is the only player I can remember being criticised for something like this.

7168~~~
Nearly correct but the 13 assists are in all competitions, like the cross for Rooney's header against Arsenal in the Cup. I think he's on 10 or 11 in just the League but that is still a lot and you're right he might set the record by the end of the season.

7169~~~
Wilson v QPR
Falcao v Leicester (could count as an assist, e.g. on Fantasy Premier League it would)

7170~~~
He got criticised for his 'bad assist' yesterday as well. Its beyond mental.

We spent 60 odd minutes watching Young blindly cross it to no one about a hundred times, and get praised by everyone as having a great game, then Di Maria comes on, within 10 minutes has picked out Rooney to make it 2-0, and yet apparently he was rubbish. There's clearly an agenda. I was as pissed off as anyone with his work rate against Liverpool (despite a very good assist) but yesterday he was faultless. It seems like the narrative has been set though.

7171~~~
People are expecting more from a man we spent £60m on. The odd thing is, at his best last season, he acquired 17 assists and 9 goals, at this point, and that, too, having played far more games, in a better and more settled team. 

Man Utd 14/15: 17 goals and assists in 27 apps = 0.62 G/A per game
R Madrid 13/14: 26 goals and assists in 43 apps = 0.60 G/A per game

The only criticism I have of him is that he hasn't shown enough of the effort, attitude and determination we observed  during the last few months of last season, particularly in the champions league final. However, you can completely understand that he wasn't concentrating as well as he could have following the burglary incident. When you buy an offensive player for that amount of money, you expect him to create and you cannot fault him there, as his numbers are better than a large proportion of the players in the PL.

7172~~~
I have complete faith that he will turn out to be a great investment. He's far too good to fail. Actually it might sound strange but im not even worried about him.

7173~~~
Brwned has hit the nail on the head. Forget the stats, possession and what not, he poses a <span style="text-decoration: underline">threat.</span> It's something that we lack on most of our other players. Yes Young can run up and down all day long, run at players and provide good width, and he has done really well, but his acts in the final third are nowhere near to what Di Maria is capable of. We have to work towards getting that out of him consistently. Even when Di Maria fecks up in the end, it is only due to his brainfart or a wrong decision, the opposition usually have no clue how to deal with him. And those "brainfarts" or things that look bad in hindsight come with every ambitious and creative player. He tries to make things happen with every touch, and has the technical ability on the ball to execute that, better than anyone else we have. Plus, his best attribute by far, is the world class vision that he has. It's something you can't train, and even when he's not hitting the passes perfectly, the runs and movements he picks out wouldn't be picked out by someone like Young in a whole season, no matter how hard he works. He adds tremendous amount of unpredictability in our game, and he can only get better. 

And of course, he has genuine scary pace, which is simply a big weapon to hold.

7174~~~
Everyone needs to chill out. Despite the decent stats, he's not been at his best. That said, he's not been hopeless either, there've been plenty of signs of a very special player even in amongst some of his poorer performances, and his productivity has been decent. He'll settle down properly in the summer, get a good pre-season in, sort out the situation with his family, and we'll soon be seeing the best of him.

7175~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYx5f7hJKRg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

It's easy to forget how good he was at Real. I reckon next year he's going to step up and we will see the old Di Maria again.

7176~~~
Yep, even when he's clearly not at his best, he looks like the most likely player to create something when he's on the pitch. Has that X factor about him. With his ability and pace, he'l always create problems for teams the way Young cant.

That said, I feel the equation between him and Young gets much more balanced when it comes to the left wing role as Di Maria isnt as good there. Should play either centrally or on the right but Mata has done brilliantly on the right and deserves to keep his place while our current CM options mean Fellaini will start in the middle.

Next year would be a much better one for him. Other than all the factors mentioned, us getting a proper CM would help everyone play more in more natural positions.

7177~~~
For me, we should be starting him in every game for the rest of the season. He's a top player who figures to be a key part of our side and I don't think he's fully acclimated to the squad and league like Blind has for example. If nothing else, we should be using these last games to get him going. Remember, he's off to Copa America in the summer and will probably not play any part in our preseason.

7178~~~
feck, I completely forgot about Copa America. That's annoying.

7179~~~
Had no idea the Copa America took place this summer, that won't help at all... He could come back gassed.

7180~~~
Well after another spending spree, I doubt he's going to be main man next year anyway. So if anything he will probably have more room to breathe.

7181~~~
Copa America is really bad news. I forgot about it, but now i remmeber that it is in Chile. feck, really wanted him to be fresh for the season.

7182~~~
Highly doubt we'll see a spending spree like we had this past summer. No way we're spending near 150m again.

If anything, it seems as though this summer will most likely consist of a few tweaks to the squad - as opposed to buying half a new squad like last summer.

7183~~~
We might end up spending north of £100m again but the number of players might be lower - we signed 5 (6 if we count Falcao loan) last year, I think we'll sign 3-4 this Summer but they might be more expensive in total. If we got Hummels it's £35m gone already, then Depay would probably cost another £20m and we might buy a £40m midfielder on top of that too (although when it comes to midfielders I feel it's more like a question of £60m it'd cost to bring someone special, say Pogba, and £20m to bring a talent).

7184~~~
some of his assists have been like that in the league this season

Fellaini v West Brom
Mata v Crystal Palace
Rooney v Aston Villa
Mata v Liverpool

That and his famous miss hit shot/pass trick.

7185~~~
We are definitely spending at least £100m in this current climate.

7186~~~
Amazes me to see people not give him credit for that assist to Mata against Liverpool. Who cares if it was a little behind Mata, most players wouldn't attempt that pass, that is not an ordinary pass to make.

7187~~~
Exactly. Seems a lot of posters have an agenda against him for whatever reason. 

di Maria and Mata are the only two in the team who'd try that.

7188~~~
Suddenly he's a fortunate assist maker...

Assist is an assist. 


Sure he could do better but some people go overboard with criticism.

7189~~~
He's quite consistent been our most creative player this season (and by some distance) but there's no need to exaggerate. All of Blind, Rooney and Herrera are more than capable of such passes.

No one has an agenda. I love the fact that he keeps on trying to create things even when we were playing shite. But there's no harm in admitting that he's been struggling for a bit of form lately. I'm sure he'll be back in the team soon enough.

7190~~~
Not suddenly - he has been fortunate with a fair few of his assists this season. But that's not a bad thing/complaint... just an observation. What's that saying about buying a ticket for a raffle?

7191~~~
You don't get consistently as lucky as he does. He releases the ball accurately and early and gives players the best chance of scoring they can, that's not fortune. 

It's also why Valencia has suddenly become as threatening as damp cotton wool.

7192~~~
Dont know. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7193~~~
Think he'll come on and show his class today...

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/euOi5hKBuv6/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

7194~~~
Unless he absolutely rips City apart, assuming he comes on later, he won't be starting much; Ashley Young has been superb.

7195~~~
Shows how much he can't wait to leave when celebrating our goal on the bench <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

7196~~~
Yeah, he was so quick to leave his seat, shows he wants out!

7197~~~
Don't expect to see him starting the next few games. He seems to think he has more time on the ball than he actually does.

7198~~~
What the heck is this? We were down to ten men and didn't need to take any risks. Against Liverpool, when he looking to make things happen and losing the ball, he was crucified; now he's looking to keep hold of the ball, you're so how managing to criticise him for that.

7199~~~
Exactly. Not one player can be criticised today, was a fantastic team performance all around.

7200~~~
That's not really what he was saying. He sometimes dwells on the ball too long and ends up being dispossessed while trying to make something happen, not while trying to protect the ball. He's right and I'm sure it's a confidence thing.

7201~~~
We quite clearly dropped off in the last ten minutes, so there weren't many passes on for him, so he decided to keep the ball as opposed to passing. Its a silly attempt at criticising him for nothing, as Joaquin, above, says, no player deserves criticism.

7202~~~
What? Don't know what you're talking about, I didn't criticize him for this game, just an observation. He was dispossessed a few times because he was too slow to react, something that it seems Young is much better at.

You need to read again what I wrote.

7203~~~
:-D

7204~~~
Cant see him wanting to stay this summer, but we'll see. Choice is obviously his.

7205~~~
Its a negative observation, with the intent of criticising him. You're hardly praising him in your post.

7206~~~
Yeah well he was dispossessed because of it so it's hardy a positive thing. However, I didn't said things you accused me of earlier.

7207~~~
What I'm saying is that there were hardly any options for him, when he was on the ball. Our performance dropped off, hence the goal. He wasn't the only one guilty of wrong doings, in the last 10 minutes. However, it's understandable as we were 4-1 up and down to 10 men, something you failed to acknowledge.

7208~~~
When we're back in Europe and playing more games I desperately hope he decides to stay another season and prove himself. Wouldn't blame him for leaving but I hope he doesn't.

7209~~~
not to blame for anything today , came on , we went a man down and gave up a nothing goal. i wouldn't change the team to get him in it  with young and mata playing well for the team.

7210~~~
Maybe he'll feel more like he's competing and less like has to be the star man in the current climate which might help him. He did fine when he came on I felt as the game was winding down.

7211~~~
He shot he took.... What the fark was that abt?

7212~~~
Would you necessarily miss Di Maria if we sold him for £35m this summer or swapped him with another quality player?

7213~~~
Yes!
As decent as we have been this season, a similar season next year (not competing for the title, out of all competitions) will be a failure next year. So we still need to do much better and we are for sure not going to do that if we sell our better players.

7214~~~
Why is this question asked every 10 pages?

7215~~~
Because its an ongoing season? and opinions are bound to change after every 4 or 5 games?

To put it into perspective - 5 games ago, fans were sulking over a Welbeck winner in the FA cup and the whole forum was gloomy.

7216~~~
The answer is the same as it was before. 

If he wants to go and is seriously unhappy, let him go. 

If he isnt and is willing to fight for his place, he should stay. He is obviously a quality player and there is every chance he will prove that next season if he stays.

7217~~~
I doubt it. We have Januzaj and the option of bringing Nani back. That gives us 4 players to compete for the wide positions.

In the first half of the season the team kept possession until Di Maria took responsibility for creating something; which sometimes came off and other times looked reckless. Our pattern of play is now different, as is our team shape.

I suspect he'll stay; if only because the number of clubs who could afford him is so small and they may have other priorities.

7218~~~
Quality player.. Mad people are saying sell him.. He hasnt had one season yet in a new league.. He will come good

7219~~~
Absolutely ridiculous question. Yeah, lets make a £25 million pound loss on a player who has been here for less than a season. He might not have set the world alight just yet but he still has a bucket load of assists. 

To be honest though, its a bit daft trying to justify why we shouldn't sell Di fecking Maria for £35 million. Jesus, Andy carroll sold for that years ago.

7220~~~
Why are you always so angry and aggressive? Go have a rub out or something.

7221~~~
If you disagree with me, then say so. I know you'd rather be the smart arse all the time, but there's a time and place for that.

7222~~~
Calm down, I'm not even sure why you're so aggressive right now, people seem to think they NEED to reply to every comment i guess.

7223~~~
No, not every comment. Just the silly ones. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7224~~~
If he wants to leave because of Ashley Young then he has a problem, I mean, what happened to actually believing in the simple fact that you're better and will get back into the team by working harder and raising your game? Having said that, I think he'll stay, he's a quality player.

7225~~~
Suppose an important question would be how Van Gaal plans on shoehorning Di Maria, Young, and Depay (if we buy him) into the squad.

7226~~~
Rotation.

7227~~~
Silly to you? Doesn't seem so silly then <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7228~~~
I think we'l get a proper No 8, play Mata/Herrera as the No 10 and Depay/Young + Di Maria as the wingers. Needless to say, he'l need to be at his best otherwise it'l be Herrera as the No 10 and Mata on the right.

7229~~~
Really? You don't think selling our record signing, the player who was arguably Madrids best during their Champions league winning season, for a £25 million loss after less than a season here, would be silly?

Sounds silly to me.

7230~~~
I'm not being a smart arse, I'm telling you you're overly rude and aggressive to other posters on the website.

7231~~~
Yes, we have heard the tales about Di Maria's magical 13/14 season, some people even witnessed It, but that isn't really relevant right now.

The question was asked as a result of the team finding the right balance without Di Maria not with the intention of definitely discarding Di Maria, he has been an ok player this season and his assists have been key but will he really be missed?

The plan was to get top 4 and find a system that would enable us to contend next season and that is exactly what LVG has done, and he has been able to achieve it without his best player.

Regarding his transfer fee, I don't see us getting the 60m back, since we can all agree we overpaid. We would be lucky to find a buyer for 40m, I don't think its possible.

7232~~~
Why do people keep having the thought that he's unhappy and wants to leave the club? Where is this idea from?

7233~~~
I'd rather keep him. It would be a bit stupid to take such a loss on a player who's in his first season at a new club and country. He's had off-field problems too with the house break in. Plus we've chopped and changed our formation so much this season and he's found himself being played as a striker, winger and midfielder this season so it's probably been difficult to find consistency to his game.

Would be a good idea to give him an opportunity in a consistent side next season. He just looks like he's completely devoid of any confidence right now. Maybe he will do well in the Copa America this summer and start next season like he did last august.

7234~~~
Was wondering that too. Besides some rumours here and there I've not seen anything substantial to suggest he wants to go.

7235~~~
he deserves another season to prove he's good enough for us but it all depends on ADM's attitude, nobody knows if he's happy or unhappy here. Personally if PSG come knocking this summer I think he will want to leave, I wouldn't be too upset if a player swap was on the cards as there's a few PSG players I wouldn't mind.

7236~~~
What on earth has he done to change opinions, in the last few weeks? He didn't feature against Tottenham, played 35 minutes against Liverpool, 20 odd against Villa and 10 last Sunday. Those who want him to leave, like yourself, will still want him to go and those who don't, like myself, want him to stay. 

The second part of your post isn't completely different and puts nothing into perspective.

7237~~~
Well considering 5 games ago we still didn't have a winning system and a consistent first 11, I think the second part of my post is pretty relevant, it's one thing to talk about Di Maria the starter in a team that isn't consistent, it's another to talk about Di Maria the star on the bench who doesn't seem to have much effect on the team these days, starting Di Maria might tamper with team chemistry which was not the case 5 matchdays ago, we are winning without him and winning well, hence my question about fans missing him next season if we sell him ( Im not advocating selling him btw).

7238~~~
This one is said a lot, but it's ultimately irrelevant when you consider that Carroll was worth nothing near that.

I <i>do </i>think we should keep Di Maria because he hopefully has a lot more to offer us and has been productive at times, but £35m wouldn't be a ridiculous figure <i>if </i>we were going to sell him. I don't think we should though, and I doubt he'll go.

7239~~~
It will be interesting to see if he can become disciplined enough for Van Gaal while still maintaining the explosiveness that is fundamental to the best parts of his game.

Couldn't care less about the money, keep him. If it doesn't work out the agents will sort it.

7240~~~
By that logic, we probably shouldn't buy in the summer, as it may "tamper with team chemistry". As well as Young has played, recently, di Maria is an obvious upgrade and will probably take over, come next season. Just as we will probably replace Valencia, Carrick, and Fellaini with better players. So, no, we shouldn't sell him.

7241~~~
Fair enough here. I disagree with you though, especially on us being lucky to get £40 million for him. In my opinion there's no chance we'd take less than £50 million for him even if we were stupid enough to sell. I think he'll be back to his old self next year, not that he's been bad this year mind you.

7242~~~
Surely we wouldn't have purchased him if van Gaal didn't think di Maria would not fit into his philosophy? Especially, given that we spent £60m on him.

What's going on with di Maria is very similar to the situations Mata and Herrera found themselves in, not too long ago. As it was then, the same ridiculous questions and assumptions keep popping up: will we sell Herrera? Why did we buy Herrera? Mata is not good enough to start away from home, we will sell him. They don't fit into the philosophy. Yet both disproved everyone, and people seem to learn very little from their mistakes. We won't be selling di Maria for £35 or £50 million, players of his calibre aren't available every season. If you visit the transfer threads, people speak about purchasing Bale, a player who's quite similar to our number 7, will he not suffer from the same issues as di Maria? Most flair players will struggle to become accustomed to a new style, but you don't throw them away and buy a new, shiny toy; we'll become the club we absolutely despise. (This rant isn't aimed at you)

7243~~~
The question wasn't necessarily about selling Di Maria, but more about its impact to the team, but yeah thanks for your contribution.

7244~~~
What team in Europe would pay £40m for him though? realistically..... again not advocating his sale.

7245~~~
I think the only team is the obvious team; PSG. I think they'd happily pay it and I really can't see him going anywhere else.

7246~~~
I'm sur he can fit in, my concern is that his best football came as a midfielder running at defenders and taking chances.  It will be interesting to see what heights he can achieve when he fully adapts to Van Gaalball.

7247~~~
Nevs analysis of our attacking play on MNF last night did make me wonder how someone like Di Maria would ever be able to fit in with what LvG demands. Di Maria is a traditional maverick winger, lots of risk and minimal discipline, you either accept it or he's not the player for you, not sure how him and LvG will find a middle ground given how demanding LvG seems to be.

7248~~~
I'm sure he will be fine. Robben and Ribery performed quite well during van Gaal's reign, for Bayern (and Netherlands). Messi, Pedro and Sanchez did just fine (or abnormally well) for Barcelona when Guardiola was manager. All the players named are your typical flair players who are characterised by their insistence on running at opposition players and taking more risks than others; and they've all excelled when playing under a manager keen on possession based football.

7249~~~
This has been said many times before, there is some truth in that Di Maria needs to change a little to fit in. Overall though, van Gaal always used players who have freedom to use individual quality. Robben and Ribery at Bayern for example.

He doesn't have to keep possesion all the time, that's not his job. He needs to make things happen and therefore can lose the ball in acceptable places. In a rigid, well drilled system a risk taking Di Maria could be devastating. He needs to learn where and when to take these risks though and not always go for goal if he's in a dangerous position.

7250~~~
What on earth do we do with Angel?  We can't keep a £60m player on the bench or for cameo roles but we also don't want to take a big loss on him.

7251~~~

7252~~~
He will be flying next season

7253~~~
Time for him to come on and create a goal for us as he does practically every time he is on the pitch. We knocked the ball around great in that half but didn't really have any end product. Should any of us be surprised though when you leave out your most productive players for those who have very little end product? Young was great in the last game so understandably starts in this one, but the stats tell you that the last game was an exception for him make no mistake, in general we'd be better off with Angel. Then there is Falcao... he should be in Angel's spot on the bench (if that) with Rooney up front without any doubt.

7254~~~
Bring him on. Might give Ivanovic a tougher time

7255~~~
Needs to come on for Falcao really. We have to gamble.

7256~~~
200 injuries, still on the bench

If I was him I would already asked to leave and refused to go on the bench.

7257~~~
Poor man's Hazard.

And that's still incredibly generous.

7258~~~
We weren't saying that when he was at Madrid or at the beginning of our season. Nevertheless, I find that comment to be pretty harsh on Di Maria when we all know he has the ability to influence game as much as Hazard does.

7259~~~
Was better than hazard last season. And performed in bigger games such as the cl final.

7260~~~
Last season, at Madrid.

What's he done lately?

7261~~~
What is wrong with him? Can't seem to get the simple passes right but can execute the more audacious ones.

7262~~~
Moved to a new club in a country in an unsettled team. And still more productive than hazard.

7263~~~
Watching that game and our attack unable to unlock Chelsea's defence, he was the one player I wanted on the pitch and that's why despite all of his weaknesses I think he should be a starter.

Blind-Young-Fellaini worked as a unit as did Valencia-Mata-Herrera but both were broken today.

7264~~~
Hes not a playmaker. Simple as. Madrid used him perfectly. Hes all about running at defenders, crossing and inventive passing.

7265~~~
Which means absolutely nothing right now

7266~~~
I don't get it either but hopefully Louis van Gaal will identify the issue and solve it next season.

7267~~~
It certainly means a lot if you're judging them as footballers.

7268~~~
Perfect example of stats being complete bollocks.

7269~~~
Please don't sign any more South Americans. They're simply not suited to the PL.

7270~~~
Di Maria is not better than Hazard, trying to compare both of them (especially after this season) is blasphemous.

7271~~~
LVG needs to play him in his best position or we will get Nani esq performances

7272~~~
Sanchez says hi.

7273~~~
Perfect example of a bollocks point. Hes a new player in a new league. Give him a break ffs. Let's see hazard be stunning in big champions league games including a final shall we before belittling our own players.

7274~~~
And Suarez. And tevez.

7275~~~
I didn't compare them.

7276~~~
He's been a little bit hung out to dry in this one. Young's success has been largely down to a good overlapping fullback opening things up for him. With Blackett coming on, he was one against two, waiting for an overlap that wasn't coming.

7277~~~
Well we certainly don't sign the right ones. Utter shite

7278~~~
Di Maria had a great season with Madrid, he should never be criticised, he gets a pass.

Who are we to talk ill about a player that was great in the CL final, criticise the whole squad except Di Maria - it's a new league and a new country ( for Sanchez too).

7279~~~
Who is utter shit?

7280~~~
Di Maria.

7281~~~
I really expected more from him today. Replacing Shaw with Blackett didn't help him but still very disappointing cameo.

7282~~~
Eh? He didnt even start today. This sounds like a bunch of children who want to moan.

7283~~~
He done little wrong today. Blackett was very poor which didnt help him

7284~~~
Di Maria was decent, Januzaj subs was the wrong one. Offers absolutely nothing

7285~~~
Factually incorrect.

Next!

7286~~~
A bit shit today but accusations of him lacking team ethic or not working hard are obviously bollocks.

7287~~~
Ashley Young done feck all during the game. Mata created nothing. We looked instantly more dangerous going forward when Di Maria was on.

7288~~~
Still think he will be our main man next season. No good judging him at the moment on 15 minute cameos.

7289~~~
Di Maria was fantastic when he come on. It was Blackett's fault everything he fecked up.

7290~~~
This site at times <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7291~~~
Not this season it's not he couldn't run past a post.

7292~~~
He wasn't fantastic at all. That long ball to a marked Valenica was the most brain dead decision I've seen on a footy pitch.

7293~~~
Blackett is not a United quality player. He'll never make it here. Really did kill the left hand side when he came on. Thought Shaw was fantastic today and he could really strike a good partnership with Di Maria, as could Blind.

7294~~~
Still looks the most likely to make things happen despite poor form and lack of match rhythm. Should just be played whenever available and hopefully play him into form like Fergie used to do with Rooney a lot.

7295~~~
Yep, because other players don't play bad passes.

7296~~~
Shaw when he is fully fit will be amazing, he hasn't been at all this season and was getting knackered before he got pulled off it seemed.

7297~~~
Chelsea - World Class player - moment of brilliance, game winner/changer.

United - World Class player - can barely beat his man.

But somehow I'm not meant to point that out because he has 10+ assists and 4+ goals

7298~~~
Are you 5 years old? Calm down and post once you've gotten the red mist out of your eyes.

7299~~~
Blackett should not be in our squad, totally agree, never been impressed with him and he looks shite in the U21 even. Not easy for Di Maria after Shaw went off.

7300~~~
Have us some much needed directness and creativity. Blackett didn't help him one bit.

7301~~~
If only he could single handedly run past 3 man at every opportunity. fecking useless!!!

7302~~~
Having Shaw overlap would have helped him. They just double teamed every time he got the ball. Blackett was useless in that role. No overlaps what so ever.

7303~~~
If he could run past one, it'd be a start..

7304~~~
Can see he's at zero confidence.

7305~~~
Whatever... Just sick of him trying to run past a defender and giving away the ball and then not tracking back (that's the worst bit). Just get shut in the summer.

7306~~~
Blackett wasn't good at all today to be fair to Di Maria. 

Was an OK cameo from ADM. Moments of gold and moments of "what?". He needs to do put in a good cameo to start ahead of Young still.

7307~~~
What did you think of Herrera's attempt to assist their second?

Or Rooney losing the ball at every other "Hollywood" pass?

7308~~~
I
I have been critical of Shaw but today I was very impressed and he seems to have improved massively going forward.

7309~~~
It would be, if he was faced with one...maybe with a bit of support.

The game was over long before he came on. But putting Blackett on was a real blow, he was brain dead.

7310~~~
Young offered nothing today. Can't keep putting a player on the bench and expecting them to work miracles when they get 15-20 minutes per match.

7311~~~
That cross-field pass to Valencia was pretty hilarious to be fair to him.

7312~~~
He's clearly had a tough year settling in England and English football. He hasn't been the player he can be but he's still been very productive, something we always seem to praise Rooney for (but first touch but gets a goal etc). I think he's a cracking player but he'll be that for us only if he settled properly. I personally hope he stays and that happens. 

Eithe way stuff like "he's shit" is childish and really unproductive.

7313~~~
Dude, you need to go to specsavers...

Are you able to generate opinions of your own? Did you forget when he was the furthest man back tracking Drogba(?) and stopped them from creating a goal?

7314~~~
A few good forward passes into the box. He was doubled/tripled up on at times whilst Blackett looked like he was playing his first game of football ever. Not much he could do really. I'd like to see him start against Everton with Shaw behind him.

7315~~~
That was abysmal. He and Herrera need to cut disaster passes out.

7316~~~
Blackett didnt help him out at all, its true. Still I just feel that ADMs decision making and passing/final ball seems really sloppy.

7317~~~
Start him and Shaw next week on the left please. He needs to play a game from the start to see if he can influence it more.

7318~~~
He has to start games. Pretty sure that he will get back to his old form - you can see glimpses of his Quality in every game.

7319~~~
It's like people forget this.

7320~~~
I disagree. There's no doubt that Di Maria gives you more end product than Young. Therefore in a team that controls games but sometimes doesn't create enough chances with that dominance, he should clearly be starting. Admittedly you might lose a little bit of that control and comfort in keeping possession but it's worth it to become a more dangerous side on the attack. We'd still dominate most teams in the possession anyway.

7321~~~
Should have kept Young on and put Di Maria on the right.

7322~~~
I agree with this, but I feel (not LVGs fault really since Shaw wasn't fit) that Shaw down the left coming off hurt us quite a bit.

7323~~~
Di Maria should be played on the right, not on the left.

7324~~~
Young was miles better for the team. He was shite, but to be fair he did have Blackett helping him out. Should have stuck him wide right.

7325~~~
If we get one of Carrick or Blind back next week, then why change a system that is working so well right now with Mata-Herrera-Valencia. That chemistry was broken up today.

7326~~~
What about having Rooney upfront and ADM in CM? We played with 10 men today thanks to Falcao

7327~~~
Di Maria will never be the player people want him to be and what he can be if we play him on the left. Its his 3rd best position.

Fwiw, I wouldn't break the Mata-Herrera-Valencia trio either, Di Maria should be on the bench. I'm just commenting on our use of him.

7328~~~
I'd like us to go into the next season with Mata behind Rooney and Di Maria on the right.

7329~~~
Start him with Felliani and Blind/ or Shaw and he could be lethal..not with Blackett please..

7330~~~
For real? Don't see how a team with 10 men could possibly dominate that much of the ball at stamford bridge. How much of the ball did Rooney see last week against City? Wasn't he getting praised for not leaving the forward position? 

Di Maria should start, right or left instead of Young. Can shift to the right and switch with Mata, Fellaini would be effective from either side.

7331~~~
I can't decide if he can't get his head around the system and how to use the triangles in the same way Young does so effectively, or he was instructed to play with more freedom as we needed a goal.

7332~~~
Apparently we can. Falcao was pretty useless today. 

I believe that ADM is a great player. He may be rusty but his class is pretty evident. Its a shame he's not liked so much in here.

7333~~~
That's for another threat I suppose. 

Yeah, It is a shame. That's why he needs to be starting games. These cameos are not enough for him to show his class, or playing on the left with Tyler Blackett.

7334~~~
.

Woo hoo he was the furthest man back in one Chelsea attach (he did have fresh legs)! I'm taking about the whole season. Get shut.

7335~~~
That would require a very strong CM though. 4-3-3 is safer for most games. Carrick-Herrera-new midfielder, ADM on the left, Mata as AMR (slipping inside) and Rooney upfront

7336~~~
A poor cameo in a very disappointing season (notwithstanding misleading stats which recategorise poor crosses or weak shots as assists). Someone needs to explain to him that you can't run through players and, in England at least, a defender won't be penalized for standing his ground.

7337~~~
One good cross for Fellaini and I'm sure he was the one that slipped Falcao in when he hit the post, not too bad but not the game changer I was hoping he'd be when he came on.

7338~~~
He really is frustrating. Like I said before, though, that's what you'll get from Di Maria on the wing. Some very good games, some very bad games, no in betweens - very similar to Nani.

7339~~~
So what has he been this season? Struggling to find his feet? £60m. That is all I need to say.

7340~~~
Once again, can you generate your opinions, or do you like the bandwagon?

His lack of tracking back is incredibly over stated; if you watched the games, you'd know. Yes, at times, he's guilty of letting his man go, but more often than not, it's not been the case, as he demonstrated today.

7341~~~
It just another incident to back-up my suspicions that he's a bit dim.

7342~~~
He still showed glimpses of class. That pass towards Falcao was sublime. Unfortunately Heske erm Falcao fecked it up.

Unfortunately EPL fans tend to prefer players who work their socks off and are usually ineffective instead of maestros who can split a defense in half with one pass. No wonder why Argentina had produced wingers such as Di Maria and Messi while England have to rely to the likes of Young and Vardy

7343~~~
He also needs to start games to find some form, you know like the rest of the team did in the good run we've been on?

7344~~~
Yes it would and I'm sure Van Gaal will get a top CM in this summer. When we've gone out and purchased a top player, I want to see him played in a position where he's good. Paying 60mil and whatever wages we're paying him for the Di Maria that is a left winger would be poor business.

7345~~~
Mata come in against Spurs for God knows how many games out and he was excellent. Shaw the same today. Poor excuse.

7346~~~
I've got no idea why he's being criticised like this.
He made a good run into their box but was crowded out, he had a good ball to Fellaini and one of the best passes to Falcao who was slightly offside, and twice he saved nearly-certain goal situations while tracking back. Once Blackett came on, he was 1v2 up against the best RB in the league helped by a winger playing purely as a spoiler.

EDIT: We're talking about a Mourinho team here that has gone all-out to defend, sometime even Messi struggles in that situation.

7347~~~
They started those games, so your examples are not exactly relevant. Had Di Maria started today and not had an impact then ok, but he didn't he was subbed on.

7348~~~
You mean like he was doing before he got sent off against Arsenal?

7349~~~
He actually had a decent game vs Arsenal (before he got sent off)

EDIT: I think its right Young has been keeping his place btw, just pointing out that what you said about him with reference to Mata and Shaw didn't really make sense.

Plus I also think he has done ok in most of his cameos, usually creating chances and getting assists.

7350~~~
He's been okay. 

That's a pretty useless thing to say. Blame fee owners for that if you want. 

Vidic and even were rubbish for united early on. Imagine if we spent 20 million them. Your all be losing the plot I reckon.

Have a bit of patience. It's as if he bummed your dog while you were on vacation.

7351~~~
The funny thing is that he's our many assist man

7352~~~
He was ok. The games before that?

7353~~~
No but he's shit. Assist don't mean anything. He shit.

7354~~~
I don't see how that is relevant to the link to Mata and Shaw?
Anyway the whole team has been playing well lately, which is good, I think if he gets his place back in the team, with the team playing well he'll be good.

7355~~~
If a local lad  had his assist record than we would be hearing a different tune altogether. Its a shame that ADM happens not to be likeable, the hardworking type (little brains but a lot of workrate) or British.

7356~~~
Other than directly contributing towards the goal, there's actually nothing special about an assist, though.

7357~~~
Yes there's nothing great about contributing towards a goal. Doesn't quite sound right now does it?

7358~~~
that's true. I mean who needs goals after all?

7359~~~
Cant wait for next season,think he gonna be so much better.Even at the moment he is not bad but its below his standard,tho i understand there are few factors why is that.

7360~~~
I guess i'll spell it out for you then. 

You said Di Maria needed a run of games. I said Mata and Shaw were able to come in after being out the team for a while and perform. You then said well Di Maria hasn't started, but failed to realise Di Maria had started the previous 6 or 7 games before that, including the game he got taken off against Sunderland at half time for being poor. Therefore he had a run of games and didn't produce. That's how it's relevant, and that's why he's currently out the team.

7361~~~
The pass he played to Falcao was absolutely outrageous, I think only Fabregas on the pitch could've played it (Falcao was offside but there's nothing Di Maria could do about that). That was just a glimmer of what he can do and why I think he should've started today. When you're coming up against a well-drilled wall you need a bit of magic to break it down. He would've given us a better chance and in hindsight, I think van Gaal got it wrong not to start him - totally agree with the decision not to start him in central midfield though, we want to control the game and we're not going to do that with him in the middle - it should've been for Young or Mata.

7362~~~
He's a more talented version of Nani really. Pacy, tricky and skillful but really frustrating. 

He'll never make it here as a central midfielder because he's just not reliable enough in possession but he's a great option out wide. He'll come good.

7363~~~
I don't mind people saying he hasn't performed like the top top player he has been in the past. But the knee jerk garbage and scapegoating is hilarious.

He hasn't been rubbish. Anyone who has created or scored a goal every 120 minutes or so like has, can't have been bad. 


I know his transfer fee gives people the need to be overly critical but that's where you have to use your brain and use a bit of perspective and show a bit of patience.

7364~~~
I've not missed a game in over 10 years. I know what I see and do I want United to take a risk on him next season. No I bloody don't.

7365~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What an odd comment, I mean its like saying there is nothing special about scoring, expect scoring the goal

7366~~~
Though he always tries alot of through balls, adventurous runs, or risky passes, and they dont always come off, today he was put on for that reason, we were loosing, may as well just let him do what he does and provide a moment of magic

But we all know Mourinho, drills his sides very well on how to sit back and absorb pressure

7367~~~
I'd rather football was changed to a sport where 22 men run up and down the pitch demonstrating their stamina, athleticism and hard work... although there maybe a sport that's similar...

7368~~~
Nobody touches MY dog! Sorry but that as brilliant ! Great post - lol

7369~~~
FFS no I didn't

7370~~~
Woah, stop, right there!!! I was being sarcastic!

7371~~~
Chees. I'm a little high so don't judge me if I talk nonsense although that's probably how I always post <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7372~~~
Phew! I was starting to think this place had gone insane!
Sorry, I left my sarcasm reading glasses in the other room.... doh!

7373~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> slated by sarcasm. Worst kind of death.

7374~~~
Starting games then.

7375~~~
My 14-year-old nephew hasn't missed a game in 11 years. He still makes ridiculously childish comments.

7376~~~
Always have mine on for this thread, given the crap I read.

7377~~~
He has a much better eye for a pass than Nani, hes not only about pace and trickery, he is probably one of a few players in the team, that can spot a difficult through pass / ball over the top and execute it.

7378~~~
Should've bought him on a bit earlier. I think he would've eventually got something Ivanovic who had locked Young down all game.

7379~~~
Again, no I didn't go and read back.
What I said was, your example of Mata and Shaw wasn't a good one and didn't make sense. Someone else was talking about starting games/ having a run of games.

7380~~~
Difference is in I've been watching 30 plus years.  Di Maria should not be given another year. Mark this post if you like.

7381~~~
Mata's been player of the season for a couple of years for Chelsea and it took him a while to settle. Give Di Maria time to adapt to both the league, and his manager's requirements. Unlike Moyes, he has a track record that says he belongs at the club.

7382~~~
That's true. It's the consistency that's his problem. He'll give the ball away a few times and then play a brilliant, defence-splitting pass to create a chance.

7383~~~
Luckily for us, you're not the manager.

Supposed, you'd want to trade him for the beast that is Danny Welbeck?

7384~~~
I agree.

7385~~~
What would be the point of selling him? we'd make a massive loss on him and still wouldn't get anyone as talented as a replacement. Pointless really.

7386~~~
Wow

7387~~~
No thought welbeck was a waste of a shirt too

7388~~~
How you can't see the relevance of Mata and Shaw when I have just explained it to you doesn't make sense.

Fact is, Di Maria out of the team because he's been fecking awful both, when starting and coming off the bench. That simple.

7389~~~
I'm actually interested, what exactly is your issue with Di Maria, you actually believe he has been totally useless this season?

7390~~~
We'd still probably get £40m which will be £20m more than next season and have won more games.

7391~~~
I've been reading your posts for years. You've mostly been wrong about everything.

7392~~~
I think he played well when he came on. One horrible ball across the midfield to Valencia but generally positive thinking, taking on players and beating them, looking to raise the tempo.

7393~~~
Unless he does a Ronaldo and really bulks up his top half plus works incredibly hard he's not going to cut it. We need a player that can be the difference as Hazard was today, he's not that.

7394~~~
Really... Fletcher fan are we..!

7395~~~
Mata had a run of games when he was poor, and so has Shaw. The whole team was pretty poor up until about a month ago tbh.
Di Maria hasn't been fecking awful all season, he had a poor run of games, yes granted, quite a few players have this season.
He has actually done well to ok in his recent cameos too.
Like I said before, I think its right Young has been keeping his place in the team, I don't have an issue with that.

7396~~~
Why does he need to bulk up his top half ffs? He has already show he doesn't need to do that. All he needs to do is be a little more careful with his passing.

7397~~~
I'm a United fan.

7398~~~
FFS! If any player gets pushed off the ball too easily it's Di Maria.

7399~~~
right and what player have I got wrong over the years...

7400~~~
That is very much overplayed, mostly he thinks its a foul so he goes down. He needs to get used to the physicality of the league, what is deemed a foul or not, rather than bulking up. Chalk it down to experience, people were spouting that same stuff about Herrera earlier in the season.

7401~~~
Most. I don't have the time or energy to go through your posts.

7402~~~
First point is invalid then. 

Didn't say he was

He actually hasn't. 

Correct.

7403~~~
Ok Sultan. You keep banging the Di Maria drum and let's pick up this conversation this time next season.... If LVG doesn't get shut in the summer.

7404~~~
It takes most players a couple of months he's still doing it now. Herrera is a good example, sorted that now.

7405~~~
To me he's better in midfield and next season Nani would be better in wide areas. His best contributions this season have been with his creative passing.

7406~~~
Only reason Di Maria would be moved would be at his request.

7407~~~
Still is our top assistant this season, no? Hardly setting the world alight but he's done ok today I thought.

7408~~~
Some dodgy back passes, not helped out much by a tiring Shaw and an unwilling Blackett but was still putting creative balls about going forward. Covered well defensively at times too. 

Telling that Falcao's better moments came when he was on the pitch too - partly due to his vision and ability to deliver balls through and over an opposition defence.

7409~~~
That we can agree on because based on his previous attributes he certainly doesn't want to be here.

7410~~~
He was poor today. He struggled to beat players, which is his bread and butter. Things got even worst when Blackett came on. He's been below par this season, comparing him to the player i saw at Real last year, I'm baffled.

7411~~~
People who want him sold are clueless. He plays with his head up and is always trying to create. Doesn't shy away from responsibility, and gets goals/assists. He needs game time, not this 10-15 minute malarky.

If Ashley Young had the goals/assist Di Maria has this season this place would be wanking itself silly saying he's one of the best players in the league.

7412~~~
Shit, when did he tell you this?

7413~~~
What does that even mean? Previous attributes? His attributes have changed? Am I stuck in my demon souls play through?

7414~~~
Previous attributes include passing a man, last time I checked in a United shirt that simply doesn't happen.

7415~~~
Every time he looks up at the man that just took the ball from his feet and he just stands there.

7417~~~
That's just not true.

7418~~~
Yes you're right he just lies there!

7419~~~
Ivanovic closed him down well when he came on, couldn't have much of an impact because every time he got the ball he was relatively deep. Di Maria tries to hard to dribble through players I think, he has the ability to go past them but once they square up to him on the wing and he slows it down, it's very easy to stop him from going past you.

7420~~~
It just seems like his heart isn't with United, isn't it? We still have 6 (?) games left this season. I hope his game is improving, and we can see that he 'clicks' in this new LvG United.

7421~~~
This is how good he can be, let's not forget.

7422~~~
This guy has nothing on Nani. Not even joking.

7423~~~
Form is temporary. I think some players just take a season to find their feet at the club. We've had examples in our recent past of players who had difficult first seasons, before settling into the team. Evra, Pallister and G Nev, off the top of my head, all had the 'baptism of fire' before going on to be fantastic players for us.

He's come from a poncey league full of drama queens and divers (I know he could. be described as one, too). He'll be brilliant next season, I reckon.

7424~~~
Some players are made for the Premier and some aren't. Sadly I think the latter is true for ADM. Along with Falcao he should be off in the summer.

7425~~~
His talent is unquestionable, his suitability to a LVG possession based team isn't. He's the type of player that would have probably been brilliant in a Fergie team, but I'm struggling to see how it's going to work here, unless he substantially changes his game. Really does strike me as right player, wrong time. 

I just can't help wonder why LVG wanted to buy a player that is just so not suited to the football he's getting us to play. He's almost the polar opposite tbh. The only conclusions I can come to are A) LVG hadn't actually seen that much of Di Maria to realise just how 'anti possession<b>*</b>' a player he is or B) It was a club signing pushed onto LVG 

<b>*</b>For want of a better phrase

I really hope they find a way to get it to work, because on his game, he's just a magical player.

7426~~~
Good news if true. What happened to him and his family must of took its toll on his game, he should be given atleast next season to prove himself.

7427~~~
This is partly what makes our league so great. It's a very tough league. There are no respecters of reputation. Di Maria will be a better player for it.

7428~~~
Played so many games last season and then a wold cup in the Amazon jungle. Then he joined a new team who was woefully out of form and manager learning the English game.

He has struggled but also put up decent numbers while playing in a slow side for the majority of the season. He is a counter attacking player playing in a possession side. 
He needs to learn but will get better. He is insanely good.

7429~~~
This concern has been posted many times before, why do people think a player like Di Maria doesn't fit van Gaal's style? Granted, he's not the best as CM because we're possesion based and he can't take risks there. Van Gaal said he didn't have a worldclass winger like him, so I doubt he was even bought for the midfield anyways. He's multifunctional though, which already ticks 1 of van Gaal's boxes.

Van Gaal <i>always</i> uses players with individual brilliance. They're not restricted to keep the ball at all times, they can make things happen. It's obvious Di Maria is that for us, he can try difficult crosses/shots that our CM's aren't allowed to try. He has more freedom in his movement, actions and there have been reports that he's the only player in training who can dribble.

I think that when the team has perfected van Gaal's style (which we're on the way of doing) Di Maria will be a great addition with his freedom. He will be the unpredictable factor in an otherwise rigid team. I still fully trust him to come good, one tough year of settling in won't change that. He's already shown us what he can do.

We won't sell him unless he desperately wants out which, despite what some say here, looks like it's not the case because there's been 0 evidence. We won't sell him for a loss either, why would we? We're not a selling club, we bought him for a record transfer fee and he's got a long contract. Why would the club take a 20m loss? That's never going to happen.

7430~~~
Strange, your post certainly gave me a good laugh.

7431~~~
I think we should keep him for next season to see if he can adapt to the pace and aggression of the Premier League...people do adapt. Interesting comments from Blind who said the Premier league is unique in so many ways. Not sure he can, because he needs too much space and time to create...but it's worth seeing if he can translate his natural talent to the cut and thrust of our game.

7432~~~
I just don't think his style of play is suited to a possession based team in the slightest. 

As a midfielder he's far to high risk with his passing and dribbling, as has been well documented. I doubt we'll see him in midfield again for a long time unless he makes massive changes to his game.
And as a winger he's not particularity good from a standing start. He's not a Hazard/Sanchez/Nani type winger who can regularly beat defenders with an explosion of pace/bit of skill. He's absolutely lethal on the counter, running at pace, twisting and turning past defenders, but with this possession style we don't get many chances for that.

7433~~~

He's clearly staying<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7434~~~
He has already shown this season that this is not true, the only thing with him now is being a bit more careful in posession and decision making (LVG likes a slightly more measured approach as Herrera has already adjusted too)

7435~~~
Bet Valencia is glad he didn't do that.

7436~~~
Not convinced until he tattoos a United crest on it

7437~~~
That 22 in Roman numerals seems likely to reference his number at Madrid. I wouldn't read much into it either way.

7438~~~
Can't wait to see him firing on all cylinders next season. Going to be very very exciting.

7439~~~
Great news! I mean, are there any other clubs in the world that have the number 7 shirt?

7440~~~
He also wears 7 with Argentina!

7441~~~
Shouldn't this be in the "Di Maria's new tattoo" thread? oh god i sound like a mod <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7442~~~
Lets hope so. I mean the number of assists he has made is quite remarkable for someone who hasn't been playing well this season.

 I had said earlier in this thread that his crossing has not been great but I must say that the attackers in the box don't really make enough effort to get a head on it themselves. You can't just stay in a stationary position where you make it easier for the defender to mark you.Tussle with defender, try to get a jump on them at the right moment. If           Di Maria is crossing in training, then the attackers should be adapting their movement to his various deliveries, so when matchday arrives, you know the kind of areas where it may typically come. The season Rooney was scoring headers galore from Valencia's crosses could not have been done without some kind of practise.

7443~~~
have to say looked like he gave a shit against chelsea

7444~~~
I think he actually likes the club

7445~~~
A couple of weeks ago I said hope was lost for this season and it seems I was right. It's a shame a player of his caliber only plays about 10-15 minutes a game. He should see more.

7446~~~
I wonder if he will start again this season?

7447~~~
That's a pair of angel wings around the '7' though. United are the red 'Devils.'

Angels hate devils and they fight.

Ipso facto Di Maria hates United.

<span style="color: #ffffff">either that or it's a reference to his name..........................</span>

7448~~~
Didn't you also say he should play ahead of young before the city game?

7449~~~
Hope he'll get another season to prove himself. It only makes sense. He came from a different league, different country/culture/language, and moreover had to get used to a new coach/system which even the seasoned Premier League players struggled to get their head around until recently.

He's a fantastic, world class talent, and i remember it wasn't so long ago when many of us were still pinching ourselves when we saw him don the United shirt for the first time. These players don't come around very often, and am just hoping he can establish himself as one of Van Gaal's trusted players by the time the next season starts.

7450~~~
But devils are fallen angels, and Ángel sure does fall a lot...

<span style="color: #ffffff"><i>♪♫...And if the Devil is six, then God is seven...♫♪</i></span>

7451~~~
I don't think so. If I remember correctly I said di Maria may be the better individual player, but that the team should stay as it is as long as it's working well together.

7452~~~
My mistake, apologies! Must have confused you with someone else.

7453~~~
Sexy tattoo I must say.

7454~~~
I hope so too but his "tfft" get-out clause is that's also his international number I suppose.

7455~~~
Will only believe he's staying until he gets a Louis Van Gaal tattoo on his arse and the words "Philosophy" across his chest.

7456~~~
why i think adm is not playing cos ddg not signing a new contract?   maybe i'm thinking too much...

7457~~~
Is it just me or does it seem like ADM attempts at least one 40 yard shot per match?  What is he hoping to accomplish?

7458~~~
Okay, we bench our most creative player constantly while we create nothing..

7459~~~
More than the other pussies who just pass back, you could get a rebound from it or God knows, we dont play optimistic one bit.

7460~~~
I definitely don't think it's that.

7461~~~
Sloppiness in possession costs us

7462~~~
you know what?  maybe tis his agent told him to do that to make him valuable

7463~~~
As much as Young has had a good spell he really is average and flatters.

7464~~~
Yes, you're right. Young simply doesn't create enough to warrant a starting place.

But hey, we dominated possession for the second game in a row, we were the better team...

7465~~~
Should be offloaded at whatever we can get for him in the summer.

7466~~~
It is not just you. Players who do this are not intelligent really, they will never succeed under LVG. Real saw this and they took us to the cleaners.

7467~~~
Along with the rest of the team.

7468~~~
If we aren't going to play him or bring him on at the obvious time then we may as well shift him whilst he still holds some value.

7469~~~
60M.  Let that sink in.  I'm sure almost everyone would agree with the fact that we overpaid for him, but it looks like we overpaid at least what, some 20-25M?

7470~~~
Should get whatever we can get for him and buy Bale. di Maria has been rubbish for the last few months. Very disappointing along with Falcao.

7471~~~
Almost as soon as he came on he put in two or three of the most dangerous balls of the game.

7472~~~
Yup. It's so clear that at his best he's yonks better than anyone else. He needs to start a game.

7473~~~
Apparently hasn't scored a goal in 6 months. Not a nice thing to hear <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7474~~~
Young will probably retain possession more, but Di Maria will get assists. He should be starting. 

Not to mention he's not going to get any kind of rhythm by being brought on so late all the damn time.

7475~~~
Well, there's Christmas... wait, they play more games then... Nope, I'm all out of excuses. His assist tally is good though.

7476~~~
Dangerous for us or them? There is nothing more detrimental to us than this cross field unnecessary passes he attempts when we are not set up to defend his needless loss of possession.

7477~~~
More like 40?

7478~~~
Needs to start in that kind of game, too much sideways passing and no running beyond the man. He's great at the ball in behind too.

7479~~~
Not a mind reader, but i feel like he wants to score a goal.

7480~~~
Anothe flop together with falcao

7481~~~
The only opportunity we created after he came on was his fantastic ball over the defence for Falcao. He creates and he has pace. When we have Mata, Fellaini, Rooney and Young as front four, it's far too ponderous and slow to ever work for an extended period of time.

7482~~~
He was poor when he came on, in keeping with the rest of them.

That said, I think it might be time to put him back in next week.

7483~~~
He has been shocking and for me easily the worst transfer of the season


But I refuse to write him off just yet, you would have to allow two seasons before calling him a flop.

7484~~~
Bit surprised by the reactions. Di Maria's style of play has always been predicated on his propensity for risk taking, sometimes the gamble pays off sometimes it doesn't. That's part of his footballing makeup and I'm sure the club knew that when we bought him. That innate unpredictability (eg. the pass to Mata vs Liverpool that very few are able to execute) is what makes him such a dangerous proposition. 

He's one of those players who is capable of turning a match on its head with one moment of brilliance. One of the biggest problems he's having right now though is his lack of chemistry and familiarity with some of the other players, it happened even at Madrid in his first season. But with time, the other players will learn his tendencies and once they get on the same wavelength we'll see the best of Di Maria. He just needs to get into his groove.

7485~~~
I wanted him to come on earlier. But whenever he plays, he seems a bit of a nothing player of late. Few decent ball among a lot of sloppiness.

7486~~~
Everything he does is either brilliant or woeful. There's no in-between with him.

7487~~~
He's been a bit of a disastrous signing. 

Looked completely bereft of confidence again today.

We could have done a lot of other things with £60m.

7488~~~
Sound like a someone I used to know. Name began with an N.....

7489~~~
Doesn't dribble enough anymore imo. As soon as he gets the ball he looks for the pass. Can't help but feel he's discouraged to do it.

7490~~~
Honestly I knew he was inconstant at Real, but Jesus he is just as bad as Nani. Nani however can at least beat a guy a few times a game.

7491~~~
Why didn't we just replace put him on for Fellaini? And play him in his best position.

7492~~~
He doesnt suit our style. Sell him as long as we get moeny for him. If he cant take risks and dribbler, whats the point in having him to cross it all the time and shoot from 30 yards.

7493~~~
He is, we know he is, Herrera (I think) said as much in an interview.

7494~~~
He doesn't want to be here, that much is clear. Van Gaal doesn't seem impressed with him either. Suppose it will come down to how much Woodward wants to keep hold of him this summer.

7495~~~
It's crazy we paid so much money for him, serious consideration needs to be given as to whether or not we should keep him, he is a 25-30m player, never going to live up to the ridiculous price tag and he is always going to be erratic because that is how he plays.

He is never to be a world class winger and score 15 plus goals a season, if he plays in midfield he is better but he is going to be hit and miss, he was a panic buy but we need to make a decision about whether or not we stick and accept he will be hit and miss or move him on.

7496~~~
Agree, especially when we already had Nani and Januzaj to perform the greedy, talented but erratic creative role. 

Right now it looks like he would rather be elsewhere.

7497~~~
Despite all this he still played probably the only pass in behind the Everton centre halves that was slightly too high for Falcao. That was more imaginative than certain players had shown in 90 minutes.

7498~~~
Not worth holding onto at this rate.  Swap him for Bale +30 million and i'd be happy.

7499~~~
I'm genuinely curious, where has he gotten the idea that he's good at long range shooting? Other than the first few weeks, where misplaced shots turned into assists, he just seems to really want to damage the defender's legs.

7500~~~
Agreed. He has one moment of quality every game no matter how poorly he plays otherwise. Still think he has a future here. He does things none of our other players can do.

7501~~~
why is he trusted to be better from the wing, his best season came from midfield and we keep thinking that he should play on flanks, feck with balance put him in midfield, his best games came from there. This is being positive. 

He's absolute shit signing..

if only the fee wasn't as big as his ears..

7502~~~
Is the next letter a vowel, and also the first in the alphabet?

7503~~~
People call Falcao but I'm sorry, he's been absolutely shocking. Offered nothing and Young is keeping him out. At least we can give Falcao back and it only cost us his wages....

7504~~~
Problem is that his pace isn't really useful against teams that sit deep and are organised defensively.

I think with hindsight it is one of those where he looks a better player in La Liga, where most teams go out and attack and try to play good football. In England, against teams who are happy to park the bus, play deep and are defensively organised, Di Maria doesn't look like he has the tools to create anything.

I think he has to play a deeper role in central midfield instead of Herrera or Fellaini, where he can maybe be the "extra man" bursting in to attacking positions and utilising his pace. He isn't a creator however.

7505~~~
I still expect him to come good. It's odd for a player to start so well at a new club, but to then to drop off as quickly as he has.

Next season...

7506~~~
Pretty much. All good and well holding on to the ball when the final ball is completely lacking. He was the only one providing that.

7507~~~
You're on the right track, you may spin the wheel.

7508~~~
His long range efforts have been pants but it's less infuriating than playing 132 consecutive sideways passes. He might not be the kind of player that's perfect for LVG's dream football but you'd have to question why he's only realising it now.

7509~~~
I was going to post just this. Weirdly he has far too many dreadful long shots, when he should be driving at the opposition with the ball.

7510~~~
I think it stems from frustration. He's not getting played enough so when he does come on he's trying to do everything himself.

7511~~~
Exactly like Nani. Talented but inconsistant and frustrating.

7512~~~
An irritating cameo. That said, he still created a good chance for Falcao. He's good for creating at least one or two genuine opportunities in a match, but then I always liked that about Nani. Some people didn't appreciate it as much.

I'd give him a start next weekend.

7513~~~
Offered very little injection of urgency into our play, I don't know if he's been told not to dribble or is simply too scared to but without that aspect in his play he doesn't pose much of a threat.

7514~~~
Give him a start against WBA, putting him on against parked buses isn't going to help him.

7515~~~
Needs to get back in the starting 11.. Young just doesn't do enough going forward. He wasn't great but still made a great chance with a nice ball that nobody else would have picked out, and he's not going to get confidence back off the bench.

7516~~~
I thought he had three terrible crosses, and 3 good ones including one awesome passs to Falcao. Don't understand the blanket criticism, it's not as though any other attackers were pulling up trees either.

7517~~~
He comes on when we're 2-0 down, plays to the level of the team and gets called shit...

7518~~~
That would have been the move I made as well.

7519~~~
His confidence is shot. A confident Di Maria wouldnt hesitate to take his man on.

7520~~~
When we bought him, I thought he was worth £35m - £40m. On his performances for us so far, that was optimistic.

7521~~~
Oh please sell him ! I wish we did the same to Mata and Fellaini after their first seasons, because look at how they turned out now....

7522~~~
What I don't get is why he never attempted to dribble at Baines 1v1? He has great dribbling and is quick, but he never once looked to take him on. So annoying that he just resorted to 60 yard crosses to absolutely nowhere, we are never going to score like that.

7523~~~
The one player I wish he had a girlfriend in Spain.

7524~~~
Agreed... I too think there's every reason he'll come good next year. At the very least he showed his worth when he first arrived here.

7525~~~
Needs to start ahead of Young. He needs more minutes.

7526~~~
Said it earlier in the thread. His confidence is shot.

7527~~~
60m pounds benchwarmer…

7528~~~
The biggest thing for me is that since he's been dropped he's done absolutely feck all in his sub appearances to suggest he's intent on getting his place back. I don't think he has the right mentality for us or for the league, he's so weary of 50/50 challenges and just doesn't seem particularly arsed. He seems to be just biding his time at this point, I'm not sure he will be here for too long.

7529~~~
We need to play him into form. Even out of form he creates a lot more chances than in form Young. He's not as good defensively, but then when Carrick and Jones/Rojo are back we should be better in the middle.

7530~~~
Awful again when he come on, unfortunately. 


Fifa accomplishments.

7531~~~
Coming off the bench for 20 minutes isn't the way to get the best out of Di Maria.

7532~~~
If he's unwilling to take on men who have been playing for 70 mins then what evidence is there to suggest starting him will make anything better?

7533~~~
Not just our style, but doesn't suit the Premiership. He doesn't have the same amount of time on the ball as in other leagues. Same with Falcao.

7534~~~
He's just rock bottom on confidence and trying to do stupid shit when he comes off the bench to win back a starting place.

He needs to start a few in a row.

7535~~~
He had an exceptional season last year and is back to what he was previously "average".

7536~~~
An argument has been made that if he cant beat players who have been on the pitch for 70 mins, how on earth is he going to do it starting?

7537~~~
Too bad it cost us 60m

7538~~~
I was worried this might happen. I never rated the guy too highly, and I remember talking to my brother who was laughing at me for not rating Di Maria after last season. I admitted that I might have been wrong and the way he started, I thought that I just read him all wrong.

Still got moments of quality in him. Hopefully he can show his class next season.

7539~~~
Disagree completely. Young has been very productive lately, let's not forget the City game, and he's much better at using his left-back than ADM who wants to do it all alone.

7540~~~
I feel the same way, his performances indicate he is not too bothered and biding his time.
If he really wants psg then we should we looking at moura, Veratti or silva.

7541~~~
One thing that struck me about Di Maria during his awful game vs Switzerland in the World Cup was his appetite for the ball and to take chances and try to create, but now he's playing just as wastefully but with no intent or energy. His body language is just off for me and I'm not sure a goal will fix it, I don't think he's comfortable here at all and that will be the biggest hurdle to extracting 100% out of him.

7542~~~
Not starting games and getting cameos will not bring out the best in him. Quite clear to see. Young has had one good game in 4, yet still starts and our team just lacks creativity. Too happy to pass the ball around for the sake of passing, with no penetration. Di Maria needs to start games and stick to one position. If not, what's the point? Nani divided the fans, now it's the same with ADM.

7543~~~
Because he's playing in a completely different team and system. 

Sometimes you can't win with some on this place, if he takes a player on, he gets lambasted for losing the ball; if he doesn't and resorts to playing safe or going for a cross, he's gets lambasted.

It's clearly obvious that van Gaal has instructed him to not take opposition players on, as much, and look for the simple pass sideways.

Moreover, he came on when we were 2-0 down and playing like sh*t, what could he possible do on his own, when the entire team seem to have given up? He's not going to perform miracles. We should be questioning the starters and their lack of effort as opposed to di Maria who's played 90 minutes across the last 5 or 6 games.

7544~~~
He's a winger, he should take players on and lose the ball, but when he loses the ball he has to show an appetite to chase it and win it back, or try at least. No one is going to clap for you for trying to dribble, then lose the ball and stand there. It's in games like this that you expect a player of his caliber to come on and give it a real go, but we did not see that with him. A waste right now.

7545~~~
Every match when he comes on he insists on on having a long range shot which either drags wide or lacks power. I actually cant remember him having a strong awesome shot / goal that makes me think its worth spoiling an attack for him to do so.

I dont mind if he takes on people in the opposition half and loses it, but so often when he does, he goes down clutching his leg hoping for a freekick rather than chasing back to win it back (when its clearly not a foul and clearly he hasnt been hurt). Its frustrating see that happen.

He hasnt shown he deserves to start.

7546~~~
I actually zoned out of the game after Everton's third, but this seems like rehashed nonsense.

We seemed to be disinterested after he came on. I felt as if he tried and then the entire team gave up. I do remember him chasing down a ball 60 yards away, from a pass from Herrera (I think), and closing down Howard, is that not the effort you speak of? In games where we've been holding a large proportion of the possession, what chasing back do you expect?

7547~~~
He cost £60m, to play like Giggs did towards the tail end of his career is not good enough. He deserves the criticism, he got stupidly sent off vs Arsenal and is showing a distinct lack of fight to get his place back in the first team.

7548~~~
Hopefully he gets a run of starting games ahead of Ashley Young

7549~~~
I don't think it's about beating player's. I think it's about not playing his natural game because he thinks if he doesn't score a 40 yard screamer or beat 3 player's he'll be back on the bench next week. Some player's need a run of games to regain their confidence and form. If you spend £60m on someone you have to play them into form, Wenger for instance did it with Ozil and he's currently one of the most in form player's in the League.

7550~~~
He played 20 minutes against Liverpool - bagged an important assist which now looks to be incredibly important, gave the ball away and much more.
He played 25 minutes against Villa - bagged another assist which also seems to be very important, right now.
He played 15 minutes against City - did nothing as we were down to 10 men
He played 25-30 minutes against Chelsea - not much to say, we were pretty bland all game.
He played 25 minutes today - He played a ball through Everton's defense, something we couldn't achieve, all game, and had a 40 yard shot, in our worst performance of the season.

What do you expect from these small cameos every game? In Hindsight, his two assists look to be very important, given where we our, right now.

7551~~~
We had a system that seemed to be working, so accommodating Di Maria wasn't a priority.

Aye, it's currently very difficult for most of our attacking players to shine, and just when it seemed like we struck a winning formula, injuries have disrupted our momentum again.

It also helps if you played for a strong Madrid side, with a world class midfield behind you. But yeah, it's almost laughable signing a player for 60m, and either: not building the team around his strengths or playing him in his most effective position (in a diamond), like last season.

But yeah, let's hope he comes good next season. His start certainly showed promise.

7553~~~
I think he's found out how dam hard it is in the Premier League, how aggressive it is and how fast paced it is. Some ex player, can't remember who, whose played here and abroad, said there is nothing like the Premiership, you just don't get the time or space on the ball as you do in Europe. Some creative players adapt and discover how to play in this league..others don't. I reckon he needs a full pre-season training and another go. However, if he doesn't 'get it' by the end of next season...bye bye Di Maria

7554~~~
Let's be honest here, the finishes flattered those two assists (nice backspin to the Mata ball though). He also flubbed an easy chance to dead the Liverpool game and generally was useless. He's making an absolute shit-ton of stupid decisions recently, he made one cracking pass today to Falcao in between loads of aimless crosses. It's clear his confidence is down but he has shown nothing in 5-6 cameos now, he's far too inconsistent and looking seriously overpriced. His finishing and ability to create chances on a consistent basis is not of the level of his price tag, nor is his tendency to pull out of 50/50 challenges.  He loves taking on these 40 yards shots but I don't think he's nailed one once. I agree with his confidence clearly affecting his play at the moment but I don't think we can afford to let him play through it right now.

7555~~~
Our system seems to have been found out, park the bus and we'll lose.

7556~~~
You can continue to molly cuddle him, that's exactly what he needs. He's a world class player, and in days like this, his quality is supposed to drive the team. he's supposed to be taking on his man, but what does he do, just gets the ball, stands there and put in aimless  cross after cross. That's not the standard I expect from a world class winger, thanks.

7557~~~
Perhaps, it didnt seem logical at the time to start Di Maria.

7558~~~
For 60 odd minutes, we created feck all, I can't even remember a single clear cut opportunity, so I'd rather see someone attempt to create something rather than passing sideways, as we did all game. He also put in a couple of dangerous crosses to the back post.

As with the 40 yard shots, some of these led to assists earlier on in the season, so it's worth the punt. 

I'm not sure how you can judge di Maria based on these cameos, as, in his last start, he was one of the best players on the pitch till his sending off. Today, he came on when were 2-0 down and was instructed to create, he tried and failed. With regards to his stupid decisions, well that's just a ridiculous statement, as it seems like the entire team made some very stupid decisions, given we lost 3-0.

7559~~~
I can't fully agree, but whats happened has happened. I haven't been entirely impressed with Young, apart from the City game, and would much rather have di Maria starting from now.

7560~~~
It depends on which Di Maria we are getting, the one against QPR earlier in the season or the one that gives the ball away 95% of the time then produces only one moment of magic, i really want him to play... but, we cant afford to sacrifice our next 4 matches to help Di Maria find his golden boots again, he might average an assist a game - but what good would that do in a game where we concede 3 goals?

He should start against West Brom though.

7561~~~
He has found himself out of the team for exactly this. He's obviously cut down on his dribbling as he want's to play sideways, more often; that's one of the reasons Young and Mata have started over him as they don't take as many risks as him. 

As with the last part, we were 1-0 up against Pool, 1-0 up against Villa and he provided the assists for the winning goals, after coming on. He came on when we were 4-1 up against City, 1-0 down to Chelsea and 2-0 down to Everton. What did you expect him to do? No one else could break through Chelsea and Everton, but hey di Maria should because we spent £60m, right? Who cares if he hasn't started since the beginning of April, he should be able to tear through the league leaders and against the team who dominated us with 35% of the ball.

7562~~~
What a load of rubbish. You earn your place in the team, we've pissed around trying to shoehorn supposed world class players into the team and it's cost us this year. You get dropped, you get cameos to prove the manager wrong, you prove the manager wrong and you get your spot back. For a £60m player that should be easy. Stop making excuses for him. His poor individual standard of play is not completely reliant on the rest of the team.

7563~~~
What have the players, from the Chelsea and Everton game, done to warrant starts for the next game? We can't drop them all, but there are players, on the bench, who could offer more than them and we're not going to find out by leaving them on the bench. When did we concede three goals with di Maria on the pitch, where he was responsible for the goals? 

I agree with the last part, it's about time we let him start as Young and Mata, haven't been good enough, lately.

7564~~~
Players like?

7565~~~
One man doesn't make a team. He can only be as good as the rest of the team. 

Like I said, what did you expect him to achieve when he came on, today? Or against Chelsea? I expected feck all. We were outplayed by both.

Which players have proved themselves over the last two games?

7566~~~
Januzaj, di Maria and van Persie for Mata, Young and Rooney would be the changes I'd make.

7567~~~
What a load of absolute tosh. You need to start watching football my friend, he was taken out of the team because he stupidly got himself sent off and in that time, Young came in and did very well, Young has been taken on his man very often except in the last 2 games, where his limitations showed. And no, Di Maria should not win the game single handedly, but like Hazard and Sanchez and all top attackers, he should be doing more than just crossing the ball aimlessly. The fact he hasn't started games should make him more determined to make things happen, that's how big players respond to adversity, he's world class, better than Young SO he has to start showing it.

7568~~~
Januzaj has been useless all season.
Di Maria averages a magic moment a game.
RVP has been out for a while and has struggled a lot this season.

Mata has been superb this season, aren't players meant to have bad games?
Young has been our best utility player this season, he usually doesn't perform in games where the team is crap.
Rooney brings more to the table than any other attacking player.

7569~~~
I don't know what's worse, top players playing like amateurs or fans that go out of their way to make excuses for them.

7570~~~
He should have come on for Fellaini instead of Falcao. Fellaini was playing high and contributing little defensively anyway.

7571~~~
Smalling and Shaw have played well, as well as Herrera at times. None of these players cost £60m. The logic that one player should be absolved from criticism in light of a poor team display is silly. He came on against a team that had sitting back for 70 mins and played like he hadn't watched any of these prior 70 mins showing no willingness to draw a man to press and create space for his teammates and whipping crosses into the back post for Young even though the tactic is completely pointless with Fellaini off the pitch.

7572~~~
He's still by far the most creative player in the team.

7573~~~
You need to read what I posted. I know he was taken out of the team for his sending off, however, he's been unable to get back as he doesn't fit in with the "philosophy" i.e. he takes more risks than he should. Young came in and did decent, he's put in plenty of aimless balls hence why he's bagged as many assists as di Maria has. As with the comparisons to Hazard and Sanchez, they both started in teams better than us and have actually played without interruptions.

7574~~~
Yes, but he doesn't offer this creativity in 80% of his plays.....probably even more.

7575~~~
Criticising a player based on these cameos is utterly pointless, especially if were losing and playing like crap.

Trying to make space against a team camping in their own half is quite hard, as we've illustrated on countless occasions, all season.

7576~~~
I like this, it's everything and everyone else fault that Di Maria isn't playing well now. I tell you what, like Finidi, Overmars, Ribery and Robben, Di Maria fits into this style, I can't remember any of those wingers playing it safe. He's a world class player who is hiding, he's not showing it.

7577~~~
Agreed and I wouldn't have played him vs Liverpool, City or Chelsea. However for the next 4 games (and today imo) it makes sense for him to play his way out of this poor patch. The last thing we need is him going off on his Summer break rock bottom confidence wise and unsure of how he fits in to the team/system.

7578~~~
Completely low on confidence, a problem we have had with every damn winger since Ronaldo left... We have to do something to get him back into form

7579~~~
That'll return when he gets consistent football, in games like today and Everton flair players like that are crucial, he's been playing poorly but he's still creating far more than anyone else.

7580~~~
You might be right, but i think our top 4 ambitions are more important than Di Maria finding his feet (right now), if he's average in the next 4 matches and we get killed we might end up 5th.....longshot? perhaps, i think the smart to do would be to start him against West Brom and gauge him from there - might be harsh but if he doesn't deliver in his next 2 games then he shouldn't start for the remainder of the season.

7581~~~
I'm not insinuating that. He rightfully spent time on the bench and had to learn how to be more conservative and play to the style. He seems to be demonstrating that, in recent cameos and, given the lack of creativity we're still witnessing, it's about time we changed things.

7582~~~
we cant afford to waste the remaining 4 games to help Di Maria find his feet just in time for Copa America - if he starts then he'll always have the ball on his feet as our go-to-guy, and if he doesn't deliver then we'll find ourselves in a terrible situation without a legitimate impact sub.

Hope he starts against West Brom though.

7583~~~
Januzaj has hardly played all season.
di Maria has been somewhat inconsistent, however, this has been over stated since his sending off. He was one our better performers for most of the games up until the sending off.
RvP has struggled, but so have the rest of our forwards.

Mata hasn't been brilliant, he's been inconsistent, too.
Young is a better LWB than he is LW, where he creates very little.
Rooney has been below par for the last few games.

7584~~~
Its a tough one to balance I'll grant you. Hopefully by next season the pressure for him to deliver will be off slightly and he can recapture some of that form we saw at the beginning of this season.

7585~~~
It's verging on sad watching him now. Where is that guy who ran rings around Atleti in last seasons CL final?

7586~~~
Januzaj has hardly played because he has done feck all with his time on the pitch, he shouldn't even be on this list
Di Maria was average before the sending off and even worse afterwards, his stats and his title as the "most creative player on the team" have blinded a lot of people.
RVP offers more to the team than Falcao but not more than Rooney which is why he currently #2 in the pecking order.

Mata has been brilliant, inconsistent ? yes, but he still has more MOTM performances than you know who.
Young has had more defensive duties than any other attacking player in the team, you cant expect him to create chances and still expect him to perform well defensively, people are judging Young as an attacker and overlooking his role as a defensive player this season.
Rooney has been below par, but he still offers more, unless RVP becomes RVP again.

7587~~~
I actually fear for him next season, expectations will more than double with CL football returning and the "New league,New team,debut season" excuse being thrown out the window, he might be playing for his United career next season, hopefully we sign other players to take the pressure of him though.

7588~~~
We can keep going around in circles, however, we won't agree. Although, that's the point in forums, so I guess we could...

The question is are our players integral to the system or is the system integral to our players? That's what I'm curious to find out, if it's the former, which I don't think it is, then we should continue as we have. If it's the latter, then we should give the likes of di Maria, Januzaj and RvP a chance to shine, as starters, whilst we're playing well. The players I named haven't had the chance to start during the period in which we clicked and starting playing more like a team, and given that the likes of Young, Mata etc. seem to be out of gas, which has seen us lose to Chelsea and get embarrassed by Everton, it's the right time to change things.

7589~~~
Change is good, but change for change's sake doesn't always mean progress, Januzaj has done nothing to deserve a place in the team... you mentioned his lack of playing time which i understand but with 7 starts in 17 appearances he has failed to do anything useful on the pitch - i really cant see us benching anyone for Januzaj.

RVP and Di Maria have earned (not by their recent performances, but reputation and the state of the current team) their opportunity to start, i'll give you that, but if they can only manage to produce average performances against West Brom then we'd be better off sticking with the system that saw off Spurs,Pool and City, Di Maria should be prioritised over RVP in my opinion as he is the WC player and the best player on the team.

Mata doesn't seem to know how to consistently maintain his form, which is part of the reason why he was sold in the first place, i think Di Maria should replace him against West Brom.

7590~~~
It's not really changing for the sake as Young, Mata and Rooney (longer than the previous two) have "stepped of the gas", in recent games. We have other capable players on the bench who can utilised to see if they can perform better, as there's no reason why they can't. 

I think you're being hyper critical of Januzaj, he's barely had a run of games to be able to perform well and our current eleven have shown what consistency and confidence can do. If van Gaal shows faith in di Maria and Januzaj, it could do a world of good for both; and given that we play WBA at home, there's no better opportunity to make a few changes.

7591~~~
Couldn't we just drop Fellaini to the bench and play Di Maria next to Herrera with Mata on the pitch at the same time, preferably with Carrick in behind, and Blind at LB, yes Fellaini has his uses but surely this is worth try.

Plus Di Maria is clearly not an impact sub, Fellaini might be.

7592~~~
In what world does replacing Mata with Januzaj make sense? I like Januzaj and still believe he has a bright future, but he's offered next to nothing this season. I think it would make more sense to send him out on loan next season.

7593~~~
Of course he hasn't, he hasn't been able to string a couple of games together. And Mata has been off the boil in his last two games and may need a rest, Young too.

7594~~~
Looks like he is sulking. Mentally very fragile. Decision making today was god awful

7595~~~
Jesus Christ what was that today? Is he trying to play as badly as possible in order to get sold?

7596~~~
I agree Mata may need a rest, but if that's the case, I'd like to see Di Maria in for him, not Januzaj, who, even when has gotten a run of games this season, has been close to useless.

7597~~~
We need to build the team around him next year and play him in the CM position he excelled in last year, i mean if that wasn't the plan all along you really have to question why we bought him.

No he won't be scoring 20 or even 10 goals a season, but he is so unpredictable with his dribbling, passing, and creativity.

The pass he made for Falcao today was a glimpse of what he has done alot of times for Madrid. Wouldn't like to see us buying a player for 60m and then just flock him with a huge loss, that would make the whole club look stupid.

7598~~~
We've just messed him around lately. Hes got zero confidence at the moment.

Di Maria is so much more talented than half the players in our side.

7599~~~
Don't even know what people are arguing here. That it was the wrong decision to keep DiMaria on the bench after the red card ban? Even after watching our recent run? With Ashley Young one of our best players? Baffling.

7600~~~
Certainly needs to start next game, Mata and Young have hardly been sparkling in the last two games.

7601~~~
He's talented no doubt, but I'm not sure how anyone can claim that he's been messed around with, particularly when our best run of form coincided with his being out of the team (for which he had no one to blame but himself.)

7602~~~
I think it's worth starting him again, just for the jolt to the system that it would provide more than anything else. That being said, it's completely up to him to raise his level of play (and by that, I mean more than just one or two telling passes in a game.)

7603~~~
Yup. Agree with all of that.

7604~~~
In hindsight, it was just a stupid vanity signing. And a colusal waste of money on a player that isn't right for the style of play LVG is trying to implement. 

That doesn't excuse some of his performances though.

7605~~~
I keep getting that feeling too. 

But then again, he was electric in the early days, i hope its just a confidence thing.

7606~~~
Yeah, indeed. Messed around my foot.

7607~~~
Wouldn't surprise me if he went to PSG this summer. He's been burgled, injured, sent off, and now he's on the bench. He isn't a great fit for Van Gaal's style of play and, more to the point, the guy does not look like a happy camper. If we sign Depay, and maybe Bale, Di Maria will be gone.

7608~~~
I'd be disappointed, as I'd hope that he had a bit more about him to deal with adversity. That being said, if he clearly isn't a good fit, then it might be best for all parties to move him along. Personally, I think he should be given another season.

7609~~~
I hope he starts instead of Young and plays a role / position he can bring the best out

7610~~~
He will be much better next season.

7611~~~
No, that would be Falcao. Di Maria on form last year was arguably in the top 6-7 players in the world, let alone his position. These are the types of players that we should be seeking to get if we want to compete with the giants like Barca, Real and Bayern. No matter what LVG tries with his system, he will never ever get to those levels with average players adhering to a rigid system. This "possession game" needs tweaking because its been found out and we have to integrate Di Maria into the team no matter what (unless he literally doesn't want to be here).

7612~~~
AdM will come good. Not everyone can hit the ground running in the PL. 

Y'day, he should have come on for Young a lot sooner, or even start the game.

7613~~~
I know its not up to me but I'm really torn between giving him another chance or selling him. It's harsh to judge a player on one season but also if he fails again in the second season then his value will decrease a lot more.

7614~~~
I feel like I keep saying this, But what makes you say he doesn't look happy? or even that PSG would still want him this Summer for that matter?

Since he has been on the bench he jumps up and celebrates every goal, plus he just had the number 7 tattooed on his arm last week. He is fine. I think if people and the press keep making an issue saying he is unhappy that it would send him that way regardless no matter how happy he currently is.

7615~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Seriously?

7616~~~
I understand LvG wants us to dominate possession, and not play risky passes.

However, di Maria is our most creative player and needs to start. Him not playing is mind boggling. People will go on about cameos off the bench, but you need to play him from the start.

7617~~~
Im going to say the same thing that I said in the Falcao thread - if instead of Di Maria it was Nani putting in these performances, would peoples opinion be the same?
As with Falcao, I think Di Maria's reputation has bought him a lot of slack from the fans. If it was Nani, Young or the likes then there would be far more anger and criticism I reckon.

7618~~~
With Di Maria you get posts like - he makes things happen. Although he more often makes things happen like loosing a ball, misplacing a pass or shooting from some wierd angles or for the sake of it. 
I think he should start next game maybe, Young has been ineffective but ADM has been totally out of form for a while despite the fact he hasnt started in a while now.

7619~~~
If we sign Memphis or a like-minded winger, does anyone think this could mean di Maria going back into a midfield three?

di Maria was absolute class for the first month or two, but then the formation got played with, he lost his position and struggled since.

7620~~~
Yeah, my point was that when Nani was putting in similar performances - poor decision making, giving the ball away but looking like he might create something (and frankly that is generous to Di Maria) - he was lambasted for it.

7621~~~
That's true. As you said its a metter of rep, last year he was briliant so people arent on his back like they should be cause other than 3 first games he has been very poor. As for Nani he was at faulf by deafult every time, he was even booed at OT ffs..

7622~~~
I really hope so. He'd have the pace of Shaw and Depay on the left side of him, the three of them running down that side of the pitch is too much for majority of sides.

7623~~~
Even the media haven't criticised him as much as they did Ozil, the only place he seems to be getting the most stick is his thread and every single poster that criticises Di Maria may or may not have an agenda.

His golden season at Madrid,expectations from the fans and his personal troubles have granted him a pass this season (the New league,new country excuse is crap imo, he is a grown man), I expect him to do exceptionally well next season.

7624~~~
I agree with you though, Nani never got the respect he deserved as the 22nd best player in the world.

7625~~~
I was certainly in the "He will be one of our most important players" camp when he signed. I thought we overpaid admittedly, but that we were getting a world class player undoubtedly.

I think this has been a good season to really get a measure of his character and attitude (although I am still not sure). It is one of those sink or swim situations, to see if he can cope with some of the stressful situations he has been in. That said, I dont think we will see the answer to those questions until next season. Fellaini and Young have shown a fighting attitude to earn their way back into the team, Di Maria must now do the same.

7626~~~
That's just ridiculous. Since when does being a "grown man" mean footballers instantly adapt to a new league/team? Surely you don't need examples of the many other "grown men" who only looked settled in their second and subsequent PL seasons?

7627~~~
I agree, but i also think the task ahead is greater than the one Fellaini and Young had this season, we didnt expect Young and Fellaini to play like world class players when we signed them, they just had to be really good and they have shown that this season, Di Maria on the other hand was signed as a World Class player and if he fails to showcase his world class talent next season then he should be the first one out the door.

7628~~~
He is 27 years old, at that age you should expect him to be able to perform in any country imo. How many players actually flopped because they had to play in a new league? and not some other reason?

I might need those examples

7629~~~
Hes already shown he can perform in this country (all beit not consistently), his settling seems to be more with the team than the league itself (formation and positional changes, as well as being asked to adapt his game by the manager).

7630~~~
*flicks "new league" excuse out the window*

7631~~~
I don't think settling into the league has even been a problem for him, as he demonstrated earlier on in the season. The physicality or pace never seemed to be an issue for him. However, his biggest problem generates from the burglary incident, in my opinion. The period following the incident saw him struggle quite a bit, understandably as his mind never seemed to be focused on the game. 

He's also been asked to play in far too many positions - RW, LW, AM, SS, CM. Haven't people realised what good consistency can do for both players and the team? Look no further than Rooney, Herrera, Young, Mata and Fellaini, if you want examples.

7632~~~
Lol CH, i like how you always try to promote your "consistency theory" in every comment - you even do it better than the politicians, whilst i agree with you on the whole consistency thing, i should also note that we aren't exactly in a position to experiment right now with 4 games to save our season.

Yes, Di Maria and RVP have to start against West Brom.

7633~~~
So infuriating seeing him trying to have a pop at goal from a ridiculous range. Sure, he has it in his locker - but how many times has he done it for us to no avail? He broke away yesterday, plenty of space to attack just outside the box - could have brought it closer to goal or make a killer pass - but instead goes for a stupid shot that was blocked by a player who wasn't even in the box. 

I understand that he may not be playing in his best position - but he's playing like an absolute lemon. His decision making is atrocious at the moment. T'was a lovely pass to Falcao though, the only good thing he did.

7634~~~
Di Maria has always been a player who blew hot and cold. Not only on game to game basis but within the same game. One minute he will pull a magical dribble followed by a great pinpoint cross, the next he'll do something completely brainless like shooting from 50 yards or forcing the issue with a bunch of Hollywood passes. That's nothing new. Ancelotti had found the perfect role for him though in his 4-3-3/4-4-2 hybrid system. Without the ball he offered the hustle and speed to defend the left flank for Cristiano. With the ball he could tuck into central midfield and support Alonso and Modric as well as overload the left flank with Marcelo and Cristiano. However he is not the man to dictate play from the middle (that was what Alonso and Modric did) nor the main attacking star who decides games on his own consistently. He was part of the puzzle. An important one but he's victim of his own hype right now. 75 million Euros was really outrageous for him. He will never be able to justify that.

7635~~~
I don't know how we're going to fit him in next season. I didn't want to believe it at first but I've come around to the idea that this was a Woodward signing. If we get a good offer I'd sell him.

7636~~~
Shots against QPR, Everton and Leicester were bent as sh*t but led to goals; surely it was worth a try, given how we hardly took a risk all game?

7637~~~
There won't be a better time. We've lost two in a row, and some of the players never seemed up to it, yesterday. At home to West Brom is more than ideal to put di Maria back into the side; it's not as if he's an unknown, youth product.

7638~~~
With regards to the shots, desparate times call for desperate measures.

7639~~~
Do you then take him out of the team if he fails to perform ?

7640~~~
As some posters mentioned earlier, AdM is at his best when used centrally. That is why, I believe we will sign only one central mid, who can play as both #6 and #8. Nani, Januzaj, Depay and Mata will be on wings.

7641~~~
I'd like to think we'd give him more than one start, unless it's an absolute stinker.

7642~~~
I don't know why this myth perdure but Di Maria isn't a central player, last season he was more often dangerous in wide areas than centrally. Play him as a center midfielder and you have a poor but fit Anderson.

7643~~~
I'd like to see a midfield like that (at least for home games):

----ADM-------Herrera-----
--------Carrick--------

7644~~~
I think we would need to add a new physical midfielder to the team then we could drop Fellaini and go with:

----ADM-------Herrera-----
--------new CM--------

7645~~~
He should be playing in the middle, taking up Fellaini's position in the inside left channel when the plan A is not working out. It'd be a niightmare for the opposition to prepare for Fellaini and end up facing Di Maria's pace and drive from midfield. I think LvG missed that trick against both Everton & Chelsea.

7646~~~
What do you mean "flopped"? You're missing the point completely. I'm talking about players who struggled in their first season, then came good in their second and subsequent seasons. 

Can't believe I actually need to give examples tbh. Anyway, here goes. Robert Pires, Mikael Essien, David Silva, Luka Modric, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, do I really need to go on?

7647~~~
I can't argue with that. I guess it's all about hindsight. If it pays off, it looks good. If it doesn't, then it's just sheer infuriating and shit.

7648~~~
TBH I get pissed off more when we're loosing or its 0-0 and we've been struggling all game to get chances and no one even bothers to have a pop when they get anywhere near 25-30 yards out. I find this infuriating tbh. We used to have so many players who would have a go, Beckham, Scholes, Nani, Ronaldo, RVP, Rooney (used to do it more often)

7649~~~
All those players you mentioned developed into better players after moving to new leagues (None of them were world class players prior), you heavily underrate their first seasons, none of them went impactless for 5 months, Di Maria has already shown his quality in the EPL so the "New League" argument is invalid, but like i said before i don't think any player 25 and over should get away with using a new league as an excuse, talk less of a WC player.

Or are we trying to compare the expectations we had for Evra and Vidic with the ones we had for Di Maria?

7650~~~
No. I'm simply pointing out that plenty of "grown men" have improved significantly in their second and subsequent seasons in the PL.

Oh and all those players were stars in their own leagues before moving to England. That's why I mentioned players who were all signed by the strongest clubs in the league.

7651~~~
Our midfield is being built on possession and protecting the ball, there's no way I see LvG using Di Maria there again.

7652~~~
Doesn't mean their sole reason for struggling in their first season was because of a new league, i don't know maybe the likes of Evra,Vidic,Essien,Silva ,Pires and Modric just happened to improve as players?

7653~~~
Happened to get back to the level that was the reason they were signed in the first place, more like. Obviously, they continued to improve from then on but that's neither here nor there.

7654~~~
He had a bit of a hybrid midfield role last season right? Whenever I watched them, he seemed like he was playing LM at times, because Ronaldo went central, effectively partnering their striker. It certainly wasn't a normal midfield role he played. Whatever it was, he did it very well, but I'm not sure that for the balance of the team we can accommodate him LCM. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't particularly care for possession based football, but even as he is, I think he's way too sloppy to play in our midfield on a regular basis. Neither wing is foreign to him, so I just hope he can show his quality there instead.

7655~~~
Yes. It usually looked like this:

---Cristiano--Benzema---
-ADM----------------Bale 
-----Alonso--Modric----- 

And this:

Cristiano---Benzema---Bale
-------ADM---------------
---------------Modric-----
-------Alonso-------------

Those were the zones he occupied. More important than his position however was how well he complemented the rest of the team. Modric and Alonso is a central midfield pairing that can easily hold its own in a 2. ADM tucking in and supporting them as an auxiliary midfielder isn't the same as playing him in a leading central midfield role. Even less so under van Gaal where clean ball circulation matters a lot. The best role for him under van Gaal would be as an out and out left winger. But in such a role he can be very predictable because of his extreme 1-footedness. A very skilful winger with a very high top level but also very hot and cold and his best career performances came in a very specific role.

7656~~~
On form he's usually better than most of our other players with a great work rate. Plus our most creative player. I can see plenty of reasons why LVG will put him back in

7657~~~
Well yes, how often have we broken down a team who mainly parks the bus and hits on the counter this season? We have been heavily struggling with it, and now Everton has punished us for it. These are the kind of tactics we will face in the CL next year. We perform at our very best when the opponent isn't parking the bus either, see our few performances before the Chelsea game. How can you deny that our game doesn't need tweaking?

7658~~~
I can't, he gives the ball away too much, is slightly built and lacks patience, pretty much everything LvG seems to not want in a CM. He'll play on the wing from this point on I think.

7659~~~
We definitely need to get in some new players. Possession based football is here to stay. Whether it's us or the likes of Barca, the approach is going nowhere.

7660~~~
That was when we, in general, played shit. He, like Mata, Herrera or Fellaini should be given a chance now again

7661~~~
If you're expecting LVG to change the possession based system, or make allowances for Di Maria to be in the team, while still not playing in the way LVG wants, then you'll be waiting for a long time.

7662~~~
It's not about that, it's about him not possessing any of the traits LvG likes in a midfielder.

7663~~~
I would rather see di Maria central as well, but my feeling is that LVG really doesn't like "risky" players in his midfield. By this I mean players who take risks and lose possession, and/or don't offer a lot defensively. It was why Herrera struggled to get into the team for a whIle (his interviews support this), and would also explain why ADM and Mata are primarily used out wide.

7664~~~
Tired of the cliche "he's our most creative player." Creative in ways of losing the ball? Even in the early days when he was playing better, he was still sending crosses after crosses after crosses into the box whenever he got the ball. That's not creativity. Your average joe knows how to do that.

7665~~~
I am too, but he probably is - he doesn't seem to show it 75% of the time though (this season).

7666~~~
I'm confident he'll be excellent next season. I always think signings especially from a different league needs at least 12 months to settle. So with that in mind I'll be waiting a few more months before I begin to get critical of his performances. He'll have a good pre season you watch.

7667~~~
He isn't even going to have a pre season I don't think. He is going to play in the Copa American and won't be back until late. Also the new season starts really early on August 8th.

7668~~~
Against teams looking to counter that kind of makes sense. You just got to make a trade off I guess by asking Young to stick close to midfield in case a break starts.

7669~~~
A bit OTT, isnt it?

7670~~~
Di Maria has to start in the last 4 games, to give him confidence and because he is good enough.

7671~~~
Not as far as midfield goes I don't think it is. Herrera had to modify his game to get starts there and he takes a lot less risks than Di Maria.

7672~~~
We talk here about ADM, one of the best players around last season. You dont lose your ability within a couple of months and he already showed this season who good he can be

7673~~~
Di Maria the winger correspond to LVG, but Di Maria the hybrid center midfielder doesn't, at least not when he is not at the top of his game.

7674~~~
I didn't say he has lost quality, I am saying that when you look at what LvG wants from a CM, Di Maria is not it, that's why he'll play on the wing.

7675~~~
I think he ticks quiet some boxes in midfield and brings a lot to our play. I don't see why LVG wouldn't want to play him in midfield ever again

7676~~~
Not LvG's boxes though, he likes patience, control, possession and accurate passing in midfield. This is not Di Maria, he likes to run with the ball, takes risks with it all of the time and plays more on the counter than as someone who will methodically build play.

7677~~~
We have Herrera who is also much more dynamic. I think LVG knows that he can't just have a midfield full of "Blinds" but needs something to compliment the others. Di Maria's passing is actually very good and losing balls has mainly started once his form got worse. He brings so much into our game and I see him as an added value. Against Everton, it showed where we struggled and he could have helped there as well. Let's see where LVG will play him

7678~~~
I don't van Gaal likes the chaos he creates when played as a midfielder. Plus, he tends to lose the ball in stupid situations quite a lot, has inconsistent touch, and isn't disciplined. He will probably play a winger for us, as soon as he settles down.

7679~~~
Herrera is more dynamic than Blind or Carrick but he is now much more careful with the ball than he was, he chooses his moments carefully when to inject something more urgent into the game. We simply don't have a DM strong enough to even try and accommodate Di Maria's weakness in midfield, it's the same with Mata, both of them need to find their form on the wings if they are to start games for LvG as he has already said he'll be buying another CM this summer, one who I am sure will fit with Carrick and Herrera while being much less risky than Di Maria.

7680~~~
Gundogan?

7681~~~
I just rewatched the QPR game from the beginning of the season. Di Maria was absolutely lethal in that game, and not particularly wasteful either. Granted QPR were obliging opponents, but the runs Di Maria makes are breathtaking, and usually from quite deep, central positions (and he's shredded much better opponents in much the same way, playing for Real and Argentina.)

I've been as frustrated as anyone by his performances recently, but it would be worth trying to tap into whatever it was that allowing him to perform at that level. It's worth noting that both Mata and Herrera were playing, so getting him to perform in this way wouldn't necessarily have to be at the expense of these two. 

Sidenote: it's quite a bittersweet affair watching the QPR match. Rafael was doing his thing at RB (I'll never understand how Valencia could be preferred to him,) and Falcao received a pretty rousing reception when he started warming up.

7682~~~
It's a difficult one. He looked like a completely different footballer to the one we've seen lately in those few games, and looked a class above the rest of our squad in the Burnley game.

7683~~~
It's tough, because on the one hand, we recently seem to have discovered a good formula that emphasizes possession play, one which has produced good results (with the exception of the Everton game,) and which does seem particularly suited to accommodating Di Maria; on the other hand however, you can't help but wonder if we shouldn't tailor our game to him somewhat, given his talent (and by this, I mean letting him play a bit deeper and more centrally, where he has looked far more dangerous.)

The player on display in the early part of the season certainly appears to be worth making concessions for. The question, of course, is whether he has it in him to take the reins should they be offered to him (talent-wise there's no doubt that he does, but there are question marks about his attitude/happiness, etc.)

7684~~~
Not gonna happen under van Gaal. He's not changing away from his possesion based football for 1 footballer, he's going to find a way for Di Maria to fit in though. 

This is more likely as winger than as CM, because van Gaal's instructions for his midfielders will limit Di Maria's strenghts severely. He would need to play him as the only attacking midfielder (the only position in midfield we're stocked on - it'll be more expensive to replace the other midfielders than Di Maria was) for it to work. He can't change his 'philosophy' to just put a worldclass attacking gung-ho Di Maria in midfield who's most important role is to keep possesion at all costs. We would get outscored every match.

On the wing he can take risks and be given a more free role in van Gaal's otherwise rigid team to use him to great effects. We haven't seen Di Maria in midfield for how long now? I think he gave up on the idea pretty quickly.

7685~~~
Oh I'm sure you're right. I just wish it wasn't so set in stone, as the player on display earlier this season was a real game-changer (and actually not nearly as loose in possession as he has been lately.) Hopefully those same strengths can be harnessed on the wing.

7686~~~
The biggest issue if he doesn't end going to PSG despite the stories that he's happy, is which wing to use him on and if we can get more goals out of him, as in a 4-3-3 you need all of the front 3 to weigh in with goals and that is not really his strength.

7687~~~
He needs to turn it up next year big time, and by that I mean he needs to maintain his early 2014/15 form for the whole of next season. 

Right now this is looking like one of the biggest transfer flops in history. He is a world class player and I believe he can turn it around.

7688~~~
Di Maria has got 10 assists and 3 goals from his limited outings. He hasn't been a trial-blazer but it's hardly a "flop" by any account. 

Balotelli is a flop.

7689~~~
Di Maria cost £60million and is getting benched by Young. Since early March Di Maria has been on the bench for us. 

Ballotelli has been a flop too, of course albeit a less expensive one.

7690~~~
He's very talented, but I think he'd be better off playing for a manager who will use him as the most attacking player in a 4-3-3, which Van Gaal seems unlikely to do. He's best running from deeper and having options up ahead.

The role Kuba plays Dortmund in their 4-3-3, for example, would suit him perfectly. 

It won't happen, but Di Maria + 15M for Koke would improve us massively (with Koke taking Fellaini's spot) and Simeone would get an Argentinian with La Liga experience to create for Manzukic/New Striker + Griezmann up top. 

If PSG buy him, I think he'll produce as he does here, since he will be pushed up the field by virtue of their personnel; Motta, Verrati and Matuidi are simply more productive than Lucas, Cavani, Lavezzi and Pastore. But whenever one of those first 3 CM's was missing, Di Maria could take Matuidi's role, for which he is well suited.

7691~~~
Unless we get the same money we paid for him, we would be mad to let him go this summer. As good as Young have been this year he is not world class anf Di Maria is more than capable to fill that position.

Yes he has done some dumb shit, but his stats speak for themselves. Have Fellaini bully the players around him and the left back bomb forward and  i am sure he would thrive in that LFW role

7692~~~
With the benefit of hindsight, those early season performance were nowhere near as good as we thought at the time.  There was, at most, two games where he put in a really good performance and they were against <i>really</i> crap opposition. Never once looked a threat against anyone decent and in games where he looked good going forward, individually, we got utterly dominated in the centre of the park for most of the game. Everton, Leicester and West Ham being the obvious examples. 

"Solving a problem like Di Maria" is far more tricky than just sticking him in central midfield. He's struggled with the physicality, pace and the refereeing of the PL from the outset and when you're in central midfield there's nowhere to hide. He didn't even play as a proper CM at Madrid. Was more like a winger being asked to drift infield. Hopefully he'll come good next season but that's going to have to be in the position he's played for almost his entire career to date, out wide.

7693~~~
Well I think he was excellent in those two or three games (Burnley, QPR and Leicester - first half.) But you're right: the opposition, particularly QPR, couldn't have been much more obliging.

I also agree that he'll have to make his impact from the wing. I just wish he could find a happy medium between the gung-ho early season performances, with the incredible pace he injected into our attack (something that has been sorely lacking over the past few years,) and the more controlled tempo he's had to play at from the wing (of course without the all-too frequent losing of the ball.) Of course, if the Di Maria problem is to be solved, then 90% of the solution will have to come from the player himself. I feel for him with what he's been through, but it's time to draw a line under that, and get on with becoming a key member of the starting 11.

7694~~~
This is the same as Mata, people are too quick to right off a player. He joined a very physically demanding league after a world cup year and we've seen glimpses of his best during the early parts of the season. We will see the real Di Maria next season and believe me he will be spectacular. A world class player doesn't turn to shit overnight for no reason at all. This is the same player who played a huge role in winning that 10th Champions league trophy for Real Madrid.

Di Maria is one of the best players in the world and we would be stupid to get rid of him.

7695~~~

7696~~~
If PSG offered 45mill this summer I would take it, seriously, I never thought that highly of him in Mourinho's Real team, I dont think he has the consistency on the wings for a 60mill type player, through the middle may be a different story, but if LvG isn't prepared to structure the team around him then its best to recoup our money, particuarly if his private life still isnt settled in Manchester.

7697~~~
He will improve next year and if we're serious about the league and CL, we need players like him to stay.

7698~~~
He's not a 60mil winger, no doubt about that. But the price we paid for him was for his performances in the middle of the park, its not his fault if we intend to play him out wide. I don't understand the sell him for 45mil bit though especially after just 1 season. Our spending this summer is not reliant on any sales. Why sell him now rather than give him another year?

7699~~~
Honestly, his form has flatlined since that attempted robbery, If his wife is that unhappy here... then  just let him go, dont get me wrong, I think he's a class player and an absolute assist machine if afforded the right circumstances to perform, but is LvG with his strict criteria for each position going to consider him centralish? if he's not then it's probable we're not going to see the Real Madrid Di Maria of last year, coupled with the idea if his private life isnt settled we could well be lumbered with an underperforming player.

We could reinvest that 45mill in someone such as a Bale, who you'd know would be instantly settled in the North West and in the Premier League.

7700~~~
I've been pretty critical of him for most of the season but I agree with those saying keep him (if he genuinely wants to stay) and see what he can do next year. We made our bed when we spunked the record fee on him, trying to get grab some change from PSG would look poor imo.

7701~~~
For Van Gaal to get a more creative player central, he needs a proper 8 in the middle. I think he's definitely going to buy one which will leave Fellaini's slot up for grabs for a proper no 10. I think it'l be one of Mata or Herrera though which still leaves Di Maria out wide. But, play him on the right and he's a top player. What he needs is confidence and a good run in the side. He's new to the PL, its very different in terms of the demand on the player to the Spanish League. When you get a top player like Di Maria, you do everything possible to let him make an impact, not sell him on after a season. 

As I said, if Bale was available and we wanted him, we wouldnt need to sell Di Maria to get him. We make too much money. Which is why I dont see any reason to sell a player like him without giving him a proper go.

7702~~~
I take your view, honestly I do, I suppose I just see it more likely his form wont improve dramatically next year... if his home life isn't settled, but at the end of the day, I dont personally know his home life issues or if they've been overblown, if thats the case then yea I would be more comfortable in keeping him here next year.

On the fact we wouldnt need to sell to buy a Bale type, of course thats true too, but I find it puzzling we're now thought of as a club who's comfortable with throwing our financial clout around suddenly, we've always been a very frugal club historically in comparisson to the big spenders, even before the Glazers, under Edwards, this 20+ year model seems to have been eroded in everyones mind due to the last couple of years expenditure.

We're still a club who runs on a tight business model to stay at the top  as much as anything we do on the field, and getting a 45million return on what could be; an unhappy, underperforming player would surely make good business sense.

Thats just my take on the situation, but again, my opinion on the matter is based on the fact I see his home life in turmoil just now. (and could well be wrong on the fact)

7703~~~

7704~~~
Hardly convincing!

I reckon if a big bid comes in, and he wants to go, we'll let him.

7705~~~
Probably a deliberate attempt to squash rumors to the contrary.

7706~~~
Very high praise for Carrick in that article about Di Maria!

7707~~~
Really hope he stays and proves himself, but if we are serious about going for Bale then we are going to need to sell a player that is actually worth something significant, if Bale looks a goer, and someone (PSG) offers £50 m for Di Maria then it'd be hard to say no.

7708~~~
We can exchange for players we want but we won't be selling to that annoying club. It's pointless. They can bleep off

7709~~~
I'm maybe reading to much into it, but it seems that Di Maria wants to leave and the club tries to convince him to stay.

7710~~~
I doubt they would bother to make a public tweet about expecting him to stay in that case. All talks would take place privately.

7711~~~
I'm convinced tbf. Van Gaal is a gentleman, he doesn't lie - he never has done. He will truly believe Di Maria wants to fight for his place and he believes in him. Of course he can't completely rule out a transfer since you never know, but I very much doubt van Gaal wants to lose Di Maria after one season when he's shown in glimpses of what he can do. The only way Di Maria would leave is if he <i>really</i> wants out, so far there have been no official reports/statements that he's that unhappy so I doubt it. The club won't be keen to sell him anyways, we don't need to so it won't be for a loss.

7712~~~
I think Van Gaal is savvy enough to know that he will need players of Di Maria's quality if he plans on making a serious run at the league and CL next year.

7713~~~
Yeah, maybe your right, but the fact that the club put all departure possibility in Di Maria's hands is a bit weird, why say that the decision is his ?

7714~~~
It's not the first LVG has something like this, he said this back in March:

7715~~~
I know, he is insisting on the 'it's the player decision' mantra.

7716~~~
Basically he's referencing to his 'totale mens principe' (total human picture?). He believes a happy player is a better player - that's why he always tries to keep them happy. As a family man he gives them much more priviledges to visit family for example - wifes and children are always welcome, he gives them holidays like with Christmas, he will even congratulate the players on the birthdays of their family. If a player really isn't happy he will be sold, because it's bad for the team spirit, he'll perform worse and because he's a family man himself. If a player wants out, he's always free to go and van Gaal will never stand in their way.

Doesn't mean he wants Di Maria to leave, he just won't stop him if he wants to.

7717~~~
Good luck and all the best...I wonder where he'll be next season, PSG?
I hope he gets the #7 shirt, wouldn't want that tattoo going to waste

7718~~~
It just sounded as if LVG was leaving the door open somewhat, so if Di Maria really wanted to leave he'd let him. Not that he'd <i>want </i>that to happen.

7719~~~
That's not what I said, if Di Maria wants to stay and the club wants to keep him, there is no decision to make. I'm under the impression that Van gaal and the club don't know what Di Maria wants, otherwise it would be simple and the message would be 'circulate, nothing to see'.

7720~~~
I don't think its that far fetched to suggest he's probably not particularly pleased to be here right now.

7721~~~
That's completely plausible, with the tweet used as a public message to Di Maria that the club want him here.

7722~~~
There are two reasons for the on-going di Maria saga. The first one are his injury problems and average performances along with it, which always causes speculations regarding a possible transfer. The second one is di Maria never really convincing anybody that he wants to be here and that I've never understood. View Manchester as you may, but you can only play football for so long while you still have a life after football and some time off during the summer to spend time in your favorite place. So if one of Europe's most renowned clubs dumps me and I land at another renowned club, one should be able to enjoy and appreciate that. 

If di Maria can become consistent next season, he could become the face of one of the World's best known clubs. We're talking taking himself to the next level marketing wise and even having a shot at the Ballon d'Or depending on how good we'll be next season. We have the manager, we already have a good amount of players and the financial strength to add to our roster in order to compete for the Champions League next season. Of course a lot of it depends on di Maria himself, but just that chance alone should make him want to stay and fight through his current struggles.

Is Paris really that much better than Manchester for it to be worth throwing all of the above away? Sure, he could compete for the Champions League with PSG as well, but due to FFP, they'll have to sell some players from a squad that isn't all that convincing to begin with. Plus, PSG is no where near as famous as we are and the French league isn't half as popular and competitive as the BPL.

The only true advantage I see for him at PSG is the city and if that has such a huge influence on him, then he's not the right player for us anyways and was never worth his price tag.

7723~~~
Yeah, agree with you.

7724~~~
Exactly, but van Gaal has always been like that to all his players. He will never stand in the way because of what I wrote above, he has no problem with selling any player if they're unhappy. Di Maria isn't having the best of times so he doesn't say anything about it. He's just trying to explain how things work like always, and he's failing horribly again by the looks <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ah I misunderstood that, sorry. That might be a hint, but he went on to say he does this with every player so I doubt it. I wouldn't read too much into it, I doubt he would've hinted at Di Maria thinking about leaving right after he has said that he wants to keep him and thinks that he'll stay and even praised him for his attitude. He's just giving generic Dutch answers.

7725~~~
I see absolutely no reasons to sell Di Maria.

7726~~~
If van Gaal can't bring him into start against West Brom at home, I will have my first doubts about van Gaal's plans for Di Maria's future.

7727~~~
I get the impression LvG is not particularly fussed about Di Maria staying or going.

7728~~~
What's this even supposed to mean? The state of the modern day fan, lost a game or two and everything is average, system has been found out, favourite player must play etc. Get a grip, will you.

7729~~~
Through last summer, over the press tid bits you pickup it seemed his first choice always seemed to be PSG (and Paris) but they struggled to work out a deal with fair play hindering them badly, it was only at the end of the summer that he agreed his move here, when hope with PSG started to fade.
You could still imagine a scenario that he's not all that enamoured here on and off the field, and PSG would still be both his ... and more importantly his wifes(!) preffered choice, if they came calling this summer then you could easily imagine him asking in private to let him go.

Van Gaal saying its up to the player kind of gives the hint that his future isnt yet certain to be here.

7730~~~
I can't bring myself to warm up to him, not sure why.

7731~~~
Might be reading too much into it but I've never seen a club/manager comment on the future of a record signing/world class player before the end of his first season, the fact that LVG even addressed this issue might actually mean something is definitely not right with his present situation.

7732~~~
I'm the same and, for me, it's because everything about him seems to suggest he'd rather be somewhere else. And if that is the case then I'd rather he fecked off out of it.

Odd comments from LVG.

7733~~~
I got the same feeling listening to VG's press conference. Why delve into as much detail as he did if everything was hunky-dory. I think he is gone if PSG come up with a substantial offer.

7734~~~
This imo proves that Di maria was never a Van Gaal signing .He was brutally honest about his first season and the talk of him not adapting to his philosophy suggests that he as not settled into the squad off the field.

7735~~~
Despite publicly identifying him as the type of player we need 3 weeks before we signed him?

7736~~~
He'll come good next season, no doubt about it. He's got a summer off, really hope he pushes on.

7737~~~
Why would anyone choose to play for PSG ahead of Manchester United? ?? He's not even that old to retire yet. And most players there wish they were somewhere else! It's a tragedy to see top footballers of today compete in leagues where careers have their first stage. And it's not even that much more money.

7738~~~
Doesn't he have Copa America this summer?

7739~~~
Yet somehow Jamie Jackson has managed to embarrass himself once again.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/01/louis-van-gaal-angel-di-maria-old-trafford-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...angel-di-maria-old-trafford-manchester-united</a>

7740~~~
Well that's weird. It seems like a sign to other clubs that he is thinking about his future. If you want to cut the speculations you use words like "definitely" or "I'm sure", not "expect".

That said I'm not particularly worried about him leaving. Van gaal will never use him in midfield, and as a winger he can be replaced.

7741~~~
"Manager says he would consider a transfer request if striker makes one "

Wov, talk about making things up. 


Saying all that, if his attitude isnt right and he doesnt want to stay I'm not too fussed about him leaving, esp if we'll get Depay or some other good winger. LVG just left the door open and that's fair.

7742~~~
There does seem a bit of history being rewritten here with the benefit of hindsight - "Oh he's never looked like he wanted to be here" etc. I think he's struggled to fit into the LVG system/'philosophy' and has clearly struggled on the domestic front, especially since the burglary - we shouldn't underestimate the impact something like that can have, no matter how much money he's earning.

I think he'll be here next season, especially with CL football all but guaranteed. He has the kind of pace and ability to unlock a defence that no-one else in the team currently has. Where he'll fit in is a different matter - probably LW but Young is undroppable at the moment.

7743~~~
He doesn't seem like a United player...thats the vibe im getting from him, like he's still thinking about PSG. Blind, Herrera, Rojo, you can tell immediately those lads are happy to be at OT. I don't get the same feeling with Di Maria. Maybe he needs to go to PSG and be a king in an inferior league.

7744~~~
I think he will start today and tear WBA a knew one. I remember him saying that he takes a while to settle into a new Club, I'm hoping his time away from the team will have helped him settle. He is a quality player who could get into most if not every team in Europe.

7745~~~
We would be idiots to sell Di Maria imo. This season has been labeled a crap season for him or a settling in season but he's still fetched 13 assists and was unbelievable at the start of the season. He's a quality player and I'm sure he'll be great next season.

7746~~~
Like all the new players, we need another season to make a proper assessment. That said, I think Blind has shown his worth. The rest, the jury is still out.....

7747~~~
Out of interest, what was Di Maria like in his first season at Real? How long did it take him to "tick" at Real?
Its possible that he generally performs poorly in his first season and does great in his 2nd season.

7748~~~
I feel exactly the same, mostly the latter actually, If we can recoup most of all the cash we paid for him i would bite there hand off, he was a glamour buy to show we can still get big name players even though were not in the UCL when really he was never what we exactly needed, I would rather we stuck with Januzaj and Nani and we would be 60 million better off this coming transfer window.

7749~~~
He's always been a slightly inconsistent yet insanely productive winger, till his last season; where his move to the central midfield and success has been well documented. In his first season, he scored 9 and assisted 14, however, the standards for him were far different, which is why he was considered to have a decent season. 

As to whether we should sell him, we'd be absolute fools. This guy has massive potential, and should be played in the LCM or Fellaini position. I don't remember many complaining earlier in the season when he was ripping teams apart for the first few weeks. I also don't recall many criticising his performances for RM, last year, in that position, where he played the most important part in them winning the CL. If the LCM position doesn't work out, then he's still devastating as a winger, and a quieter* summer would do him a world of good.

*World Cup maybe more demanding than Copa America

7750~~~
JSV. great the first couple of months with the club. sold for half what united paid.

7751~~~
He's a tart

7752~~~
I am glad that Van Gaal has learned to pick player of the performance rather than reputation, but if I am being honest, I rather we try and help Di Maria find his early season form, than make him a part time player. This is all with the assumption that Di Maria does want to stay here next season.

7753~~~
Young has been rubbish in both our defeats. Mata has also offered very little. Di Maria wont find any form getting small cameos from the bench.

7754~~~
Young and Mata were poor last week. Thought he would be given a chance to prove himself today

7755~~~
Not trying to start something, but it seems like a bad Ashley Young performance is not allowed, he's usually  classed as "rubbish","shocking""should losing his starting place" etc but when Di Maria plays badly, "he's average","its just one game","he'll come good"etc

There is no middle ground for Mata, he is either the best player on the pitch, or he offers very little.

7756~~~
Spend 60m on a player and don't even let him play, brilliant.

Honestly if I were ADM I'd want to go somewhere else this summer.

7757~~~
No, he's on the pitch in an attacking position and that means he should be offering some creativity. Very few times this season he has actually done that, even with his much improved performances and hard work. Mata was poor in the past 2 games, it's the same for him. He offered next to nothing in an attacking sense which isn't good enough.

No, Di Maria hasn't started for almost 2 months now, and people are ripping into some sub cameo appearances from the bench, it's not a fair comparison to players who have started in the exact same (almost) line up for 8 games running.

7758~~~
If we made our money back, then fair enough. If he's unhappy, let him go. He's in no position to demand first team football when he's playing the way he is.

7759~~~
So if Di Maria offers nothing in the next two games you'd be calling for his head as well?

7760~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> people are calling for his head and want him sold because he can't get into the team, yet he's still by far our most creative player, with the stats to show it.

7761~~~
Definitely would have made sense to play him today, however I absolute detest the man when he plays with Fellaini - he is a key culprit of aimlessly lumping it towards him.

If we're talking about form deserving a start - Young and Mata haven't played very well in the last two so it would've been fair to give him a go.

7762~~~
Yes, because his transfer fee automatically means he'll play well, some logic that.

7763~~~
No, but playing proven players in a consistent starting XI and they might start playing better, y'know like the rest of them did in our good run?

7764~~~
He is the most creative player in our team, but can we at least get some of that creativity from him in more than just 2 attacks?

7765~~~
He hasn't played in ages and has got 13 assists and 4 goals. When was the last time we had that kind of end product from a winger?

7766~~~
Should have started today...

7767~~~
Well we would if he played more I'm sure. Kind of common practise, more minutes = more creativity.

7768~~~
You mean playing an inconsistent player signed off one golden season? are we just going to ignore the fact that we used a system in our good run?

7769~~~
He's done nothing coming off the bench to suggest he deserves to be starting apart from giving the ball away.

Even the hint of taking someone or something.

7770~~~
Really surprised he doesn't start today our wingers and Fellaini (presuming he could play CM) have been poor in the last 2 games and LvG in his press conference hinted that he will play, meh.

7771~~~
What about the other 10+ games he played/started and did feck all?

7772~~~
I'd love to know which would be the ideal winger for LvG apart from Robben who won't give the ball away a lot? Depay? Bale? Both give it away very often.

Even for a low risk taker and at times coward manager like Mourinho Di Maria had always been a starter. I am afraid to say it but LvG's coward tactics at times will cost us big time in Europe against any half decent opposition.

7773~~~
We also managed to consistently play the same group of players, and that's the main reason we went on the run. Something we haven't managed to do most of the season is fielding the same XI and when we finally did, look what happened? Look what also happened when we lost a few of them. 2 defeats in 2. Di Maria has barely been on the field in this time, it's not because he's a poor player but it's because the line up has been consistent, yet when we lose some games and other players in his positions on the pitch are poor, he still sits on the bench, and supporters still get riled up at him for some unknown reason (the transfer fee?) How can he produce when he isn't playing? All the evidence so far points towards him producing a fair bit when he does play, but in unbalanced teams. Barely had a chance in this system though. Harsh to say the least.

7774~~~
Going by that logic, what about the 8 games Messi's done feck all this season, or the 15 games Rooney and RVP have done feck all? You expect someone to produce magic every single game, well actually the only player in the world that does it is Messi, and he's had some shit games this season too.

7775~~~
I'm surprised he doesn't start today.  He isn't playing great, but probably deserved a go today due to the poor team performance against Everton.

7776~~~
Very easy to throw the "how can he produce when he isn't playing?" excuse, when the same supporters getting riled up at him have witnessed him start for us on a consistent basis and waste balls after balls(besides the 1/2 golden moments), we have seen what Di Maria can do, his name used to be the first on the team sheet at some point.... we have gone down that path before, Mata used to be a bench warmer, then he'd come in and play well -he even won us a game from the bench, same with Herrera - cant say the same about Angel though.

7777~~~
He really should be starting in games like these. The fans should judge him after he gets a run of 3-4 games in a balanced team. He is effective when he starts.

7778~~~
I never said anything about a transfer fee meaning a player will automatically play well, did I?

It's the idea that when you spend that massive amount of money on a player you pretty much should be playing him regardless, so that it's not a total waste of money.

He hasn't been given proper chance in the past two months to get himself back into the groove.

7779~~~
Is he on the bench? Hope he comes on at half time.

7780~~~
His movement and ability to try and create something is desperately needed in this game. 

Herrera and Mata are babysitting Fellaini, Valencia and Rooney here. They need support.

7781~~~
Fellaini off di Maria on at half time please. 

Absolutely no reason fellaini should start against these lot he doesn't offer anything but strength and aerial threat we don't need eith in this game, we need pace and unpredictability.

7782~~~
You are basically saying Di Maria should be starting every game regardless of his performances...because of his transfer fee, you could apply the same logic to Falcao, its wrong.

7783~~~
Not sure why he's not starting, that's 225 minutes without a goal where we've been woeful in front of goal.

7784~~~
Crying out for him. We'll chuck him on in the 70th minute though.

7785~~~
Yup. He cripples our creativity a lot, really shouldn't be a first teamer in most games.

7786~~~
LVG has got it wrong today IMO, should of started with Di Maria and been a bit more adventurous.

7787~~~
Definitely should come on, we lack unpredictability and drive right now, it's all too side to side.

7788~~~
Every week, someone pops up asking why he's not playing and says "he's made for this game". And then he comes on and proceeds to do feck all except shoot from stupid places and give the ball away, coupled with one or two decent crosses. Then people come in saying he did well and that's deemed sufficient enough for him to start the next game. He doesn't and the whole cycle repeats itself.

7789~~~
But are Young, Mata, Fellaini, Rooney doing well enough for him not to be starting? No chance at all.

7790~~~
It was obvious that WBA would come here to park the bus, it's poor selection by LVG. It's incredibly frustrating a manager can't see it when every fan could see it.

7791~~~
You're happy with what you've seen against Chelsea, Everton and now West Brom from everyone else?

I'll tell you what's more frustrating than watching di Maria, watching us play against WBA and create feck all, all half.

Everyone has been awful in these past few games.

7792~~~
What I don't get is this, whenever we are losing or not looking like making anything happen the manager brings on Angel di Maria so clearly he is of the opinion he can make something happen but then isn't it logical just to start him and let him grow into the match?

7793~~~
Stay on your feet, you fecking fanny.

7794~~~
I know it's a cliche but seriously; "needs to bulk up". 

A 6 year old girl could brush him off the ball.

7795~~~
Why does he insist on launching it into the box every time he touches the ball, regardless of where he is on the pitch?

7796~~~
Joke of a signing. Feck off.

7797~~~
Jesus, his worse cameo yet.

7798~~~
He can't even get the basics right.

7799~~~
Whole team has been shit.

7800~~~
Nothing, and I mean nothing, is more frustrating than watching Di Maria play right now. 

If we can get get our money back for him, I'd gladly sell him. He doesn't fit into our midfield three and the only place to play him is on the wing where he's consistently inconsistent.

7801~~~
Fraud

7802~~~
ill drive him to Paris myself for anything close to our money back at this rate

7803~~~
Abysmal performance and abysmal man management.

7804~~~
His confidence looks shot.

7805~~~
How is he anywhere near the first 11.  Just get shut.

7806~~~
His head is elsewhere. Premier league is not for him.

7807~~~
Just feck off di Maria, just get the hell out of here

7808~~~
No confidence, i dont expect anything from him as long as he doesn't start. Van Gaal really should have started him today.

7809~~~
Madrid must be pissing themselves.

7810~~~
His worst performance yet? A total train wreck today, no confidence at all.

7811~~~
This is genuinely a 0/10 performance.

7812~~~
Tbf you could say the same for the vast majority of our team. 

Rooney always escapes any major critism but he's actually shit.

7813~~~
Nani on crack

7814~~~
His confidence has gone well and truly, sad to see.

7815~~~
Thrown on into a desperate situation and yet he'll be the focus of most ire. 

Yea, he's been gash since coming on, but it's no great shock. He's devoid of confidence.

7816~~~
Go to his thread.

7817~~~
Thats whose fault?

7818~~~
Why does everything have to be someone's fault?

7819~~~
I have hope he'll come good next year but we can't assume that so a winger is a definite priority.

Also, it annoys me when people sometimes defend(ed) him by saying that "at least he's trying something". Put me on the pitch and I'll try something. The best players try it and get it right. Right now he seems like a loose cannon with the ball.

7820~~~
I rarely go there tbh.

7821~~~
He's not getting cameos. Second game in a row he's had a full 30 minutes to influence the game. For a player of his (alleged) quality there's no excuses.

7822~~~
Confidence seems to only affect Di Maria on here.

7823~~~
Complete waste of time and money

Pathetic is a generous word to him

7824~~~
Shite crossing, just looks like he has no confidence at all right now. Should have started today against a team that were happy to sit back and let us play.

7825~~~
Bring back Liam Miller and Djemba  x2

7826~~~
He's pretty hopeless now.

7827~~~
He probably wasted as many balls as our other players combined though (exaggerating for emphasis!), so you can understand the criticism. You could argue that he's at least trying something, but when the result is a goal kick I'd rather he didn't try.

7828~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> my thoughts too

7829~~~
As a team we were absolutely woeful. It's criminal how we started trying after going one nil down. 

This thread can be quite funny.

7830~~~
Couldn't do anything for 25 mins, but should have started...ok.

7831~~~
Smiling at the end there that irks me, want the players to feel the pain we do after a performance like that

7832~~~
He does not want to be here. Get rid.

7833~~~
On the other hand you barely read anything about the Mcfail guy who gifted Westbrom with a great freekick and failed to score an open goal

7834~~~
Madrid must be laughing. Sixty million, what a disaster.

That period where every single cross he made ended up in complete failure just depressed me.

7835~~~
He reminds me of Bebe. Wild and completely unaware of whats going on.

7836~~~
I don't blame him. The way fans and club had been treating him is despicable.

7837~~~
That was far from convincing.

7838~~~
The whole team was trash today, not Di Maria's fault, he did however waste more balls than every other player - as per the usual.

7839~~~
That was painful to watch.

7840~~~
This isn't true. What did we do for the 65 or so minutes before he came on? Surely, the shite we witnessed before he came on was wasteful, too? Did you forget the part where we created feck all in the first half and lost 1-0?

7841~~~
Yes, why not? West Brom sat back. Mata yet again created nothing. Fellaini was pointless until shoved upfront. Young was also pointless. He doesn't have the trust of the manager, obviously.

7842~~~
Young was pointless? YOUNG WAS POINTLESS? did you watch the fecking first half? Di Maria would have done a better job? stop it.

7843~~~
He even passed Falcao today in being shit. It would have been better if he never showed up at all. feck, we would have been better playing with 10 men!!! Those crosses could have been done better by any youth player in our academy. ANd I'm talking about 10 year old boys here! I have been defending this man all season, but today he showed what a horrible investment this has been. I can NOT understand how a player can FALL that badly from his peak in that CL final JUST A feckING YEAR AGO!!!!!!!!!! Stop playing him right now and hope someone is stupid enough to give us any kind of money at all. I'm hoping we'll get maybe 15m euro at this rate.

7844~~~
I NEVER want to see him in a United shirt again.

7845~~~
He was complete horsehit.

7846~~~
Yeah, the first half where we created about 1 half chance. Amazing half.

7847~~~
You mean our 6th choice teenage CB?

7848~~~
Terrible performance.

7849~~~
At the moment, up there in the top 3 of the worst signings in the history of the Premier League.

7850~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Love it.

7851~~~
Time for him to feck off. He's had about 4 good games for us and they were all before he decided Manchester was a shit hole. He deserves more stick than Falcao for me.

7852~~~
Appalling really, has no confidence whatsoever.

7853~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7854~~~
I mean the one who costed us the game AGAIN

7855~~~
He was thrown into a team producing feck all who had just gone a goal down and were generally playing crap. Like I said, he was pretty bad, but he by no means deserves to be singled out.

He needs to get some starts and a proper run, preferably in a less desperate situation. 

Yes, Di Maria is the only player who has ever been cited as needing confidence. Clearly. Ffs.

7856~~~
Wow, a few bad crosses and these are the reactions. Knew it would happen though, whereas some players have been getting away with it for weeks.

7857~~~
Reminded me of Bebe's performance against Wolves

7858~~~
Sitting on the ground rolling up his socks? He can piss off.

That said, the crowd were shite with him, as they generally were all round aside from the fantastic tribute to Rio and his family.

7859~~~
I don't think you watched the game before Di Maria came on then, Young was the busiest man in our team.

7860~~~
Crap crap crap .....

7861~~~
He was spectacularly poor, like even worse than Januzaj this year.  Looked like some poor bloke from the stands being given the chance to play for United after winning some contest.  Shocking display from the most expensive signing in English football.

7862~~~
If Valencia made some of those damn awful attempt at crosses, then his performance thread would be plastered with "can't cross for shit", "wasting all of our chances" bla bla.

We just saw £60million worth of crossing today apparently. I'm sorry, and I know I'll be slated once again by the "OH YOU CAN READ BODY-LANGUAGE? BRAVO" party - but I really don't think his heart is in it. Doesn't seem to care that much. If we're offered anything close to £50million this summer, I'd be perfectly happy to sell him. Maybe this league just isn't suited for him. Not every world class player makes it here.

Edit: The whole team wasn't great today. I know.

7863~~~
You think his performance was funny. Seriously, it's been the same the last how many games? And yet every game LVG brings him on, should be anywhere near the first team. Reduces the team to 10 everytime he plays.

7864~~~
He has not shown any form whatsoever to be given a proper run.

7865~~~
He's just in a terrible form and he hasn't the mental fortitude to impose himself on matches to change them. Very underwhelming signing

7866~~~
Right ... let's blame everything on the person who gave away the free kick which resulted in a fluke goal. Sounds reasonable.

7867~~~
He should play some games for the U21 team.

7868~~~
The worst United cameo in living memory.

7869~~~
That was probably the most dejected footballing "performance" I have ever seen. 

Absolutely pathetic and embarrassing.

7870~~~
We created a few chances without Di Maria on the pitch, and apart from one or two potentially good crosses from him they were pretty much pointless. I'd rather keep the ball going then, instead of hitting the ball aimlessly upfield.

You might also note that I never said that Di Maria was our worst player. I just said he wasted a lot of balls, which is why he'll get a lot of criticism.

7871~~~
He's being thrown in a team when we're desperate and when strikers play in midfield, midfielders play in attack and attacking midfielders play as wingers. I don't blame him for being confused. I am confused and I've been watching United for years

7872~~~
I'm not surprised, never rated him highly

7873~~~
Nice, these players must have been so brilliant to help us win the game then. MATA motm, attacking mid who hasn't done any attacking for 3 games. Young, cuts onto his right and puts in a hapless cross or Fellaini, what did Fellaini do today exactly? He got shoved upfront and kept getting caught offside. Not excusing Di Maria's shit performance either btw. He was crap yep, but some of the reactions. This forum gets a bit embarrassing.

7874~~~
If we're going to keep him we need to start playing him from the beginning of matches and not just chuck him into a game with no shape or real tactic to it.

7875~~~
To be fair, he can still dribble, and got into decent crossing positions. Doesn't excuse the abysmal balls, though.

7876~~~
Mata, Young, Rooney, Fellaini were horrible in that first half. Nearly fell asleep watching us. Stop acting as if di Maria was the worst. He created one of our best chances which should have been scored by McNair.

He also managed to get a shot on target, unlike most of our team.

7877~~~
He's having plenty of chances coming on where we're dominating the play, he's getting the ball plenty of times and he's falling on his ass.

7878~~~
PSG can bloody have him.

7879~~~
I hope PSG couldn't get a stream.

7880~~~
Yeah, and I forgot that he helped us create chances too. We had pretty much all of the ball for 90 minutes, and created almost nothing with it, at home against West fecking Brom. Busiest man of the team, who cares? He didn't offer enough, neither did any other attacker today apart from RVP who was our best player in his first start in over 2 months.

7881~~~
No lets blame everything on the Argie who played like 30 minutes of play instead of the guy who gave the free kick that ended up with a goal and failed to score from few meters away.

I wonder what would be the reaction in here if Angel Di Maria was named Angus Mcmaria

7882~~~
Confidence is the last thing people resort to with Di Maria when they run out of excuses, his confidence has been low since the Everton game last year..... That seems to be a problem that only him can solve, giving him 90 mins to waste balls isn't going to help his confidence in anyway.

I bet he wasn't lacking any confidence when he was signing a contract that made him more expensive than Hazard though.

7883~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7884~~~
Young created far more than Mata, Rooney, Herrera, Fellaini, RVP, Di Maria or basically anyone else today.

7885~~~
Am I the only one who thought we played better with him? Even if he's wasteful at least he was doing something different and actually took a decent shot on goal. It's not like our other attackers created much more, and West Brom were doing feck all when they had it.

7886~~~
As i have pointed out twice today, The whole team was horrible, didnt stop Di Maria from wasting more balls than the whole team combined though.

7887~~~
Who is blaming ADM for losing the game? People are saying he played like shit and is massively out of form, if you care to dispute either of those points.

7888~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7889~~~
Can't stand the bastard. Needs fecking off. No fecker would take him now though.

7890~~~
Absolute waste of space. We'd have been better off playing with 10 men during the last 20 minutes.

7891~~~
He could go down as an even worse signing than Balotelli if he doesn't sort himself out...Scholes said at the start of the season that Di Maria didn't look happy at Utd and if that is the case then ship him out to PSG on the next Fed-EX plane ASAP

7892~~~
Holy shit that was bad, just looks completely and utterly gone.

7893~~~
If PSG are still interested, we should sell him. He's never going to justify his transfer fee here, and he just doesn't seem like he will recapture his Real Madrid form in the EPL. He would probably be a lot better in Champions League but for a player we spent 58 million pounds or whatever, we should be getting great productivity in the EPL. As it stands, he has been more of a liability than an actual positive asset to us lately. PSG have some players that we definitely should be interested in (Verrati, Moura, Matuidi), so we should try to do a player swap deal.

7894~~~
Not sure how he is getting defended. Out of everyone who played today he was the worst by a distance even though he only had 30 mins. Thank feck we didn't have to see him for 90

7895~~~
The best thing he did today was standing in a pocket of open space on the left and making himself available.  I noticed this after his third failed cross as I was screaming at our players not to pass to him.

7896~~~
Absolutely disgraceful performance from him today. You'd hope that any player would play with a bit of passion and desire after being benched, let alone one with his ability, but it took him a good fifteen minutes to remember how to pass.

7897~~~
Feckin Tyler Blackett is a happy man tonight I bet. What a shower that was.

7898~~~
He came on and straight away we went 1-0, and everything because a chaos. It looked like we were instructed to punt the ball towards Fellaini, which is why he kept aiming for him every time he got the ball.

Most people are waiting at their keyboards for him to make a mistake so they can join the bandwagon. It's a funny read. The criticism he gets is also embarrassing to read. Like I said, he mis hit three crosses and people are acting as if he was responsible for the loss.

7899~~~
He's been given bits and pieces of games and only when the team is in a mess. Its not his fault that Mcnair is crap and our manager keeps playing strikers in midfield, midfielders as strikers, attacking midfielders as wingers and wingers as fullbacks. We'll soon see Valdez upfront and Rooney as goalkeeper.

7900~~~
We were not supposed to sign a 60 million left footed Beckham wannabe... The player that we actually signed for his ability to get past players and cross the ball perfectly managed to do neither...

He looks completely lost and broken.

7901~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7902~~~
Di Maria hasn't done anything spectacular in 6 months, but yeah, let's make excuses for the man that we broke the Transfer Record for, Bale was playing badly Madrid fans were hard on him, he started playing well again, Ozil,Giroud,Hazard etc Di Maria? no, confidence mate, we cant criticise him.

7903~~~
Yep exactly. It's like he was the only one hitting shitty crosses. Far from it.

7904~~~
Criticize him all you want, but some of the reactions are embarrassing.

7905~~~
On the plus side, it's great that we can waste all that money on such a dud and not be completely screwed for the next transfer window.

7906~~~
Harsh. For one unlike our other attackers he shot when he could see the goal not as soon as there were 11 players directly in front of him. He beat his mean and didn't immediately stop, won corners, a few bad crosses? Well feck, might as well chuck our entire team out because there weren't many good ones today.

7907~~~
Just looks like he doesn't want to be here to me, even allowing for him beinf  off form he was absolutely shocking when he came on. 

The big worry about keeping hold of him for next year is that if he plays like this again we'll end up losing about £50m on him.

7908~~~
That's not unreasonable. Perhaps just say that next time instead of pinning a bad result on one player.

7909~~~
Still offered a whole lot more than your boy Angel, at least with Young we actually looked like we knew what we were doing and he wasn't giving the ball for a Goal Kick.

7910~~~
Excuses you mean?

7911~~~
Same to be honest. Though it felt like I was eating humble pie after last season and at the start of this season.

7912~~~
A player does not become so poor so quickly, especially when he looked fantastic at the start of the season. The team is currently too safe and it does not lend itself to any creativity. He hit a few shit crosses, but Young spent the whole game doing exactly the same and on the other side Mata did absolutely nothing. If it was just him playing shit then fair enough but for weeks now the wings have been poor.

7913~~~
knew what we were doing, as in crossing it into the box and looking for Fellaini. Inspirational stuff. I didn't excuse Di Maria's performance. I said he was shit.

7914~~~
Is there actually a significant amount of people doing that? There'll always be a few of course, but generally people are just saying that he had a poor game and wasted possession a lot of times. You're probably right that he was instructed to find Fellaini, but that doesn't really excuse the crosses that were nowhere near anyone. And even if he was instructed to find Fellaini, hoofing the ball up when he's on his own and marked by two players is just a poor idea.

A lot of the reactions also reflect the fact that people know what he's capable of. Despite his poor form, people still believe/hope he can set up a goal somehow. And he did have a very good cross shortly after he came on, but then it just went downhill.

7915~~~
Im simply said that he's not the one who costed the game. If we had to pin one guy than that guy would be Mcnair followed by LVG. Mcnair made the foul and he failed an open goal.

By no means, dont allow me to spoil the witchhunt against the Argie though.

7916~~~
He was despicably bad today, and made a fool of people like you who demanded he shouid be starting.

7917~~~
How do you come to that conclusion?

Based on that horrific performance, does anyone actually want to be here?

7918~~~
The same people have put up with Valencia's shit crossing for about 3 years

7919~~~
£60 million and he can't even cross a ball properly. He was really poor when he came on.

7920~~~
But the rest of our team did us proud, right?

7921~~~
Some people defend McNair, and some people, like you, defend Di Maria in everything.

7922~~~
Where have I said that he should start? To be fair it would have made sense of having him starting instead of having strikers in midfield, midfielders upfront, wingers as fullbacks and attacking midfielders in the flanks.

7923~~~
Knew what we were doing or just got the ball more as the most creative player/record signing and star man, whipping desperate crosses into the box, as he couldn't beat his man.

7924~~~
I'll say it again - this idea of shoving out of form players into the mix with 30 minutes to go hasn't worked all season and still isn't working. Van Gaal needs to realise that the way you build confidence isn't throwing someone on to save the game.

He's done it was Falcao, Di Maria and Januzaj all season and what happens? They all try to do too much and look dreadful. To be honest I don't totally blame them, their mindset is clearly: if I don't score, beat 4 men  or provide a miraculous assist I'll be back on the bench. 

Fergie did the same with Nani and it was just as unproductive.

7925~~~
It's unbelievable that this same man was MOTM in a CL final under a year ago. Unrecognisable.

7926~~~
Really poor. He got a bit better as the game went on, but it was too late. I think he needs a start (should have started against Chelsea IMO), and not come on when we are right up against it. I imagine his confidence is already low, so it's difficult to see him having an immediate impact.

Still, he pulled several stinkers today. Just basic stuff. But I'd still like to see him start against Palace. For all his mistakes, he's still the one player who can make something happen form very little. We just haven't seen it in a while.

7927~~~
Sack the whole team then. Crossing hasn't been a strong point for years, yet we still try it more than most.

7928~~~
Still better than Mata who again failed to show up. At least he is trying to create sth

7929~~~
would be quite relaxed if he goes to PSG, even if we take a 10-15m hit.

7930~~~
The club need to find out right at the start of the summer if he wants to be here. Any hint he doesn't, get rid.

His performances might be giving us the answer anyway.

7931~~~
Exactly, this reaction here is bewildering. He came on as a sub into a team that wasn't creating any good chances.. And had the audacity to lose the ball a few times. Lost us the frigging game I tells you.

7932~~~
Not really. Start reading my posts and you will know me better. I dont have any bias for anybody. If a player doesn't perform than he should leave irrespective if he's British (the new Edwards for example), Irish (Mcfail and OShit) or has an exotic name (Rafael, Fabio, fat Ando etc).

However you can't judge a player who is barely given any chances and than he's thrown in a deep pan in a team which have no stability at all.

7933~~~
We should just fill the team with 11 hard working players and sit happily in mid table. That'll show them mercenaries who don't start games and can't win them for us when they come on because the rest aren't good enough.

7934~~~
Wanted him to start today, but wow he was terrible. So slack and careless with all his passing and touch. The criticism was harsh earlier in the season but since he got the red card against Arsenal he has been really, really bad.

7935~~~
His confidence is absolutely shot to pieces. I don't think it can go any lower. He's struggling to get the basics right.

7936~~~
That's an absolutely atrocious post. What the hell has the performance of a teenage academy product defender got to do with what we should expect from the most expensive player in the history of the Premier League? You're embarrassing yourself. Seriously.

7937~~~
Was poor but its stupid to play him on the left. Unless we start playing him in defence, that's the worst way to use him. Di Maria playing to swing crosses in. Stupid.

7938~~~
Had some really, REALLY sloppy moments.

That being said, he got involved and tried to do create something on his own instead of just passing on responsibility like a lot of our other players did today

7939~~~
I don't remember everything he did, however, off the top of my head - one of his corners actually managed to reach our player unlike Young's and Mata's who were woeful on set pieces. He also managed to get a shot on target - something most of our other creative players failed to do. Then we have his three failed crosses, the first two were quite simply mishit and the last reeks of a lack of confidence. If anything, I see a player trying desperately to prove himself. He gets the ball, instantly looks up and tries to find a man. Yes, some of his crosses were absolute shite. But the ENTIRE team were guilty of playing like shite. The bashing he gets is unwarranted.

One of the reasons his performance stick out like a sore thumb is because he's quite literally the only player who's not risk averse. The rest of our team spent most of that game passing sideways which is why their performances don't seem as bad as they don't "waste" the ball, and at the same time don't create anything, too.

7940~~~
I'd be ecstatic if that happened now.  I think he is technically brilliant, up there with the likes of Mata, but mentally he is not strong enough to fight for this team.  He'll do well when he is surrounded by stars like he was at  Madrid, when he isn't relied on as the main man, he was a very brilliant cog in an already well oiled machine.

7941~~~
Did you miss the bit were he failed to pick out a teammate with his every touch?

7942~~~
We paid double what he was worth, he isn't in the same class as the best players in the league and the expectations are too high. He is always going to be hit and miss, especially as a winger and if there is any truth to him wanting to leave then he should be moved on.

7943~~~
"It looks like.....to me"

I suspect when he was fecked out the door at Real his options were limited and he ended up here because we had the cash. 

Just a suspiscion, ordinarily I'd say a player needs at least a season before you even start to judge (see my posts on Fellani from last year) but its not exactly an ordinary transfer and the 'drop in form' is up there with the worst I can ever remember.

7944~~~
Let him go to PSG, his confidence is shot and cant see it recovering before the end of the season.

7945~~~
Bag of nerves, his confidence couldn't be any lower. Might as well send him away on his summer holidays and start fresh next season.

7946~~~
You want to play him where, on the right ?

7947~~~
I don't care about the fee. Once he wears the shirt he's our player irrespective if he costed us 60m or nothing. You may not notice but when West Brom were gifted with that foul they didn't say 'let us not score because the person who gifted us with that foul is an academy product defender whose pretty crap in football'

Di Maria is struggling and considering our system and the amount of game given I can't blame him completely for it.

7948~~~
Oh, another one who's mind was made up weeks ago.

7949~~~
He always seems to rush things and lacks a cool head in the crucial moments. At this point you wonder why we let Nani go out on loan and spent 60 million on an inferior player but thats hindsight tbh

7950~~~
Looks like an imposter at the moment! 

Can't believe this is the same player we signed. The basics of football seem beyond him at this moment in time. Can't pass to a team mate, can't hold the ball, can't cross. He's in horrific form. I still believe he can be a success but we may have to wait until next year for that... if he's still here. The whole second half of the season has been a write off for him.

7951~~~
For those defending this bag of shite he was signed to be our maque player, to rescue a game, to add inspiration and for £60m. Get a grip and accept he's been nothing short of a complete and utter flop. We need to get as much money as we can for him. 

In fact today I actually thought I wonder if he's being that bad because he wants to go.

7952~~~
I'd prefer if it was nerves as that would mean he gives a shit

7953~~~
Sure, and if you look in other threads you'll find similar criticism. This, however, is the Di Maria thread, and if you don't want to see him being criticised you probably shouldn't enter the thread after a poor performance.

7954~~~
Confidence affects everybody

7955~~~
He should never be deployed on the left. If that's where we plan to play him long term, we ACTUALLY SHOULD sell him to PSG and take the money.

7956~~~
Has he played well once since the break-in at his house? He just looks distracted everytime he comes on.

7957~~~
Anything upwards of 30m for him would be perfect, i don't see it happening though.

7958~~~
John Carver, is that you?

7959~~~
Today? Where RVP was playing. Van Gaal should simply have taken off Rooney or Falcao. 

In general, he should be employed through the middle or on the right. Never on the left.

Can you imagine Hazard playing on the right for Chelsea?

7960~~~
And your mind was also made up as you always defend Di Maria. Yes, you said he was shit today, but you always come up with a defence for him.

7961~~~
He makes it very hard to say anything positive about him

If he wants to stay great but he has to improve so much it's not even funny

7962~~~
Wake up pal and accept this lad doesn't want to be here. Worst player on the park bar none.

7963~~~
Blame the manager for that, same for Januzaj, 2 flair players not allowed to play and express themselves.

7964~~~
If we paid 60mil for Di Maria the left winger, all those who sanctioned the move should be booted out of the club. Di Maria too should be sold on.

7965~~~
Not really, he doesn't start games and his confidence is shot. Best for all parties if he just leaves. Bring Nani back and move on.

7966~~~
Let's not delude ourselves here. With his £60million(<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>) price tag, he is one of the biggest transfer flops of all time as it stands. 

Every week we think he's going to pick it up and perform but he never does. So frustrating because we all know what he is capable of.

7967~~~
woeful!

I'd write him off until next season, give him a full pre season and put this season down to settling in, if there isn't a dramatic improvement in the first couple of months next year then take the hit and move him on in January.

7968~~~
We didn't break the transfer record for Valencia...

7969~~~
He was embarrassingly bad on multiple occasions and I understand why van Gaal doesn't play him but he still created the best chance of the game. Mata's much less likely to do something incredibly stupid and disrupt the rhythm of the team but he's creating absolutely nothing at the moment, and with Young on the other side for balance we're so blunt in attack that I do think di María's moments of frustration are worth putting up with.

7970~~~
He needs to play central and be given free role.

But that then messes up Van Gaal's keep ball and 80% posession philosophy. He is risk taker and will lose it on few occasions.

7971~~~
Compare the criticism. 

If someone hadn't watched the game and simply read the forum, there's a good chance they'd assume that di Maria was at fault for the loss.

7972~~~
He intentionally misses a lot of things to boost his argument.

7973~~~
Yes I'm sure ronaldo would struggle to play on the left wing!!

7974~~~
Some sense, but that doesn't really belong in here at the moment. Young + Mata on the wings with Fellaini off a striker will not get us very far.

7975~~~
Like? Young's blistering performance, Mata's created chances and Fellaini's dominant performances?

7976~~~
He should be starting. Even when he is shit he creates chances while others just dick around and defer responsibility.

7977~~~
£60 million for a one-dimensional player and the #7 shirt.....im sick to my stomach.

7978~~~
Atleast try and make some sense. 

The equivalent would be paying 100mil for Ronaldo and then deploy him as a right winger with the job to beat his man and put glorious crosses in.

7979~~~
Your constant need to slag off homegrown players is beyond tedious, incredibly annoying and UTTERLY irrelevant in a thread about Angel fecking DiMaria.

7980~~~
Yep given them room to roam freely behind the strikers. Express themselves fully even if it means losing possession few times.

Screw this we need to dominate posession shit.

7981~~~
Hasn't done enough to warrant a start, doesn't have the right mentality or ability to influence the games enough - what's the point of having him in the team? He's not even able to do the basics right FFS! His performance today was up there with Bebe's. It's only a matter of time before pity turns to anger!

7982~~~
Angel Di Maria was really poor today but when I think about it more, one of the reasons he excelled at madrid was because they played a counter attacking style of football where he had the likes of Benzema, Ronaldo..etc who are all extremely quick and technically proficient and complement Di Maria's attributes on the counter. You don't make Di Maria play possession based football with very little creative freedom. You don't wait for the opponent defence to re-organize themselves and put in a lazy cross. You play quick one-two's, be creative and play Di Maria into space where he can run with ball and take on defenders. Granted he still failed to do the basics of football today, it comes of no surprise to see Di Maria's deterioration in such a short period of time if Van Gaal has been practicing his philosophy of static possession based football all year long which just makes me doubt Van Gaal's choice to sign him in the first place. Shockingly underwhelming season given his reputation and ability. Hope we find a solution that works best for all parties.

7983~~~
I don't know exactly what's the problem here, he started the season really well, his passing and vision were brilliant. Hopefully next season will see him shine like evra and vidic.

7984~~~
I know he's not shit but he's really been playing the part for a few months now. Hasn't looked particularly interested for a while either.

Not sure what to do with him, especially as Young and Mata haven't been justifying their starts during the losing streak.

7985~~~
He will never justify his price tag playing as a left winger. Regardless of how well he overcomes his obvious drop in form. He isn't capable of being a 60mil worth left winger.

7986~~~
And? He still plays every week and weakens us.

7987~~~
Almost felt sorry for him. 

Looked like a young player out of his depth, completely in awe of his surroundings. 

Then you remember it's Di Maria. 

fecking bizarre.

7988~~~
I can't believe people are using the fact that he was terrible coming off the bench as a reason he should be starting games.

7989~~~
I seriously don't care how many times he loses the ball or does something stupid in games like this. At least he's trying something and ends up creating a proper chance almost every game. I'd much rather see that than see us take 30 touches to pass the ball from side to side.

His confidence is gone at the moment and we only have ourselves to blame for that. We should start him and put up with his sloppiness because the upside of him getting some form back is a lot higher than what Young or Mata can produce.

7990~~~
Exactly. He was never a great winger at Madrid.

Absurd if LVG paid 60 million to play him as a curtailed Left Winger in a possesion based team.


His best season easily came central in a AM role in a fast counter attacking team where he upped the tempo.

7991~~~
I just don't get posters like you that try to defend a player that should have made the difference between finishing 4th, 5th or 6th to actually challenging. The guy has been utter shite.

7992~~~
I can't believe people are using the fact he's only coming on later in a game and should never play for us again because he failed to win it for us.

7993~~~
So what do you think? Should we sell him now while he's 27 and we can still get decent money or do we keep him?

7994~~~
No, but maybe because he was shit?

7995~~~
Or three

7996~~~
At least this will teach people a lesson that spending boatloads of money doesn't translate to success.

7997~~~
Atleast those 3 players have managed to give us 3 exceptional/match winning performances in the last 7 months.

7998~~~
Jesus Christ. Why is it so hard for people to discuss one player in a thread dedicated to that player, without mentioning other players? Anyone who can fail such a basic IQ test shouldn't be allowed to post anymore.

7999~~~
I don't get posters like you who see everything in black or white. He's not been good, I have said so in my posts already. I won't repeat it every single post. Our use of him is absolutely pathetic though. You do not pay 60mil for Di Maria and then play him on the left. All it would have taken today was Van Gaal showing his famous balls and taking off one of Rooney or Fellaini.

8000~~~
Alright, lets close down the internet. Pogue has spoken. Lets not compare players ever again.

8001~~~
You don't become a shit player overnight. He's quality. He just needs more time to adapt and he'll set the PL alight.

8002~~~
Blows my mind too.

8003~~~
Keep him ofcourse. You do not sell a player like him without giving him the best possible chance to shine. Play him either centrally or on the right.

8004~~~
He will NEVER set the PL alight, be honest with yourself..

8005~~~
So please tell me where would you play him where he's not already been played and proven to be shite?

8006~~~
The logic though.

8007~~~
CM ideally, we have the entire team designed to keep the ball. I dont see why having someone like him with the license to run with it or go for the killer balls is such a big problem. We keep the ball 70% of the game anyways, I'd rather we keep it 60% but take more risks. 

If not, on the right in the role that Mata plays for us.

8008~~~
Fecking hell, you simply cannot judge him on this performance. His confidence is shot plus he comes on at a moment were we are going desperado because yet again we have been sucker punched, not an easy mission for anyone to turn around coming of the bench.

8009~~~
Did you not see his CM performances earlier in the season, then?

8010~~~
I slag players whom I believe that they are not good enough irrespective if they are homegrown or not. I probably slagged Ando more than anyone else and he's Brazilian.

But there again let us put the blame on someone who played just 30 minutes and protect the one who gave a weak foul which costed us the goal and failed to score an open goal.

8011~~~
If he doesn't win games for us in his cameos then he simply has to go, or something like that.

8012~~~

8013~~~
Left back?

8014~~~
We've been judging him on his performances dating back to November.

8015~~~
In the changing room.

8016~~~
Nobody is "putting the blame" on him. We're discussing his performance. Look at the title of the thread ffs.

8017~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8oNXfOjWgk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8018~~~
Except Young, Rooney, Mata, Fellaini were abolsutely rubbish, today; and based on the last three performances, we wouldn't be any worse with di Maria starting. 

You do realise that we haven't scored in 280 minutes, conceded 7 and lost three.

8019~~~
LvG has to take a bit of the blame here. He should've been playing AdM more consistently and giving him a few starts in recent weeks.

8020~~~
His confidence is shot and he looks clueless to what LVG wants him to do, it's a real square peg in round hole situation.

No doubt he will go somewhere else in the summer and then get back to his Madrid form.

8021~~~
Yes, only winning the game for us would have been acceptable. Nothing less <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Feck me, the idiocy in this thread...

8022~~~
It was a 2/10 performance from him really and yet he still, out of nowhere, came as close as anybody did to levelling the match for us. And that's why we will be patient with him.

8023~~~
Well last season in the las 6 months and from the moment Ancelotti played him as an hybrid CM-LM, he has played on the left, in a role not very free.

Di Maria isn't a central player and doesn't thrive in a free role, he played there for Mourinho and wasn't great. Di Maria is a wide player who sometimes will come inside.
He played centrally against weak teams, but against strong opposition and therefore the games that caught everyone eyes he played on the left, the CL final is a good example of that.

8024~~~
I'd ask you whether you've ever watched him play CM if you think he's as ineffective there as he's out on the left. There's a reason why neither his national team nor Real deployed him as a left winger with the job to ping crosses in on a regular basis.

8025~~~
Played his way out of the team with his primadonna play and careless attitude, which I said could happen when we signed him. Where's all the feckers gone that told me he was a guaranteed success when we signed him?

Right now his confidence is shot as a result of all this and his time on the bench. If we want him to get through it we need to just play him and let him get it out of his head. Unfortunately it's too late in the season with a lot at stake.

This is why I'd rarely touch a Madrid player or spend huge on one player.

8026~~~
Well we certainly weren't any better in the 30 minutes he did play.

8027~~~
Absolutely, but making it seem like Di Maria is significantly better isn't going to help matters, Young played better than him today.

8028~~~
He's no where near the quality of player as mata ( who is played out of position in RM). As for CM who's he going to displace Herrera?

8029~~~
What's the opposite of strong on the ball?

8030~~~
I can't remember when was the last time we played well when Di Maria started. He's been such a bad signing for us.

8031~~~
But he'd have done a better job if we'd have given him 60 more minutes = Logic.

8032~~~
His role in the Real side when he played in the middle and kept going either wide to the left or straight ahead was absolutely different to what we ask of him. The best use of Di Maria isnt to have him stuck out wide looking to ping crosses in. He could do a job there but that's not what we've paid 60mil for.

8033~~~
Heh. You accuse me of not watching his performances for his national team. Ironic. Dig out some videos of his last few games for Argentina and pay attention to the position he plays, then get back to me.

8034~~~
I dont care about the title. Most of you are going to tough on a player who played just 30 minutes and nearly scored a goal. I wouldn't even blame it on the guy who made the foul either. If I had to blame someone Ill blame the one who players strikers in midfield, midfielders as strikers and defenders, wingers as fullbacks etc. We'll soon see DDG upfront. Actually no, we'll soon see him at Real by the look of it.

8035~~~
I just can't believe what I am seeing from this guy, I feel he has to stay just to be given another chance to show us that he really isn't this bad, it's almost laughable at time.

I do think though that he is best left out of the squad for the last games, he is clearly not an impact sub, and LvG refuses to start him, tbh I'd rather see Janujaz, or Pereria coming on in situations like today at the moment.

8036~~~
Problem is he's been pretty junk for quite a while now

8037~~~
Heh. Sure I will and then get back to you.

8038~~~
Yep, there's no difference between starting a game and joining it 60 mins in whilst already a goal down.

8039~~~
LVG is to blame, his bought in a players who he doesn't know what to do with!

Di Maria needs to start and shown confidence in not letting rot on the bench!

8040~~~
You cannot seriously play him as CM as if and most certainly when he loses the ball the opposition have a straight run at our very fragile defence.

8041~~~
Nobody is blaming anybody!!! We're discussing his frigging performance!!! The clue is in the title of the thread!!!

Jesus wept...

8042~~~
Di Maria has nowhere near the quality of Mata? Ok.

He doesnt have to displace Herrera. Vs a side like West Brom, we can play both Herrera and Di Maria in CM along with a more defensive CM.

8043~~~
Being a total pussy?

To be blunt, that's what he is at the moment.

8044~~~
He has started enough games for us and been very poor in most of them.

8045~~~
He's too weak and isn't physical enough for the Premier League. What a terrible signing.

8046~~~
Then you and I didn't watch the same game. We were far better when he came on, whether he was responsible for it, I'm not sure. But we looked more likely to score when he was on the pitch. After all, he created our best opening (one of?) - the cross to McNair was something the rest failed to do.

In 30 minutes, he managed a shot on goal, one key pass, one dribble and 3 shit crosses. Definitely not as crap as people are making out to be.

8047~~~
I don't see why that'l happen when he'd have both Herrera and Carrick playing with him. I'd not advocating a middle 2 of Di Maria and Herrera ffs.

8048~~~
I honestly don't think Young has been all that good. For his standards Young has been good but from a purely objective view, I think Young has been okay to good. The fact that this Ashley Young is keeping di Maria out the team, and quite comfortably is worrying. I genuinely believed that all he needed was a good half an hour and di Maria would get back in the team. The lad's been extremely sloppy and he's so frustrating.

8049~~~
It must be tough for him considering the last 3 games he has came in to play were when we were in losing positions with only 20-30 mins left to play.

8050~~~
Not like we weren't playing the same way or anything.

8051~~~
He's had a disappointing season for us. I think patience will pay off.

8052~~~
The main difference is that the player coming off the bench needs to show the manager why he should start the next game. What Mata and Hererra did, basically. If he can't do that, well, he's lucky to even get 30 minutes tbh.

8053~~~
Some players take a season to find their feet. I'm fine with giving him more time. So many fans are short-sighted and forget that he's truly world class. 

A few games ago we were going to dominate Europe and were the new Barca. Now we're abysmal. Take a few deep breaths, relax, and realise that the guy will get back to his normal standard sooner rather than later.

8054~~~
He needs to get in the weight room. Maybe a session with Tony V?!

8055~~~
Wonder if you guys would sell him to us. If it meant getting Bale, maybe?

8056~~~
No he didn't. Considering Young is in form, full of confidence and starting every game, that performance was not great, at all and not better than di Maria's. It was just as bad, if not worse, given that he started the game.

8057~~~
If we take that avenue, he will be sold to PSG and the money will serve in financing a Bale transfer.

8058~~~
Normal standard of inconsistency?
Forget that he's truly World Class or had one World Class season?

8059~~~
Bingo. Young's gone to shite for the last two or three games and Di Maria somehow managed to make it not quite a no brainer to start him in our next game. Which is amazing really.

8060~~~
Today was one of the first times all season where I've felt like he just doesn't want to be here. Chasing a game, everyone working their socks off and his touch and passing was just so careless and sloppy and lazy. People know I defend him more often then not because of what he's capable of but fecking hell, the sloppiness of his passing towards the end of today was ridiculous.

8061~~~
And yet against Palace, you'll see this thread bumped again asking why he's on the bench when he's exactly the type of player we need in that game and then he'll come on and do his best impression of Bebe. So many Di Maria apologists. He's been poorly handled but let's not try to paint Di Maria as being unlucky. He's just been shit, to put it frank.

8062~~~
Mata and Herrera came off the bench and improved us? Must have missed that one. Can't really remember any of our subs making a big impact this season. I thought they just got to start games eventually and were kept in the team for playing well.

8063~~~
Will they be able to afford Di Maria if they also sign Pogba which is looking more and more likely? Or do they just not give a feck about FFP?

8064~~~
Did you watch the first half...at all? Not saying Young was great, but he was a better player.

8065~~~
From what I've seen of Di Maria in a United shirt. he's not fit to lace, wilsons boots let alone displace mata.

8066~~~
Been bang out of form since the City game. Depressing that Di Maria hasn't been able to make a better fist of displacing him from the team.

8067~~~
As I said earlier in the season, he is no different to Nani. Capable of world class performances but also capable of what we saw tonight. If you want the rainbow you have to put up with the rain. It's well and truly pissing it down at the moment.

8068~~~
Ok.

8069~~~
Mata - Crystal Palace
Herrera - pretty much all his performances from the bench.

8070~~~
Did you watch the first half? What on earth did Young do to have you call his performance good?

8071~~~
If Di Maria had played like Young the CAF would be so excited and building all sorts of expectations. Accept it Youngs a decent winger and Di Maria isn't and imho Di Maria can't play CM with our current squad.

8072~~~
He certainly did enough to be better than Di Maria was today.

8073~~~
My thing is, Young isnt actually offering that much more. And Di Maria needs the little confidence boost I think. Thats why I think he needs to start, he is low on confidence and keeps being brought on to rescue games. 

He is in absolute shite form though, I almost feel sorry for him. Then remember that he is earning a shit load of money and needs to sort it out.

8074~~~
Why not start di Maria and help him regain his confidence? He's been thrown on when we've been 1-0 down, 2-0 down and 1-0 down, and is somehow expected to completely change games where the entire team has been absolutely sh*t. He's not a miracle worker.

8075~~~
Did any of the players who started today justify that selection?

8076~~~
Your standards must be really low.

8077~~~
Ages ago. They were both out the team for ages, came back in for starts and have been in there since. Coming on late chasing a game is completely different to starting one. Especially when you are expected to deliver each time. Most of our subs this season have come on and made minimal impact.

8078~~~
For me, young is a mediocre winger. He's done well, but even at his best, I don't think he's lit the place apart. Never been a huge fan of di Maria but he's a better winger, but he's not showed it for some time. Agreed, he can't and in all honesty, I don't ever want to see him playing CM for us.

8079~~~
Most of them were decent, Rooney and Di Maria by far the worst though. Di Maria was just awful when he came on and just looked like he didn't care. And I never bring shit like that up and tend to defend Di Maria, but his crossing and passing was so lazy and careless. Everyone else was putting in effort, apart from him really.

8080~~~
DDG's first season, easily bullied and intimidated, not strong enough to cope with the pressure, not vocal enough, not commanding enough, needs to bulk up, etc, etc. 

I view Di Maria in similar terms. He's a fantastic footballer who is all over the place right now, but he will get it right eventually and be back to the player we bought from Madrid.

8081~~~
I missed some of the first half but it's fair if say he rated Young as a 4/10 and di Maria as a 3/10.

I agree that Young has not been good. However even despite this Di Maria isn't even showing enough to justifying an out of form Young

8082~~~
Of course not. Did anyone coming off the bench make a case for starting ahead of them?

That's the killer. You want competition for places. Not replacing shite with shite, in case they might be a different kind of shite. The most expensive player in the history of top flight English footba and the best reason we can find to start him
is because he, hopefully, can't be any worse than the present incumbent? That's a diabolical state of affairs to find ourselves in.

8083~~~
Some will disagree with me, but I think we should cash in on him whilst we can, before we lose out on too much money. He's never been a great winger. His best season came as a centre midfielder (LCM) and unless Van Gaal is looking to play him there next season, then I see no point in keeping him. 

40M from PSG and go all out to sign Bale or Reus.

8084~~~
He just needs (like most of our attacking players) to be allowed to do his own thing in the final third rather than have his every movement micro managed by LVG.

Our slow, languid build up approach does not suit ADM at all.

This guy would have been legendary under Ferguson.

8085~~~
PSG's attempt will be the second in as many summer transfer windows. There is someone over there who is willing to pay the fee and feel a need for a Di Maria. Of course, I also think this is where Cavani will be shipped off first (and hopefully not to us). For Pogba, I don't think he would leave Juventus nor PSG would have any room for him unless they get rid of someone among their midfielders first.

I dunno how much RM would ask us for Bale, but I would also keep both eyes open on Marco Reus if we can fully take advantage of the disintegrating Borussia Dortmund following Klopp's departure.

8086~~~
Stop trying to change the argument, we aren't  arguing about a great performance, we are comparing Young's "ok" performance to Di Maria's "ok" performance, Young was better today and Young wasn't really at his best, the whole team was shit...Di Maria on the other hand did nothing in 30 minutes to warrant a starting place, it is quite sad that you cant make a case for our Star Man/WC player being significantly better than members of our slightly below average squad.

But yeah lets scrape the barrel to make a case for Di Maria - pathetic.

8087~~~
You did well then, buddy. That first half was so incredibly boring. We were really poor; everyone was. Given the different circumstances for the players, Young should be performing better than di Maria, but he's not. The fact that di Maria managed to create as many chances as Young illustrates that their performances were quite similar.

8088~~~
Possession is pointless if ya cant make goals from it. The opposition have cracked the LVG system, just put men behind the ball and United cant deal with it.

8089~~~
It doesn't matter when it happened, Herrera and Mata both made magic happen from the bench and deserved to start when they did, Di Maria on the other hand hasn't done anything spectacular in 7 months and has been terrible from the bench which has left the campaign for him to start relatively weak, the only reason Di Maria doesn't deserve to start, he should though as the others have done feck all.

8090~~~
We are definitely not getting 40m for Di Maria.

8091~~~
Not really today, but generally I think he has, yes. 

I also think he'd benefit from a run in the team and from the confidence that comes from starting games. It's a bit of a chicken & egg situation in that he needs that belief before we'll see the best of him and 30 mins from the bench isn't going to lead to that. 

We had the same problem with Nani, he showed that a run in the team would reap rewards but people would have no patience and spit their dummies out after lacklustre sub showings. 

Sometimes players need more than cameos to shown their worth.

8092~~~
We paid 37M for Mata when he wasn't playing for Chelsea.

8093~~~
In di Maria's ok performance he managed to take a corner and have it reach a player. Young, on the other hand, failed to take one successful corner. Young also had 3 shots, all off target; di Maria had 1 shot, 1 shot on target. Young played 90 minutes and di Maria played 30 minutes, yet their productivity was the same. With regards to possession, Young had a 90% PA compared to di Maria's 81%, however, I don't care for high possession stats, as we've held 70%, 65% and 80%, respectively, in our last three games and not scored a goal. But yeah lets bang on about how di Maria gave the ball away more than everyone else, because that's what cost us the game.

8094~~~
Thats the United way.

8095~~~
Think it a bit complex with Di Maria. The fee we paid for him was simply too much, PL seems to be physical for him at the moment and he was rightly dropped. We're a better team without him on the pitch, Young has done very well since he came into the team and that has led to Di Maria being sidelined, which seems to have destroyed his confidence. To top it off, him and his family are rumoured to be having issues settling into Manchester. 

He's a good player but I don't think our playing style will suit him and so far it seems PL isn't the right league for him. If PSG come in for him then I would let him go. Sometimes it happens, some players don't work out in one team while they do well for another team in a different league. 

Shame really, I was very happy when we got him.

8096~~~
Christ the hatred thats appeared in this thread.

Go to threadmarks, click Man United vs QPR 4-0 and read the  page below it.

The contrast is  bigger than Falcaos.

I feel ADM is not suited to the EPL now, either that or he is a mercenary.

8097~~~
The club won't sell him after just one season for less than £50 million.

8098~~~
Were the crowd giving it to him today during the match? I thought I heard a few unpleasant words

8099~~~
Also this.

8100~~~
True.

8101~~~
HOORAY!

The stats people will bring up to make a case for Di Maria against Hazard? no , Sanchez? no, Fabregas? no.....surely Jordan Henderson? no ....Ashley Young.

Pathetic!

8102~~~
Then i guess we're stuck with him.

8103~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8104~~~
Depressing as it may sound, it was also our best most clear cut chance of the game (apart from the penalty). Pity it fell to Mcnair.

8105~~~
No pathetic is the performance I've just witnessed from our team. And pathetic is the garbage I've read in this thread.

8106~~~
He was overpriced, he can't really play in the position that he thrived in last year, his overall style doesn't seem a natural fit for LVG's philosophy, he had a difficult time settling in to England and his confidence looks seriously shook.

Both he and LVG will have to do an immense amount of work in the summer to stop this being a disastrous signing. If either party isn't up for it then selling him isn't unlikely....

8107~~~
If we are lucky Martino doesn't select him this summer.

8108~~~
Wasteful today, and too often this season. Annoying thing was that he didn't seem too bothered to have wasted the chances today. I know I want to see a bit of emotion when chasing the game.

8109~~~
Pathetic is you bringing up a stat like
To defend a player that broke the British Transfer record against a player like Ashley Young who seems to be working his ass off for a team that he shouldn't even still be in, Ashley Young is not the future....Di Maria is, i could give a feck about a bad game from Ashley Young but a bad game where he looked more dangerous than Di Maria? that is rock bottom.

8110~~~
He actually came the closest to scoring too with that shot. He was actually more dangerous than Ashley Young in terms of end product which is why I think we should play him into form.

8111~~~
Goodness me he was so bad today. I'm a big Di Maria fan but that was an embarrassing performance. I really wanted him to start today but I'm not even sure what I want after that.

8112~~~
When we were winning (in our previous games) and he came on, the argument was that he was coming on, after the game was won and we didnt want/need to score.
Now you are saying its tough for him to come on, when we need to score?
You cant have it both ways.

In any case, today, I think he played well. I'm not a fan of his, but when he came on, he was taking pop shots on goal and pinging the ball into the penalty area. It is our strikers which need to deal with the ball, once it arrives in the penalty box. Before he came on, we were stroking the ball across the penalty box and making very little attempt to shoot. In the first half, Mata did almost 100% back/side passes, which was reason enough to have taken him off, but LVG was happy as it maintained possession. Di Maria came on and immediately wanted to push the ball forward and made shooting attempts.

With the exception of RVP and Di Maria, today, our entire team was too careful (to maintain possession). Rather than shoot - they chose to back/side pass.
In contrast, the moment WBA got the ball, they headed for our goal, which automatically caused us problems (they either got a free kick or a corner). No defender likes to see the ball coming towards their own goal at speed.

8113~~~
Pathetic is the fact that the stat exists. 

I defend him because I see past the stupid fee. I also know what it's like to be involved in an incident similar to his. Something similar happened to be and completely screwed up my undergrad, without me even realising. His confidence must be down the drain, and he's obviously aware given the grunting from our fans when he kept failing at his crosses.

People never seem to learn. The same happened with Fellaini, Young, Vidic, Evra and several (probably hundreds) other players. They all struggled to cope with the league and/or the team. di Maria is suffering from something similar, but because you spent £60m on him, why should he be afforded time, right?

8114~~~
Still maintain that the fans are actually going easy on him.

8115~~~
But wait................he came closet to putting the ball in the net and created our clearest chance for McNair...........did he not?

8116~~~
The only good games he's played for us were his first three. He's been crap ever since, though he has at least been providing assists. Today was the worst of the lot though.

8117~~~
I will admit that I was a great believer in high possession football, but after having 80% possession (almost a record) and scoring zero goals, I have come to the conclusion that possession football just doesnt work in the EPL.
Especially when Chelsea (best team in the country) were comfortable/happy with 30% possession and won the game.

8118~~~
... Compare this thread to others. He's pretty much the main culprit for the loss.

8119~~~
Exactly, Chelsea 30%, Everton 35% and WBA 25% yet all beat us. I don't care if it was by luck or not. Ironically, against Spurs, Pool and City we had 52%, 58% and 58, respectively; all lower than in our last three games, yet managed to win all three. Key was we seemed to be taking a few more risks. Now we seem to be content with holding the ball and doing nothing with it.

8120~~~
Star Man
Record Signing
#7
World Class player
£60m fee

Do you actually blame the fans for coming to vent on his thread after expecting so much? but yeah its only on this thread, the media hasnt exactly pounced on him unlike Ozil and he isn't getting any stick anywhere else.

8121~~~
This set of statistics say it all, to be honest.

8122~~~
It was painful to see him play today. Class player but clearly not in the right frame of mind at the moment.

8123~~~
Hasn't started since Arsenal FA cup game.
Devoid of confidence.
Plays 10-30 minute cameos.
Not a miracle worker.
Cannot raise the performances of our entire team.

Does the context not matter with this guy?

8124~~~
Not like he is playing exceptionally well and the whole team is letting him down or anything.

8125~~~
We should stop. We've been at it, in this thread, for a while. It's about time we shook hands (e-hands?) and got on with our lives... till next week, of course.

8126~~~
whereas Valencia's signature move is to stop dead with the ball and do an impression of a statue, Di Maria's seems to be lamping long diagonal crossed into packed boxes from way too far out.

8127~~~
I think my 10 year old nephew is stronger on the ball than him. I thought Blind was bad but at least he tries to be physical.

8128~~~
Seen a few people say this, without one iota of evidence to back it up.

Legendary like Veron, do you mean?

8129~~~
Pathetic.

8130~~~
Like Veron? Such a baseless statement. The notion that everything would have been great under Ferguson is something the lot of you NEED to break away from, it's pathetic now.

8131~~~
Like pretty much most of the time this season he tried a lot but failed with most of it. 

On the one hand I feel it's refreshing to have player in the team who will try the unexpected but on the other hand it's frustrating that he only pulls it off in 1 out of 10 attempts.

8132~~~
Shame the keeper saved his shot as that could have been the turning point for him, a bit like Fellaini had. Wasn't too be though. It's weird how he seems so much off the wavelength of the other players.

8133~~~
Except Ferguson managed to get the best out Nani, Young, Valencia - who are all wingers. Isn't di Maria a winger?

8134~~~
As was Bebe, Obertan  and Luke Chadwick. The idea that Fergie + winger = guaranteed success is seriously naive.

For the record, we saw the best and worst of Nani under Fergie. By the end of his reign Nani was no less marginalised than Di Maria is now.

8135~~~
So it's pathetic to think that ADM would have thrived under the more attack minded Ferguson?

Veron was a deep lying playmaker that was shoe horned into attacking midfielder position that he wasn't suited to. He was a case of right player but at the wrong time.

The only thing that Veron and ADM have in common is their nationality!

8136~~~
Awful examples, Nani hasnt worked underLVG yet, Young has been better for definite, and you could argue since being a slumping right winger when SAF left, he has improved as a right back.

Not only are you wrong about the original notion, but also all of your examples to back that up...

8137~~~
Fergie managed to get the best out of Valencia and Ashley Young? didnt he also get the worst out of them lot as well?

8138~~~
We know SAF got the best out of all attacking midfielders like Kagawa... I wouldnt have phrased it pathetic, but delusional would have been my terming.

8139~~~
Were Bebe, Obertan and Chadwick man of the match in a CL final? (Yes I brought up the past)

I'm not one of those who argue that he would have brought the best out of di Maria, however, it isn't far fetched to assume that Ferguson, the greatest manager of all time (one of), could have had one of the best players of 13/14 playing at a completely different level to what he is now.

8140~~~
Maybe legendary was a tad over the top. I was merely stating that he'd flourish under a more attack minded coach (like Ferguson) that's all. 

The guy was one of the best players in the world last season and is now suddenly shite?

8141~~~
If Fergie can't get the best out of someone, I would argue that nobody can. My beef is with the crazy idea that Di Maria's poor season is something that can only be due to Van Gaal. No reason to assume that's the case. Almost as though people have forgotten his underwhelming campaigns when he was still at Madrid. Two years ago, not one person on here would have wanted us to sign him. And that was when Fergie was still in charge.

8142~~~
Read your post again, you'll find out what's wrong with it. I won't do it for you. You can defend Di Maria and blame everyone bar him for his shitty performances, however, the HARD evidence before our very eyes remains that he has been shit for a long time now. Go have a look at Chelsea, Arsenal and City and see what their marquee players [you know them] do, they make the team look better than it actually is, why can't Di Maria do that? The worst is you're lauding him for simple thing such as finding a man with a corner kick, seriously? All I see is a player who's hitting one poor cross after the other. We would have killed Nani for serving up this level of shitness.

8143~~~
Wouldn't be the first player to be a one season wonder and, let's be honest, last season was a bit of a contrast to his overall career so far. 

I'm still hopeful it's teething problems but blaming the manager is being far too lenient on the player himself.

8144~~~
Agreed. 

LVG's micro management of the players every move on the pitch has hindered not only Di Maria but most of our team this season.

Do we honestly think that special players like Ronaldo, Messi, Suarez, Bale etc are micro managed? Or is it more realistic to think that their managers just let them play their football?

Di Maria has been very disappointing this season but a good portion of the blame has to be laid on LVG and his tactics.

8145~~~
Maybe delusional is the right word.

8146~~~
I wholly believe that the burglary incident is largely responsible for his poor performances. Added to the fact that we haven't utilised him well, at all. 

I do think that Fergie would have had this guy bombing up and down the wing creating chance after chance. Yes we'd see inconsistencies, but you get that from players like himself and Nani. You need to take risks in life, whether they pay off or not is another question, however, you need to take them to move forward.

8147~~~
How about Robben? Doesn't he belong to that category?

8148~~~
FFS. Young is his first season was quite good. Valencia has been sh*te since last year. They both excelled under Fergie, however, injuries also hindered their progress.

8149~~~
I totally get where you're coming from mate and I agree with you. Di Maria has been appalling at times, but I truly believe that a Ferguson or Wenger would get so much more out of him by just letting him have a bit of freedom to do as he wants.

8150~~~
I am pretty sure that if a £40m bid came today we'd take it and all of Di Maria, van Gaal and Woodward would be happy/relieved.

Either that or we sell him for £8m to Inter/Milan/Atletico in 2 years at this rate.

8151~~~
He does mate, and LVG was able to get the best out of him for Holland. 

He was allowed to play to his strengths and Holland benefitted immensely for it.

I just wish that he'd do the same and let our key players express themselves.

8152~~~
Then buy Bale for £100m and when he struggles to fit into the philosophy, sell him on for £15m a few years later.

8153~~~
I just can't buy into the idea that Van Gaal won't allow anyone express themselves, not when Robben is such an obvious counter-example. 

The problem is none of our creative players have been playing well, as individuals. It's that simple. Ashley Young showed that it can be done, against City. Mata's showed some encouraging glimpes but nobody else has stepped up to the mark. And that can't be all down to the manager. Not when he has a proven track record of managing creative players who consistently won games for him, thanks to their individual brilliance.

8154~~~
He still played shite, no matter how you want to try to dress it up.

8155~~~
Valencia #7 season ?
Young hasn't been as effective as he was for Villa.
Hardly Exceptional players in their best seasons for United though, just players who did well for Fergies system, Valencia has not been Valencia since his one dimensional technique to beat a man was found out.

8156~~~
This is getting into Kagawa territory now.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8157~~~
Guess you're sort of right with regards to Valencia in 12/13, although, I didn't think he was that bad. 

However, we still got a few good, if not great, years out of Valencia and one good season from Young.

8158~~~
I agree with you, but looking forward, is Di Maria a player suited to Van Gaal's football?

I'm increasingly unsure, he just really doesn't look like a fit to the system we're clearly building. 

On the flip side he's had a CL winning season with Madrid, a World Cup semis in the summer and then the awful experience his family had this season, so it's understandable that he's not at his best.

8159~~~
Was really poor today, but still tried to make things happen. Still have faith he will eventually come good.

8160~~~
Enough of excuses and enough of blaming LVG. Matter of fact is he's been in a poor, very poor form for a good while now. 

And enough of 'he makes things happen' stuff. Yeah he makes things like loosing posession or aimlessly crossing the ball happen.

8161~~~
Making things happen is very relevant in this team, as the majority of our players are too comfortable passing sideways and backwards keeping possession just for the sake of it, we need some players who take risks with passing, dribbling and shooting.

8162~~~
He doesnt deserve to start. Nothing indicates he deserves to start ahead of Young or Mata. Even if Young and Mata arent doing anything, hes not doing anything better to say he should be starting ahead of them.

8163~~~
Felt sorry for him, never visibly seen a player lacking confidence to the extent I saw today.

8164~~~
meh

8165~~~
Young will start the remainder of the games. Di Maria will start the Hull game if the next two matches aren't good.

8166~~~
But if Di Maria comes on and is woeful with his runs, his passing and his crosses, ill even doubt that he will start the Hull match, lol. We dont watch training, but if I was picking the next team based on whats happened in our previous matches, Young and Mata start again on the wings.

They havent been great, but I dont think Di Maria has shown anything to replace either (unless its an injury)

8167~~~
He doesn't have to replace either. He might replace Fellaini. That way Mata might play as a midfielder instead of being shifted out wide where he currently is compensating for other players.

8168~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28053, @Snow" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28053/">@Snow</a> fair enough about that. I actually thought Di Maria should have come on for Fellaini and we should have gone to a 442 diamond with Young LB, Blind holding, Herrera and Di Maria beind Mata with Rooney/RVP up top. Would have made more sense with the players we had (and tbh, its the position Di Maria played where he got the goals / assists early in the season). For some reason that Leicester game killed LVGs thinking of it, even though WBA were never going to attack. But ive gone off point.

I will be surprised if Di Maria comes in for Fellaini as Fellaini offered more (scary to say) for LVGs style. He probably didnt give the ball away as much as Di Maria too.

8169~~~
I think hes brought on in the last few minutes, and is told to lump it into box at every opportunity, or just try and make something happen for remaining minutes he has on the pitch

I doubt he plays so many wastefull balls from himself, plus not letting him start matches, and play consistently is a big negative for a player who needs matches to get some confidence, momentum going

8170~~~
Not really. Two years ago, we had Valencia and Young as our main wingers. A lot of people wanted Di Maria especially after failing with getting Hazard and Moura. But Real Madrid weren't selling at the time.

8171~~~
I one willing to give him next season but it's amazing, I'm not taking the piss, every single time he has the ball, even if he is attempting a 4 or 5 yard pass, I don't back him to make it.

8172~~~
TBH, his downward spiral has gone so steeply that I don't believe that much in his chances for a recovery as a Manchester United player. If the PSG rumors are true and that they are willing to show Woody the money, I'm all for it since it would open the door for signing (preferably) a third player from Borussia Dortmund for this summer in Marco Reus as his replacement.

8173~~~
Highly doubt it but Reus to replace Di Maria? shut up and take my money!

8174~~~
Can only hope next season is different, cause right now it looks like we've been had.

8175~~~
I just don't see how he fits in going forward. He's a quality player but the wrong signing for us. Hopefully PSG are still interested.

8176~~~
His decision making and execution when it comes to passes and crosses is terrible, at least lately. Once in a while he does something fantastic on the pitch, but it's just not worth it. You can talk about positions and formations, but wherever he's being played there's no excuse for it. I was so excited when he signed, but I'm starting to think we should cut our losses. He's a complete liability at this moment in time.

8177~~~
It's hard to say. I'm not even sure anymore. It's rather if going into the last game and the 4th is secured that Di Maria will play rather if it wasn't.

Fellaini looses the ball way less. He also creates zilch. He get the ball to a team mate and keeps play going but when we need the goal he's put up top and the tactic is more relied on hope than one own's ability. That I dislike.

8178~~~
I just don't see how he is ever going to fit in with what LvG wants from his wide players, it's why Nani is almost certainly not going to be coming back, LvG seems to demand the ball protection and systematic attacking to such an extent that a maverick is never going to suit him.

8179~~~
Its just not working out here, for a variety of reasons.

8180~~~
First season syndrome I hope

Spains fairly easy for the top class players, lots of time on the ball to pick crosses, make a decision on run, cross etc etc

I think he'll be a lot better next year, get in the gym, get a bit of weight on him (not much) do him the world of good

8181~~~
Physically, possibly the weakest player I've ever seen play for United.

A breeze would knock him over.

8182~~~
It's truly bizarre because he is a world class talent and we all know that, but he has looked like half the player for quite some time.

I think a lot of it has to do with his confidence, but I think whatever instructions he is getting from van Gaal/the way we play is definitely not suiting to his style of play.

8183~~~
i think that most people remember di maria selectively, based on last season.

But before that, he had rows of absolutely dramatic displays where he eventually ended up on the bench for RM too. If there was one player that annoyed me with bad dribbles, useless ball losses and bad longshots during Mourinho's reign at RM it was Di Maria.

And then out of nowhere he went on to be amazing for the next 6 months, only to go back to dramaria the week after.

In short, hes the next level Nani. Even more unreliable, more talented, more swingy.

8184~~~
I would start him against Crystal Palace.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8185~~~
I think he's more compatible to the way SAF had his teams play, especially in comparison to the way LVG has you playing. He's just not suited to the stagnant style in the PL, and the fact he hasn't adjusted physically accentuates everything. 

I have to admit I find this situation humorous considering all the rubbish I read in here about Ozil last season - though if he's shown anything it's that it can take some time to fully adjust to the PL for these kinds of players. 

Yes you can point to the likes of Costa, Sanchez and Aguero as examples of players with big reputations coming from Spain to England and excelling from the off - but they're all very similar robust players who already had a physical edge to their game. 

Ozil had obviously hit the gym during the injury lay-off and has come back into the side and clearly has been our best player during this run of form. It looks like he's put on a good 5kgs if muscle and can ride challenges/hold-off players better now. 

I think ADM will need to do the same, and with a bit of an adjustment mentally he will show his true class. But the real question is how well does he fit in to LVG's slow system?

8186~~~
The problem is all of his running,passing and crossing is very poor atm.It doesn't really have a lot to do with tactics, he's just poor when when it comes to those fundamental things.

Though at least he tried and failed.We had some players yesterday who did nothing.

8187~~~
Yes hilarious, that he's the PL record signing and looks no better than Bebe.  We should sell him while he still has some sort of value.

8188~~~
slips on his arse, looks to the referee. Playing like the last kid picked in the playground, then shows why he was the last picked

8189~~~
He needs to sort himself out! he is miles better than he is showing.

8190~~~
No better then Bebe, really though?

Look he was crap yesterday absolute no doubts about it, it looks like his confidence has gone. He really needs a run of games starting and yesterday was a great opportunity to start that. I find it interesting that LVG has bought him seemingly without ever watching him prior as his man management of the player has been shocking in all honesty.

8191~~~
Feel sorry for him. He's a brilliant footballer but his confidence is completely shattered. Some of the stuff he did yesterday was laughably bad.

8192~~~
I'm reading this a lot. He's already had a longer run of consecutive starts than almost every other player in our team, with him getting worse over time, rather than better. I'm curious why if the same thing happened again, now, there would be a different outcome?

8193~~~
Who would sign him even at half price he paid?

8194~~~
He really was terrible yesterday. Looks totally devoid of any confidence at the moment. Needs to find his mojo back again.

8195~~~
Yes that's the problem and every game he plays we knock another £5m from his value!

8196~~~
He was awful.

8197~~~
During his consistent run of starts, he was arguably one of our better performers, albeit not great. However, as a team, we were really poor yet he was able to stand out among the rest, as a say he was the best (one of) of a bad bunch. The likes of Fellaini, Rooney, Young, Valencia, Smalling (whenever fit) were also consistent starters during that period, before Christmas, and have all continued improving, and were all essential components in our decent run of late. Add Mata and Herrera to those previously mentioned, and you have a core of about 7 or so players who were shown both faith and confidence by our manager, from which we reaped the rewards (the run of 6 wins has put us in pole position for a CL place).

Why not di Maria? He is our player. One which we spent £60m on. Why not afford him the same opportunity given to Young, Fellaini, Mata, Herrera and Valencia. Mata and Herrera weren't even in the starting eleven from Jan to March, yet were put straight back in against Newcastle/Spurs. The United futures of those named above were being doubted not too long ago, however, when given the chance to prove themselves, they ensured no one would ask that question again. Why is di Maria any different? Bale cost Real Madrid £100m and had a tough start to his career, yet he was afforded time and won Real the CDR and scored in the CL final.

The question you ask at the end is honestly ridiculous. Have you never seen an out of form player regain his form?

8198~~~
Quick glance at some Premier League numbers:

Rooney - <span style="color: #b30000">31 apps</span>; <span style="color: #0059b3">90% full games played 10% subbed off</span>; <span style="color: #ff4d4d">12 goals; 5  assists</span>; <span style="color: #0080ff">44 chances created; 39 key passes</span>

</span>
Young and Di Maria are the ones who compete for the same spot right. Looking at the numbers alone indicates that Di Maria is simply a better creative force (no shock there, I know). Essentially, LVG wants to control the game from start to end and we are lead to believe that Young is being favoured because he is, somehow, believed to be better at doing what ADM was doing better, if you look at the numbers. Losing the ball or passing percentages isn't even an issue here as they are equally good/bad.  Thus, we are giving up the ability to challenge team who sit back in favour of keeping the ball and move it around like a lethargic handball team.

So essentially this leaves a huge question mark over the purpose of the transfer of ADM and how he was to fit into a rigid system that is somewhat of  an ideological mismatch. Or at least that's what's being perceived by his omission from the starting line-up.  We cannot rely on just Rooney and Mata to create chances, that's too easy to deal with, especially when Rooney is forced to drop down to can't provide any sort of penetration.

Here's what I'm curious to know. Why isn't LVG utilising ADM the same way he utilise someone like Robben, on the right with the ability to cut inside? Imagine ADM getting into these positions:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZSB8oDgxZE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Move Mata into the number 10 role (numbers suggest he would handle it well) and move Rooney up.

8199~~~
Because Robben's a great goalscorer and ADM isn't.

8200~~~
He need to start every game we plays from here,he tries a lot and nothing going for him in last game,imo it look like lack of game time that knocking him down.

8201~~~
He hasn't always been. Once he was utilised properly by Bayern, he's become really efficient at scoring.

8202~~~
He didn't start out as a great goalscorer though. It's a moulding process. The intention of playing ADM in such position would be to bring his strong penetrative ability into play rather than having it sat on the bench.

8203~~~
He's always been a better finisher than ADM though. I just don't see ADM as that sort of player.

8204~~~
For me it is simple, play him in CM or sell him. LvG will have known that Di Maria isn't the best possession player, he is a engine and a creator that always seek to assist goals.
With a front three you need the players out wide to score goals, and Di Maria's finishing isn't good enough and never has been, you won't get 15 goals or even 10 from him per year.

Looking at pure stats, in the 7 starts at CM for us he has assisted 5 and scored 3, that is insane numbers actually. Maybe the balance is screwed with him in CM, but then we have to buy a strong box-to-box midfielder to accomodate him.
If LvG is unhappy with him, it is his own dumb fault for buying him and it would make me question his judgement of players, you don't spend 60m on someone you don't see fit in your style of play.

LvG did say earlier this year that he felt we needed a player to have one of Januzaj or Di Maria in CM, so it is possible that he still have plans for Di Maria to play there, but with his comments of Di Maria it makes you wonder if he just isn't keen on having Di Maria in his side.

8205~~~
He's the new scapegoat now? He certainly was not the reason why we lost 3 games in a row

8206~~~
Criticising isn't the same as scapegoating. We smashed the British transfer record for this guy and, so far, he's a candidate for worst pound for pound signing in United's recent history.

8207~~~
Recent? You could delete that word and your point would stand.

8208~~~
You love making stuff up don't you? Nobody has said that, they are talking about his season and performances as a whole and they have been nowhere near good enough for the price we paid.

Suarez and James Rodriquez moved for similar prices in the summer, and they are making Di Maria look like a pub player right now.

8209~~~
We should have played him in midfield against West Brom, considering we had all the possession. This guy could still potentially be one of the best creative midfielders in the world.

8210~~~
Fun fact: Di Maria haven't been playing as a CM with Carrick yet.

8211~~~
First time I'm hearing this, go to every other player's thread and you'll see critics.

8212~~~
Quite frankly, I don't think LVG knew much about Di Maria at all. All the Madrid fans on here warned us what he'd be like if we played him on the wing.

8213~~~
And that is what worries me, can we really trust him with money? Seems like he only knows what he is dealing with when the player is at the club, spending 60m on someone you don't know anything about is just ridiculous.

But i guess that is for another thread <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8214~~~
Yep, really was no need to have so many "controlling" midfielders on the pitch. We knew WBA would play defensive but we failed to adapt.

8215~~~
Should of started if not come on at half time.  He gives it away a lot but if anyone is going to try and beat their man it's him.
Right now he just looks like a massive waste of money, hopefully he'll get his shit together soon though.  When you pay that money you don't expect much of a wait on the results.

8216~~~
Have to admit, i'm moving towards the 'sell' camp. To sell such a big signing after one season reeks of knee jerking, but if we're not going to play him in midfield then we may as well sell if an offer comes in. If not, obviously he's good to have in the squad and you have to hold out hope he can turn his form around.

8217~~~
I really enjoyed seeing him have a laugh with one of West Brom's players immediately after the while yesterday. Especially after that performance.

8218~~~
All in all, he had a mixed season. Good start, poor finish. But it's his first season, let's see how he does next week. People are just too quick to write people off

8219~~~
And before it was Vidic and Evra, right? Oh wait, they came good after a while

8220~~~
Maybe that WBA player was Argentinian so that's why.

8221~~~
I personally think people go overboard with their criticism. He barely played lately so it's difficult to get into the team without match rhythm. It's also his first season here in England so I wont be too harsh on him.

8222~~~
You buy a player whos only performed in CM, play him on the wing and then openly criticise him... All seems poor to me, next to a mobile Carrick and a retention player hed do well IMO

8223~~~
I have trouble accepting LVG or Woodward could have signed off on a £60m+ expenditure with so little due diligence. And yet as we enter the final few games of the season, there is no other explanation that makes more sense.

8224~~~
Hes been shite of late, but it would be insane to sell him now unless we could get back the fee we paid. His decision making (and execution) have been very poor, but he has that unpredictability about him which we have lacked lately.

If Carrick is still injured for Palace, i would but Young at LB, Blind at DM and Di Maria at LW from the start.

8225~~~
I agree. I'd like to see an inform Carrick with Herrara and ADM infront, especially in home games like against WBA. Let's judge him then again

8226~~~
It is pretty weird that Van Gaal seems to have given up on the idea of Di Maria in midfield.

That's the position where he played the best football of his career and he looked great there early in the season. Plus his performances on the wing have been laughably bad.

8227~~~
Hes never performed like a 30m player on the wings, play him where he earned his name..

8228~~~
Does he have a special ability?

8229~~~
He is exactly how I remember him on the wing for them, i.e. incredibly frustrating. I remember watching him against Barcelona in 2011 and being amazed how people rated him back then, he was literally unbearable to watch even for a neutral.

He was sublime last season but his style means he cannot possibly cement down a regular XI spot at United in midfield, ever. If the intention is to play him out wide then we may have as well signed a £20m winger from France or Germany and make a better use of him - even someone like Carasco or Lucas Moura would be doing equal if not better job on the flanks. We paid £60m for him as a midfielder because that's where he got his reputation last season, with no intention (or even possibility now) to use him there long term IMO.

If a £40m bid comes this Summer we will likely cut our losses and move on. I don't think it will though and I'm not even mad at Di Maria.

8230~~~
They did indeed. Took them just over half a season. 

Mind you, for a combined total of 12 million quid they were never even close to being the worst signings we've ever made.

8231~~~
For a grand total of two games, against the worst teams in the league. People are (deliberately?) forgetting he looked shit in central midfield too, hence we were unable to continue playing him there. He wasn't shifted out wide on a whim. It was an inevitable consequence of us getting overrun in central midfield whenever he played there.

8232~~~
If only.

8233~~~
Yeah there's a myth about him being great as CM, but after 2 good games he was already beginning to fade. If I remember correctly he was pretty bad vs Everton at home despite playing as a CM. It was then when his poor form started.

8234~~~
Indeed. Let's not forget that West Ham were all over us too. Even before Rooney's stupid red card. His contribution before then is over-stated too. A nil all draw against Burnley and 3 all (while he was still on the pitch) against Leicester. Basically the whole idea that he looked good for us as a CM is based almost entirely on one game against the worst team in the league, QPR, at their lowest ebb of the season. Consider me not convinced. 

Basically we all got really excited by a few flicks and some promising link up with Rooney on the break against crap teams.  He never looked close to bringing what you need from a CM in the PL. Composure, physical presence, discipline and reliable passing and positional sense. 

I can't for the life of me understand why being able to run fast with the ball and occasionally pick a decent pass is all we should be looking for in a central midfielder. Based on what he has done well in his United career, playing him out wide makes a lot of sense (his excellent crossing was also a feature, early on) but playing him in central midfield makes no sense at all.

8235~~~
Half a season where they played and United, in general, was in a much better shape. I find it premature to write someone off as the worst buy ever after not even one proper season, especially after a rather positive start

8236~~~
It's actually quiete simple

8237~~~
How dare you criticise Di Maria's Post Burnley,Pre Everton form?(3 games) he was up there with Messi and Ronaldo according to most people on here, infact that game against QPR(not Chelsea not Arsenal not City, not Spurs not even Stoke, but QPR) will go down in history as one of the greatest performances ever, 60m to terrorise a team that had Rio in its defence...price tag justified.

He is not a Winger
CM is his best position (he has played there in more than one occasion this season)
He needs to start to prove himself, despite being the first name on the team sheet before the Arsenal game (excluding the games he was out injured)
He is the most creative player in the team (despite averaging 1 or 2 golden moments a game)
Personal Issues
New League, needs a season to adjust (despite using his early season form to point out his efficiency).

The curious case of Angel Di Maria.

8238~~~
Yeah the problem is that myth has really grown now as its obvious in this thread.
Play him in CM and he will shine stuff.

Also "He makes things happen" posts too.

8239~~~
Well I'm with you on that one. I still hope he'll come good.

8240~~~
I find it difficult to really see this as anything but LvG failing to use him effectively. I also don't think it was his signing but it all seems very messed up if the managers vision wasn't communicated or understood.

The manager does seem the type who favours the "pull up your boots" approach rather than a softer personal touch so I'm not sure how this will end. 

"It's up to the player" followed by him leaving and slagging us off is my guess

8241~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8242~~~
LVG saw ADM's best performances in midfield so far - you really wonder why he isnt playing there especially when we had Carrick fit and Herrera finding his feet

8243~~~
I think us getting overrun in midfield had more to do with Carrick not playing, rather than Di Maria being there. Also, the games he had in CM was in that awkward period where we had not yet grasped Van Gaal's system and looked very disjonted

Not saying he has played well, by any means, but it would be silly imo to give up on him. Now he might not deserve it, but i would give him a start at the LW spot, or the LCM spot against Palace. Young could be shifted into LB (a position he has excelled in) or he takes Fellaini's spot. Rooney and RvP has been given starts despite being equally shite this season, and i see no reason why Di Maria should not be given the same chance.

You might argue that he is no good on the wing, and i agree, but he could play the same role as Mata (who is neither a winger) and drift inside and let the LB bring the width. And while his wing play might be sub par, he does have an exceptional good cross on him.

He is incredibly frustrating, but he also has that x-factor to him.

8244~~~
That's the first time I felt absolutely mad at him. I generally have a soft spot for flair players and tend to overlook some of the mistakes they make (mainly because they take risks to make something happen which will not always come off) compared to the ones who graft and are not that talented with the ball at their feet, but against WBA he made three almost identical passes (crosses?) in the space of 2 mins and 2 of them went out for a goal kick while one went over the top of everyone and perhaps for a throw in to WBA. Made me mad esp since he is good enough to get at least one of them spot on and with us chasing the game in the dying seconds he was doing absolutely fck all to help us back into it.

However, I still have hope that he will ultimately come good here. He is far too good not to.

8245~~~
He should start every game from now on. Although he did not get as much game time as others during the last months he was one of the very few players who looked as he could pull something off.
Blaming him and wanting him to leave is ridiculous.

That does not mean that I am 100 % happy with his performances - far from that.

8246~~~
I dispute this. Let's look at his 19 premier league starts, the positions he was used in, and the ratings the forum gave him and the team after those matches.

His first five games were in the left cm role. Against Burnley, QPR and Leicester he was our highest rated player and MOTM in each game. Against West Ham he scored the team average and then against Everton he was our second highest rated player. His average rating over those games was 7.7, the teams was 5.8. We were never really 'overrun' in midfield in any of those games, certainly not every time he played there, and it seems kind of ridiculous for you to claim that and say he 'looked shit' when it goes so far against how people at the time viewed his performances. 

In the next four games (West Brom, Chelsea, City, Palace) he played as a winger and his form suffered. He was rated below the team average in all games except West Brom.

Van Gaal then decided we needed his pace upfront and he played six games either as a striker or as a no. 10 (Arsenal, Hull, Southampton, QPR, Leicester, West Ham). His performances continued to disappoint with a personal average of 5.5 while the team scored 6.0.

Then he played two games at left cm again against Burnley and Swansea where he slightly outperformed the team average, 5.8 against 5.2.

And finally two games back as a winger (Sunderland and Newcastle) where he was shocking. Our lowest rated player in both matches with an average of 4.5 against the teams 6.1

Those ratings fairly well mesh with my own view of his season. Left cm, the same position he excelled in for Madrid, is the only one where he has been a success for us. His performances in other positions have ranged from average to pathetic.

8247~~~
So you're basing your opinion on redcafe ratings?
People were maybe still giving him high ratings vs West Ham and Everton despite the fact he wasnt very good in those games.

8248~~~
He looked good but the team did not. We were far too open, got overrun in midfield and didn't look balanced at all. He's a bit useless when we don't have the ball in that position.

8249~~~
Hmm, wonder if that had anything to do with the fact we played Blind, Herrera and Rooney in there too, with Falcao and RVP up front... Anyway, I don't even think we got overrun in those games at all. Look back at the forum during this time and most people would say the same. Revisionist nonsense just to paint a worse picture of Di Maria's season me thinks, since some others are getting it from all corners. He was crap against Everton <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> oh dear.

Obviously he's not lived up to the billing this season, but lets not pretend he wasn't our best player in the first part of the season when the team was a fecking mess.

8250~~~
He wasnt crap but he wasnt praticulary good either. Same goes for West Ham game.

So when he was good with Blind, Herrera, RVP, Rooney and Falcao great. 
But when he was bad with them its cause he played with them.. 
Interesting.

8251~~~
Someone mentioned how we were far too open, yet do you not think that might be down to the line up we had out in those games? He was our best player in those games. Saying we were not balanced and putting it down to Di Maria is pretty ridiculous when you look at our line ups and the "diamond".

8252~~~
I'm not playing down Di Maria's form in those games. I'm just saying we didn't look right as a team back then and that is why we had to change things. It's not entirely down to Di Maria, we just don't have the players to play a diamond. The team looked a mess so we had to change the system. It's up to Di Maria to fit into the new system.

8253~~~
I dont remember him being the best player vs Everton and West Ham. I may be wrong of course.
I dont think we were unbalansed cause of him, just think his dip in form started while he was a CM.
If he can play just one position and one position only I think we have a big problem.

8254~~~
We persisted with unbalanced line ups for ages after these games just to fit in 3 strikers and play one of them out of position. I'd say that had a massive effect on our performances suffering. Can't think of many games it actually looked alright except that Newcastle one at new year.

8255~~~
They are supporting my opinions, not the basis of them. 

Like I think Di Maria had a good game against Everton because I watched it and I can remember him scoring, getting an assist, and causing them problems all day. But it's nice that I can also look at the thread for that game and see that lots of people agreed with me and that he was easily our highest rated outfield player.

8256~~~
The problem is, if we sign the player based on a season playing in that position then isn't the smart thing to do to play him in that position instead of moving him around all the time? Why would we sign a striker to play him on the wing? Now di Maria obviously can play on the wing, but he isn't as good there. I'm not convinced he will have a future here if he can't get into the trio in midfield ahead of strikers and target men. It's a complete square peg in round hole situation. It makes me wonder why LVG said yes to this transfer in the first place if he didn't plan to use him in that position.

8257~~~
As I said people were generous to him with ratings cause he started brightly. 
I dont remember him being anything special in that game.

8258~~~
Well it seems we bought a player who isnt all that. I mean he's good in only one position it seems and that's not enough imo.

8259~~~
Well of course people will say that now, because they know what's happened since then. Looking at the threadmark after the Everton game most of the caf thought he was a shoe in for player of the year.

8260~~~
On the other hand - match day threads. People write lots of stuff, some of it beyond ridiculous. 
I'm not saying that part was ridiculous but as I said I dont remember him being really that good. 
And as I said I may be wrong. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

I agree we should maybe start him next week just to see how that goes. We need to mix it up a little.

8261~~~
It's quite grim looking back actually. The team/system has changed that much throughout the season, next year it has to be a lot more stable.

8262~~~
Well it seems we have a system and a team now. 
I'm not sure why is it so big difference when he plays in CM and as a winger. He runs the ball, attacks the space, take men on and makes passes. Why cant  he do it as a winger also.

8263~~~
Personally I don't we were as bad as all that and the problems we did have can be put down to other factors than Di Maria. We had:

1. A bunch of players who were either new to the league or inexperienced youngsters.
2. A team that had spend the whole of pre-season and the early games using 5-3-2 having to suddenly switch to a back four because our manager realised too late he didn't have the squad for the former.
3. No Carrick in any of the games. Key player.
4. No Smalling except for one sub appearance. Our best centre back.
5. The lamentable form of players who should have done better. I thought Van Gaal would rejuvenate RvP, he just carried on playing like he did for Moyes. Evans was our senior centre back going into the season. Do you remember his early performances? They were shocking. Rooney was named our captain but instead of giving us leadership he had a meltdown on the pitch against Leicester and then got himself sent off against West Ham.

No offence intended but when you look at all the problems we had I find it kind of odd that Di Maria's good performances even get mentioned as an issue. Him in left cm was one of the few parts of the team that we should have been happy with imo.

8264~~~
People have short memories, no point in trying to convince some. He was quite easily our best player for the first month. I remember that Burnley game, where he was the only player that looked like he was a professional footballer, against Burnley! People will use those earlier games to prove that di Maria is shit - "di Maria's only good games came against the bottom placed teams", yet forget that the rest of the team looked like shit against the same opposition. He was our best player against QPR, Leicester and Everton, and only turned, somewhat, shit when moved to wing after the Everton win.

Some on here forget how crap our defense was earlier in the season - Smalling, Jones and Evans were non-existent, McNair and Blackett were our main CB's alongside Rojo, also a new signing. We also had Blind as our DM, not Carrick, playing alongside an inexperienced and naive Ander Herrera. It's no coincidence we conceded so many in the first few games, and it wasn't down to di Maria. Not only was he our most creative, productive and best player, he was also taking up his defensive responsibilities. It's easy to forget how good he was, as we were so unbelievably shit earlier on in the season.

For me, it's quite simple, without some of his contributions, we could (probably would) have found ourselves out of the top 4, at this stage, - his freekick led to the point against Chelsea, he assisted Fellaini's stunner against WBA, he scored and assisted against Everton which we won, he also assisted Rooney's goal against Arsenal, he assisted two important goals against Burnley, he also assisted the winner against Liverpool. But yeah... he's been shit, all season and we shouldn't acknowledge his contribution this season.

In a season, which only De Gea can be proud of, it's quite laughable how much criticism di Maria is receiving and the fact that some of his performances and contributions are being dismissed. Short term memories seem to be quite prevalent, around here.

8265~~~
It seems we have 2 camps. One is criticising him relentlessly, the other thinks its not allowed to criticise him and say he's in a poor form cause its everybody's fault but his.

8266~~~
I really feel that we should be playing him as a CAM with a free role ahead of him. Just let him wonder about doing what he wants, picking the passes as he pleases. He isn't a player that plays well under chains, and while the 4-3-3 has worked OK in the big games, a 4-3-2-1 with Herrera ** at the base with would give him a stable base to go about doing the creative work.

8267~~~
I'm not in either of those camps. I doubt anyone is.

I'm in the camp that thinks he played great in those early games in that left cm role. Then we moved him around a bunch and his form nosedived. Now he's playing absolute bobbins and barely looks like a pro-footballer.

8268~~~
Haha, reading that was hilarious. Shows how we as a fan base right now are not much more than a bunch of complete knee jerkers.

8269~~~
We know he's a good player but he won't do himself any favors playing like that? That was as bad a performance as any Bebe put in and he was slated. We just need to finish in a good position, get this season over and then do good stuff in the summer.

8270~~~
He's actually in the same boat as Rooney, for me. I see absolutely no point in trying to criticise our Captains performances as he's been thrown around all over the pitch, and even when's he's played further forward, we lack creativity, which has seen him score only 12 goals, this season. di Maria, similarly, has played as a CM, LW, SS, RW, AM and due to this and a few other reasons, he's completely out of form. 

With regards to who's fault it is, do you, for one moment, think that di Maria wants to play badly? Do you think he stepped out against WBA and thought "I'm going to ensure we lose this match"? He put in a fine ball to McNair, who should have scored (debate for another day), which is enough to show me that guy is trying is hardest to prove himself, but it isn't working out for one reason or another. His confidence is gone and won't return till he starts consistently. 

It's the managers job to ensure he gets the best out of his players, and with regards to di Maria, he hasn't and LvG is responsible for that. Of course, that's not to say di Maria didn't help himself against Arsenal, for example, with the sending off, but who fecking cares about that - he made a mistake, we all do, I don't care about that, and neither should anyone else.

8271~~~
With Rooney is even worse. What is excused for ADM its not for Rooney. 
With both of them there's talk about selling them and so on..

I dont think it's his fault and that he just decided to be in poor form.  And I agree its lot of circumstances. 
As I said I think he should start next game or if not next certainly against Arsenal to prove himself. 
LVG found a winning formula but now that formula isnt working for 3 games and ADM starting should be a mix he should really try although ADM is out of form.

8272~~~
Like I said, short term memories. Put an in form di Maria into our team and he'd create game in game out for Rooney. Bar the two chances against Chelsea, I don't remember many other scoring opportunities for Rooney in the past few games. Yes, he hasn't been great, but he has his weaknesses, and his finishing isn't one of them.

8273~~~
Question is where will he play. Does LVG trust him to play in midfield (especially with Carrick out) and does Young deserve to keep his place? I'd play him in midfield and even if not, I dont think Young deserves his starting spot

8274~~~
It was the feel good factor of an exciting new signing. Redcafe ratings should be taken with a pinch of salt at the best of time but should be completely ignored when everyone is giddy about a potentially quality new signing, who's got a few flashy tricks up his sleeve. That's the kind of group hysteria that creates lunacy like Anderson shitting on Fabregas.

8275~~~
Wasn't just the caf though was it? Most media outlets too.

8276~~~
For "caf" read United fans in general. The caf wasn't responsible for the Anderson chant either.

8277~~~
That's not what I'm saying. In that run of games most people outside of United were saying the same things about di Maria which makes it completely frustrating that he's been hit or miss since.

8278~~~
Big name signing comes in with a huge load of hype around him, joins the biggest club in the country who've had a shite start to the season and has some exciting moments then plays a big part in the destruction of (as it turns out, diabolically bad) QPR. Not hard to see how the superstar United saviour narrative got written, even if you weren't personally invested in him being a success (which we all were)

Don't get me wrong. He was decent for those couple of games but the opposition and his form since gives all the initial hype a very different perspective. And yes, it's massively frustrating. I just disagree with the narrative that he was excellent as a CM then was shunted into positions he can't play, through no fault of his own.

Plus, unless I'm very much mistaken, all he's been asked to do since is play the position he's always played for Argentina. Not a big ask really.

8279~~~
Completely agreed. Hence you had people finding it laughable to compare Di Maria to Sanchez.
I'm still not expecting people to say Sanchez is better (or even equal), but I doubt it's as 'laughable' now.

8280~~~
This. Heck I was excited too after those few games but it all went downhill after that for one reason or another.

8281~~~
How do you think the Copa America will affect him going in to next season? Will playing for the Argies revitalize him, or will he be fatigued and have a slow start to next season?

8282~~~
Was looking through some stats focused on central midfield and defensive midfielders only this season and saw that Di Maria has actually made the most key passes of any CM this season, averaging 3.1 per match in his 7 matches there. Fabregas is just behind with 3.

Its definitely a double edged sword using him as a CM, while he creates from there he also loses the ball and he doesnt partake in defending whatsoever.

So what if we signed Schneiderlin to plug the gaps and kept Ander on the right pressing high and making tackles? Would that see us get the best out of Di Maria once again?

I feel like thats as good a solution as any to seeing Di Maria be successful at the club and we're very likely to adopt a 3 man midfield moving forward anyway

8283~~~
It depends on our capacity to score on the chances he creates and on our capacity to not concede before he creates a goal.

8284~~~
I suppose Argentina will reach semis at least, so I suppose it can only have a positive effect on him. He seems more tired mentally than psychically, a good tournament will hopefully raise his confidence (I don’t think any team with Messi can have bad tournament).

8285~~~
A rabbit have more determination and is less frightened.

He is good for the women football.

8286~~~
If Di Maria can hardly get a start this season, how is that going to be any different next season - there is actually more competition already with Depay joining. Is he off?

Surely we can't afford to have a £60m impact sub?

8287~~~
It looks like he will be staying with us next season thankfully -

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://puu.sh/hEPNN/e4b033d804.png" src="http://puu.sh/hEPNN/e4b033d804.png"/>

8288~~~
Well, we're certainly rich so why not?

8289~~~
talk about a fecking buzzkill.

8290~~~
We have already paid for him. If we were to pay £60mil for a average player then we obviously can't afford that.

8291~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8292~~~
They could cash in in Matuidi for some money or if someone does go for Verrati, that will increase the money they are allowed to spend, no?

8293~~~
Would anyone consider letting Di Maria go if it involved a deal with Veratti coming the other way?

8294~~~
Only if we signed Bale tbh

8295~~~
If (big if) we do flog him after just one season he'll be damaged goods, which means we'll have to accept a huge reduction on what we paid for him. Which wouldn't rule PSG out, even if they stick to FFP.

8296~~~
No brainer.....feck yes!

8297~~~
Or they could just offer us one of those and some money for Di Maria.

8298~~~
Yes, i would do that. Verratti is a monster, he would fit us perfectly and could replace Carrick. Di Maria on the wing is replaceable, while Verratti is special and he would be absolutely destroying it here.

8299~~~
I'd take the £35mil plus Lucas Moura. Depay on one wing, Moura on the other <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

In all seriousness, DiMaria deserves another season, unless he's unhappy and wants out.

8300~~~
Bullshit imo. No way would we accept almost half of what we paid for him a year ago, especially after getting 13 assists which is 3rd or 2nd best in the league.

The only way we would sell for that much would be if he was desperately unhappy.

8301~~~
I know but if we sold him, OK we wouldn't recoup al, of it but £40m or whatever we could reinvest in weaker areas of the squad like CB, CM, RB, Striker.....

8302~~~
Don't know where to stand on this, shit season and 13 assists.

Surely deserves another year as he's adjusting and grasping language.

8303~~~
I'm sure a swap deal can be worked out. Verratti would be the perfect signing for us.

8304~~~
I'd take £50 mil for him, its <i>only </i>a £9 mil loss, which is peanuts for us really.

I just don't see him ever fitting into LVG's philosophy, unfortunately.

8305~~~
If we keep Nani, yes.

8306~~~
PSG want Pogba, they can't have everyone with FFP.

8307~~~
Pogba has already turned them down apparently

8308~~~
since??

8309~~~
I'd agree to a straight swap. Not that it's likely, anyway. Veratti would be a very important piece in the puzzle, while Di Maria isn't yet (note that this may change in the future).

8310~~~
Yes without, we'd still need to get another winger but Veratti is a jewel. One of the best young CM in the world if not the best.

8311~~~
Di Marzio tweeted it 2 days ago i think. They offered him 15m wages per year, he turned them down

8312~~~
A few days ago. I believe Di Marzio said it - should be in the transfer thread somewhere

8313~~~
I haven't been pleased with his performances lately, but it amazes me how many people want rid of him, even more so when people suggest Nani is fit to replace him.

We keep saying the same thing: We need someone with pace who can beat a man out wide. Di Maria has these qualities that we're looking for and I think it's stupid to want to offload someone who even in terrible form and not starting has been productive for us.

8314~~~
We don't if Nani stays.

8315~~~
I doubt Nani will stay. He'd wanna move to a club with very good chances of starting.

8316~~~
Give him another season to adjust. He's had a world cup last summer and overall a tough season. I'm confident he can turn it around. We shouldn't become a club where we just dump players quickly once things aren't going well. I also don't want us to lose a ton of money on his transfer without having given him a full preseason and training camp with our squad as well.

8317~~~
What we would do if Veratti were to struggle to accustom to the league? 

We've invested a lot of money in di Maria, a seriously talented player; flogging him after one half bad year is not the answer, and it never is.

8318~~~
But what if Veratti was the missing piece to the puzzle, and replaced an impact sub who makes no impact?

8319~~~
He could just as easily fail to make the impact we would require, if we were to get him (which we won't, PSG won't sell him). And then what? Flog him in 2016?

8320~~~
You could say that about any signing. 

I would have thought captain hindsight would be less patient, considering! 

I'm all for giving Di Maria another season to be honest. I just thought it was an interesting question, as it's surely worth considering bringing a player in to improve a position we desperately need to reinforce, at the expense of a player who's currently showing no signs of being able to make it in the PL.

8321~~~
I'd be happy if we gave them di Maria <b><i>and cash</i></b> to get Veratti.

The boy Veratti would fit a Van Gaal team like a glove and would be the kind of signing that'd see us push for a title.

We're now a club who'll pay a bench warming striker half a million pounds every fortnight - I'd have no problem with the club chucking 10 million quid on top of di Maria if it meant landing an utter gem like Veratti.

8322~~~
I'd listen to some sort of deal involving Verratti too, although not if there was any chance we could get Pogba. 

If Bayern really want him and are happy to send Iron Robben our way as part of any deal, I'd be all over that too.

8323~~~
As much as I love Verrati and think that he is exactly what we need I still wouldn't trade him for Di Maria. I seriously doubt it's even an option, PSG aren't going to sell him. He's part of their long term plan, they can find a cheaper alternative to Di Maria if that's our offer - they already went for Memphis.

Di Maria hasn't had the best first season and we all agree on that but I think he will want to redeem himself as the #7 next season. He's not come in under ideal circumstances and had to adapt to the PL, van Gaal's methods aren't easy either, especially in a different language. The only reason the club would sell their record breaking transfer is if he is <i>seriously</i> unhappy. Even then the club wouldn't take a 10m+ loss on him, no club will offer this. There's been no reliable sources suggesting that he's <i>that</i> unhappy. He said he wanted Manchester United to be his last club in europe before he moves back to Argentina - I doubt he will give up this easily and want out after some poor form and a burglary, which can happen in any country sadly. 

He will be fine on the wing next year, I doubt he will play much in midfield since he can only play 10 - we're stocked for that position. He will probably play on the right, van Gaal likes inverted wingers. He will need to adapt to van Gaal's style and this can take time, I want to give him a 2nd season.

8324~~~
Why isn't he being <b>deployed in the right wing</b> or the position Fellaini has been playing. Playing on the right makes him look twice the player rather than not being able to beat a man on the left.

Look at against Arsenal how he played on the right and also how he destroyed Germany from the same side.  It doesn't make sense to me to not use him in them positions. In the centre providing through balls in to Rvp would have caused havoc last Saturday.

8325~~~
Di Maria has endured a tough year, bright start but faded quite a bit after half dozen games or so.

Still has shown bits of quality here and there, though, which gives me some hope that he'll be better next season with pre season under his belt.

8326~~~
I've just been watching a few videos of his, just to remind me how how good he actually is, and what struck me most is just how much he took people on in his Madrid days, and tried fancy bits of skill, little tricks and flicks etc. That seems to have been completely eradicated from his game atm, right now he just gets the ball and tries an aimless cross into the box. I can't remember the last time he beat a defender with a nice trick.

But why the dramatic change? Complete loss of confidence? Can't hack it in the PL? LVG tactics? There must be a reason why one of the biggest flair players in the world has gone from being such a 'showman' to someone who looks scared of a football.

8327~~~
The bolded 2 IMO. He looks scared of getting hit with a tackle and worried of losing the ball. I don't believe LvG has told him not to try to dribble as Young and Herrera do, but he's so low on confidence that he tries the safer option with the pass but unfortunately he can't even manage those right now.

8328~~~
One thing I took from those videos, is just how much freedom he was playing with. You contrast that with now, where he looks genuinely scared to make a 5 yard pass, and as you say he's not even getting those right now. He looks like he's double, triple, thinking everything. 

Completely agree on him looking scared of being hit in the tackle. Which is weird, as he was getting very stuck in in the early stages of the season. Maybe as he's got used to how physical the PL is, he's become more aware of getting injured etc etc

8329~~~
Yeah and that is a mental thing, not sure how we can help him there or if LvG's demanding style of obsessive planning is suited to him period, Di Maria is a maverick like Nani, he's not a Valencia type who will follow orders to a T.

My guess is some of the earlier hits he took have made him wary of getting too close and especially trying to dribble in a tight space.

8330~~~
tough season for him. you can see he simply does not has any confidence these days.

i'll keep him though as i still believe we haven't seen the best out of him yet. unless suddenly bale is available and PSG make a bid for di maria of course.

8331~~~
Well then he should pack his bags and leave if he can't take a few inevitable hits. He probably thought he could hack it in a more physical League and now he's found out. He's had problems off the field which would have affected him mentally but no one died (thankfully) and more than a few months have passed since then, no improvement.

I think deep down he doesn't want to be here and regrets moving from sunny Spain,that's the bare truth of it. I would wait until the summer and see if anyone is prepared to pay the asking price. If PSG came in tomorrow with a 50 million bid I would accept it without any regret. If he is prepared to put his body on the line and play without fear, then he stays but he has to prove that in these final games and pre season first.

8332~~~
If he doesn't improve next season we'll probably sell him, and it will be for a lot less than we could this summer, when we could still likely get 50 million.

You don't sell a player like him after one poor season though, especially if you're as loaded as we are.

8333~~~
Whether it's a good idea to sell him or not depends on how Van Gaal plans to use him. 

If he still sees him as a midfielder then give him another season. We paid such a high fee because of his performances in that role and he was brilliant there at the start of the season. 

If he doesn't like him as a midfielder and only wants to use him as a winger then selling him before his value seriously declines is the right decision. He has never been an elite winger in his life and, judging by his awful performances there this season, shows no sign of turning into one.

8334~~~
He's had a rough year, but to even consider selling him it's ridiculous. He has the quality to be our best player, he just needs to settle in LVG's system. Once he learns the language and gets more used to LVG's demands he will be great.

I am dissapointed to hear that he will be playing Copa America this summer, I hope that won't affect his summer preparation.

8335~~~
I was thinking that, but maybe having a good tournament is exactly what he needs to boost his confidence.

8336~~~
The German press is going mad reporting that Bayern is in for AdM with Schweinsteiger possibly going the other way.
Other names mentioned as targets for Bayern`s spending spree are Griezmann, Gündogan, de Bruyne etc. etc.

Not that I take this serious - however, I really hope we won`t sell AdM on the cheap.

8337~~~
I don't want Schweinsteiger here at all. Not the player he used to be plus he'll be 31 this year. We don't need him, the time to sign him was 3-4 years ago not now.

8338~~~
No we won't. And Schweinsteiger is not better than Carrick regards injuries nowadays

8339~~~
Yea, it's not like he's going to be burned out from playing too much with us!

8340~~~
That would be an awful deal. Scheeinsteiger is very much in decline and is just as injury prone as Carrick has been.

8341~~~
Yeah that would be a stupid deal for us. Schweinsteiger will be injured all the time in the PL and Di Maria will get back to his best at Bayern and we will ask here why we did a deal like that.

8342~~~
I would take Mario Gotze or Veratti (PSG)  plus fee in a swap deal.

8343~~~
Cant see us selling ADM this early on, especially with all the noise from his camp about being happy here and working hard for next season. PSG are just the work of the French media to make them relevant for the big transfers again. I've had this argument on another forum where it was claimed PSG were gonna take down FFP with all these loan to buy nonsense deals and how, if Uefa accepted United's kit deal with Addidas then theyll be forced to accept PSG dodgy equivalent.
No club will loan to buy unless they couldn't shift him and wanted to free up wages ala Falcao. Never mind if we did sell him, why would we want to wait a year for the money when other clubs would pay it there and then?
Especially when clubs need the funds to combat FFP themselves.

8344~~~
Just in you read this Maria - you're a fecking DICK!

8345~~~
Yeah, feck you Angel you dickhead.

Wait, what did he do?

8346~~~
If Guardiola successfully makes him part of his possession based system after LvG has failed to do it, then I am convinced I won't be the only person having a mega meltdown.

Having said that what the hell is Di Maria going to do in Munich at Bayern Munich when he is not happy in Manchester. He'll either stay here or join his Argentinian mates at PSG. Hopefully he is here to stay.

8347~~~
yeah knobhead!

8348~~~
swap him for veratti in a heartbeat.

8349~~~
Surely he has to be better then he is showing us at the moment and I think he should stay for at least one more year, but if he does go then he could certainly could prove key to getting a good player in return, PSG, and Bayern keen, it would have to be Marquinhos, Verrati, Robben, or Lewandowski, mind you swap deals rarely happen.

8350~~~
I think he's a fantastic player but one we should have never bought, Id be delighted if we can recoup the majority of our money back this summer 50m+ and move on from there, he doesn't come across as being happy in Manchester and I don't think he truly wants to be here so its best for both if he left, 

Saying that if he stays you just hope LVG can turn him into a better player for us next season.

8351~~~
If we are willing to offer Falcao another chance, then surely we have to give him more time. Next season we will be more settled especially if we get Champions League Football. First half of this season was us trying to fit everyone into a new formation every week. No one clicked. Now that we have a system that works I would love to see Di Maria start. He will have a break after this season since no international football and will have a full pre-season under his belt. I want him to stay.

8352~~~
Just going to leave this here..<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZ5V-6CCY9U?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8353~~~
Let him play with freedom - you get the above (and what we saw last season).
Force him to play within himself and you get di Maria of Man United.

8354~~~
Or we could just buy a lot of world class players to play around him.


His poor form has less to do with tactics and more to do with what's going on in his head in my opinion. He was facing the fact he is supposed to be our main man (you cant expect nothing less for the fee we paid) and is struggling to deal with the pressure. The media and the fans were expecting too much.

Di Maria has never been a player that can carry the team on his back nor a World Class player by himself. For me, he is a enabler for others to shine. The more good football players around him, the more he will shine, so of course he was always gonna struggle with us. (Sanchez was a much better fit, what we really needed).


that said, i think we will come back from Copa America with a complete different aura, with the pressure of the first season, GONE!

A good transfer season (Hopefully a couple of big signings that can carry the pressure of the team alongside Rooney), a established set of tactics, and he will be shining for us. (or making the others shine)

8355~~~
Largely agree. Although, I think his complete loss of form is due to a range of different reasons.

8356~~~
Look at the space they're giving him though, he doesn't have that in the BPL. 

Either way, he can be way better than he has been this past season and should be given a chance with a full preseason at the club and no previous summer tournament where he also ended up heading to the final and getting injured.

8357~~~
Why not try play him on the right, Mata behind the striker and whomever on the left

8358~~~
I remember his tournament ended around quarterfinal; whole point remains overall

8359~~~
But there is the Copa America this summer.

8360~~~
Well, he doesn't in our current set up anyway.

8361~~~
and the next one too.

8362~~~
Yes I articulated it poorly. I think his injury and lack of preparation and opportunity to get accustomed to van Gaal has also played a large role in his struggles. Early on he was just playing freely before he attempted to settle into van Gaal's system, suffered injuries and as a result has never found his rhythm back.

8363~~~
Completely forgot about it. In that case, we can only hope he remains injury free and will be able to participate in a full preseason. Having already played a season under van Gaal and in England will also help either way.

8364~~~
True, but no matter how we use him, there won't be this much space and time and make a decision.

8365~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I thought you were joking. I think that he will be alright, he hasn't played much this season, he had time to rest and since he is a good athlete, he should comeback fresh.

8366~~~
And that is the point......Sky-Sports News Germany are a laughing stock in the last couple of weeks with their sources and Sport Bild are a bit like Daily Mail.

8367~~~
I think Di Maria is leaving purely because Depay seems to have taken on the number 7 in all his Twitter headers and photos, signing M7. May just be a hunch/coincidence but would be strange for him to Start promoting that number when he knows he will have to change next year. Maybe he's been promised it?

8368~~~
You could be right. But he is number 7 for psv so could just be that for now at least

8369~~~
It was his number at PSV and he did it for quite a while already. Nothing to do with the transfer.

8370~~~
Di Maria is the new Mata on here. A few bad games, not being given any real chances since his couple of weeks out with injury and suddenly he's not good enough.

8371~~~
Move Herrera to the DM slot and give Di Maria a chance in midfileld ?

8372~~~
Or just drop one of Rooney, Mata, Fellaini or Young. They've all been poor three games in a row. Blind as a DM, Herrera needs to stay as a CM/AM and di Maria should start in Fellaini's or Mata's position.

8373~~~
Herrera at DM gives me the jitters. He was mostly fine there, but has this habit of having a very loose first touch/pass a few times a game. He get's away with it further up the pitch but it's suicidal when he's the deepest midfielder. Plus his energy, high pressing, quick passing, forward runs and shooting is nullified if he is having to play more of a holding role.

8374~~~
If he doesn't start today I will be fuming, you don't keep the same team when you've lost 3 in a row.

8375~~~

8376~~~
FFS

8377~~~
Will this season just end please? it's just one shit thing after another since that Chelsea defeat.

8378~~~
He wouldn't have played anyway

8379~~~
Typical

8380~~~
Thought he would get a start today. This season is write off for him if this is indeed true.

8381~~~
Kind of sad that 13 assists and 4 goals from the midfield is a write off, just goes to show you how misleading some stats can be.

8382~~~
Not a big deal with the form he's been in.

8383~~~
If we lose today the season will be a write off for us too. I can't wait for it to be over quite frankly.

8384~~~
He'll be ready just in time for the Copa America.

8385~~~
Considering his form I don't really care.

8386~~~
Conversely it may also illustrate the quality of the guy; out of form for majority of the season, yet our second most productive player.

8387~~~
Yup, some stats can be very misleading. Tbf to Di Maria, he started off very well and he looked excellent for us, it's just that his form got worse as the season went on. 

I know what you mean, I just want top 4 to be secured so we can move on. Big game today.

8388~~~
Disagree,but okay.

8389~~~
Another training injury? Fecking hell.

8390~~~
You disagree he's a brilliant player? His ability to create chances is amongst the best in world football.

13 assists from a poor season is just superb.

8391~~~
Of course you do. You put a negative spin on everything, with regards to di Maria. Would you rather a player like Young? 2 goals and 2 assists in his last 10 starts, whilst in the form of his career (United career) and 2/3 G/A in the entire season.

I don't understand the stats are misleading idea. Football is about results and stats; and whatever way you want to think of it, di Maria has directly contributed to us finishing (when we do) in the top 4. 

Reaching the finish line is far more important than how you got there.

8392~~~
NO. Everyone knows he's a brilliant player, his 13 assists weren't all brilliant though - i think about half of those assists have come from magic moments and the other half from sheer luck,or just average plays. It's very easy to call a season with 13 assists "superb" when in reality his season has been everything but superb.

8393~~~
he had those 3 goals in the first month though didn't he?

Very reminiscent of Veron, scored a stack of goals early on, then just faded

8394~~~
That's just nit picking to extremes though. Why can't anyone else on our team be so productive?

8395~~~
Expecting much more from him next year. Once we actually begin scoring a few goals his assist potential will become a world class threat.

8396~~~
Damn. fecking annoying. Really wanted him to kick on to roll over for next season.

8397~~~
I do not, criticising a World Class player for having a terrible season is putting a negative spin on everything regarding him? ok, you can sit there and convince yourself that his quality has been illustrated all you want, but the truth of the matter is those 13 assists don't tell the whole story and anyone who has watched Di Maria play this season will admit to it.

These Di Maria arguments are really fruitless anyway, some fans like to tell the truth and some don't, some know how to accurately analyse performances in the present, and some are captain hindsight's, there's really no need to go through this again, different individuals expect different things from WORLD CLASS players.

Like i said before

8398~~~
Because no other outfield player on our team is World Class?

8399~~~
So the whole creative burden is on Di Maria's shoulders? He's still been involved in 17 goals we have scored. Directly, indirectly, he's put chances on a plate for strikers quite a few times. His performances from the bench lately have hardly been inspiring but he's still contributed to the season, more so than most other outfield players, even if the general play and overall performances are not there with the other contributions.

8400~~~
If his stats don't illustrate it, what makes him a world class player ?

8401~~~
Where did you get that from?

8402~~~
Di Maria has been World Class this season?

8403~~~
You said no other outfield players are World Class, it's your words.

8404~~~
Is that a lie? do we have any other WC players on our team that i don't know about?

8405~~~
I've not stated that di Maria has had a good season, all I've said is that, given the circumstances, he's not been as awful as YOU keep stating. Yes, his performances haven't been great, yet he's still contributed. Does that not count for anything? According to you, no, it doesn't matter. You have to be doing something right if you can still bag assists every two games or so and a few goals in between. Or is it all luck? 

West Brom scored a very lucky goal against us, last week. However, do you think they care? You think they felt guilty after being crap all game and winning? They won and that's all that matters in the game in football, especially when the stakes are high. 

What can you can analyse from his last 6 or 7 substitute performances? During his time as a starter from September to March, he wasn't anywhere near as good as last season, yet he scored and assisted some incredibly important goals and performed well (on a rating scale of about 6/10, with the odd 7/10) every 2-3 games.

I, too, expected much more from him, but I can appreciate what he has done for us. We needed CL, next season, and he's helped get us there. That, for me, is all that matters, right now.

8406~~~
This happened when? According to me? putting words in my mouth now? i think you're trying to paint as something just so you can defend your precious Di Maria, i basically said his stats don't reflect his performances, but i guess you cant criticise someone on here.

8407~~~
It's not the point, you disagreed that his stats were a proof of his high qualities, and after that you said that it was normal to have stats like that because he was a world class player.

So his stats reflects his quality.

8408~~~
Read your posts in the thread. All you've done is dismissed his contribution.

Had any other midfielder in our team scored 4 and assisted 13, different things would have been said.

8409~~~
I never said it was normal to have stats like that because he was a WC player, the reason i brought up his status as a WC player was to point out the fact that he would have possession of the ball more than the average player and everything went through him up until the Arsenal game in february of course, when you combine that with his WC ability its easy to see why he'd have 6 brilliant assists and 7 fortunate ones.

But my overall point was that HIS STATS DONT REFLECT HIS PERFORMANCES which has been said a million times, his season hasn't gone the way we expected which is not necessarily a bad thing as he can make up for it next year, but it doesn't also excuse the fact that he hasn't had a spectacular match in 7 months.... but like i said, this has been said a million times, i just came here to break the injury news if you think his stats have reflected his performances then that nice.

8410~~~
Probably missed the ones where i praised him then, just so you could throw his stats at me to somehow vindicate his performances, but its okay, you believe what you want.

8411~~~
No own said that his stats reflected his performances, what has been said, is that his stats reflects his intrinsic qualities.

8412~~~
Maybe you should've just said that without replying to anyone then.

8413~~~
Better than you constantly dismissing his stats. Like I said before, and as <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> states, his stats reflect his qualities and not his performances.

8414~~~
Why on earth does he need crutches though and why wasn't this injury mentioned in LVG's presser?

8415~~~
For fecks sake. Was hoping he'd replace Mata/Young today. Another game of relentlessly pointless passing beckons while everyone blames the strikers.

8416~~~
Probably got injured after the presser?

8417~~~
I acknowledge his stats every single time,I'm concerned about performances. you and <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> can go and talk about his quality.

8418~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8419~~~
TF!?

8420~~~
Oh most definitely. Fellaini will add to that too.

8421~~~
Most talented player on the team and showed it more than enough times. Shame about how many injuries he picked up.

8422~~~
I said this a while ago, I think that Falcao and Di Maria just aren't suited to the EPL.
Skillwise, both are actually pretty good, but the physicality of our league is just something else.
In EU, some of the challenges would yield a freekick/foul (this is probably why we see Di Maria and Falcao fall on the floor so much), but in England, the ref doesnt give the foul.

LVG also realised that the EPL is a completely different animal compared to Spain, Germany and Holland.

BTW, it is being suggested that PSG might take Di Maria on loan for next year.

8423~~~
If they took him on loan you'd hope it was part of a permanent deal to bring Veratti here.

8424~~~
I like ADM and I'm happy if he stays as long as LVG actually thinks it through and has a plan. 

But if he goes to PSG then the money is no good to us. We'll sell him for 45m and then be forced to pay 40 for hummels or something, we are always held to ransom. If PSG want him, and they should as he would tear ligue un to shreds, then they should cough up a crown jewel, veratti or marquinos. 

We have an actualy bargaining chip this summer, we're not under massive pressure to sell, I really hope we get a good deal with ADM goes to PSG.

8425~~~
Biggest disappointment since Veron.

8426~~~
Where should he be played? Seems inconsistent on the wings. Fellaini's current position?

8427~~~
The fact that there's even talk about him leaving after one season sums up how bad he's been. Yeah, you could say that if Young and Fellaini can turn it around, so can Di Maria, however both of those players have already proven themselves in this league many times in the past.

8428~~~
Lets also not forget, there may be an issue that his family (and also him), who simply may not like it in England.
Like a mercenary, he could just do a "Falcao" and stay for the high wages and warm the bench, but if he (or his family) dont like it here, he may decide to take a wage cut and move to a country where he feels better suited.
Previously he has lived in Argentina, Portugal and Spain (all hot countries), so I imagine that the climate could also be an issue.

8429~~~
I doubt that is the case but if that is the case then they are stupid.

8430~~~
It's looking plausible that he could leave.

I think this would be a huge error.

1) It doesn't send a good message that you break your club transfer record and pay £60m for a player who is gone 12 months (or less) later.

2) di Maria certainly has the talent to turn it all around and become the best player in England. The first third of the season he was fantastic and still has 10 assists despite being piss poor since then.

3) If he does go, that is another player we will need to sign to replace him. If de Gea goes too, we could be looking at something like 7 signings. It will disrupt us again and put us back to square one. (and no I don't think Memphis is a di Maria alternative, I think we'd have signed him anyway)

Letting him leave on loan would just be idiotic and sad.

8431~~~
Not really.

8432~~~
Yeah, i don't get this either, the manager even commented on it which is strange because I've never seen this type of thing happen with a record signing before, i have this theory that the whole 'Depay rejecting PSG for us fiasco' was all premeditated, i mean you rarely see players talk about teams they rejected this early, even LVG spoke about PSG, so i think they are going to sign Di Maria, its kind of like "I'll fend off Liverpool against your boy Depay and you come in like a knight in shinning armour and swoop him at the last minute, then you give me a cut price deal for Di Maria, win-win for everyone."




I think i need to stop overthinking things.

8433~~~
Gary Birtles then.

8434~~~
That's quite some theory. Although, we don't win. We paid £60 million for di Maria, why would we sell him for a cut price? He's 27 and at his peak. Selling him would be really, really stupid. This isn't a Bebe or Anderson; we're talking about one of the best players on the planet. He's shown glimpses of what he can do, in this league, and he's got the ability to rip it apart. 

A front line of Depay, Rooney/Rvp, di Maria could be devastating next season.

8435~~~
Would Fellaini's current position not suit him perfectly? He could drop deep to receive the ball and take players on, his pace would be unreal on the counter attack and he has a fantastic workrate which would suit LVG's high pressing style.

8436~~~
He's not big enough to lump the ball at-I mean err-balance.

8437~~~
I'd be disappointed to see him leave before giving a second season a go. He's far too talented to just discard. He's blatantly struggling with confidence and concentration.

8438~~~
Give him until January and if no improvement, sell him. How has arguably the third best player in the world (straight after the WC) dropped to this level of performance? I think he's actually a liability to the team when he comes on at the moment, from giving the ball away. He's THAT low on confidence. I really wanted him to succeed.

8439~~~
I didn't think he had that good of a world cup though, I am sure there was one game (where I think he actually scored the winner) but he was getting slated for giving the ball away on so many occasions.

I still think we should keep him, though it wouldn't suprise me one bit if he was sold - slightly annoying that there is a Copa America this year.

8440~~~
He needs at least 2 more seasons for the massive fee we paid. He showed that has immense  talent and can score and assist on a regular basis even when not consistently in the team. I think he needs a good solid pre season behind him and a fresh slate. Build the team around him and we will see the fruits of that soon enough.

He can perform to hazard levels if he's in form and although he's been shit alot of the time this year he definitely needs to be given more opportunities to flourish. This season it's not been easy due to his injury and the form of some of our more unfancied players.

8441~~~
ouch , he does have 4 goals , some a bit flukey and assists that are the same. maybe another season. but birtles and veron spring to mind.

8442~~~
Hugely disappointing after a promising start, I wonder how much the house break in affected him.
I would give him the summer, get him back in preseason, hopefully happier to be here and then see how he goes. I think he's been affected more than most by this ultra rigid formation that LVG seems to favour. Games I remember him being at his best in for Madrid he popped up everywhere in midfield and along the front line. Hopefully LVG will play him more often next year and give him a bit of freedom to express himself.
He can be amazing, I just don't think he suits being tactically constrained like this.

8443~~~
He's been named in Argentina's Copa America squad, I guess that supposed ankle injury was incorrect.

8444~~~
So true. Some players are natural leaders and some are great at helping leaders.

8445~~~
I have mentioned it before in this forum but although originally a winger, we are currently playing him out of position when he comes on. He started the season as one of the midfield three and was immense in a lot of the earlier games.

I know he should be able to do it regardless, I remember watching him vs Germany in that early season friendly and he was so lethal

8446~~~
He will never play consistently in midfield for van Gaal, I’m sure of it. He’s not reliable on the ball and makes some brainless decisions at times. He will be playing in the front 3 so I’m not that concerned about what happens to him this summer, as a winger he’s replaceable.

He was good against worst opposition in the league but he also had some poor games in midfield.

Notice how much space Germany gave him to run into. He thrives in such games. Will never happen with LVG possession game.

Guys, out of curiosity, what makes you think that he will come good next season? I’m not saying he won’t, but I’ve seen very little that would suggest he can turns things around.

8447~~~
Let's see what the new season will bring but to see him in midfield with Herrera and a fit Carrick could be brilliant

8448~~~
Heard that he was on crutches last week, I really think that if we want to have a genuine crack at the league we need to look at the training methods. If we keep believing that the injuries are just bad luck then we are just being naive and it will keep costing us.

8449~~~
I'd be very annoyed if we sold him. Both at the club and at the player, because he's proven that he can perform to a high standard at United with those performances at the start of the season. But wanting to leave/wanting to sell him after the first sign of trouble? Just giving up? Maybe it'd be for the best if he did go, if that's the attitude, but I'd be very disappointed.

8450~~~
That's my hope to. It really is a shame we never got much chance for that to happen this season.

8451~~~
Agreed. A lot of people here wants us to throw money around since we have it and buy world-class players. Now it's not working right away and they wanna sell him.  First and foremost this should show that you can't just invest a ton of money and expect to get results. At the same time, even with big name players you're gonna have to be patient. It's up to van Gaal to find a way for di Maria to fit into this system.


I agree with this as well. All these injuries aren't a coincidence. Didn't van Gaal fire some people in the medical/athletic department for that reason? Seems like his choices didn't work out well either.

8452~~~
So his injury wasn't anything big and he's fit to play this weekend. Any chance of a start from him against Arsenal? His performances against Arsenal have been pretty good this season (red card aside), getting an assist in both games and generally looking dangerous. His sub appearances recently have been decent at best, but maybe he just needs to be trusted again in a big game from the off and he'll get some confidence back... A lot of people seem to have made their mind up on him, but if he can get back to his form from last season or the first few months of this season, he'd improve us no end.

8453~~~
He was dismal in that game in the cup, absolutely dismal before the red card. Personally, I don't want to see him start as he hasn't shown enough from the bench to deserve to start. I can only assume it's been the same in training, because Louis hasn't been in a rush to get him back in.

8454~~~
Yeah, I was at that game and I wasn't really impressed with him. He did some good things in the game but a pretty patch performance, for me Young's performances have been better and so Young deserves to start.

8455~~~
He really wasn't... Made a few good chances, looked a threat every time he got the ball, and had that great cross for the assist. The only way people would say he was bad was because they were pissed off at his prior form and then the red card happened and forgot about how he actually played, which wasn't actually bad (and we weren't bad as a team, we just shot ourselves in the foot with the goals we conceded).

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tohIR7LUvvo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Seriously, how can you watch that and say that was a bad performance? I'm half way in and he didn't put a foot wrong (though his one mistake which they don't show was not tracking back properly for their first goal).
Edit: Finished it now, the only thing that people could be pissed off at him for was the dive and tugging the referees shirt. Other then that, he had a very good game. You saying he was dismal shows you're either just against him, or don't remember that game at all, just the red.

8456~~~
Di Maria was excellent in almost every game he started. His bad performance have come recently after his injury when he was just thrown in sparingly for 30 minutes in a game. I think people except Di Maria to score goals  and make assists every game but that's impossible. Stats prove it, even with the limited game time he's got, he's our most productive player in terms of chances created.

van Gaal didn't give Di Maria a chance to get back into the team after his sending off and small injury. The most ridiculous thing is that the people slating Di Maria are mostly the ones who want Bale. Bale is nothing compared to Angel.

Di Maria is our best player and this isn't just an opinion, it's a fact. Everyone was drooling over his performances when he actually started games for us, I don't get all this negativity just because he's had a bad couple of substitute appearances.

8457~~~
You're right, perhaps I don't fully remember the game. I looked back at the comments during the game, and I was saying he was more good than bad, but very inconsistent. So you're right, maybe I let the red card cloud me after the fact. However, I never believe those little snippet videos that supposedly show a player's performance. What that clip conveniently leaves out is the complete and utter ball watching he did for the first goal, which I do remember very clearly. All game he was quite lazy with regard to his work, that kind of thing. I'd be very surprised if that video shows all his touches, because I certainly seem to remember him giving the ball away more than that in the first half ... but again, maybe I'm incorrect.

Regardless, that game was a long time ago, and recently, he's been very poor when coming on. He shouldn't start.

8458~~~
Capable of being one of the greatest players ever to walk onto the OT pitch. Can't wait to see him once he's settled into the team.

8459~~~
No way would I let him go. He's had a tough time settling in his first year. That's happened to plenty of players in their first seasons in England. If he picks up his form and gets back to his best next season, he'll basically be our best player. Such a creative player and could become a huge part of a top team of ours in the future.

8460~~~
That's a bit over the top. Capable of being our best player currently for sure. In fact he will be if he returns to his former self. But this club has all time greats so I don't think he'll get <i>there</i>.

8461~~~
I'd start him on Sunday. The pressure is off. He's not had much luck coming off the bench, trying to make a big enough impact to win us the game. He can't do it on his own. Give him a start, let him grow into the game and play with a bit of freedom

8462~~~
He should get his mojo back next season. Top players don't tend to lose it for too long, but I do hope he embraces the physicality of the league. That's basically the only thing can stop him from being a big force in this league.

8463~~~
His confidence will return this summer with Argentina.

8464~~~
He was very good in the Arsenal game.

8465~~~
The boy has everything to be a great for us. If this is such a great club its about time we acted great and stuck by this lad. He shone for Real and he can shine for us nothing over the top about it!

8466~~~
I don't think he's going anywhere unless he forces a move

8467~~~
Who would you start him in place of?

8468~~~
Fantastic to hear his ankle injury isn't bad <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8469~~~
I dont know if he'll force a move, that sounds extreme, but it seems probable at this point that he'll ask us to let him go if PSG or similar come in for him this summer.
At the end of the day it seems heavily reliant on his family life, which we know nothing of other than what little the media told us after the break in.

8470~~~
He could shine as brightly as he wants, he'll never reach be one of the greatest Utd player.

8471~~~
Would like to see him given a free role in the AMC behind RVP today. Let Herrera / Fellaini be the midfield base and just let Di Maria run havoc and do what he wants. 

He isn't a player that works well with instructions, but he will naturally run and help his team on instinct. He also plays best when allowed to work the space in the middle, as boxing him out wide makes him easier to mark IMO.

8472~~~
Wont happen, never, at least under van Gaal.

8473~~~
He already played in the free role for us <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

8474~~~
So what's the general consensus on here regarding his future? Is he going to push for a move this summer? Surely we hold the cards seen as he still has 4 years on his contract. Personally would love him to settle in with the other new signings and rediscover his form. However, can't seethe point of having a player who doesn't want to be here!

8475~~~
It hasn't been a successful signing yet obviously, but at times I think people went a bit over the top. He hasn't been <i>that </i>bad. I think next season on the left side of a midfield 3 he could be quality for us.

It amazes me when people put him on the wing in their line-ups. For me, he's just not a winger. He is so much better in a central position, collecting the ball in deep areas and bringing it forward.

8476~~~
When? He played as a LCM a while and then as a winger, but I dont think he played a free role.

8477~~~
So who honestly thinks he will still be here when the new season starts?

8478~~~
Count me in.

8479~~~
Me too.. Don't think he is going anywhere..

8480~~~
I've read nothing trustworthy that he's unhappy enough to leave, the last statement he made was that ManUtd was going to be his last club in Europe before he moves back to Argentina. The comment van Gaal made about a player having the choice to leave is normal, he's like that with every player. If a player doesn't want to be here, he will let them go. In Di Maria's case this is difficult though since the club payed big for him, don't need money and he still has a 4 year contract. The only way he would leave if is he forces a move, but even then he's dependable on other clubs paying big since the club won't sell him for a major loss. The only clubs who could realistically afford him are RM and Bayern (both not gonna happen), or a FFP-struck PSG who could only buy Di Maria without strenghtening elsewhere. I doubt they're interested since they already went for a cheaper alternative in Memphis.

I think he's unlucky that Young and particulary Mata both are doing well in the positions Di Maria can play in, I don't think we'll see him in midfield anytime soon or next season. Mata can't play in midfield either this season because of the balance, and he's been good enough to keep his place. Di Maria might be unhappy now, but next season once he's settled in he'll be fine I reckon.

8481~~~
He is not going anywhere.

8482~~~
We all want him to stay, but there's still a chance that PSG might try to steal him this summer, that decision is down to the player...but i dont think he'll push for a move after one season.

8483~~~
Oh people, he has specifically said that he wants to fight here and make history

8484~~~
This is a generic statement though.

8485~~~
Good to hear he wants to stay next season and prove himself. I would be gutted if he was sold in the summer.

8486~~~
We could probably recoup £40 million but another poor season next year and we'd be lucky to get £20 mil. He should be our star player.

8487~~~
Can we assume he won't be here next season then?

8488~~~
You've not read what he said last night?

8489~~~
He was warming up from when Falcao went off and presumably would have come on were it not for the de Gea/Valdes swap.

8490~~~
No need,he will be here next season as our main man.

8491~~~
We should keep him. Next season he could be superb.

Him and Bale either wing would be amazing.

8492~~~
Blackett coming on for Rojo made zero sense. 

Di Maria should have been used today.

8493~~~
No i must've missed it, I've not been paying attention to ADM in recent weeks tbh.

8494~~~
He will be here next season and hopefully have settled in a bit more.

Fellaini and Young have been performing admirably but to win a title we need players of his quality to start week in and week out.

8495~~~
Not really. Rojo hadn't been injured for quite a long time. About time he was given a rest.

8496~~~
Well the quotes would probably answer your question.

8497~~~
Disappointed he didn't get a game today. Was refreshing to hear the quotes last night. At least the Caf psychologists can leave it for a while.

8498~~~
He was primed for the second half. I literally can't think of a better team and a better situation for him to come on against.

What a shame we went for Blackett and RVP.

8499~~~
Shame he didn't play today really I want to see him start/play in the last game. He hasn't been the same since the robbery incident but I think we have to remember he is genuinely one of the best players in the world. If he's happy to stay in England I want to see him back in the side in the sort of form he was in at the beginning of the season. He hasn't been that bad he just wasn't himself for a while and form of other players means he has struggled to get minutes.

8500~~~
FAO of the "flop" and "sell him" brigade...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/2457559/di-maria-ospina-are-leaders-in-some-key-prem-stats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/tactic...ria-ospina-are-leaders-in-some-key-prem-stats</a>

8501~~~
i'd be very disappointed if he was to leave. i think he'll be great 2nd season. giving him back his starting spot next season will not only be smart for the team but also help his confidence.

8502~~~
Put it this way: players generally tend to become worse in their second season. ADM can only get better. He's not going to have another season like the current one. Even in his supposedly worst season he managed to get near the top of the assist charts.

8503~~~
I'd like to see him stay for another year and see if he could get back that early form he showed for us but i don't think its going to happen. His heart isn't in it, whether thats because of what he went through with the burglary or whatever. I don't think he wants to be here regardless of what he says to the media.

8504~~~
Not suprising, been saying this for a while, unfortunately though other apsects of his game have been letting him down.
He'll get back to a high level though no doubt, as this kind of stat shows

8505~~~
True, but some of the assists had more to do with the goalscorers (against Everton it was a bad shot which Falcao deflected, again Liverpool it was a bad pass, in the back of Mata, but Mata reacted brilliantly, and the same can be said for Rooney's goal against Villa).

The assist against Burnley was good and the whole game he was really good, but there you can see the difference between an assist and an "assist".

8506~~~
And what about the countless chances our forwards have missed that he has put on a plate for them? Hes had a poor season, but in terms of creating chances he has been very effective.

8507~~~
How many actually? The beginning of season was good and some games later, but the rest was really bad and he still got some good numbers there (Liverpool and Villa he was awful and still managed 2 assist). 

And the number for creating chances never makes any sense to me, as it looks like every cross in the box i a chance created.

8508~~~
Play him in a proper midfield next season and he will be brilliant again. We need players like him, especially now where we struggle to create chances or open up other teams. We have 60+ % ball possession but cant do much with it. Hence he's the player who could complete the puzzle

8509~~~
The problem is we would need to change our style and LVG doesn't want it. Herrera was to adventurous for LVG, so you can imagine what he thinks of di Maria (as a winger it would probably be different, but we have to admit that he was really bad as a winger).

8510~~~
I'm more talking about from the games I watch tbh, not stats. As for the highlighted point, that was what I was saying, although he has had a poor season, there is no reason to deny he has been effective in creating chances.

I don't remember all of the top of my head but even in his first game Burnley away 0-0 he created at least 2 excellent chances one for RVP.
Spurs away (again another 0-0) he put one on a plate for RVP and another for I think Falcao. The Arsenal game where he got sent off, he created a very good chance for I think Fellaini.

The point I was making though was that just as you named a couple of assists that he got (where the pass could have been better), there are also chances that he put on a plate for people that they missed.

End of the day, he as a player has been effective in terms of chance creation. Where he has messed up mainly is his loosing the ball too easily in dangerous areas, and going to ground too easily too.

I don't think its fair to critise him for his ability to create chances, or try and discredit him when hes been one of our best players in that particular respect. In other aspects of his game, fair play he needs to do alot better.

8511~~~
I do understand what you mean and I agree about the first part, I like how he played (some really good games, some not that good, but dangerous), but the last part of the season was bad and the assist which he got didn't come because of some great pass, so you can say OK, he was bad, but got that moment in him. He didn't have even that (and that's what worries me), he was really, really bad, almost to hard to understand as someone may like him, or not, but he is better than that. 

I do not try to discredit his ability to create chances, but again, he did send most of the balls inside the box, every time he thought it could be something done he crossed the ball, which other players didn't do as they were not allowed to do it (so again, not that he really worked hard for all these chances). 

Again, he won us the game against Burnley, the run before the goal against QPR was brilliant, even the counter against Arsenal was great when he missed, same of the goals he scored were really good, and these are the things I would like to see, as he can do it, but I am worried that it will not be possible to use him to his best with LVG, as he is not a huge fan of players like that, unless he improves a lot on the wingers position.

8512~~~
Has been a poor-mans Nani this season. Would keep him for one more year to see if he grows some bollocks. If not get rid.

8513~~~
Predict he will have a very good year next year - not a £60m player type year, but definitely a £35m player, which is what he is really worth, type year.

8514~~~
This kind of post makes no sense. Last season he was the definition of big game player at Madrid. This season he started off brilliantly, got injured and then had issues in his personal life. He's come back in and never really been given a real run of games and this will never help a player's confidence. I hope he has a good tournament with Argentina and comes back with some form.

8515~~~
Ermmm yeah, sound like Nani then <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

8516~~~
Poor man's Nani? Chill.

8517~~~
I don't think Depay would be too happy about that.

8518~~~
I enjoyed this:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/watch-manchester-united-winger-di-9304918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ews/watch-manchester-united-winger-di-9304918</a>

I think I also remember seeing a training/exhibition shot from Di Maria - when he took a corner and scored, directly from it.

I really wish he could do some of these tricks in real matches - the guy is undoubtedly talented and I want to see more flair from him next year.

8519~~~
No team in the world would treat Di Maria the way we have this season. 

Completely messed around our most talented outfield player.

8520~~~
Arsenal?

8521~~~
??

8522~~~
What have we done to him actually? He was given a chance on a wing and in midfield, he failed to cement his spot in either of those positions, he failed to adapt his game to LVG's instructions. Look at Herrera, took him time to get into our XI due to subordination issues yet when he's turned it around he played nearly every game and became one of our leading outfield players.

You'd think we gave him a mining pick and asked him to work in quarry.

8523~~~
We never gave him the chance to settle properly. That's been the problem and it's down to van Gaal.

We played him as a LCM for the first few games: He played alongside Fletcher in CM against Burnley and LCM from QPR -Everton.
We moved him to the left wing for the games against WBA to Palace.
He then played right wing in a 3-5-2 against Arsenal, and then got injured playing right wing in a 4-4-2 against Hull.
Following his return from injury, he got injured again against Villa playing on the left.
Following his return from his second injury, he played as a SS against Yeovil, Southampton and QPR (seriously...? wtf?).
He then finished his first season (as a starter) by interchanging between the left and right wing.

He and Rooney have had it the worst, this season. Constantly shifting positions, but have got on with their jobs and still contributed brilliantly towards the cause. Not a coincidence that our two best players are the ones who have contributed the most whilst playing in, nearly, every possible position. It's a testament to how talented the two are and how we should have played them in their rightful positions to be able to extract the best out of them. Injuries haven't helped us, but neither did our manager. Rooney and di Maria should have been two players nailed on to start in their best positions.

8524~~~
Looks like he's getting a shot in midfield today!

8525~~~
Really pleased. I really like this player and want him to succeed here.

8526~~~
Looks like he's playing in his favoured position, although it could be Mata as the ten.

Cmon Angel show us your class.

8527~~~
Glad he is in the starting eleven. It baffled me how he went from a player that was an absolute joy to watch, to a substandard version of Nani before his move to Lisbon. Hopefully, he can play with no pressure today and show to the fans what he is truly capable of. If he is incapable of that, it is best we hurriedly cash in on him, before his evaluation goes into the United median sale price <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>...then fund Bale move <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8528~~~
What's the odds on a Di Maria goal then?

8529~~~
Come on Di Maria I'm looking forward to seeing him tearing through that hull midfield.

8530~~~
Saying on the home page that he's playing left wing, with Young centre midfield. However, sky showing him in midfield. Hope he is in midfield. His best games have come from that position.

EDIT: 

He is playing left wing. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

8531~~~
Yep on the left Young is in centre mid.

8532~~~
Injured

8533~~~
Or not up for it.

feck him off already ffs

8534~~~
Clearly wasn't the case.

8535~~~
Pathetic.

8536~~~
Just about sums up his season, sad for him.

8537~~~
The "dream" season.

8538~~~
Seems clear to some that whatever he's said recently he doesn't want to be here.

Liability.

8539~~~
Was there actually anything wrong with him?

8540~~~
You'd think he never really wanted to go here in the first place. I know he didn't want to leave Real.

8541~~~
Jesus Christ. The physio was on the pitch after the initial time he got a knock, the fact Adnan was ready to come on immediately says the Physio probably told Van Gaal that AdM was struggling.

Peoples agenda is embarrassing.

8542~~~
He looked like he was in a lot of pain after he got hit in the balls/stomach.

8543~~~
Although that's not his fault, he has two choices, get a grip and sort himself out, accept Madrid didn't want him and put his heart and soul in to a club that does. Or he can become a mercenary and float from club to club earning a fortune but never really settling or finding a home again. I still hope he choses the first because a dedicated Di Maria is an asset to any side, especially United because he's tailor made for us.

8544~~~
I've no agenda against anyone. But I've got a nose for anyone who's swinging the lead and that fecker is taking the piss

8545~~~
Really impressed by his commitment & toughness. Should fit right in at Paris.

8546~~~
It seems easy to knock him out of the game.

8547~~~
If a player says he can't carry on what's the call then? I don't have any agenda but I've seen nothing that could have injured him in this game.

8548~~~
It's not neccesarily that easy though. Some people struggle to adapt to a new culture and country. It doesn't help that the robbery in his house apperantly really scared his family, and him being injured or played out of position for most of the season.

8549~~~
Did you not see his clash with El Mohamady?

Besides this match is of no importance. Why risk anything if you feel you might be injured.

8550~~~
That's to be decided between the physio and management. van Gaal wouldn't of played him if he wasn't up for it.

8551~~~
Some of you wanna-be psychics need a reality check that you actually don't know s**t.

8552~~~
I agree, hence why i'm not slagging him off or declaring he is shite or just not up for it. It's not his fault he was sold, nor that he was robbed, or injured, nor is it his fault his place was taken by the un-droppable Young.

8553~~~
Some of you lot are hilarious.

8554~~~
I saw him slip and thigh someone in the balls but nothing else, I'll have to check it again at half time.

8555~~~
In that challenge at WORST he will have been winded there's nothing else in it.

The impact isn't big enough to cause any other sort of damage. I still reckon he'll leave this summer of the chances arises

8556~~~
How is this not his fault?

8557~~~
That's the one.

8558~~~
We've got some great conspiracies in here. 

Looked like he was wearing a PSG jersey underneath his United one.

8559~~~
Won't be here next year. I'd put my fecking stones on it.

8560~~~
He was still playing LW with Young as the LCM...

8561~~~
Only thing that makes sense is if LvG wanted to test Di Maria as a winger for next season.

8562~~~
fecking hell the state of some of you lot in here, embarrassing. He's had a shite season but he got injured, it happens.

8563~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Some people here are just...

8564~~~
What a terrible season regarding ADM<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8565~~~
Too many idiots in this thread. Embarrassing

8566~~~
Di Maria has been a bag of piss this season, there's no other way to put it. Hopefully the injury isn't too bad and he turns things around next season, but dearie me...

8567~~~
No. It’s final day of the season and we’re playing friendly game. He doesn’t want to test anything, he just doesn’t trust Di Maria in midfield.

8568~~~
You do get the feeling certain players who had a point to prove would have stayed on.

8569~~~
Yet he has the second most assists (10) in the PL this season. Only played 23 games.

8570~~~
Stats never tell the full story. He's been a big disappointment, I don't think anyone can deny that.

8571~~~
Yes, of course. I'm very disappointed, but saying he's been a bag of piss is harsh. Balotelli would qualify for that tag though.

8572~~~
Mainly because of his fee, which he didn't have anything to do with.

8573~~~
Not necessarily. He came here with a high profile and vast experience being a key man for Real Madrid and his country. On that basis, you'd really expect much better.

8574~~~
Are you kidding me? A large majority of our team has been "piss poor", this entire season. It's hard to excel when you're surrounded with players who aren't playing well, too. Relatively speaking, he hasn't been that bad, at all.

8575~~~
He certainly hasn't played at that level but much of the expectation came from his fee. Same with Bale at Madrid. You can't overpay for a player without the fans expecting a return that corresponds with the fee, which almost always leads to disappointment. Di Maria is basically a 40m player who had an off, injury plagued year in a foreign country. He will be much more influential next year.

8576~~~
Precisely my point. Rooney and RvP had poor seasons by their standards, but we don't hear much about them because neither involved a massive transfer fee last summer.

8577~~~
Jesus, this is just airbrushing of history. He got dropped from the starting lineup after  performances where he seemed to have never played the game before in his life so awful was he.

8578~~~
Before that he got played out of position for several games, and lost what little confidence he might've had left at that point.

8579~~~
We didn't pay that kind of money to get a fragile little flower.

8580~~~
No, you couldn't be more wrong if you tried. He was the best player on the pitch against Arsenal, even after his sending off... He wasn't able to regain a starting position as we started to look slightly more cohesive, as a unit during a 5 or 6 week period.

8581~~~
I forget, how much did you contribute towards his fee?

8582~~~
That's our own fault then. If our scouting is at the level it should be we should've known by the time we signed him that he is a fragile little flower.

8583~~~
DOesn't really matter whose idea it was now. Nobody could have expected him to be so weak mentally. All that matters is that the situation is fixed, and if PSG are really interested then we can maybe get in a new player who won't wilt so badly.

8584~~~
So you think we signed a player for £60m without thoroughly looking into his psyche?

8585~~~
I dread to ask, but how do you normally thoroughly look into a persons psyche? Do you use some kind of machine?

8586~~~
Remember when fergie told nani to hobble about with crutches and pretend to be injured? This place sometimes. Why carry on if you feel something go? Risk being out for ages in a game that really didn't matter much.

8587~~~
I get that you're frustrated, but come on really?

I'd think evaluating his performances on the pitch, in training, talking to his former managers, looking at how he has reacted to defeats, his team going down during a match etc. would be a good start.

8588~~~
This season has been a complete disaster for him. Hopefully his second will be better.

8589~~~
Can't catch a break.

8590~~~
Was it anything serious? If so he could miss Copa America.

8591~~~
What a terrible season. Must be his worst season ever.

8592~~~
Frustrating to see him go off so early today. Hopefully he'll get a summer off and be ready to take the league by storm next year.

8593~~~
Lets hope so. The rest + pre season with United would be best for his carreer. Don't think he will miss the Copa though, he's one of their best players.

8594~~~
Today summed up his season. Van Gaal played him on the wing, I guess because that's where he wants to start him next season, but he just doesn't do it for me on the wing.

8595~~~
Copa America is this summer.

8596~~~
Didnt watch the game, he got injured early? 
is it sthing serious?

8597~~~
Didnt he start in midfield?

8598~~~
Nope. He played left wing. Young played in centre midfield.

8599~~~
Don't think so. Doesn't look that way anyway.

8600~~~
If there is a club interested in handing out good money for him, I would certainly be open to a move.  He had a good few games when he first started but he quickly lost his edge.  Even knowing the circumstances (injuries, house robbery, new country, etc.), for 60M you expect a player to maintain a certain standard and he has been poor.  IMO you can't even make a case for paying 30 or 40M with the form he's had.  The fact that Young has gotten playing time over him says a lot and it's no given that he will turn it around in the PL next season.

8601~~~
Very very unlucky. next season Im sure he would turn things around.

8602~~~
It remains to be seen whether Di Maria can fit into LVG's system. I don't think he's the answer as a left-winger because he hasn't really got the two-footedness to come inside and it makes him very predictable. Even in situations where he gets past the full-back we haven't really got strikers who are particularly good at challenging defenders in the air on out-swinging crosses.

The big question for me concerns the reasoning behind LVG's reluctance to take risks in midfield. The fact that Young was preferred there over Di Maria against Hull speaks volumes in that respect. From what I gather it's a mainstay of his philosophy (possession football with dynamic risk-takers in the wide areas and up-front). Unless he loosens that restriction slightly next season I don't think we'll see Di Maria much in the midfield. It's possible that with a couple of signings to solidify the defence and midfield and an injection of pace up top in the form of Depay he'll feel far more comfortable playing him there.

8603~~~
Too light weight for the BPL. The difference between him and McShane was glaring today. One had 2 small stud marks on his stomach and had to go off the other had major cuts to both his leg and head and yet carried on.

This has been his downfall all season he goes down under the slightest attention and stays there while the player who took the ball of him runs down the other end and creates a chance. 

He needs to man up next season if he wants to make it in the BPL.

8604~~~
I certainly want him to stay and try again next season

But for the first time since Berbatov I'm left questioning if he really gave 100% this season.

It's funny that I can only think of 3 players in my life supporting the club who I really have questioned their commitment. All 3 were transfer records: Veron, berbasloth and di Maria

8605~~~

8606~~~
I don't, because he's clearly not trying now. He looks really disinterested on the field, like he's going through the motions.

I don't care how good he is when he tries, if he's not prepared to try for us then what's the point in keeping him?

8607~~~
Agreed. Really can't believe he didn't risk worsening his injury for this titanic fixture. We could have missed out on winning the league... Oh wait. Well, we could have missed out on the CL... Oh wait.

8608~~~
Because when you spend that kind of money and have a player with real quality it's worth giving them another chance

If he has the same type of year next season then he can feck right off

8609~~~
Agreed. Given his quality and the amount we spent we cant afford to let him leave after one season... That said if we receive a big offer from PSG I think he'll be off

8610~~~
I like him but I think it's best all round if we can offload him and recoup sum of the fee. If PSG paid 50m for David Luiz...

I just don't rate him that highly as a winger/wing-forward, and LVG clearly has no intention of playing him in midfield.

8611~~~
He's been light weight all season my abiding memory of ADM this season is him lying on the floor while the player who looked at him runs away with the ball. 

Today just highlighted how soft he is compared to the average BPL player.

8612~~~
So far, all the doubts I had when we signed him have turned out to be right. Horrendous season for him.

8613~~~
After he got hit, he continued, though? And van Gaal clearly stated he came off because of a hamstring problem. Which BPL player has played an entire game with a hamstring issue?

8614~~~
Diego Costa. Regularly.

8615~~~
I rememeber that game in September I think, where he had 4 assists against the world cup winning German team. Thought he would be world class here <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8616~~~
He was!

...for the first 5 or so games.

8617~~~
Great example, a guy who is riddled with hamstring problems for over a year and been on/off the pitch because of it. Why risk a bad hamstring injury in a game like this? Maybe Costa should have played through against Madrid in the CL last season too.

8618~~~
Even his shitty shots were making assists back then!

8619~~~
He was fantastic in that game. Playing out wide. Which goes against the caf rhetoric about his issues for United being all about the position he's being asked to play.

8620~~~
Another who needs putting on the spot early this summer. If his heart and head are in it, I'd happily give him another year to turn it around.

Any sign otherwise and I imagine the interest from PSG will be encouraged somewhat.

My gut feeling is that he'll stay.

8621~~~
I was answering his question. 

I couldn't care less about Di Maria going off. Typified his season so far but meh, I really don't give a toss about what happened today.

8622~~~
The fact Young played in the AM/#10 role in midfield today instead of him should surely put an end to the idea that LvG has any intention of using him like Real Madrid did in the PL.

8623~~~
Hope he proves himself next season. We need to seriously beef up the midfield and sort out the "balance" of the squad.

He is a brilliant player but we need to provide the defensive solidarity and midfield industry to get the best out of the likes of ADM.

We definitely need someone like him to create chances for us because this possession football nonsense is rubbish when it comes to us scoring goals.

8624~~~
Sorry but when I think of him this season this is the picture I have in mind:
I don’t know what happened to him today and why he got subbed, but he struggles with the physicality in the EPL (it’s a cliché but it looks like he is the perfect example of it). We should give him another season to prove himself blah blah blah, but I would sell him as he won’t be a midfielder under van Gaal regime I’m sure.

8625~~~
And he worsened his injury, did he not?

8626~~~
Since the 2-1 defeat at Swansea he's played 268 minutes. We've played 12 games in that time so averaging 22mins a game (he didn't play at all for Spurs, Palace and Arsenal though so 30mins in that case). I can't see him staying.

8627~~~
Yeah and my big problem is while he's sat there like that the game is going on without him and we are left defending a man light.

8628~~~
Too brave for his own good. A flaw I would prefer our players to have, if the alternative was the opposite.

8629~~~
No, it's called stupidity.

Who knows how long Carrick continued on with that injury (against City) and what affects it may have had. Definitely ended the tiniest (very, very tiny) of chances of winning the league and a third place finish. Considering our luck with injuries, I'd be surprised if we'd even allow a player to continue playing on with the hint of any injury.

8630~~~
Let's hope he finds his form next season and can play in midfield like he did at RM. New season, new chance

8631~~~
I want him to stay.

8632~~~
I want he to stay but he needs to toughen up or average teams will muscle him out of the game. I don't think any player can be judged on their first season but he needs to adapt to the BPL if he is going to make it.

8633~~~
This summer might be the only opportunity to get something decent by selling him. If he has another season like the one he had, then we might have to pay to get rid of him.

8634~~~
If PSG do offer 50m it would be hard to turn down, especially if as it does appear as if di Maria isn't happy here. He will always be a disappointment because we paid twice his value and he will always be hit and miss, he will never live up to the price tag. 

He is a good player though so we need to either be prepared to live with that and stick with him or sell him this summer if we aren't.

8635~~~
I'm all for giving players a second chance if there is at least some hope for them to come good, unfortunately with Di Maria i don't have faith in him to make it here. 
He looks horribly out of place in LvG's philosphy, if PSG came in with a bid close to the 60m i would take it and move on, would benefit both us and him imo.

8636~~~
Aye, Di Maria's cautious approach today was obviously with the greater good of Manchester United in mind.

8637~~~
Same old, same old.

8638~~~
He's a smashing player, but he needs to start showing it for united.

the problem is now we are in the off season, a big offer near where we paid for him and i could see the club seriously considering it.

Big summer ahead for him.

8639~~~
I definitely hope we keep him. A disappointing season all in after his great start, but he's shown some glimpses of good form. We're certainly not going to get anywhere near what we originally paid for him, so I'd persevere at the moment and hope he can translate his assist figures into overall performances.

8640~~~
I'd be very surprised if anyone bid near to what we paid for him considering he's been fairly average this season.

8641~~~
But his stats....

8642~~~
His stats have been good obviously, but I'm sure plenty of teams will know that he's been far from great.

8643~~~
His  good Madrid form is still fresh enough in the memory, hence we might get a big bid.
Another poor season  and his value will plummet.

We need to sell him now for a big fee, or get him firing on all cylinders.

8644~~~
Perhaps, although I'm really not sure that a lot of big sides will gamble. If he does then perform, his value will still be high: there's arguably no reason for them to come in early on when it's a much bigger risk.

8645~~~
Somehow I blame v Gaal for his poor season playing him in 4/5 different positions over the season. There's no doubt he's a class act. Even when in such poor form he still looked our most dangerous player. 

5.5/10

8646~~~
Position or not poor form is poor form, mistakes are mistakes, attitude and so on. 

Anyway very poor season by him I hope he'll improve next season.

8647~~~
I didn't say anything close to that.

How come you weren't of the same opinion when De Gea went off against Arsenal? Don't remember many questioning whether he should have continued playing. Or Ashley Young against Stoke, earlier in the season; He pulled his hamstring and went off. 

Honestly, it would seem you (and others) have an agenda against him. It's crazy to assume that he should have stayed on to worsen his injury just to appease fans/critics like yourselves.

8648~~~
id like him to stay... a couple of decent additions and a system that can get the ball to him and give him options to use it could prove the making of him

8649~~~
The cafe.

8650~~~
Fair enough. I got sucked into a tangential argument when - like I said - I don't care that he went off injured. I just thought it was representative of his whole season. Exciting to see him start a game for us but ultimately disappointing and unable to cope with the physicality of a PL game (a stark contrast to imports like Suarez, Costa and Sanchez - who seem to relish a battle). 

I accept he probably had no option but understand why people are peeved.

8651~~~
I agree, he does seem to be a bit scared of a challenge. I don't blame him, he's skinny as f*ck. Needs to gain some weight.

8652~~~
If I'm being honest, I'd rather cut our losses and buy a player that is either world class in midfield or world class on the wing. Di Maria is neither. He's way too lightweight and careless to be playing in the middle in the PL and as we all knew, wildly inconsistent playing down the wing.

8653~~~
Hard to believe he made it onto this list after such a shocking season:

8654~~~
It is indeed. Although the presence of Chris Brunt on that list with the same number shows how cautiously you should interpret assists when judging a player's value.

8655~~~
If Di Maria had been fit and played regularly he'd of gotten more assists than Fabregas. That I'm of no doubt. Get him fit, confident and firing, and in a three man midfield there isn't much better.

8656~~~
I just have the feeling like he'll be off in the summer, doesn't look as if he's enjoying it here and PSG could be an escape route for him and his family off the pitch, I'd give him alot of credit if he does decide to stay and fight on next season though.

8657~~~
He's been fecking terrible and there have been games this season where he's genuinely looked like he didn't really care that much.

If PSG offer anything £40M or above I'd sell him.

8658~~~
Strange that Young started in front of him as part of the midfield three last night. Chances of him staying aren't very bright, imo.

8659~~~
I would swap him for Verratti at this point if PSG wants him.
If we need a CM that can do it all, thats our man.

8660~~~
TBH, after the break in he was not mentally with us anymore.
Its as disappointing as the Falcao situation.

8661~~~
It's fine saying give him a second season but he has to actually want it, and personally I just don't think he looks like a player that does, it just seems to me that he has figured out by now that this league is not a fit for him physically.

8662~~~
Hope PSG take him off our hands for a decent fee.

8663~~~
He has been awful and he's not going to magically get better after a pre season which he won't have since he's got Copa America and the Prem starts much earlier too due to the Euro's next year.

Take the £50million if anyone offers it, and re invest for someone who suits how LVG wants to play.

8664~~~
I wonder if all the same people were saying sell Fellaini and Young last year?

That being said, Argies just don't work for us do they? We could sign Messi and Maradona's genetically engineered baby and he'd underperform for us.

8665~~~
This kind of thinking I just don't understand. fair enough if we were a poor team which needed the money to reinvest. We don't. Di Maria, when on form, is one of our top 2 or 3 players, if not the best. But let's hope another team signs him, yeah. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

8666~~~
Doesn't fit the team, reportedly doesn't want to adhere to LVG's instructions, wife and children obviously don't want to be here after the robbery and probably didn't want to be anyway and I doubt he's particularly fond of the place either.

Chances of his form, attitude and general play improving are pretty slim, might as well cut our losses and get rid.

8667~~~
If he leaves I'll be shocked tbh. It makes no sense to splash a PL record fee on a guy one year and then sell him off after one bad season for a loss. I dont get why his heart doesnt seem to be in it. Maybe he just doesnt like Manchester or has fallen out with LvG but his complete and utter lack of desire to play is mind boggling. 

Personally, I would not sell unless Veratti is in the equation and while it will be at a loss I dont think the club should except less than 50m. I'd keep him one more year and if his form does not improve we can cut our losses then and sell him off to Paris.

8668~~~
I think he'll come back stronger next season and get back to his usual level. Needs to work on his strengh and get back to his "fighting" ways at Madrid. The bugger used to chase every lose ball.

8669~~~
A lot of talk about him going to PSG. I would like to see him fight his way into the team next year but if he's not happy here he may be off. I actually think he was one of the best players in the league earlier in the season so he can do it here.

8670~~~

8671~~~
Di Maria missing the Copa America would be bad for us.

8672~~~
It's much more disappointing. Falcao at least showed some fighting spirit and determination in the face of incredible difficulty. De Maria seems weak, physically and mentally, in comparison.

8673~~~
Agree, I would like to see him come back from it on a high and full of confidence.

8674~~~
He had a bad season and people on here making him seem like Obertan, i think people need to chill and see how he does next season if he stays.
One or two good performances next season and everyone will be calling him our best player, like they did in his first few games for us where he was head and shoulders above the rest!

8675~~~
Even if misses to recuperate it wouldn't be so bad. If he goes despite having an injury and plays when he's 70%, that would suck balls.

8676~~~
You are right.... Falcao was clearly 100% invested in the club, as is Herrera and Blind.

Whatever inertia ADM initially came in faded fast...after the injury and the break in he does not seem to be mentally or physically with the rest of the team. His market value is still around £50M and I think we should seriously consider swapping him for Verratti as that is the man our midfield really needs.

Gundogan would be equally good for us IMO, as long as his spinal injury does not resurface.

8677~~~
So he shouldn't be criticised for his performances this season because he might be world class next season?

8678~~~
astonishing that he ended the season second in assists to Fabregas.

Most people's perception is that he's been massively disappointing.
Does feel very Veron like, in that he made a storming start then just withered away though.

Really do wonder what's in Van Gaal's mind. Depay is coming in, Mata's been shoehorned in out wide. You have Young and Januzaj. Interesting conundrums.

EDIT ...just seen Cazorla snuck into second.

8679~~~
Angel Di Maria suffered only a coup. They did studies and there is no muscle injuries. It will soon be in Argentina.

8680~~~
The fecks a coup?

8681~~~
I think they mean knock or blow.

8682~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8683~~~
He did suffer a coup in all fairness, overthrown by Ashley Young.

8684~~~
I'd give him to PSG for Verratti plus Pastore. We'd probably have to add cash on to that. The question is, how much do they want him?

8685~~~
PSG are hit by FFP, I don't think they're interested in Di Maria because of the price we paid. There's no chance they'll trade Marquinhos/Verratti either, they've got some older players but El-Khelaifi is in it for the long run. Getting one of them is a muppet dream but unrealistic and not going to happen. They went after Memphis, a much cheaper option, already.

The club won't sell Di Maria for a loss, that's just not going to happen. Unless PSG are willing to spend most (if not all) of their budget on Di Maria he's staying here. There aren't many clubs out there who could afford him or even want him right now.

8686~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Very good.

Hope Di Maria stays unless a really good offer comes in, there's still a player who can be great for us in there. Could watch that finish against Leicester all day, that's the kind of stuff he can pull off when he has his mojo. Remember when he first came, the 5 or so games we played in those weeks everyone was basically in agreement that he was unlucky to be playing amongst such a shower of shite, he looked a class above at that time. Somehow it all went wrong after that.

8687~~~
This is too much of a fairytale move, besides Di Maria is a better player than Pastore and Herrera can be as good as Verrati next season.

8688~~~
Verratti and Herrera don't play the same position. Pastore has potential to be better than Di Maria, esoecially in the middle of the park.

8689~~~
you call what's going on in this thread simple criticism? people want him sold. Difference between "he's been bad this season" and "sell the fecker"

8690~~~
Can't belive people want him gone after one poor/mediocre season. There are plenty of others who have been equally bad, yet recive nowhere near as much stick

Young and Fellaini were shite all year last season and they had PL experience to boot. Yet they turned it around, and especially Young has been magnificent.

We all know how good he can be. So id say he deserves the benefit of the doubt

8691~~~
For me it's very simple, IF he wants to leave then sell him to whoever bids atleast the 60m he cost us. However, if he wants to stay and prove his class then by all means let him do that.

8692~~~
He needs to bulk up this summer. Someone merely tickles his shoulder and he's down like a sack of potatoes. 

I don't want him gone necessarily, but I wouldn't be against the idea of seeing him leave and replaced by Bale.

8693~~~
still has chance after disappointing second half of the season and parts of the first. but he has already shown here how good he can be in the first several matches this season.

but at the end it's all down to di maria himself to turn it around and he can. if young and fellaini can turn their fortunes around why can't di maria?

8694~~~
If PSG come in with an offer around £50m then it would be hard to say no even though I really want to see him make it here.

8695~~~
I'd keep him if he has any interest in staying. He's a younger than Young, Valencia and Nani and at his best he's a much better player.

8696~~~
If he pulls his finger out he is easily our best player. He is that special talent we have always had in our dominant phases and that we currently lack. Unless he really does hate it here we have to keep him at all costs.

8697~~~
Of course, people are trying to find deals that'll potentially benefit both parties this summer,he's had problems on and off the field his bad season isn't just about football,something's are personal as well,and there have been rumours of unrest all season. 
I think the unusual ones in this thread are the ones that act like everything is ok and he is definitely going to be our POTY next season,the ones who never seem to criticise him.

He is the best player in the team and I desperately want him to stay,not going to cry if he leaves for £40m though.

8698~~~
There is nothing that would benifit United in selling a player of Di Marias abilities. Hes had a poor season, it happens.

8699~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Nice

8700~~~
It's not just that, he looks totally unsuited to the PL and not compatible with LvG's stringent demands.

8701~~~
So how bad is his injury? I hope he goes to the Copa America and has a great tournament. Not a fan of players missing big tournaments because of injury, let alone United players.

8702~~~
Thats not true, as he showed in his early season form. 
Hes had some bad form yes, but lets not go overboard.

8703~~~
I think he's fine physically but he's too used to having referees blow for easy fouls. Referees can be cnuts in the PL, specially when it comes to Latin "superstars".
He needs to get into challenges without being ready to throw himself on the ground.

8704~~~
He had 4 good games, got hit a few times and went into his shell, he looks scared of getting tackled.

8705~~~
Ok hes shit and can't play in the EPL. Yet somehow hes has the second most assists in the league (even though hes had a poor season oh and only had 4 decent games)
Something doesn't add up there.
He also not scared of getting tackled as we've seen him get into it, although he goes down too easily when he feels hes been fouled and looks for the freekick (he just needs to cut that out and he'll be fine)

8706~~~
Chris Brunt has the same amount of assists, so I wouldn't hang my hat on that argument. He looks scared every time a player comes at him, and he's very careless in possession which is an issue when we have a manager that wants possession based football. I just don't think he fits with the league or the manager we have and it's not merely form.

8707~~~
Pretty sure Chris Brunt didn't play half a season.. He looks scared, right ok. Hes been careless in posession, yes thats true, the same could also be said of Herrera first half of the season. Fact is we have seen that he has the talent already so I don't buy he can't play in our league or our team for that matter. Its not like hes been a Falcao and we haven't seen his ability. Hes was poor in terms of form and then since the sending off hasn't even started a game (rightly so as Young has been awesome) but then how exactly does that mean Di Maria can't cut it.

Its a bit like Bale at Madrid this.

Di Maria is still our most creative player, creates the most chances of anyone in our team and thats when hes had a poor season. Give the lad a break. Hes been poor, but he'll get better.

8708~~~
It's Chris Brunt, that is the key thing in exposing stats as shaky bases to rest an argument on. I don't think Di Maria is going to suddenly become this settled player who keeps the ball intelligently and doesn't mind getting smashed by defenders, personally I think if the right opportunity arises he'll be off in the summer.

8709~~~
He doesn't need to, and the thing about it is that he actually uses the ball more intelligently than most which is why he creates more than any player on our team. LVG said he put him in the team on Sunday because we needed creativity so LVG knows his talents, will be interesting to see how we use him next season. Hes already also said he'll be staying so thats that. Would be good if some fans got behind the players, yet we have people on here calling Madrid fans silly over Bale.

8710~~~
He is World Class but he isn't exactly Messi or Ronaldo, he can be replaced.

8711~~~
It's spelt "coo".

8712~~~
No one is saying he is.
Its as if people are not looking at our squad, hes is the only world class player in it (Ok I forgot De Gea), so what is the point of replacing him, we should be adding more to him. After one poor season it makes so sense to sell we're not broke, it doesn't benefit us one bit.

On the whole Di Maria vs Brunt thing, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/%C3%A1ngel_di_mar%C3%ADa/126/126/1846/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/cesc_f%C3%A0bregas/126/126/306/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/santiago_cazorla/126/126/311/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/chris_brunt/126/126/869/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/gylfi_sigurdsson/126/126/863/46/p#key_passes/assists/goals_scored/successful_take_ons_%/successful_take_ons/pass_completion#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here are some stats</a> comparing all the 10+ assisters in the PL, on a per 90 basis.

To be fair to Di Maria, his rate of assists and key passes/90 is the best of the lot.

Where he falls down is what we've all noticed. His pass completion is the second worst and he's got the worst rate of successful take-ons and attempts the highest number per game. He concedes possession too often and too cheaply.

I've never bought the idea that creative players get a pass when it comes to retaining possession, on the basis they might create something so better to try and fail than not try at all. They have to be smarter than that and learn to get the balance right between taking a risk and doing something more conservative.

The stats for Fabregas and Cazorla demonstrate that they've both got this balance spot on and are real assets to their teams. Di Maria hasn't got this balance right and that's why he's been frozen out of the team for much of the latter half of the season. Something to build on though, hopefully.

8715~~~
Good post, the only caveat though is that Carzola and Fabragas operate as CMs. So they will regularly make safe passes, during much of Di Marias poor form he played as a winger and even as a CF where passing stats will deteriorate. I do however agree that in terms of the balance that is an area he will need to improve, but Herrera also needed to and did, so I doubt its beyond him.

8716~~~
He is going nowhere. I'm not sure why there is so much debate about this. You don't sign a player of his quality and sack him off after one bad season.

8717~~~
Not really many out and out wingers at the top teams to compare him with. There's a bunch of free-floating wide(ish!) players though and the same issues apply. They seem much better at beating a man, despite taking opposition players on more frequently. They also tend to pass the ball at least as accurately. In terms of pure creativity, though, he holds up fairly well. Like I said, he just needs to get the balance right.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/%C3%A1ngel_di_mar%C3%ADa/126/126/1846/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/eden_hazard/126/126/454/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/philippe_coutinho/126/126/2673/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/mesut_%C3%B6zil/126/126/123/0/p|champions_league/2014/2015/alexis_s%C3%A1nchez/142/142/1581/31/p#key_passes/assists/goals_scored/successful_take_ons_%/successful_take_ons/pass_completion#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">More stats</a>.

8718~~~
He said he's staying coming from a footballer means next to nothing, we know that all too well. Also I don't get the last line about getting behind players, I am not sitting booing him or something, I am simply giving an opinion on what I see, which to me is a player simply not cut out for the PL.

8719~~~
We demand loyalty from our players, currently from DDG. Would be nice if the fans would also show that, espiacally for a brilliant player who's going through a tough time

8720~~~
fair enough.

8721~~~
I am a little worried because at the start of the season I was saying we had 3 WC players in Di Maria, RVP and Falcao. None of them stood out for various reasons. If we get rid of them and bring in 3 more WC players who says history wont repeat itself. I think it is the centre midfielders that are the core of the problem. WC attackers need creative people to work with.

8722~~~
Its as if people don´t judge him by his whole career, but only by about 20 games. That’s the problem in this debate. Your assumption, that he is worldclass beyond controversy is simply wrong. He is not. Even if you just look at his last season in Madrid (all games; not just a few), 60m was very steep. Considering that LvG doesn’t fancy to use him in his best position and that he isn´t a player, that excels in a possession based system makes things worse. The problem isn´t that Di Maria has a bad character or is in terrible form. He is just struggling in a system, where he can´t show his best.

It’s a different question whether we should sell him or not. That depends on Di Maria´s wishes, LvG´s plans and potential offers. We shouldn´t expect miracles if he stays.

8723~~~
When he has been this terrible then you do sack him off. Especially as he looks like he struggles in LVG's system.

Under a Ferguson system then yeah I agree you don't sell him.

8724~~~
I don't get why people are so certain he's going to stay. He might have said that he wants to fight for his place and van Gaal might have suggested that we want to keep him (not even sure this has happened) but truth is he was barely used in the final three months of past season and he's still a very expensive player to have on our books with no intention to ever use him. He wasn't even a rotation player between March and May, he was a fringe player who came on when we desperately needed a goal best case scenario, or not at all if we weren't chasing. If a significant bid came from the direction of PSG or any other club abroad we'd at least have to consider it, from a business point of view keeping a player who isn't used at all when we can get a lot of money for him would be sort of pointless exercise.

He will never ever be given another shot in midfield and he's not really great on the wing, never has been, so I think best option for us would be to just let him go and buy someone who suits van Gaal better. Pointless signing and I'm disappointed both with how he's been handled these past few weeks and how he's performed, especially after such promising start.

8725~~~
If we keep Di Maria, it would make sense to select a striker that suits Di Maria's early delivery, rather than RVP, or indeed Rooney, neither of whom really seemed on the same wavelength as Di Maria. I spent much of the first half of the season thinking that Hernandez would have got a lot of chances to score had he been on the pitch with Di Maria firing in early crosses and wild shots.

8726~~~
You could be talking about Ander Hererra there, if you changed the dates round a bit.

Players come in and out of favour, as they come in and out of form. Obviously, we'd be a lot more optimistic if his season had matched Hererra's trajectory but falling out of favour for a few months shouldn't be interpreted as falling out of favour permanently.

8727~~~
Yep but Herrera actually looked quite good at times before he went out of favour, in a similar position to the one he's currently occupying and will likely pin down for years. I don't think Di Maria looked good even once on the wing and the way he finished season doesn't fill me with much confidence for future in all honesty.:

8728~~~
Exactly this. I'm really not sure why Di Maria seems to be disliked as much as he is. The only thing I can think of (apart from his wishy washy playing form, which doesn't count really as he wasn't that loved at the start either) is that it's because he doesn't use Social Media. Seems pretty crazy but because the likes of Falcao \ Herrera \ Mata have such a social media influence that it appears to endears them more to our fans whereas Di Maria is still kind of an unknown quantity personality wise, which i'm not saying is wrong btw as he is entitled to live however makes him happy.

8729~~~
Where the feck did I say that? Jheeze hes clearly a level above many players in our squad thats not even up for debate.

8730~~~
Last season for Madrid (or should I say two seasons ago now?) He was definitely World-Class. He was a huge reason for them winning the CL and often outshone Bale and Ronaldo. 

I still hold confidence he will reach that level for us with better players around him, but if we sell then we will never know.

8731~~~
Assuming he stays, I anticipate a similar season, to be honest. Probably a bright start, but with another dip. Although probably not such a severe dip. His career doesn't display consistency, and he seems quite a fragile person. 

I wouldn't be surprised if Memphis completely shows him up, but maybe Di Maria's doing a lot more learning behind the scenes than we suspect.

8732~~~
Bizarre reasoning. Falcao has been shit for the whole season and if you look at his performances thread, most of us wanted him out long time ago. Herrera and Mata have had good/very good seasons and you have to remember it wasn’t that easy for them in the first months.

The only thing that works against Di Maria is his price tag, but for me more important is how can a player decline like that in a few months? He was one of the best players in the world last season, now he’s being kept out of the first 11 by Ashley Young. As good as Young has been, it’s clear that Di Maria’s top lever is much higher than his. The problem is he had just a few games where he played on his level (mostly against the worst opposition), he’s been poor in other games. It’s not like he was <i>bad</i> in a few games (as some on here suggest), in fact he was <i>good</i> in a few games.

8733~~~
I agree hes been poor, but saying hes only been good in a few games is I think extremely harsh.
Even the game he last started (when he got sent off) he actually had a good performance up until that particular point.

8734~~~
I have disliked di Maria this season because I dont believe he has given 100%


I couldnt give a shit about social media

I felt sorry for Falcao because you could see he was trying his best but was still rubbish. It was a sad sight

8735~~~
TBH I never really got that from him much. There was the odd incident, but usually hes been a hard working player when in the team.

8736~~~
=
Individually he is one of our best players. That doesn’t help us at all, when Fellaini and Young are starting, while he is sitting on the bench. In LvG´s system he is not “clearly a level above many players”. The reality is, that LvG won’t change his idea of football. Di Maria won’t play as offensive midfielder and he never was a world-class winger. I understand when fans still want him to stay, but he won´t be our saving grace.

Ronaldo, Benzema and Modric were more or less on par with him. He was fantastic – especially in the crucial stage of the season – but Real winning the CL wasn´t a one-man show. He was one crucial part of a system. I still don´t understand why people only look at this season and not the other three, where he played as winger.

8737~~~
Kicker are reporting that Bayern might be interested in him.

8738~~~
I actually quoted a post where someone else called him world class and I would actually agree he is anyway.

Also saying he is world class doesn't mean I am saying he is without controversy which is what you said so no its not really = is it? I didn't say he was world class without dispute/controversy did I?

Now you are the one talking in absolutes when you say he won't play as an offensive midfielder, you have no idea whether he will or not, especially if we have balance in the 2 midfielders playing behind him (which we haven't been able to do with the current squad)

The reality is this season LVG  we had a massively an unbalanced squad and has had to accommodate that, Di Maria also has been poor and was rightly lost his place in the team when Young started performing very well. (Even then he still came on as a sub and contributed in games)
The reality also is that although Young has played very well (I think hes been our second best player this season), he has produced very little end product for all his good play, because in terms of quality rather than his endeavour his final ball just isn't at the level of a player like Di Maria.
The football we played this season isn't to the standard LVG wants us to play and Di Maria has all the attributes to fit into LVGs system, LVG has said so himself soooo lets see what happens.
As for being a level above many players I think he clearly is (in terms of his quality and ability to create chances) as he has shown in glimpses for us this season, just not with the consistency required.

8739~~~
Well my thoughts differ, you cannot judge a player on one season. Particularly one when he did, to begin with, very clearly fit into the system.

8740~~~
Any news on his injury?

Really hope he stays, confident we'll see the best of him in the new season.

8741~~~
Might be me but once that coming together happened early in the game, I said to my son, he'll be off in 15 mins. Nothing to do with an injury, the lad looks like he just doesn't want to be here. Everything in his body language and game says it.

8742~~~
He needs to be much stronger psychologically if he wants to succeed otherwise there is just no need to stay. He has got to be more like Alexis Sanchez in that regard, a guy who never stops fighting and running, even if his attacking performance is bad. When things don't go his way (losing the ball easily, crying for a FK the referee didn't give etc etc ..), Di Maria loses his football entirely.

8743~~~
Not really

8744~~~
Apparently Bayern want him  <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

8745~~~
It's weird that we have to say this because at Madrid he was exactly the player you are describing. His work rate was one of the top features of his game - the guy never stopped fighting and running.

8746~~~
I havent seen this in him. I see a player who has found both the league and life in England a lot tougher than he expected and is a bit lost in trying to adjust.

8747~~~
This is for me the most frustrating thing about him. I can understand not being settled into the foreign life, football and feeling difficult to play with new teammates. I'll never understand how a player can at times give so little in terms of fighting and courage. I'm not asking Di Maria to be crazy like Phil Jones obviously, just less lazy and lethargic when attacking and specially losing the ball.

8748~~~
He needs to play with World Class players to get back to his old self,he needs the run of games.

8749~~~
I know it's too early to say this and I may regret this, but in my opinion he's just not going to play well for us and will be one of the biggest flops (considering how much we paid for him) in five or ten years. He just doesn't feel okay in England (especially after the<i> burglary</i>), in the league and will end up in Juventus.

8750~~~
Di Maria this season reminds me of Giggsy on a bad form. There's a stretch  some years ago where he was just shite,  losing the ball,  looks like lacking effort, but Fergie kept him on the pitch to the point where some idiots boo him. But then one day he came on against Juve in CL and tore them a new one. 

Fergie had the luxury of keeping Giggs on the pitch because the other players can pick up the slack. Van Gaal couldn't do it with di Maria this season because the other players are inconsistent and there are no room for error,  so he went with the most in form players
He can be brilliant for us,  he's too talented not to be given the chance to prove it

8751~~~
I guess there was no endearment before social media then, I guess the likes of Januzaj and Smalling should have also had the same problems as they just recently joined social networks, Falcao also seems to be "disliked" as you put it and he is very active on social media.

People react to what they see on the pitch more than anything else, Di Maria has looked out of place since he got here, his body language,facial expressions etc. It always seemed like a forced move,  and that type of thing doesn't sit too well with fans, we really didn't give a shit in September and early October - when he was undoubtedly the best player on the team - then he became average at best and stayed like that for the remainder of the season, which led fans to start to criticise him, it's not a personal vendetta or anything like that..I really don't think anyone hates Di Maria, he is just heavily criticised because he is supposed to play like a WC player not Nani 2.0.

People are usually quick to throw the agenda card like its personal, I don't think any one wakes up to a picture of Di Maria on his/her dart board every morning, I don't think people think about Di Maria or anything like that, the reactions/criticisms are about 2 things -his average performances and his body language/attitude.

Paul Scholes was socially awkward as a player and he still has fans who are willing to commit murder for him on here.

8752~~~
He needs a good pre season to sync with his new team mates.

8753~~~
I agree, I wonder if he will be available for the US tour with him playing Copa America this summer...

8754~~~
Not if he's injured.

8755~~~
I said in the newbies "If you didn't like Nani, you won't like Di Maria". I still believe this is the case, even at his best. I'm not particularly concerned about him, if he stays, he'll discover his form, but he'll still be frustrating, he'll still give the ball away needlessly and he'll still have those annoying elements about his game. If we decide to sell him then we absolutely have to replace with top quaity, someone like Griezmann would be fine, and is someone I wanted us to sign last summer anyway.

8756~~~
I don't want him injured of course. However I'd prefer him with the team instead of at the Coppa America TBH. Don't forget that the Argentinian manager's scope is to win the trophy at all cost. He doesn't care if he sends Di Maria tired, out of shape or even injured.

8757~~~
It just seems like a case of a player who has won everything at Real Madrid, come to United in the opinion of it being a step down, and has lost a bit of his ambitious personality that he had previously.

Which is the reason why I hate the idea of spending huge money in order to take players of Bayern, Real or Barca's teams, as players will most likely come to United with the same attitude.

Whether we like it or not, it's going to take us winning a few UCLs in order for foreign players to think we are on the same level as those 3 clubs.

I'm not saying this is the case for Di Maria, but we should be signing players who really want to join our club rather than ones who are being forced out of their current club and looking for someone who can match their wages.

8758~~~
Di Maria needs more mobile players in front of him and willing runners to stretch the opposition, unfortunately for us and him we haven't had that in the team and possession football does not suit his game. Our best games of the season were against Tottenham, Liverpool and City, in those games we had runners, quick passing, a lot of triangles and Di Maria assisted the goal of our season. Then we just switched off again, I would like to keep him because with him in the team we will play better more incisive football. Fellaini has been great for us this season but was sussed out from the Chelsea game onwards and LVG's refusal to accept this made our results suffer and I can't help but feel Di Maria would have won us more games if he started. He is a better footballer and you need to have the best players on the pitch for the longest periods in order for you to reap the rewards.

8759~~~
I still reckon he needs to be played consistently on the wing. He gives it away too much to be played CM. If he gets a good pre season under his belt he can hit the ground running in August. A front three of ADM, Mata/Depay, Rooney has so much potential.

8760~~~
He needs to get his head together, not being able to pass and bad decision making are nothing to do with playing positions, systems or other players.

8761~~~
I'm not all that keen on seeing him on the wing. Just limits him to be a decent winger. Give him a holding midfielder and another well-rounded midfielder to play with in a midfield 3 and he can be back to his best IMO

8762~~~
Exactly. He's got the potential to be a top player for us but far too many excuses being made for his form in 2015.

8763~~~
Would be incredibly stupid if we sold him IMO. The fact that he was one of the best players at Real Madrid, and Bayern now want to buy him, says it all. He's a world class player, just off form. It happens. Him coming good would be basically the perfect signing for us.

8764~~~
His performances as a winger have been diabolical and we should sell him this summer if Van Gaal doesn't plan on using him in midfield.

8765~~~
What happened to form is temporary, class is permanent?  See Young for a perfect example of this, he's been bang on form for much of the season but he doesn't have an ounce of the class of Di Maria.

8766~~~
That's nonsense. The fact is that Bayern really struggled on the European stage for 4-5 years when we were making semis and finals and the English teams in general were doing really well in Europe. But even then, we lost Ronaldo to Madrid although they had done feck all in Europe for a good decade and were in Barca's shadow in La Liga. 

The pull of Barca and Madrid for European and Latin American players will always be more due to a variety of factors but Bayern are just like us. Only difference is that they are the undoubted top dog in Germany (which in turn lets them have a great chance of signing all the best young German players who are one of the best in our generation) while we have to contend with at least 3 more teams in England on more or less equal footing for players.

8767~~~
100% keep him. Anyone who says otherwise is fickle and inpatient.

8768~~~
If he doesn't want to be here (and lets face it, it's been quite likely since the break-in completely rattled his family) then he's not going to improve his form or attitude is he?

If the break-in hadn't happened I'd be more inclined to put it down to acclimatisation and say he might get better but I bet you his Mrs and the kids want to leave for somewhere else and that'll have a massive effect on him.

8769~~~
Unless we recoup 80-90% of the fee back or a quality player in exchange than we shouldn't sell.

8770~~~
So you're saying foreign players are just as likely to come to United than Bayern Munich?

8771~~~
Of course they are, we haven't turned into Bolton.

8772~~~
Should give him another year at the absolute minimum. We'll need him.

8773~~~
It'll be nice if he can regain his confidence, I feel he isn't all that happy at the moment but hopefully a full pre-season will help him focus for next season. That's about as generous as I can be.

8774~~~
No way should he be sold on the back of this season. He's done enough or has more than proved himself on various other stages of European and world football to get another crack at Utd and the PL. Give him time and more importantly use him in a way that'll suit him best, things should fall into place for him and us then.

8775~~~
Maybe few events in his life had influence on his form,state of mind etc. they are humans after all. Dont forget not only its his 1st season in England,he needed to learn language,had some injuries and that attempt of burglary while his wife and child was inside,say what you want,go all Chuck Norris on me,say how thats not a big fecking deal but maybe he took that event hard.Think before first injuries he was more then decent so hope he will stay,settle and improve next season.

8776~~~
Bayern do have lots of quality to offer in exchange.

8777~~~
Maybe not for the last 2-3 years but in general, yes.

8778~~~
Nothing but sheer conjecture

8779~~~
I'm looking forward to seeing if di Maria can improve in the second season and be more efficient on the ball. I think playing him on the right wing will suit him well as he'll have the freedom to either cut inside or stay out wide. His inswinging crosses/diagonals from the right have always caused the opposition lots of problems, and he can still cut in and be dangerous in the middle with his through passes or shots. I think putting him on the left makes him quite limited as he's weak on his right foot, and he's too cavalier on the ball to be effective in the middle, but he's accustomed to playing on the right from his Benfica/Real Madrid days, so he's a bigger threat from there and from the left/middle.

8780~~~

8781~~~
I think the rumours is from BeIN, he is probably a bullshitter.

8782~~~
I'm glad you posted it, I saw it but thought better of it.

The source is pretty bad, but I suppose it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the year he's had.

8783~~~
He can leave at the right price if he wants out and we shouldn't be worried too much about it. Not less than 50M that is.

8784~~~
It is probably best he does leave. Top quality player, but he takes too much risk to fit into Van Gaal possession based philosophy. Even though, I feel his assertiveness to be positive should benefit and balance our team, Van Gaal seems to think otherwise.

8785~~~
We'd need a replacement though and I'm struggling to see one that would be for sale.

If he fancies Bayern we'll take Robben and £35 million, or PSG Moura and £30 million.

Money isn't much use to us we need a top replacement or two, or preferably the rumours are BS and ADM comes good because he's a wonderful player when on form.

8786~~~
If he's does want to leave then he definitely should. But we need to recover most of the transfer fee otherwise it makes no sense whatsoever for us.

8787~~~
I believe that LVG is a very honest coach so any player asking to leave since his arrival would be partly to do with the conversations they have had with the manager.

Much like Welbeck, he asked to leave due to conversations with LVG behind closed doors, so if Di Maria does leave this summer then it will be because he is not in the managers plans. If that is true, then so be it, same goes for every player really because no player is bigger than the club.

8788~~~
Didn't he just have an interview less than a month ago saying he wanted to stay and fight for a place? 

Highly unlikely that he's going anywhere this summer.

8789~~~
wasnt welbz shown the door due to his goals record?

8790~~~
He was a panic buy we made mid August when we started the season badly and we were really desperate. He doesn't fit this system at all by the looks of it, in fact he can't even seem to take players on any more.

Sanchez or Sterling would suit us more with there close dribbling ability, we need to find a player like that.

8791~~~
Sterling v Di Maria straight switch? We wouldn't say no (though obviously Di Maria and his family probably would).

8792~~~
Why do I get the horrible feeling we'll end up loaning him to PSG with some god awful, play now, pay later deal?

8793~~~
I literally cannot think of a single reason why he'd want to go to Liverpool

8794~~~
If we have to sell him, PSG must include Verrati in the deal. No bloody cash only deals.

Your club would the only ones saying no.

8795~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> @ ADM agreeing to that.

8796~~~
*Gets burgled in Manchester,moves to Liverpool* <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I would welcome Sterling though.

8797~~~
The story is bollocks though....i hope, if its true then i think 13 assists and 4 goals should be enough to entice PSG to pay 35-45m for him.

8798~~~
If we could get around £40m back, it would be a good deal. Unless LvG sees him playing here every week (actually starting), then there's no point in keeping him.

8799~~~
Straight swap with Verrati would be great.

8800~~~
He was going to be 3rd choice at best, so van Gaal suggested it's better to leave. Welbeck agreed and wanted out.

<a class="username" data-user="81376, @RuudTom83" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81376/">@RuudTom83</a> is spot on though, if Di Maria really wants out he can do so under van Gaal. It'll be difficult for Di Maria though since the club won't take a loss on him. There are very few clubs who could afford what we paid for him and I doubt many are interested. I'm sure he will stay, one bad season with OK statistics won't drive him out I think.

Swap deals barely happen, PSG won't offer their best players. They already rejected Barcelona twice.

8801~~~
Why on earth would they swap Verrati? aren't they trying to.. you know... IMPROVE their team by signing ADM on top of what they have?

8802~~~
It wouldn't surprise me if he does leave, but it'll take more than Richard Keys and a beIN sports 'source' to convince me it's in the works.

If it is to happen, get it over and done with. If not let's hope he can come into his own next season and put in the performances we know he can.

8803~~~
If he doesn't wanna leave, selling him after one season would be beyond stupid.

8804~~~
If he actually wanted to stay,these rumours/links would be non existent.

8805~~~
In all my years of supporting United I can't recall any time we've signed a top quality player in their prime and then sold them a season later. We broke the British transfer record on Di Maria, yes overall it was a disappointing season for him but he showed at the start what he could do and we would be very silly to sell him when we all know next season he will more than likely find his form. 

I highly doubt he will ask to leave when he has so much left to prove and hopefully win here with us. The only way we would entertain selling him is if we were somehow signing Bale or Ronaldo and that ain't happening I'm afraid.

8806~~~
Yes and apparently Pep will be City manager this summer....

8807~~~
Unless someone offers us something stupid i cannot see us selling him. 

Hes been average this season (after a good opening spell) but i would rather see what he can do next season than cutting our losses this early on.

8808~~~
Our stance with him has been strange. Obviously we can't let him leave! What the hell would Ronaldo think!?

8809~~~
Wait so rumours only exist if a player wants to leave? They don't call it silly season for no reason!

8810~~~
would you take a 50 million bid from PSG

8811~~~
What currency is that? You know what, doesn't matter. I would.

8812~~~
If we can replace him for 50m or less, yes.

8813~~~
Not really a question of replacing him in the normal sense, is it?

He's hardly been a fixture, nor has he established himself in any sense as part and parcel of LVG's system.

If we wanted to, we could let him go without “replacing” him, as this wouldn't amount to anything more than going for roughly the set-up we used when looking – clearly – sharpest in that run of matches before Carrick got injured.

He's not had a chance to properly prove himself, though. That's the issue. He's a very good player. Far too good to be let go just because he's had a bit of a rubbish season. If there are problems, if he doesn't really want to stay – well, that's different. But if he's committed and willing to fight for a place in our XI, then for God's sake keep him. He's got more football in him than most of our current players, so if LVG can use him at all, he should keep him.

8814~~~
Depends on who is available. Most likely I wouldn't. I don't know how many available dribbling midfielders are available right now. I doubt many.

8815~~~
It would in the sense that we felt we needed someone who could twist defenders inside out by running at them and given we lack that in the squad we would need to replace find another one who can do that.


Probably a lot easier just getting him back to him former level. If he wants to play for this club, he should be able to do that next season.

8816~~~
There is no smoke without fire, rumours are constant in the game irrespective of a players desire to stay or to leave, Herrera to Bayern is a prime example, -it didnt last, Di Maria has been linked with a move to PSG since last May, this is definitely not your average rumour, when you combine that with his personal troubles and his average performances, it shouldn't surprise anyone that he might want to go to his preferred destination.

He cost us £60m,he was given the #7 shirt, he is the most expensive signing in premier league history, Great season or not Di Maria should definitely not be linked with a move out of United,the only transfer related news about Di Maria this summer should be a clear warning from United to suitors (PSG)as he is not for sale, he should be nursing an injury and preparing for Copa America but that is not the case now is it?
How many record/important signings have been linked with moves out of their clubs as early as december? average season or not, this shouldn't even be an issue, this transfer has been strange right from the start, how many managers have had to address the media regarding their record signings in February? 

Herrera,Rojo,Blind,Fabregas,Sanchez,Costa,Mangala,Fernando - these were top signings(foreign) for the top teams in England, how many of them have been linked with moves out of their respective clubs all season long?

8817~~~
The logical thing to do would be to keep him, i think every single person on here would agree with this decision, but if it was that easy and if it was up to the club then it would really be a non-issue, when somethings persists like this - you have to begin to suspect the player, United is not a selling club.

8818~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69303, @Chesterlestreet" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69303/">@Chesterlestreet</a> I suppose that we will need to replace him numerically with a player who meets our expectations.

8819~~~
We've got Depay now, though. What you describe there is – at least ideally – his game.

8820~~~
He's one of those players that I couldn't care less if he stays or goes.

8821~~~
Aye, but in terms of what?

What do we expect from Di Maria? That he becomes our true offensive driving force? At the highest level? If so, it won't be easy to replace him. His potential is higher than most players' as it stands. It might be wiser to give him another chance to grab that role and become our Messi light, or whatever you want to call it.

If, however, we just expect him to be a decent alternative in some positions across the midfield/attack, then we can easily replace him. Or, rather, we don't have to - we already have players who can fill that "role".

8822~~~
Well, if we sell him it will be because he wants to go, otherwise there is no reason to sell. And if he wants to go, I would accept 50m at the condition that we can replace him for that amount.

8823~~~
If a player does not want to play for the club you are free to go. Cant carry the 'i am not sure where i want to be in my career at this point' players in the LVG era. You are either fully committed or you walk through the honourable exit at Old Trafford. There is only 1 football career in sight, so choose wisely.

8824~~~
He's going nowhere.

8825~~~
Keys is about as connected as a kibbutz, but if it was true and PSG want him then you ask for Verratti to be included in any deal.

8826~~~
He's 20 though. We signed Di Maria because he' was already a top player when we got him. And depay's supposed to be more about goals than Di Maria who is primarily a creator. Anyway this is all conjecture anyway. God knows what lvg's plans are.

8827~~~
Why would he want to play for a small club? If we did do a deal with PSG, they should pay us more then we paid or maybe they have players we want that would help the team. Only time will tell.

8828~~~
Money? Paris?

8829~~~
One thing is sure, we know feck all about his current intentions so best believe nothing.

8830~~~
This I have my doubts about. Mentally he's not coped and its dented his confidence on the pitch. Now, its about whether he has that determination to get over that barrier and adapt to the team ahead and hopefully it with United.

8831~~~
Does LVG have any intention of using him in midfield? That's the decisive thing for me. I can only seem him being used on the wing under LVG, in which case I'd happily take 50m for him.

8832~~~
Didn't we hear him say how he wanted to stay and fight for his place, earlier this month? Moreover, Rojo spoke about how he and di Maria have been taking English lessons, would be pointless, for Angel, if he were planning on leaving. Selling him would very, very stupid as this is a player who's proven himself at the highest level and is at the peak of his powers.

Pretty sure beIN sports reported that he had signed for PSG, last summer, too. But yeah, rumours are true 99% of time, so I guess he's off.

8833~~~
I doubt we'll see him in midfield often next season, probably as winger. LvG said he didn't have a worldclass winger like Ronaldo or Di Maria before he bought him and Di Maria's skillset doesn't match a van Gaal midfielder profile as much as a winger. He'd be mostly passing and not dribbling/crossing. On the wing he'll have more freedom to be of influence. Di Maria on the right and Memphis on the left is my guess.

So I don't even think van Gaal bought him as midfielder and therefore won't judge him based on that. He's multifunctional and van Gaal tried him there but he didn't really play well.

8834~~~
Watching Sanchez tear Villa apart in the FA Cup final, then realising many of us thought at the beginning of the season (myself included) that ADM was the better signing. This makes me sad. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8835~~~
This is what it hinges on for me. If he's got the heart to fight then keep him for sure. Plenty of players have taken a year to settle in a foreign league before now and come good.

If he wants out that's a problem and a different story. I'd consider selling but only for the right deal, certainly not a year's loan somewhere.

8836~~~
Huge difference, though. One plays for a team that's dysfunctional and unable to orchestrate a proper attack, whereas, the other is playing for a team that's the complete opposite. It's quite hard to stand out and shine in a team like ours where most of our players have been well below par for the entirety of the season.

8837~~~
Sanchez joined a side that is settled, that has been together for years. They've also got the same manager they've had for many years and also play to his strengths.

Angel joined a team in transition, a side that the season before had an awful season. Another new manager, the second in twelve months. A whole host of new players, not to mention the personal troubles he has had since coming here (injuries and having his family home broke in to).

Both players are top quality, Arsenal and their style of their play have given Alexis the chance to shine, we have been trying to find a way in which to fit Angel in to the side all season. I have no doubts if he stays (which I hope he does, one bad season doesn't make him a bad player and I think a lot on here have been to quick to write him off) he'll shine next season if we can keep a settled side.

8838~~~
Do not understand this post.

Why would PSG expect to pay more for a player who's stock is basement level (Coming off an awful.. awful season & unhappy off the pitch)  compared to when we purchased him? (Integral to Reals CL win, best personal season to date, settled in Madrid)

Also the PSG smaller club point.. umm what footballer actually gives a shit about this in reality? Do you think Aguero loses sleep currently over his choice to play for Man City over 5x CL winners Liverpool? PSG have a better team currently than we do and would be expected to progress further than we do in the CL next season.

Not to mention money, better place to live and a happy wife off the field.

8839~~~
I agree. Do you think LVG would consider switching to a 4231 with Depay, Mata and Di Maria ahead of two deeper mids? And would he be willing to play with Herrera as one of the two deeper DMs? I'm sceptical because he didn't do so this season, but maybe he would go for it if we bought in a DM like Schneiderlin who is defensively solid and more mobile than Carrick..

8840~~~
Pounds, I guess it would have to do with how bad he wants to succeed here and be a world beater with us. If he is easily persuaded by psg, and we don't have his full commitment to give everything, I'd sell him and buy players that rather give their all

8841~~~
No United attacking player can lay claim to having a good season. I've said it before I lay some of the blame for Di Maria's bad form on LvG, and his philosophy. If the manager wanted a player to adapt to the team he should not have purchased him for a record fee. You don't buy a world class player at the peak of his powers and try change his playing style, position and restrict his flair.

He's a free spirit, let him express himself on the pitch.

8842~~~
Same.

8843~~~
In the first half of the season, the crosses he would put into the box were as good as it gets but RVP and Falcao just couldn't convert. His assist tally should have been a lot higher. Shame that he seemed to lose that part of his game over the course of the season but if he can get back to that, I can see him coming good as a winger for us.

8844~~~
I think there is truth in that, LvG seems a demanding "My way or the highway" coach who wont accommodate a player, they will have to bend to his philosophy.

8845~~~
Bullshit. Look all the rumors that are constantly made up in the papers

8846~~~
Lucas Moura, have him and Depay charging down the wings.

8847~~~
OK.

8848~~~
Di Maria and Depay would make more sense imo.

8849~~~
Not if he doesn't want to be here. Don't get me wrong I'd rather DiMaria stayed and proved his doubters wrong but if we're going to swap with someone at PSG then I'd like Moura.

8850~~~
As I care very little for French football, has Lucas Moura actually set the league alight like many said he would or has he failed to live up to the hype like so many do?

8851~~~
Pastore for me.

8852~~~
Would be stupid to sell him, if we want to be more inventive along with our possession style then we need a player like him and we also need to allow players express themselves. Otherwise even with a couple of new additions we will keep creating 2-3 chances per game. Look how many chances Arsenal created today or Barca as I write it. Usually that's what happens, you create tons of chances and 1 or 2 will usually be converted, if the attackers have very clinical days then maybe more. But if you only create 2-3 chances of course in some games that won't be enough.
It would be really frustrating if we sell him, LvG leaves in 1-2 seasons, and the next manager who tries to inject a bit more inpredictability and directness would actually fancy Di Maria very much. I imagine a Klopp, Ancelotti or even Guardiola would be able to get the best out of such a player.

8853~~~
Although I don't believe the rumours, if Di Maria was to leave, with him ending up at PSG, then a swap deal with Verratti coming to United would be awesome.

8854~~~
The rumours are emanating from Bein Sport who are owned by the same people as PSG

8855~~~
Yeah,Every single rumour about Di Maria this season as well..

8856~~~
Until we hear anything from United or the player himself everything else is just that, a rumour. A rumour is basically a circulating story or report of uncertain or doubtful truth. 

I remember Di Maria himself saying he's happy to remain and wants to impress at United. That's a fact.

8857~~~
Yes,because that's how it is in Football, I guess all the stories about Madrid chasing De Gea this season are all ...."just rumours".  LVG has only addressed rumours about only 2 players this season, DDG and Di Maria.

8858~~~
I guess those Burglars also work for the owners of PSG.

8859~~~
Sarcasm?

De Gea's case is different. He is in his final year of contract and has not yet signed a contract. United are under no obligations to sell Di Maria, unless he himself wants a move and United agree to his request. Until we hear this to be the case everything we hear or read will be regarded as rumours. 

Please note I'm not saying for a fact he's not asked for a move or United will not sell. My argument is these are just rumours at this moment in time.

8860~~~
If you're naive enough to believe all the rumours United would be buying and selling 100's of players every season.

8861~~~
Of course, I think they are rumours as well, all I'm doing is speculating, which i think should be perfectly normal in a football forum, I'm looking at the worst case scenario - we all want him to stay....I hope.

8862~~~
It's not about being naive, we're talking about an unsettled foreign player who barely speaks English,who was signed off a World Class season, but seems to have struggled this season, being played out of position....sometimes, playing for a team in transition, watching his house where (his wife and his infant daughter also reside) get broken into, when you combine that with the fact that his preferred destination may or may not have been Paris to play for a team that is Ruthless in the transfer window and looking to spend crazy amounts on players - and said team have been chasing him for a while, I don't think it should come as a surprise that he might be on his way out.

I guess only positive speculation is allowed on here.

8863~~~
On the other hand he recently came out and said he wanted to stay, so we just don't know either way tbh.

8864~~~
Pfft, that means nothing, the way he itched his arm and blinked makes it obvious he hates Manchester. 

Factor in the way he held his stomach when he went of injured and forget about it.

8865~~~
If he stayed I would give him another chance, if he went and we got a big fee and got someone else in I wouldn't care.

8866~~~
Might as well close the whole transfer forum if we can't speculate then,Shutdown the whole forum.

I mean what do we know?why discuss what we have no inside knowledge of ? Rate a player's performances ? Pfft we really don't know why he performed badly so why speculate?

8867~~~
Who said you can't speculate?

8868~~~
Of course you can, but when you are seen to be extremely one sided and not very objective, like you seem to be adamant the guy wants to leave when you really have no clue, well then it becomes a bit tedious.
Don't think anyone minds speculation, but at least treat it as speculation and not fact.

8869~~~
Quote?

8870~~~
This is getting tedious. You've said your piece. Please move on

8871~~~
...

8872~~~
I can't be asked to dig it all out, I've seen your posts in this thread over the past few weeks/months. You seem to be very anti Di Maria full stop. But anyway:

Here you are suggesting that the rumours mean that he doesn't want to stay, when about a week ago he gave an interview saying he does want to stay.
Its of course possible that the rumour is untrue, of course it is possible it is true, but your statement is saying that because there are rumours/links then it means he actually doesn't want to stay.

EDIT: <a class="username" data-user="42549, @Rado_N" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/42549/">@Rado_N</a> did a better job above

8873~~~
Who the hell do you think you are coming to tell me to move on when i clearly wasn't talking to you? do you get notifications any time i post or something? i said all i had to say to you and i was replying someone else.... dont like it? thats your problem.

8874~~~
Don't talk to Sultan like that.

8875~~~
1) if Criticising a player who hasn't performed the way he is expected to automatically makes me "anti-Di Maria" then so be it, i have said i want him to stay on numerous occasions, i have acknowledged the fact that he is the best player on the team on numerous occasions, i know he can do better and i want him to do better, but i won't come here to praise him for average performances just to stay positive... but i guess you see what you want to see.

2) "If he actually wanted to stay, these rumours would be non existent" doesn't sound like someone who is 100% certain Di Maria is leaving or someone who definitely wants to see Di Maria leave, i was simply saying "there's no smoke without fire", if there are loads of rumours something must be wrong - i was just speculating, nothing more,nothing less.

Di Maria's future is clearly a touchy subject, so I'm not going to talk about it for a while.

8876~~~
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

8877~~~
I didn't say you did, I said you were implying that he definately wants to leave because there have been rumours whereas it could all be a load of bollocks. I'm not saying you want him to leave. However there can be smoke without fire.
Like, for instance, us being intereted in signing Gaitain for the past 5 years, there were plenty of rumours and links for a while, but its obviously been a load of bollacks, hence we have heard Gill called the Benfica to tell them to stop it.

Its perfectly plausable that the rumours exists solely because he hasn't had a good season, and he hes not getting picked and people want something to write. For instance Herrera apparently wasn't in LVGs plans about 6 months ago when he wasn't getting picked and there were rumours he would be sold in the summer which again were reporters putting 2+2 together and making a story, its the nature of the media.

Now I'm not even saying the rumours are not true, what I said was when you treat them as though they are fact then it becomes tedious (which is what I said in my original post).

8878~~~
So basically what you're saying is you can dismiss the rumours (which may or may not be true) as bollocks and speculate when you have no inside knowledge, but when i use the same rumours(which may or may not be true) to also speculate, also without said inside knowledge it becomes fact?

Ok,noted.

8879~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
Erm no thats not what I was saying, but lets leave it...

8880~~~
Maybe we should buy Higuain, di Maria provided loads of assists for him.

8881~~~
Messi voted for him for Ballon d'Or so we should definitely keep him.

8882~~~
Has moura been that good? I don't follow the league but heard he's been underwhelming.

8883~~~
Season disrupted by injuries but when he was fit, he showed clear signs of improvement as a player. Specially when it comes to decision making.

8884~~~
I see. I'd still prefer verrati, he's superb.

8885~~~
Same for me, probably the best young CM in Europe at the moment.

8886~~~
I don't understand why some are saying LvG is trying to change his style of play or restricting his freedom. He was given maximum freedom everytime he's played. I remember at the start of the season he was doing ridiculous shit like shooting from 40 yards out at least twice every game, Sending a long ball in from the half way line or trying to take on 4 players from near our own penalty area. He'll never be the kind of player who passes and moves. He's a dribbler and a fantastic one too. 

Eventually he lost confidence in himself and it affects the dribblers the most. The injuries didn't help either. I don't see how anyone can blame van Gaal for di Maria's poor form. LvG experimented with different positions only to give him more space and allowed him to take on players. He did that very well as a striker. Some of our counter attacks from De Gea's throws/kicks were amazing to watch. The rest of the team had to be specially set up to adjust for di Maria's knack for losing possession. I think it's safe to say in the end the manager got a bit tired of it and benched him because he was not able to do the things he usually does and became more of a liability.

He still doesn't know english. He needs to adjust soon for his own sake. No one has any doubts in his abilities. We should never sell players of his quality.

8887~~~
Most attacking players turn the ball over a lot. Finding an attacking player who can play such a possession based game but can still provide creativity and a cutting edge is a very difficult balance to find.

Di Maria has all of the ability. He can create centrally and from out wide. He can play a short possession game and can use his pace on the counter attack. His biggest issue just now is mental. It may confidence or lack of desire but if he rectifies that it's hard to see United being able to sign a better player. It would be a waste to discard him after one season.

8888~~~
He won't be the first and certainly won't be the last player to come to the PL and struggle in his irst season.
I can't for one second think the club will entertain selling him. The guy has recently said how he wants to go about next season in a United shirt.
The guy was adjusting nicely to United until the break in, after that he clearly was troubled. Come pre-season he will have the basics of English (hopefully), he will be free from distractions of big money move and Madrid so free to concentrate on getting his confidence back.
That goal against Leicester was world class. He has done stuff like that consistently as a player, we just need him to find the love again....and he will.
United 'fans' wanting to sell a world class player after a poor season......heads gone.

8889~~~
Smashing the English transfer record then dumping the player less than 12 months later? We'd be a laughing stock!

8890~~~
I'm struggling to think of a logical reason I can think of that would lead to him leaving. The only one that is possible is if he is desperate to get out and hasn't settled in England. We certainly wouldn't be selling after one bad season - that's just bad management and to be honest would be incredibly embarrassing after breaking the transfer record to bring him here.

8891~~~
I wouldn't be embarrassed if we recouped £50m+

It'd be more embarrassing if he spent another season underwhelming for us and being kept out of the side.

Keeping him in the hope of avoiding embarrassment could backfire spectacularly. Pride comes before a fall and all that.

8892~~~
I'd agree with most of this and add that LVG's philosophy shouldn't be a straitjacket and the team would benefit more from an unpredictable player like like him in the squad looking at our difficulties in chance creation this season. We average ball possession at 60% + but we can't find a way past WBA at home, can we really believe that this 'philosophy' is the only way to the promised land?

8893~~~
Lets not try and rewrite history here, it was one outstanding season (His last one there) and three seasons where he fluctuated between the sublime and the average, much like Nani. Although I do agree that given time and support from the club he will come good and justify his transfer.

8894~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4303ebG28-A?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He may have had a shit season but goddamn that was beautiful.

Is Falcao there for moral support? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8896~~~
Forever sidelined <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8897~~~
We loaned out Nani who is more talented than Di Maria and can use both feet. 

I still believe we would have been better off simply playing Nani on a regular basis.

8898~~~
Manchester United’s Belgian midfielder Marouane Fellaini has really put his foot in his mouth with some comments made on French TV station Téléfoot.

Asked if Angel Di Maria would be a good signing by PSG, Fellaini responded <b>“Angel Di Maria would be a good signing for PSG. He is a world class player</b><i>.”</i>

Signed by Louis van Gaal for £59.7m from Real Madrid last summer, the Premier League record signing has been linked to PSG in recent weeks.

Despite having a below-average first season at Old Trafford, Manchester United fans on Twitter were bewildered by Marouane Fellaini’s comments.

The afro-haired midfielder was already in the bad books with Man United fans after receiving a needless (and reckless) red card in the final game of the season – making him unavailable for the first three games of next season.

Stupid from Fellaini .No need to feed the media.

8899~~~
He was asked if Di Maria would be a good signing for PSG. He just gave his opinion.

8900~~~
Nani is like Rafael, every week he isn't here he gets better and better and people already forget how shit he was in his last months here. Even Di Maria this season was at least productive and had similiar numbers to Nani at his best. According to some people Nani is a goalscoring winger <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I would call players like Ronaldo, Bale, Griezmann like that, Depay has the potential to be one of them, but Nani? He won't return and it's completely understandable why, some decent performances in Portugal doesn't change that.

Would be madness if we sell a quality player like AdM after one year, if it doesn't work out next year either, we can discuss if it's better for both parties to go seperate ways, but after one season it we shouldn't even consider it.

8901~~~
The press didn't give his full quotes (naturally). But let's hang him anyway.

8902~~~
Is it really that mad? The player Di Maria is a risk taker, he will loose the ball often because he tries to create all the time, LvG demands a possession style of football where you open a team up slowly and take your time finding the gaps in defences, I just don't think Di Maria who is at his peak can adapt to it. Next year his value will be much lower than it is now, and i think if we got the right bid it would be best to part ways for both the club and his own sake.

8903~~~
Aside from the issue as to whether the player wants to leave, or if we're prepared to sell, I think this is a very fair point. It looked a problem for Di Maria in the latter part of the season though admittedly he was low on confidence.

8904~~~
He. Was. Not. Fit. 

Do you understand?

8905~~~
When he is on form and at his best he won't lose the ball all the time and I think we need some risk takers in our team too, otherwise it will be just posession for the sake of it. I just can't agree that people think the league or anything is a problem. The main problem was Di Maria, he fecked things up, his form was shit and confidence low, he had enough chances to shine, but didn't use it. If he can return to his best next year, he will be great for us in the PL, he showed his class at least in the first month already.
I don't care about his value to be honest, I don't want us to pay every stupid fee, but I don't care if a player lose his value or if we make a loss on him. We shouldn't sign players with that in our minds, we should just sign quality and keep them as long as they can be great for us. We can sign the players we want without selling Di Maria and Angel in top form could be much more worth than getting big money from PSG.

8906~~~
And shit in pretty much all the games he played while producing feck all. That his injury record is not good either doesn't make it better. It's the same with Rafael, in 5 years time people will keep saying "Give him another year, when he is fit he will be brilliant." No he won't and I am glad that LvG is kind of ruthless when it comes to that.

8907~~~
I'm not so sure about that, i just watched some game footage of him at Madrid last season and he really was sloppy with possession, many useless crosses etc.

I agree, but i'm not sure LvG agrees, there is also the difference between constantly trying to make something happen and intelligently move the ball around and suddently find the opportunity to lay a golden pass. I think for example Herrera's assist to Mata at Anfield was a good example of what we are trying to achieve reguarly.

Would like to think if we sold him, that we would spend the money on someone who actually fits, i just think LvG bottled it with this transfer to be frank.

8908~~~
Naturally.

8909~~~
Falcao is like a extra on a film set. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8910~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> why was he even there?

8911~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8912~~~

8913~~~

8914~~~

8915~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

8916~~~
That clarification actually worries me more, to be honest. As if Fellaini is under the impression that Di Maria does infact have a decision to make. Or perhaps I'm reading too much into it.

8917~~~
Nah, I think you're right.

8918~~~
Same here.  Would have been far more reassuring if Fellaini laughed it off as a silly rumor.  Something to the effect of "why would ADM want to leave?"

8919~~~
To be fair, would he be a big loss if he did leave? He's not gonna be playing in central midfield any time soon and where we do play him he's inconsistent at best. I'd not be opposed to selling him and bringing a real central midfielder or two in since we've already bought Depay.

8920~~~
With Memphis Depay playing as an inverted winger on the left and a central midfield geared towards reliable possession his only place really would be on the right wing.

If he had the freedom to come infield and essentially play a free role out there I think he could be brilliant. It's down to whether or not he wants it though.

8921~~~
I hope PSG buy him. He may well flourish here next season, but I tend to think he has too much ground to make up to become a viable Premier League player. This would be the last chance to get big money for him, and I'd take it.

8922~~~
Wow looking at those quotes I reckon he's very close to leaving.

8923~~~
I don't think I'm alone in not ever warming to Di Maria. He strikes me as a player that doesn't give much of a shite and half of the time his head isn't screwed on. Very similar mentality to Nani. I'd not be hugely fussed if he left as it would all but confirm his poor mentality. I just can't see him doing what Fellaini and Young did to restore their careers here.

8924~~~
Is
Is Rojo the only one who will be here next season?

8925~~~
Yep. In a settled team there's no reason he can't be very successful out on the wing for us. While he flourished as a central midfielder during his last season at Madrid, people would do well to remember that he was still a largely successful winger before that. I think talk of his sale borders on ludicrous. It's counter productive.

8926~~~
I think that's unfair on Nani in regards to attitude, by the way. He's an extremely hard worker. On topic, though, Di Maria does give the impression he doesn't care, which is strange in that visible work rate was seemingly a strength prior to this season, but I do admire his persistence. He never hid.

You raise the subject of Young, a player with an attitude to playing here that I previously found to be terrible. Here was a man with a incredible opportunity that was insistent on wasting it due to cowardice. He's changed that against all the odds, so it isn't beyond reasonable doubt to suggest that Di Maria can do that, too.

If he does want it leave, however, I'll be inclined to agree with you. Pissing off to France would be the easy thing to do, and he would leave England a failure.

8927~~~
Shouldn't entertain any offers unless we can sign a replacement of a similar calibre e.g. Bale, Reus. He's had a very poor first season, that's it. Given time in a settled side and bit more freedom with a little less expectation and pressure I reckon he'll flourish. He's a world class player, we need people like him the squad if we want to seriosuly challenge.

8928~~~
He's played like he doesn't want to be here all season, and if that's the case then he should just leave.

8929~~~
Yeah but if Young leaves it won't be to top club. He knows that. Di Maria would have offers from places which I assume he would be more interested in than Manchester.

8930~~~
Wonder if he was LvG's or Woodward's signing. I suspect the latter.

8931~~~
If that's how he feels then that's disappointing. United is a good place to be at the moment, and I think the rest of our squad, and staff, would attest to that. I want Di Maria to succeed here and believe he can, so him wanting to stay would be a big, big plus for us.

8932~~~
I think he was asked something like "Do you think Di Maria is leaving?" and as he can't speak for Di Maria he just said "If I was him I wouldn't".

Anyway I guess during and even ahead of Copa America Di Maria will have enough interviews to give, so we will hear from the man himself soon enough what he thinks.

8933~~~
Why do people question Di Maria's attitude? His performances haven't been the best but I don't doubt his attitude. From the interviews I've seen he's a realistic guy that is very happy that his daughter is still alive and that he's playing for a big club. He's always been a hard worker on the pitch and he hasn't complained publically about being benched either. He probably wasn't very happy this season because of on and off the pitch issues but there's nothing holding him back from improving next season. Why should other players get a 2nd season but not Di Maria, even though he's proven to be a great creative player for us already in glimpses?

He's said he wanted to stay and fight for his place and I'm sure he will. I don't even think PSG can afford him realistically speaking, there's 0 chance of a swap deal with them too.

This has been discussed numeral times, it doesn't matter. LvG will never agree to sign a player he doesn't want, if Woody forced a player onto him we would've heard about it. LvG mentioned Di Maria himself as a worldclass winger so I'm sure he wanted him.

8934~~~
LVG kept going on about not having a player of Di Maria's calibre, so I'm not so sure.

8935~~~
If that were the case then I'm confident LVG won't want to get rid after a season.

8936~~~
For the millionth time....LvG name dropped Di Maria as a "world class winger, that we don't have already", then we bought him.

8937~~~
This  ...In the final game of the season he was barely touched but still went off after 20 minutes or something and it had all the signs of a player that didn't want to get injured in his last game in case it could scupper a move away.....He looked like the best player in the league in his first 3 games and then hasn't looked happy or interested since........Maybe with a bit of English learned over the summer and a good rest then he can come back and become a great player next season..that's defo possible but as Scholesy put it many months ago - he hasn't looked happy

8938~~~
This thread will be hilarious next season.

8939~~~
I don't understand the attitude here, at times. 

One of the biggest contributors towards the visual downfall of his performances is a complete lack of confidence. He went from one of the valuable players in the world to bench warmer in the space of 6 months. It's odd that when others play bad it's mostly because they're out of form etc., but any poor outing from di Maria and the "he doesn't want to be here" crew start their engines. 

We have, in our hands, a world class player, who are very hard to acquire, these days. A man who, not too long ago, ripped apart the world champions. So for those who keep throwing around the "he only performed well at the beginning because he was playing shit teams like QPR, Burnley etc", I say he was performing well because he was full of confidence and playing in his favoured position. The moment we stuck him out on the wings, against WBA, was the moment we witnessed a completely different di Maria. 

We have an assist machine whether in form or out, and we should, if the rumours are to be believed, do everything to keep here. As <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> points out, di Maria isn't the type of guy who would complain about being on the bench or shy away from responsibility, just read what he says about his daughter and how grateful he was about her birth. I would assume he thinks similarly of being here at Manchester United, one of the greatest clubs of all time; privileged is a word that comes to mind. 

A second chance could be the key to getting the best out of him, it'll certainly provide him with the faith and confidence he quite clearly lacks.

8940~~~
This was a club signing. Who wouldn't turn down a world class player if handed to them.

8941~~~
Pretty much. Not to say he was <i>forced</i> onto van Gaal, but this signing would have happened regardless of manager (yes, even Moyes) when you look at Di Maria's motivation for coming here.

8942~~~
Disagree. Van Gaal asked for him and got him. Why would a business waste 60m on an unwanted asset. That's double our previous transfer record. You think van Gaal would specifically mention a player he didn't specifically want?

8943~~~
doubt the club would buy a player the manager has not asked for.

I think he will come good..after he adopts van Gaal's philosphy.

8944~~~
If he is still here next season we should put De Gea on free kicks. Its not as crazy a Jones on corners.

Di Maria's rabona <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8945~~~
Wouldn't be too different from the Mata transfer, really. Convenient for all parties, including Woodward. Pretty much a no-brainer for a manager looking to strengthen his team.
Neither manager seemed to have a real clue how they were using their big-name signing.
Only difference is the price, but you could argue we were more desperate, following a shocking year. It just tells us the way the club views signings now, under new management.
Not 'unwanted', but there are degrees between 'wanted' and 'unwanted'.

8946~~~
Yup you would have to say on the balance of probabilities he will not be here in the summer. I actually think it would be best for both parties, he is best as a LCM and he isn't going to get the chance to play such a role in this side under LVG.. not possession minded enough and as a winger he isn't that great in my opinion, never has been.

8947~~~
Incorrect.

Di Maria has 3 goals + 11 assists in 20 PL starts. He averages 0.7 g+a per start.

Nani during his whole time at United has 25 goals + 56 assists in 111 PL starts. He averages 0.73 g+a per start.

At his peak Nani had 9 goals + 19 assists in 31 starts. An average of 0.9 g+a per start.

Across the 4 seasons that Nani started at least 15 PL games, he averaged 0.8 g+a per start.

Sorry but Di Maria has not even managed to match Nani's average productivity, nevermind his best seasons.

(stats from Transfermarkt - Di Maria has 7 sub appearances compared to 35 for Nani in the PL so PL starts is a reasonable proxy for playing time, given their respective number of starts)

8948~~~
I agree with the general point you make. It's more a complete lack of confidence than anything to do with a poor attitude or not being suited to the league.

I really don't understand this point. You bring up his performance against Germany which was superb but neglect to mention that the performance came when he was playing on the wing not through the middle. And then in the next sentence you blame his lack of form on him playing out wide. His performances were very poor regardless of the position he played in (and it's a position he's played in for the majority of his career).

8949~~~
Speculation continues to look as if he's off, it doesn't exactly surprise... well perhaps some on here may be, who knows, I just hope we get a decent fee and not some hideous season long loan deal with an option to buy type agreement.

8950~~~
Unless we get £50m and use that on Bale, I will be disappointed if we get rid. Still think he can come good.

8951~~~
I'd prefer to give him more time. How many years did we give Anderson?

8952~~~
I know I should be more nervous about these rumours with him leaving, but I don't think I really mind that much. He has the quality, I just don't think he suits Van Gaal's system. He played well in the middle, but Van Gaal didn't like the balance which cost us goals. He's not performing well out wide. 

If we get a good fee, then fine let him go. We'll strengthen this Summer anyway.

8953~~~
Its ridiculous to get rid ADM in just ONE SEASON! yes its has been a disappointing one, especially second half of the season. But come on, this guy is magic when he is on form and first half of the season show what he can do. He needs more time to settle in, find his place in the team and then push to be the best he can be. United are gonna need him next season, especially in UCL.

8954~~~
I'm saying this assuming the player doesn't want to be here. We don't know whether Di Maria is actually enjoying United or not. I've said the same with De Gea, no point keeping a player if he doesn't want to be here.

8955~~~
He wasnt good in the whole of the first half of season. If memory serves me well, did he not get injured around November? Once this happened, he was average.
So really, he was good for 2 months. For the rest of his time he was average (not bad, just average).

8956~~~
Probably alone here, but I don't put his early 'good' form down to playing in the middle. He was bound to have a few really good games at some stage during a 38 game season. They just happened to come at the initial period (mostly against dross), where, frankly, the whole team (a number of them being new) played with a degree of 'swagger' and zip. 

I think too much is being made of his position, personally.

8957~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/angel-di-maria-rubbishes-man-5825785" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/angel-di-maria-rubbishes-man-5825785</a>

I'd be happy if the quotes are true, shows he has some determination and character. He can definitely be one of our best players and hopefully he stays fit for us and can be an integral part of the team next season, him and Depay on wings in full swing is mouth watering.

8958~~~
Impressed with his recent comments. He's made for Manchester United, just needs to rediscover his form.

8959~~~
Richard Keys looks like a prized lemon now after tweeting a week ago that he heard from a source in the know that Di Maria asked to leave.....Not that Key isn't a prized lemon already......best thing Sky ever did was fire the muppet.....I hope to God Di Maria stays.....with a good holiday and a good pre-season he can only be good for us next season. Mata was atrocious in his first 6 months yet was fairly decent this season ...Di Maria is twice the player Mata is so if he can settle in Manchester then we could have ourselves a world beater next season

8960~~~
That's twice he said he wanted to stay at United, he ain't going anywhere. Can't wait for him to show us what he's really got next season.

8961~~~
Ar-Gen-Tina!

8962~~~
A "Woodward" signing is a myth, Woodward in no way shape or form signs players without LvG's full consent and knowledge.

8963~~~
Falcao.

8964~~~
LvG said multiple times that there was no way he could pass up on a player like Falcao, especially on a loan.

8965~~~
Mourinho also claims Shevchenko was a signing of his.

8966~~~
Louis van Gaal isn't Mourinho, he doesn't lie. If Woodward would've forced a signing onto him we would've heard about it. Van Gaal agreed to the loan so I don't see a problem.

8967~~~
Cool he's staying, here's to him settling and finding his form again.

8968~~~
Good lad. Idiots on here will have you believe that he can't wait to get out of Manchester, has poor attitude and various other bullshit

8969~~~
Are there any players of ours that you actually DO like?


Im glad to hear him saying he wants to stay and prove that he can do it here - makes me think he can. Would have been very weak of him to leave because he couldnt face the challenge.

8970~~~
The big question remains though: why is it taking so long to see results if lots of people at United seem confident ADM can still make it?

That was something I was thinking about during the season and I'm sure LVG thought about it as well. I think I saw him play on the right flank a few times. However for some reason, either it didn't work out enough to make a viable option or Di Maria doesn't want to play the Robben role on that right flank.

8971~~~
It took him a year to adapt when he signed for Madrid and he played a lot on the right wing under Mourinho. Di Maria is good there but like you said he needs a free role which is generally the case for Van gaal's wingers.

8972~~~
Personally I think he was the perfect example of Post world cup itis. All that mixed with a move to another league/culture all took it's toll. I for one am more than willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Can't wait for next season now.

8973~~~
If we can have the Di Maria back of the start of the season, we will be off to a great start. I do think maybe LVG shackling him made him start second guessing himself, but hopefully he will allow him to play a role where he can attack and dribble freely without worrying too much.

8974~~~
But his body language!!

8975~~~
I think more and more that was an issue for a lot of our players, be it form wise or injuries

8976~~~
It's annoying that he has this Copa America on now. The Final is on the 4th of July, and there's a huge chance Argentina will be there for that.

Season starts on the 8th of August so that only gives him about a month until the next competitive match. We (hopefully/should) give him at least 2 or even 3 weeks off after the Copa America. Still a good chance he'll be burnt out. I expect the start of next season being filled with cameo roles for him again.

8977~~~
The most important thing for di Maria will be to regain his confidence and playing for his country - especially with Messi in the form he's in - should be the perfect way to do that.

8978~~~
Absolutely nothing there implies I don't like him. I just think the talk about positions is a cop out.
For the record, I think Carrick, Herrera, de Gea, Depay (early days) are brilliant.

Di Maria will get better. To be fair, he'd probably have to play badly purposely in order to not do better this season.

8979~~~
He's right it is a harder league. We all know Messi plays in a pussy league. Tap him up Angel.

8980~~~
He will need less of a pre season due to him having played in the Copa America, plus it's not like we had him playing every game for 90 minutes towards the end of the season. It will do him some good to get some confidence back.

8981~~~
I thought he hates being at United and desperately wants out..

8982~~~
I really don't think he was being shackled at all. Well, he was doing the exact opposite: taking needless shots, being careless in possession in our own half, etc.

 The caf body language experts are just something else

8983~~~
I think it's more to do with confidence personally, he was full of confidence last season for madrid and the start of this, and that slowly went away the more we struggled and then he started struggling on a personal level.

8984~~~
Fecking hell, 13 assists is not too shabby. Imagine what he'll be like when more settled and used to the league next season <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8985~~~
Imagine a full season of his early season form <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Hope we get to see more of him in that left midfield role.

8986~~~
Careful posting comments like that. Chris Brunt managed 10 assists, too. Therefore, assists have lost their legitimacy.

8987~~~
I think Chris Brunt probably played 95% of West Brom games and he wasn't a foreigner new to the league.

8988~~~
Goal Cup Champions 14/15! <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

8989~~~
To be fair, i thought that at times last season, his body language was not good.

I'm glad he wants to stay though (if this is true) and it would be a complete waste to get rid of someone of his quality after one dodgy season (a dodgy season where he got the 3rd most assists in the league).

8990~~~
I think all these body language experts on the caf may need to get a new occupation <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8991~~~
Hes had a poor season, I fully expect his body language to not be good, sitting on the bench for Young. Thats a good thing, if he was happy as larry in that situation I'd be worried.

8992~~~
Exactly. Although there did seem to a big difference in his work-rate in the earlier vs later part of the season. All well and good a player being unhappy/frustrated but if that translates into not putting enough effort in then we've got a real problem.

Re the latest comments, they don't leave us any the wiser. Standard media-trained response to some difficult questions. I was much more encouraged by earlier comments of his which were a bit more detailed about his unhappiness with his form and his desire to set things right next season. Just a pain in the arse that he's off to  the Copa. A decent holiday, followed by a full pre-season with Van Gaal is exactly what he needs for next season. One of those occasions where an international tournament couldn't come at a worse time.

8993~~~
What?

8994~~~
Could've sworn Mata's goal was in the PL.

8995~~~
That's utterly bizarre.

8996~~~
Happy he's staying, really hope he has a great tourny and comes back full of confidence, we all know what he's capable of it'd be very nice if he could replicate that when he's in a United shirt.

8997~~~
I find that Di Maria is very underwhelming on that left wing. I think he's better as a CM or a right winger.

8998~~~
Good to hear he's staying.

It's quite amazing how Di Maria and Bale both struggled last season at their respective clubs. Two superstars that have proven their quality time and time again in the past and there's speculation regarding both of them leaving after a season or two in Bales case. It's just strange when you think about it. Maybe next season we'll see a complete reverse.

8999~~~
That's it? One sentence and now he's staying? 
I still feel he's very close to leaving.

9000~~~
He also said just a few weeks ago when these rumors started that he wants to become a legend here.

9001~~~
caf experts win again. burglary! never wanted to join us in the first place! body language!

9002~~~
Yeah I missed that (can't find it).

9003~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/manchester-united-gary-neville-backs-angel-di-maria-rediscover-form-after-disappointing-season-1501939" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/manchester...cover-form-after-disappointing-season-1501939</a>

This speculation is all shite, why would Manchester United sell their best player they just signed last summer? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9004~~~
Thought his goal was deservedly one of the best, if not the best, of the season. It was a unique and brilliant goal. One of the very few good things about his season .

9005~~~
Nah he's fine on the left. Which side of the pitch one plays on only really effects players who's main strength is crossing or conversely crossing. As long as he's not restricted he'll be fine. He can probably do his best work at CM, true, which become more of an option if we get Schneiderlin. Herrera and ADM in CM leaves Carrick too exposed.

Delighted he's staying. Truly unique player, will be devastating next season I'm sure.

9006~~~
We need to play him in midfield that's where he is at his best, he should be occupying that left side role instead of fellaini, di Maria would be a big disappointment if we try to play him as a winger. The prospect of him, Shaw and depay all linking up is really exciting and has lots of potential.

Could be interesting if veratti goes to madrid though because although it now looks likely di Maria will stay it could change.

9007~~~
Completely agree. We saw how Mata/Herrera/Valencia linked up on the right. Those three, if they develop an understanding, should be as good. 

My only worry is i think LvG doesnt rate Di Marias defensive ability. Unless we get a real enforcer, or hope Blind develops into one, a three of Blind/Carrick/Herrera/Di Maria is just too lightweight

9008~~~
If his heart's in it, he stays for sure.

Hope we get much more from him next season. And I think we will.

9009~~~
I agree. All season I have wanted to see him in a midfield with Carrick and Herrera but it just hasn't happened.

9010~~~
If his heart is really in it we will see him shine next season.

9011~~~
"Idiots" seems a bit strong. Surely many of us have been in a position in the past when they've been strongly considering leaving, weighing up their options for months, but when they spoke to their manager they said they were happy as Larry? The same logic applies here and because he's speaking to the media, he has even more of an obligation to say the right things. There's no possible reason for di María to openly admit he wants to leave so him saying this tells us absolutely nothing.

If you take it at face value then fair enough, but it seems odd to me that the people who do take it at face value use it as an opportunity to celebrate how right they were and how wrong the others were, rather than an opportunity to celebrate the fact we have an incredible player who wants to play for us. Strange set of priorities, IMO.

9012~~~
I don't care about Mourinho, LvG would not allow any players to be forced on him. Woodward knows nothing about football, he is the CEO who negotiates with agents and companies, not someone who identifies targets. Woodward hasn't turned into some football muppet in a few years, he's a business man. The most he says is "we want the best players here!"

9013~~~
Glad he's come out rubbishing the rumours. Hopefully he has a fine copa America. Terrific player and one if the most exiting to watch when in full flight.

9014~~~
I'm firmly of the belief that ADM's best position is LCM but where do we think LGV will play him next season? 

I think the only hope of him playing there is a proper destroying DM and a left winger who puts a good defensive shift in- does Depay track back much?

Without these in place LGV will probably consider it leaving us to exposed.

If we move to a 4231 the only option is the wing, left or right

9015~~~
Goals scored by us, definitely. 

Twas a season of ludicrously good goals overall though (a bunch of them all in the same weekend!). No way would that be the best goal in the league last season.

9016~~~
It's weird that it worked at Madrid, given that the left winger there was Ronaldo. But I suppose when you're just steamrolling every team it doesn't matter as much that players like Di Maria and Ronaldo are bombing forwards. Still, it would be an idea to try and replicate what they had going there, because Di Maria was fantastic that season

9017~~~
You can't replicate what they did without Ronaldo, last season they were playing an Hybrid 433/442.

9018~~~
As that goal went in I literally thought we may win the league... At that very moment.... Alas we didn't even win the fecking match <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9019~~~
Not saying Memphis is Ronaldo, but he could play the same role as the second striker.

9020~~~
I agree. I'm really disappointed he hasn't performed well this season. I'm even more disappointed that some wankers broke in to his house. That would be enough to upset and unsettle anyone, especially someone new the country, let alone area. I hope he can find his form again and begin to love United and England. He is a joy to watch when on form and the fans will love him if he responds well in the new season.

9021~~~
If he wants to stay and show what he can do after a difficult first season in a new country then good, that sort of stubborn drive and determination is what the best Utd players are made of.

9022~~~
It's not only about the role, it's about who plays it. The system was designed for Ronaldo.

9023~~~
Me too, buddy. Felt unreal at the time. 2-0 up in the matter of minutes... then James Vardy and Clattenburg wanted time in the spotlight. Oh what could have been...

9024~~~
There will always be great goals; for me, most are too generic, not that they're aren't spectacular, though. Volley's, long rangers etc. Goals like di Maria's against Leicester and, off the top of my head, Wilshere's* team goal against who ever it was, the season before last, are fresher to the eye and, for me, are far more deserved of the goal of the season title than the same generic stunners we witness every few weeks.

*think it won GoTY, anyway (?).

9025~~~
Just scored for Argentina vs Bolivia

9026~~~
and playing well <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9027~~~
Yeah, the whole team is playing well. 

Now there's a penalty .

9028~~~
now assist for Kun goal, 3:0 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9029~~~
I really like the team.I think we play well without Messi

9030~~~
Nice crosses from adm

9031~~~
No surprise, he is a quality player. Our management team are trying to fix something that was not broken

9032~~~
It's not a surprise at all that he performs well for Argentina, and it will also not be a surprise if he leaves and performs well for his next club. 

I just hope it doesn't come to that and LvG manages to get the best out of him instead.

9033~~~
Penalty for Argentina, Di Maria

Scores! Arg. 5 - 0 Bolivia

Aguero x 3
Di Maria x 2

9034~~~
I honestly think that everyone thinks this, which is why I'm always confused at the goal of the season bits which are just long range shots. They're great at the time but a brilliant team goal is so much better to watch

9035~~~
What position did he play for Argentina?

9036~~~
played on the wing, mostly on the left one.....btw he picked some injury and was subbed, didnt look to serious though.

9037~~~
Interesting that Argentina have him back on the wing as well.

9038~~~
Well if he doesn't performances like last night can put to bed the ridiculous idea that playing him wide is the problem.

9039~~~
Not playing him after he came back from the small injury he had was the problem.

We really need to go with Memphis on the left wing and Di Maria on our right wing to add some pace to our team. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Hopefully Shaw will be there and a proper right back as well.

9040~~~
As much as I like Mata, he can't play on the wing. We need a front 3 like Barca's. Pure pace. So ADM, Memphis and a centre forward (Rooney). Maybe play a midfield 3 of Mata Herrera and a new DM and we'd look great. Problem is it's not LVG football of pure possession. Hence why we will have Mata on the wing still, and a conservative midfielder in the mix. 

Another problem is our full backs. It's such an important position, these guys need robe world class. We need them so badly in our attack, need them to be wingers really. Alvez wold be a massive upgrade on Valencia. Shaw needs to stay fit all season. If not then we need a left back too. Unless Blind can make the position his own.

9041~~~
Delighted to read the other day that he will stay. Very interesting him for to admit that the Premier League is a harder league to play in than La Liga.

9042~~~
God I hope he can return to his best for us next season. I think with us signing him and Falcao the belief was we had signed two world class players which we've not had enough of in recent years. City basically sleepwalked to second despite only Silva and Aguero performing for them. We have a player at or near that level in Di Maria if he can replicate his Madrid form.

9044~~~
I'd really love to see him firing on all cylinders next season! Such a fantastic player

9045~~~
Scored 2 today. Assisted another for Aguero - who got a hat trick himself - in a 5-0 win over Bolivia. Captain too.

Highlights:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZaUwfDqQyw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

9046~~~
I know LVG is all about the team and doing as your told but some players should just be allowed to play!

I really hope Di Maria finds his mojo at United next season, maybe a return to European football will help.

9047~~~
Good lad!

9048~~~
There's no surprise he's had a good game for Argentina. On the one hand, he's starting as Captain for his country (WC runners up) and on the other, he's playing 10-15 minutes as a sub for the fourth best team in England. We should have shown more faith in him as opposed to leaving him to rot on the bench. Lets not make the same mistake, again, next season.

9049~~~
Yeah, we should put Di Maria interests before the team, he was out of form and the players on the field (Young and Mata) were in form. The team needed the CL qualification there was no time for Di Maria.

9050~~~
I can't understand how everyone doesn't think this. I know the joke about messi not being able to hack it on a cold night in stoke, but it is based on some truth. 

Even last night Messi wasn't allowed waltz around vs Juve without a strong tackle coming in. Doesn't seem to happen in spain, whether it's the ref or the culture

9051~~~
Spain does it right I think. In our league it is almost accepted to go in very hard on players with a slight physique and quick feet. In Spain that's at least a yellow or a red.

9052~~~
That's the thing, he wasn't out of form. He was our best player in the game FA cup game against Arsenal and lost his form as a result of being out of the team. Young, Mata and Fellaini quite easily could have been dropped after the Chelsea game, and definitely by the Everton game; however, we chose not to and won a mighty one from our last six.

I don't understand the bolded part... If we get him back to his best, then surely we'd reap the rewards?

9053~~~
We can't just keep him in the first team when he's putting cross after cross into row z and is facing a crisis of confidence, when we NEED top 4.

This is the perfect time for him to work hard and come back a stronger player. We need Di Maria to his old standard back.

9054~~~
Once we lost to Chelsea, and then Everton, we quite easily could have had him back in the starting XI. Heck, after the loss against WBA, he should have been nailed on for a start, but he wasn't; couldn't have been great for his confidence, hence the wayward crossing in his sub appearance against West Brom.

9055~~~
We will reap the rewards next season, the end of this season was to important to play an out of form player.

9056~~~
The manager obviously got more confidence from young in training, and it's obvious to see why.

Look, I've defended Di Maria a lot this season. I think he's one of the most exciting players in the world to watch and if he gets back to his best he will be our best player instantly. But I don't think lvg made a mistake this season in playing him less. He was under immense pressure to get 4th and he did what he had to. Now Di Maria can work hard and show his best form next season with a clean slate.

9057~~~
Not really, like I said, we picked up 5 points from 18 and still finished 6 points ahead of fifth. He should have started after the WBA loss, if not after the Everton game.

9058~~~
You are trying to rewrite history here, Di Maria was out of form and he probably wasn't better in training hence why he wasn't starting games. Di Maria is a great player but for reasons unknown to us he didn't performed well, next season will be a different story and he will probably start most games.

9059~~~
The thing is, aside from the first three or so games last season, we have hardly any evidence of his 'old standard' in a United shirt. It's not like he was playing well for around 2 months and then went to shit. He was poor for the entire season and that worries me.

9060~~~
It's so uniimportant as well. It's about the team and we needed confidence in the team and Di Maria was struggling with it and struggling with the new league. Nothing wrong with giving him time to improve while we get what we need and what he would need to be at this club - champions league football.

9061~~~
So he should started the game after West Brom because he was terrible when he came on against West Brom? Di Maria needs to up it massively, he's actually got away quite lightly for how disappointing he's been given how much he cost. Although Van Gaal also has to take the blame for signing a player coming off by far his best season and then quickly deciding he didn't trust him to play there. Until his last year at Madrid he was always a slightly inconsistent winger, I'd take that right now rather than what he showed from about November onwards which was mostly pretty poor.

9062~~~
His numbers are too good for him to have been poor all season.

He's a great player. He'll prove it at United next season like he did at Madrid. If he's motivated and stays as a result, I'm very confident in him doing well.

9063~~~
I disagree, I don't like the culture of the spanish game. The last ten minutes of every match involves dives and players rolling around on the ground, robbing the fans of an exciting finish and value. I felt sorry for people who aid 1000 euro last night and had to watch 10 minutes of barcelona players diving and acting and limping off. If Bayern Munich had been that low in 1999 they would have won 1 nil and there wouldn't have been a shot in the last ten minutes, and their fans would have been happy, but all the neutral fans around the world would have been robbed of a great finish

9064~~~
Whilst I think he had a poor season, I think that this is very much overstated. Only had 3 or so good games?

9065~~~
Yes and Vidal was lucky not to be sent off

9066~~~
No, he had a few others, but if we're talking about his old standard, they were still far away from his best.

9067~~~
I don't think that's a strong enough argument to say that england and la liga are the same difficulty for attackers, which is my point

9068~~~
If I was LVG I'd buy a midfielder that would allow Utd to play Di Maria in a midfield 3.

Di Maria ----- Herrera
--------New CM-------

Problem solved!

9069~~~
van Gaal refused to make any changes to a team that had just lost three in a row, and it could have cost us since we ended up winning one from our last three. We were lucky that Liverpool somehow managed to trump our form from our last six and failed to capitalise from our mistakes. 

In hindsight, it looks different, as it seems as if it worked out as we wanted it to; however, at the time, we should have changed things to avoid squeaky bum time from the last three fixtures. If we're vying for more than fourth place, this coming season, I'd to see a more proactive LvG, especially, if we lose three in a row and our football is dull. 

Lastly, we're talking about Angel di Maria, not some chump from the third division. A player who was voted into the world team of the year from 13/14; had we shown him a bit more confidence in him, we may have finished third as opposed to fourth.

9070~~~
He deserved to be dropped last season, but i agree that van gaal should show more faith in him. 

Let's not forget that he had 4 goals and 11 assists in 24 starts, he could easily double those numbers with regular football next season.

9071~~~
Schnierdelin (or however its spelt)

9072~~~
3 things to add to the debate here folks -

1) Di Maria's style by nature is to try things on the ball that will risk giving it away in the final third. Dribbles, through balls, crosses and shots. Those actions create chances regularly for good strikers and individual brilliance is something that we will see flourish with Memphis' arrival too. It also a difference maker when a team is struggling to break an opponent down or force an error in the opposition to exploit - something we suffered from a lot last season. 

2) Di Maria creates a hell of a lot of chances naturally. While the consistency of his delivery was awry at times, his actual play wasn't far off what he has been doing week in, week out anyway in his career to date. The price tag and performances in the world cup seem to have over inflated peoples expectations to a level that he simply has never achieved to date. Feel free to look at his statistics and his career, he doesn't  score a shed load of goals but he creates huge amounts and poses threat at all times. In fact, had we had an in-form striker finishing some more of the chances he did create - Falcao, Fellaini, Rooney and van Persie often fluffed up - then Di Maria's assists would have been doubled and all of this "flop" talk would have been reversed as praise for a man who creates so much - just like at Madrid when (B, B &) Cristiano would generally score. Therefore his "struggles" are often twinned with the weaknesses of strikers too. Feel some on here miss this part crucially.

3) I'm hoping, by September (because I expect a slow start post Copa America and phased pre-season) he has replaced Fellaini in the team. I think MF has great use in Prem games but generally speaking, his place is open for Di Maria to take directly or Mata to switch infield and Di Maria to start on the right. If Rooney or another striker can hit form and if Memphis edges out Young, then we will have a great deal of movement and quality for Di Maria to create chances for and thrive once more.

9073~~~
Can't wait for him to get back to his best next season.

9074~~~
He played Young there ahead of him against Hull. It's quite clear he will not play in midfield for us.

9075~~~
Yes it was clear Di Maria was not going to play in a midfield 3 in the '2014/15' squad...mainly due to the Leicester shambles.
But i am suggesting that with the right buys in the transfer market Di Maria could find himself back in the centre in the 2015/16 squad.

9076~~~
What position was he playing in for Argentina?

9077~~~
Creates more chances per minute, and had more goals/assists per minute last season than your Fabregas', Silva's, even Hazard. He is the kind of player who would have absolutely thrived under Fergie, or most managers, but I don't think LVG is going to let him here. 

Watching Neymar and Messi last night - in the CL Final - being given free license to take risks, try individual skills and just play their way - wouldn't happen under coaches like LVG/Mourinho/Benitez. 

I think LVG will make us a better team and functional unit, but I've seen nothing that suggests he's even interested in leveraging ADM's world class talent. He almost seems to resent the unpredictability. 

Which is just stupid when you stare at the raw numbers. Di Maria creates chances and goals for us, in a season when we couldn't score. We replace him with Young, who tries really hard, is positionally disciplined, but barely ever actually gets us goals.

9078~~~
That's wrong, we've seen how much freedom Di Maria gets. If he wasn't allowed freedom with the way he played last season he'd have been dropped before Christmas to never play again. Wingers and 10 always get freedom and can take risks under van Gaal so I don't know why you think that. No other positions can dribble or lose the ball as much as Di Maria does. Ofcourse he has to fit in with the team a bit more, but there is no reason why Di Maria can't.

Have you seen van Gaal's teams in the past? Arjen Robben wasn't exactly restricted, and neither will Di Maria be.

9079~~~
Other players who transferred from La Liga to the EPL did say that they now have more space and more time on the ball. David Silva and Aguero off the top of my head.

9080~~~
ADM is vital for United to do well in CL. You guys may win the league without him, but in CL it's vital you get the last ounce of juice from this guy. You need that extra quality, that additonal push to win in CL knock-out games. ADM is the perfect guy for that, he can give you something extra in tight games.

9081~~~
I think we need him big time in the league as well given we don't have many players that can do what he can at his best and basically turn defenders inside out by running at them.

9082~~~
Fabregas on the two leagues:

9083~~~
Surely it's not about how "Hard" you go in, but whether it's a clean tackle or not.

9084~~~
I would consider many shoulder charges Di Maria got throughout the season and tactical fouls to stop him from going into the box as very dangerous challenges which only a few times got punished with a free kick or yellow card. Even Herrera and Mata get this kind of treatment from time to time. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Ronaldo used to get that a lot as well here, goes past 2 players and gets a very rough sliding challenge that takes both the ball and the man.

9085~~~
Captain Rev
It is still football, which is meant to be a contact game.

Although the likes of Barcelona try and make it otherwise.

Never can a team have combined such fine football with such levels of cheating.

Suarez on his own was on the floor so much yesterday at the merest touch. He's built like a brick sh!Thouse

9086~~~
some myths being created in here. 

First - ADM wasnt off form. He indeed was off form, he should have started last few games, sure, but that doesnt change the fact he was in poor form for a good while.

Second - LVG doesnt give some players freedom to play. That's another myth which has been busted again and again but people will repeat it nontheless.

9087~~~
I would like him to do well but I don't see any change happening from last year, if he can stay injury free he has a much better chance though.

9088~~~
Put him in a side setup to counter attack and watch your jaw drop.

9089~~~
How would that even be possible? Unless you're looking at yourself in a mirror... but then you wouldn't be watching the game, so your jaw would be dropping at your own reflection. I don't think that's what you were getting at, but it's the only thing that makes sense.

9090~~~
And notice your jaw drop

9091~~~
Not that I'm calling you out or anything but considering most of us on here are United fans, we'd all want him to do this wouldn't we?

I want us to cut our losses because I don't see him fitting the team or league and don't think he really wants to be here but ideally I'd love him to habe a great year for us too.

9092~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Thanks. I honestly don't remember making that post!

9093~~~
If he doesn't want to be here he won't be next season. If he stays it means he's up for the challenge. I hope that's the case because we don't have a dribbler like him in our squad and finding one will be difficult.

9094~~~
This is a forum where I can only speak for myself and not for all of you/us, and after reading some of the comments on this forum over time, I'm not sure if all the fans want players to do well.

Why would you sell him after just one season? Why not give players a proper chance? Would you have sold Vidic or Evra as well?

9095~~~
It's bonkers isn't it? If you listened to some fans we should be selling Angel, Mata, Rooney, RVP, Januzaj, Rafael, Shaw, Herrera at one point, not to mention all the shit players we should've sold last year.

Were fans always this mental? Or has Football Manager and FIFA melted some people's ability to think in real world terms?

9096~~~
Knowing the type of player he is and the type of player LVG would prefer him to be, and seeing thats not gonna happen?

Plus the kicker still remains his family and their perceived distrust of Manchester after the break-in. His performances fell off a cliff once that happened and never recovered. Factor in that he didn't want to leave Madrid and supposedly wanting to join PSG before us and these are all things that neither Evra or Vidic presented.

You can say it's all rumours and hearsay but theres no smoke without fire.

That all said, just like most, if we had a fully firing Di Maria it'd be amazing and I'd love it.

9097~~~
Fans were always fickle. No patience with our players and wanting to get rid very quickly but demanding eternal loyalty.

It annoys me when fans want to sell a 19 year old talent, a world class player who had a dificult 2nd half (in his first season) or a very talented spanish midfielder who needed some time to adjust. Where is the fan's loyalty, patience and common sense?

9098~~~
Now that's a lot of speculation. We dont know if he's the type of player that will thrive under LVG, because he had brilliant as well as poor games. But I wonder how you came to that conclusion... And how he and his family now feel in England, well, no one knows unless you're a close friend. The same goes for that PSG transfer.

Who's making the smoke? The reliable English papers?

9099~~~
We can only go up off what we hear and yeah, entirely speculative but it makes sense. I'm sure his wife wasn't best pleased about leaving Madrid but then losing Paris and ending up in Manc followed by getting burgled must've made life fun for Di Maria at home. As I said his performances fell off a cliff after that came out...

I should probably work for tabloids...2+2=5 right?

9100~~~
This. We've had a lot of changes in our team and are going through a transitional period. Let's give everyone a little if time before we make our final and defining conclusions about them all. It's not so hard.

9101~~~
It may makes sense but we dont know. For me, ADM is just too good to sell right now. At least give him another chance because if it would work out with him we have a top 5 players in our team who creates so many chances - exactly what we'd need right now

9102~~~
Yeah he's basically a chance creating machine. It would be silly if, assuming he wants to stay, we give up on a player who is quite comfortably our most creative and one of the most creative around. It's something we aren't that good at either.

9103~~~
body contact can be allowed only if the ball is open to anyone.  once a player keeps the ball under his possession any body contact is not allowed anymore.  or body contacts could have also happened as subsequent actions after a clean tackle is being made.   at least this is the standard that football is played everywhere in the world and maybe there is only one place in exception

definitely adm was very furious of the never-ending illegal body contacts he received during the season and was frustrated when the criminals were all immune from punishment.  his reaction to michael oliver is just a reflection of it

9104~~~
Saw this doing the rounds on twitter. It's still bizarre to me that people don't rate him on here.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/iwsvWx7.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/iwsvWx7.jpg"/>

9105~~~
Yeah but by his standards he flopped. If he produced the same again next season? People would be disappointed. I don't think anyone can doubt that.

9106~~~
Stats never tell the whole story. It was a really poor season from him in terms of performance. I'm not sure anybody can deny that.

9107~~~
The way I see it is that he performed relatively well when you take into context our team performance as a whole. 

Those stats for the fourth best team in the league are quite impressive. Yes, you'd have expected more from him, but it's hard to shine in a team that was as inconsistent as we were, last season. The fact that many considered Ashley Young as our best outfield performer last season illustrates just how bad we were. Not to take anything away from Young, however, his first season for Man United was better than his last season for us.

9108~~~
It wasn't his best season, but he was still our most creative player.

9109~~~
For about 8 games.

9110~~~
You mean 38? Shocking that he played a little more than half the season yet was our most creative player.

9111~~~
He played well in a few games and racked up good stats. He was invisible for the rest of season.

9112~~~
He was still creating during his "bad" spell. And he was invisible because he was on the bench from March onwards.

Regardless, we all expect far more from him, next season. Especially, if we're challenging for the league.

9113~~~
So, in those 8 games he did more than any of our other players did in the rest of the season... yet he's the problem?

9114~~~
Still amazes me how frequently he overhits passes, especially considering his quality. Also very strange that Young was better beating men from a standing start.

9115~~~
He's obviously insanely creative, which is why we signed him. But he did have a sub par year which ended horribly. 

He didn't look good in his 1st copa game either, but I'm still confident in him doing well for us because this slump aside he's an excellent player.

9116~~~
Not that supriing given Young was in the form of his life and Di Maria in the worst form of his. Same happened with January this season. A young player with such great technical gifts constantly trying to play like a pacey winger and lacking the confidence to do what he normally would.

9117~~~
He had a few good games. He was beyond dreadful after the turn of year and produced very little, yes he's a bit of a problem right now, a €70m problem at that.

9118~~~
di Maria's first 10 games:  Minutes: 820; G/A: 3/6 Man United results (W/D/L): 5/3/2 GF/GA: 17/12
di Maria's next 10 games: Minutes: 204; G/A: 0/0 Man United results (W/D/L): 6/3/1 GF/GA: 17/6
di Maria's next 10 games: Minutes: 608; G/A: 0/7 Man United results (W/D/L): 8/1/1 GF/GA: 23/9
di Maria's last 6 games   : Minutes: 99  ; G/A: 0/0 Man United results (W/D/L): 1/2/3 GF/GA: 3/7

His performances during the end of last season weren't close to the first few games, yet they weren't as bad as some make out. They key to his performances were playing consistently, during which he would constantly produce, more than anyone else.

9119~~~
People bashing him based on one season performance baffles me,game in Premier league is completely different to where he had played before.
Slight adjustment is what he needed right now,which i completely expect from him from start next season.

9120~~~
Remember the WC Semi-final?

He was pretty unremarkable in that, but who got them through to the final?

Who the feck cares, you win a game of football by scoring more than the other team, people were getting excited by Young, but on several occasions he was subbed off for Di Maria, who came on and assisted the winning goal.  We know he is a properly World Class player and he has shown that he can pull a bit of magic out of nothing time and time again over the season.

This is the same sort of attitude that gets players like Giggs & Nani booed at OT, hopefully he is resilient enough to get through it and he has admitted that it is his intention to improve his performances next season.

Some people don't half spout a lot of bollocks on here...

9121~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9122~~~
feck this iPad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9123~~~
So what you're ultimately saying is Di Maria should be immune from all criticism last season because there's a chance he'll be booed and could produce magic once in a blue moon? hardly time and time again.

There's a reason why he was frozen out at times by LVG, and that's because he was costing the team with carelessness in possession either by aimlessly running himself into trouble or passing the ball straight back to the opposition. If you couldn't see reason for the criticism in that regard, I don't know. He also deserves praise for the good he did, but it was in very small bursts. For a world class player coming to United in or around his prime, people have every right to expect better than what he produced last season.

9124~~~
how did Sanchez manage?

9125~~~
People on here rate him. They just don't rate that iffy season he just had.

9126~~~
Everyone knows he is world class when on form. And he was for the first couple of months and then generally solid for the first half of the season. The second half of the season has been largely bad from him though and that is all that people remember, how he got worse as the year went on.

Calling him flop of the year is a bit ridiculous though considering he had a good first half of the season and made a good impact, while others literally did nothing all year.

9127~~~
Sending cross after cross after cross into the box or just simply losing the ball isn't creative. Ashley Young can do that.

9128~~~
If Young can do what Di Maria does then why doesn't he? Without looking I'd guess he had roughly half the goals/assists that AdM had.

9129~~~
If the cross ends up assisting a goal, then it is creative, is it not?

9130~~~
In fact he has less than a third of Di Maria's production, Young isn't as productive as Di Maria because he doesn't spot and try the killer balls, Di Maria is 100% creativity, he struggles to control himself.

9131~~~
A full year to settle in and new players to work with. Can't wait to see him next year.

9132~~~
He is called a flop because he cost £60million and ended up getting benched by Ashley Young. He also only scored 4 goals which isn't very impressive and his numbers at Madrid were miles better.

Don't buy into the "needs time to settle" either. His form was dipping long before his house was broken into and guys like Costa, Sanchez, Courtios all came from La Liga and hit the ground running and Sanchez was doing it whilst Arsenal had their worst ever Premier league start.

He will obviously be better next season, but his level of consistency really needs to be higher.

9133~~~
Does they both got similar physic?

9134~~~
he was shite last season

9135~~~
Well there's the small matter of each player being different?

9136~~~
Is he ever gonna be a possession team footballer?

He's not Robben, who's actually very economic and rarely wasteful for a flair player.

And from watching van Gaal's football, it seems that there's room for one true flair player - and I think that's gonna be Memphis.

We should offer PSG di Maria for Verratti.

9137~~~
Well van Gaal said he uses 4 creative players: the wingers + 10 + striker. So there's room for Di Maria and Memphis in the same team.

9138~~~
I think there's a difference between 'creative players' and out and out 'flair players' though, and I also think there's a difference between the type of footy that Ancelotti's Real were playing and the type of footy van Gaal is after.

I could be wrong, I just don't know that di Maria looks a van Gaal player.

9139~~~
He will be world-class for us.

9140~~~
To answer both, the whole point of having creative players is so that the team won't have to resort to mid table style attacks e.g repetitive crossing. There's a reason why only 1.6% of crosses end up as goals in the league, it's an art of quantity not quality. Your average Joe such as Ashley Young can do that for you. Without looking I'd guess that ADM also loses the ball at triple the rate Ashley Young does. You don't see like likes of Hazard/Sanchez/Silva having a first instinct to hoof the ball into the box.

9141~~~
Little worried that his form isn't picking up at the copa america's. 

Either way, hopefully a new season brings out his old form.

9142~~~
Get a striker that can finish some chances and he'll be looking a lot better, along with everyone else. Watch a video of his highlights and you'll see how many wasted opportunity he set up. It obviously fell apart as the season wore on but that was also a bit to do with World Cup fatigue that affected many players. Don't think he'll ever live up to the fee but he can still come good.

9143~~~
How's he doing at the COPA? Is he still starting for Argentina?

9144~~~
He'll always start. He's one of their best players. But he still looks out of form. That comfort and ease on the ball isn't there. Generally untidy, so far.

9145~~~
I'd gladly sell him to PSG ... Still got depay,young,mata and januzaj on the wings. Just think that he had one amazing season and is now back to his inconsistent best.

9146~~~
That's not going to change.

He's always been an erratic player from what I've seen.

9147~~~
A bit erratic yes, but still a superb dribbler and very comfortable on the ball. He'd always has the ability to tie defenders in knots. Right now he just doesn't look in command of his own game. It'll come IMO.

9148~~~
Don't know about the COPA but in the friendly before it didn't he score twice and get a handful of assists?

9149~~~
hopefully he gets a nice rest after copa and will be available for a few of our pre season game. we are expecting a lot more from a player of his caliber next season.

9150~~~
The Final will be the 4th July. If Argentina goes there of course.... Then he will have at least 3 weeks rest (I remember that Van Gaal gave RVP 4 weeks last year), meaning that Di Maria and Rojo, will be back in Manchester the frist week of August... Then they need to do their pre season on their own, while the players will prepare for the first game of the season against Spurs.

9151~~~
I agree but I’ve not seen anything to suggest he’s adjusting to this league. He started well, but from the middle point it was only downwards.

You mean sending cross after cross in the box? That’s not being creative, and it’s not like a lot of his crosses resulted in goals. Young was playing ahead of Di Maria because he improved the team in general, while Angel was out of sync with the rest of our players.

Moyes thinking.  

That’s the question we should be asking ourselves. I doubt it personally.

9152~~~
I can't believe people want us to sell one of the few class attacking outlets we have.

9153~~~
If he has been a "class attacking outlet" for us then Ashley Young must have been one of the greatest attacking players United have ever had by comparison...

9154~~~
You've written him off after just one season then? I hope the club the club don't judge that way.

9155~~~
I'd be a little gutted to see ADM go so early on. I'd love to see what he could do next season in one fixed position, with a full pre season, the team having developed under LVG a year on.

9156~~~
I think he should stay at least one more season....unless PSG want to trade him for Verratti.   <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9157~~~
I think we'd all be disappointed with his season even if he cost £35m. 

I've not been convinced by him at all, but I still have a little bit of hope that he will come good. With that being said, a decent sized bid from PSG and if I was in charge, I'd at least consider it.

9158~~~
We saw glimpses of what he can do last season, Im fully expecting him to push on this year and be a massive player for us

9159~~~
Young 2 goals 5 assists
di Maria 3 goals 10 assists

added to the fact that I'm sure di Maria has played a lot less minutes! di Maria has created more chances than anyone else last season despite playing half the games as some players makes him a "class attacking outlet". Yes his performances mightn't have been great at times but if he's creating goals and chances (which he is more than anyone else) then who cares?!

9160~~~
The thing is, despite ADM not being anywhere near 2/3 his best...he has still created chances and is not afraid to try something in order to create a chance. If we get anything like his Madrid form from him next season we'll be a nightmare to defend against IMO. A broken first season isn't enough for me.

9161~~~
Di Maria was actually 4 goals, and 13 assists according to this forum.

So that's 17 goals either scored/created, in 32 appearances.

Considering it wasn't his best season by his standard, that's still pretty good numbers.

9162~~~
He wrote off Ander Herrera after about 2 games so it's no surprise. New Kagawa I think he called him. Some weird posts from him over the past few years. Think he just likes to criticize new players and anyone who says a bad word about Fellaini.

9163~~~
Hazard is similar strength wise but managed much better. Di Maria has always been an inconsistent player barring one season.  We just massively overpaid on the basis of that season and changed the entire setup that had finally made him click.

9164~~~
What an incredibly uninspiring list.

9165~~~
He's been utter wank at the Copa America. We should sell him to PSG while he still has value.

9166~~~
Being just a touch melodramatic? Name another PL club whose list of wide players would be more inspiring?

9167~~~
Bollox. Really did not want to read comments like this.

9168~~~
It's not. It's the painful truth. Unbelievable how many balls he's lost in both matches so far. Also spends too much time on the ball.

9169~~~
Probably, I just don't think that's a great list of options for a team that has genuine title winning aspirations. 1 decent player, 2 young and completely unproven players, and 1 good but limited winger. 

I'd say right now Arsenal (Ox, Sanchez, Walcott and Welbeck), Chelsea (Hazard, Willian, Cuadrado, Oscar) and City (Nasri, Navas, Silva, Sterling*) all have better options. 

*Probably

Saying that, with the way things change so quickly in football, Memphis could hit the ground running, Januzaj could have his 'breakout' season, Di Maria could find his mojo again, and suddenly everything looks great again,

9170~~~
I'm not disagreeing. I haven't watched any games. Just expressing disappointment <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9171~~~
An awful lot hinges on Di Maria coming good in his second season. If he does and Depay has a good debut we're looking good. Mata's a class player on his day too and Young/Januzaj have both shown they're capable of a good season.

9172~~~
I'd agree with all of that. Although I'm in the 'Januzaj needs a loan' camp, I think he really needs regular first team football.

9173~~~
Oh.

There's unfortunately nothing indicating atm that he will turn it around next season. I would've had hope for him if he played well this summer, but it could be argued he's looked even worse there. We need to sell him while we can.

9174~~~
Hazard is miles stronger than Di Maria. You can tell Hazard has put a bit of time in at the gym developing his leg muscles, whereas Di Maria looks as though the only time he's squatted is when he goes for a shit.

9175~~~
To be a top class footballer, does not require large muscles.
Look at Terry - he is like a match-stick.
Same for Ribbery, Robben.
Michael Owen (remember him), was a tiny little thing, but he was one of the players of the World Cup tournament in 1998.
Look at Sterling - this guy is also a matchstick.

Generally speaking, muscle bulk is not a good indicator of footballing ability.

9176~~~
That's not fair. His upper body is skinny as feck but his legs look fairly strong. Completely different genetics to Hazard anyway, who's always been a stocky wee nugget. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Angel+Di+Maria+Burnley+v+Manchester+United+5Yg9fRFowQ-l.jpg" src="http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Angel+Di+Maria+Burnley+v+Manchester+United+5Yg9fRFowQ-l.jpg"/>

9177~~~
Although I do wonder how anyone can be a professional footballer and have such emaciated arms/torso. What the hell is he doing when he's in the gym?

9178~~~
To be a top class footballer you need to be able to stay on your feet while opponents are hassling you. It’s clear that lack of physicality is hurting him in England, don’t you think?

9179~~~
What? JT is huge

9180~~~
I was going by league stats. But yea but not bad for someone who had a "shit" season

9181~~~
Thats the main thing. He's not afraid to try create chances. If more of our players tried this then we'd be a lot better off, yes a lot of the time it's not gonna work but isn't it better to fail 9/10 than not try at all? Don't get me wrong I'm not saying he's had a great season because by his standards he hasn't. But it's just stupid for some people on here to say that we should sell him.

Give him another season and we should start seeing the best of him.

9182~~~
Looking at him, with absolutely no medical credentials whatsoever, I'd say he probably has an issue with his thyroid. He probably finds it incredibly hard to gain weight.

I know someone with an overactive thyroid, they eat like a horse, but just don't gain weight and they're pretty sedentary.

Combine an overactive thyroid with a very physical lifestyle and I can see muscle gain being a real issue.

9183~~~
You'd think wouldn't you.

Then again, this lad falls over before, during and after the hassling commences.

9184~~~
Seems like it.

I hope not.

9185~~~
I agree that we over paid him,but comparisons with Hazard on physic I don't agree on, Hazard who got better lower body weight is much better in handling defenders than DiMaria.
I do remember when we played him in CM role early in season  looked comfortable until some tackles started flying and he goes down easily for which referees here never bother.
I don't complain referees here but game in PL is different, all he need is different way of thinking to adopt game here.

9186~~~
So, thats it? He's done and dusted and will never perform at the level we require him to?

9187~~~
He's made for counter-attacking football, not possession football.

He might (and should) get better for us if he stays, but he'll never be AS good as he was in that Ancelotti team. Not while van Gaal's here anyway.

If di Maria stays, and we have a poor season and van Gaal is replaced by Klopp - I'd expect to see di Maria excel again.

He's a 'heavy metal' footballer, not an a 'Vivaldi' footballer. Or, to put it another way, he came from Real Madrid, not Barcelona...

9188~~~
I agree you need to be able to stay on your feet, but this is not related to muscle bulk.
There are many top class players, who can stay on their feet, who are also thin. I listed them earlier in this thread. Add Neymar to that list.
Falcao is bulky and as we saw, he was unable to stay on his feet most of the time. Even when he was simply taking a shot, without being challenged, he would fall over.
Balance is important here. Not bulk.

9189~~~
Perhaps you are referring to a different John Terry.

I am referring to this match man.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/06/08/article-0-0C76A46F00000578-936_634x479.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/06/08/article-0-0C76A46F00000578-936_634x479.jpg</a>

Terry is the perfect example of an aerobic athlete - built to run long distances and have good endurance. For this he needs low muscle mass. The more muscle you have, the more oxygen you require and in football, this is generally a bad thing. 

I can go on and on...but you get the idea. ADM has the perfect physique for a top class footballer.

Lets not forget that ADM has created many chances and has many assists.
I think his biggest problem is that huge price-tag.

9190~~~
I really want to see Di Maria succeed at United, but my hopes that Copa America would help him get his mojo back is fading quickly.  That's not at all to say that he won't get it back either this summer or next season, just that I was hoping that a good Copa America would lead to him starting the season in good form.  

In their two games so far, both he and Falcao have pretty much looked exactly like they did in the second half of the season for United, so I don't think it was anything specific to United, LVG, or LVG's system.  They both just lack confidence (Falcao seems to be missing a half of step of pace or burst since the injury, as well).  For those that felt Di Maria looked and played like he didn't care late in the season, he's showing the same body language with Argentina.

9191~~~
I think this guy will be ready for next season. Could be a like a new signing.

9192~~~
He definitely is not a match stick, even from the image you have sent me... A match stick is someone like Di Maria, not JT. I've just checked his height and weight and he is 6'1" and weighs 90kg, which is probably a very decent weight for that height.

9193~~~
Either he doesn't train hard enough (in the gym), and isn't eating right.

Or, it's a genetic thing. People with his kind of physique seem to be rangy and durable, so maybe he won't suffer from repeated soft-tissue injuries. Though I'm not sure what ADM's injury history is like, but those kind of rangy physiques seem to last a little longer (going from AFL experience).

9194~~~
Neymar has got absolutely tiny arms too. It must just be a genetic thing.

9195~~~
It's his genes I'd say too. I read somewhere where it said that as a kid too, he was frail looking, but had boundless energy all day long. And they sent him to play football to keep him busy.

Here's him as a youngster. Looks more like a long distance runner

9196~~~
How on earth is somebody calling John terry stick thin? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9197~~~
Don't know the reason behind him slipping so much, could be the boots maybe. But he could definitely hold players off, I remember him looking impossible to take the ball off of at times this season.

9198~~~
Probably has terrible balance, that's a mental issue.

9199~~~
Had a decent game against Jamaica tonight, he was Argentina's most creative player.

9200~~~
I thought he was excellent against Jamaica. A constant threat. Everything good, essentially, went through him. Set up the only goal. Unlucky not to pick up another assist, plus a goal or two for himself. I'm really looking forward to seeing him play next season. He's simply too good not to be a real impact player for us.

9201~~~
agree.

9202~~~
I bet that bar is still shaking. Good performance from him and hopefully he can push on from that.

9203~~~
Not true at all, he's been pretty good generally. Didn't see him against Uruguay as I missed that game, but he was one of Argentina's better players against Paraguay, being a threat throughout and made loads of chances. Then he got the man of the match against Jamaica. His stats were pretty decent for the Uruguay game which is all I have to go off from that, so I think you're definitely going over the top and exaggerating every bad touch or loose pass and ignoring the good things, which people tend to do to players they don't like or are frustrating. He has been a lot better then how he was the second half of last season for us, without a doubt. In fact if he played for us how he has played for Argentina, then he'd be back to being an automatic starter on the wing.

9204~~~
Nice performance for argentina. Could easily had 3 goals and 3 assists.

We all know he is a world class player. Hope to see him at his best again next season.

9205~~~
His performance against Uruguay is nothing to write home about. I watched the game, he was absolutely abysmal. He was nothing special against Paraguay either. As for the Jamaica game, that was one of his best games in quite a while. That was the sort of level I'm hoping he can maintain next season.

9206~~~
He looks much improved from these highlights. Not convinced the assist was intentional but never mind... The fact he looked dangerous with the ball at his feet is the important thing.

9207~~~

9208~~~
Sounds very promising, here's hoping he can carry the form back home with him to United and start the season positively.

9209~~~
He was excellent last night, particularly second half. It was only Jamaica, but good to see still.

9210~~~
Thought we would've gotten wrecked last night but we didn't <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Even Messi had a quiet game by his standard.

9211~~~
He definitely just doesn't get how LVG likes us to play. He's a very instinctive player and likes to play at a high tempo. When we slow things down and make "think" about playing he clearly doesn't like it.

9212~~~
Manchester United's Angel Di Maria hasn't had the first season at the club that he would have wished. A decent start was soon forgotten and Di Maria ended up out of the team and struggling to impress. There were of course claims that he wasn't happy and there could be a quick exit, and problems off the pitch culminated in an attempted burglary on his house. However, speaking to Ole Newspaper in Argentina, Di Maria has said it's the disappointments to do with football which have made him and his family uncomfortable.

When asked if he's been uneasy since his move to Manchester United, Di Maria said
That doesn't sound great, but what balances that out is Di Maria's will to succeed. He isn't planning on going anywhere and doesn't want to run away after a difficult first season. When asked if he's thought about leaving, Di Maria said
Di Maria said he wants to be able show the level he has previously and he's not fussed where he plays, he just wants to be on the pitch. He's not happy with being a substitute and wants to put that right, but he thinks things started well and would like to get back to that
There's little sugar coating from Di Maria. He's frustrated at being a substitute and not being able to show what he can do has left both him and his family unhappy with the situation, but he's said he's going nowhere and his determination to succeed where he is shows a good attitude and one which will help at Manchester United next season.

9213~~~
Sounds committed to turning things around. 

Here's hoping to a glorious second season!

9214~~~
With an attitude like that, it's only a matter of time till he shows the BPL what a WC player he is.

9215~~~
If he is to play in central midfield, it would mean Herrera on the bench most games. Herrera/Di Maria should work against lesser teams, especially at home, just LvG doesn't seem keen on that particular "balance". Personally i think he can make one of the wings his position, he has the pace and dribbling, just need to take on his man more often. 

The expectations/output ratio was on the lower end i suppose but he didn't have a horrible season. His interviews shows a man that wants to fight to succeed here and it's up to him to show it on the pitch. I want him to flourish here, hope he does.

Did our fans sing songs about him last season? He could do with some encouragement after burglary attempt/being benched (yes, wages/glory etc should be enough..).

9216~~~
Brilliant attitude and fantastic to hear how he wants to fight for his place. Doesn't sound like someone angling for a move.
Fingers crossed he will be the player we all hoped we signed, next season.
His pace and skill will scare the shit out of the PL.

9217~~~
He has a great attitude. Really hope he wins his place back in the side next season. He's the only player we have at the moment that gets you out of your seat.

9218~~~
Right now I'm 100% sure he won't ever play as a midfielder under van Gaal. It's wing or bench for Di Maria.

9219~~~
Dude, he spent almost a full season with us and I didnt see many teams scared of him.
I remember he played in a few FA Cup games against non EPL league teams and they weren't particularly scared of him.
In fact, he has been so "unscary" that LVG decided to keep him on the bench. 
Did you watch the games this season?

9220~~~
His pace and skill will be effective once we introduce some counter attacking game. If we continue to play as we did this season, I fear he will struggle.

9221~~~
Pace and skill don't mean much since he has the strength and balance of a toddler.

9222~~~
It's very important that he makes the US tour, imo. fecking Copa America.

9223~~~
Don't find those comments encouraging at all tbh. Much preferred the earlier interviews where he admitted he wasn't good enough and wanted to work hard to earn his place in the team.

This interview leaves you with the impression he thinks he was dropped unfairly. Which simply isn't true and show a worrying lack of insight.

9224~~~
I wouldn't take the translation as gospel TBH.

9225~~~
For sure. Just giving an alternative opinion to the posts praising his attitude based on that same translation. 

I do like the bit about him not letting criticism get him down, though.

9226~~~
Repeating the same old stuff isn't necessary. I highly doubt his mindset has suddenly changed. He's probably just realized that he's a far better player than Ashley Young and told himself that he shouldn't be behind him in the rotation. I doubt he's blaming van Gaal for that though.

9227~~~
Those wanting him to leave must be having a laugh. We don't just boot world class players like Di Maria out after one single bad season.

9228~~~
100% mental, his problems. Overthinking.

9229~~~
In which case we shouldn't have bought him. the only position he was a top player was that perfect attacking midfield role at madrid, where he soaks up the space left by ronaldo and co and has acres of space in which to counter attack into.
At united he has to be the main man, in a new system the entire squad himself included is getting to grips with, even at benfica he was never a top top winger.

9230~~~
Not at all. The position he's best in is in midfield but he's not the right man for <i>our</i> midfield despite how good we know he can be. He doesn't have the right supporting cast either and looks way too lightweight to play in the PL. I mean when players like Fellaini and Rooney are outperforming you in midfield, you know something's up.

So the only position we can play him is on the wing where inconsistency is an understatement. He's nothing special on the wing, basically another Nani, who on his day can be great but when it's not, is absolutely dreadful.

If it was up to me, I'd sell him while his stock is still high. In fact, I'm not entirely sure why we bought him especially since we don't really need him. 

There's no point in keeping him in hope he'll regain form. There's no room for sentimentality anymore, especially when we don't <i>need</i> Di Maria. In fact, that's why we are where we are right now post-Fergie. Look at Chelsea, they're getting rid of Cuadrado because he just doesn't look the same player for them as he did for Fiorentina.

Not saying we have to sell him but there's nothing wrong in people wanting to do so. Not sure why it's so ridiculous when he's been so shit for large parts of he season.

9231~~~
Exactly how I took it. Was stunned to read people praising him a few posts above.

9232~~~
That interview is quite worrying. Someone needs to tell him that he's not been playing 'cos he's been shite.

9233~~~
Because it's fecking retarded spoiled Football Manager nonsense. Shiny thing not working right away. Me want new shiny thing now.

Especially the season after two of our most hated players, half as talented as Di Maria, who everyone wanted sold 12 months ago, ended up amongst our best performers with the slightest change of attitude and confidence.

But yeah. Lets sell our most expensive, creative and potentially talented player without giving him a similar chance. Nothing wrong with that. Lets sell Mata too, and Januzaj, and all of our brand new players who haven't set the world alight yet. Selling people off's become almost as muppety a signing them this season. Lets just start from scratch every year till we get it right.

Sack Louis, Sell Angel

9234~~~
I'm glad hes determined to stay. I have no doubt he will be at the club next season and I really hope he finds his footing with the team but it doesnt help that he'll start the season late due to Coppa America.

9235~~~
I don't get Barcelona link. They're not allowed to register players for 6 more months, they have the best front three in the world and they surely wouldn't pay €85m for a player they couldn't use until January who'll be 27 by then?

Then again he'd be perfect for their midfield really, good workrate, good link up play with forwards and he's already excelled there in Spain. Could be an option.

9236~~~
He would be pretty much perfect in the trio behind the front 3

9237~~~
Yep. They would play him in his best position in midfield and he would be a fantastic signing for them. 

I also doubt they would be put off by the registry problem. They signed Suarez despite him being suspended until November.

9238~~~
Well, he's 27 now and they'd be getting a nearly 28-year old player in January. Also, his form at United has gone down singificantly. While I believe they might be interested, I don't buy into €85m fee.

Maybe they even wanted him last year but knew Real Madrid wouldn't sell to them, so they let him go to us knowing they could probably sign him from us in the future. Conspiracy level hard.

9239~~~
It's plausible imo. He's almost the exact same age that Suarez was when they signed him and €85m is actually less than they paid in that deal iirc. His reputation in Spain must still be stellar after his last season there and I don't think they will be worried about his awful form in a different league and in positions where they wouldn't play him. Plus he's Messi's mate which probably counts for a lot at that club not to mention it would be one in the eye for Madrid. 

I mean it's probably just paper bollocks but it's paper bollocks that makes sense and not like, you know, United are signing Gaitan for the fifth summer in a row.

9240~~~
On the contrary, the interview illustrates his determination to prove himself. He actually says "It is a little difficult to explain why I don't play", which seems to be related to the fact that he wasn't starting as he was not playing to the philosophy, as opposed to him simply not being good enough.

I think the interview is a good read, and shows the type of character di Maria is.

9241~~~
He wasn't starting because he wasn't good enough. Nothing more to it.

9242~~~
That's the go to argument whenever a player flops. "You're spoilt, give him more than one season to prove himself". Did you afford the same courtesy to Moyes despite him looking just as tragic as Di Maria has looked? I guess we were spoilt for sacking him after a season then.

Never mind his assists, he's been a flop so far. We expected so much more from him especially considering what we paid. He doesn't suit our style of play and looks like a deer in front of headlights in the PL. In fact, Bambi on ice is an apt comparison.

Instead of giving him time for time sake, why don't we evaluate if he's that important to us. Why keep a player we don't need? We've shown we're good enough without him. He's world class but how often have we seen that from him this season? He doesn't suit our midfield and is wildly inconsistent on the wing?

Why the hell would you criticise people for wanting to make a profit on someone we got ripped off for and that has also flattered to deceive? Top rèd behaviour right there.

9243~~~
So people seriously want to sell him, knowing full well that Bayern and Barca want to buy him and he would slot into their starting 11 easily? 2 of the best 3 teams in the world, but he's not consistent enough for us and just can't cut it here.... Right. Makes sense.

9244~~~
I couldn't give a shit about recouping the money, £60m at United wouldn't break the bank. I'd much rather us give him another season to settle in to a completely different culture and environment, as well as a different style of football. He's a world class player, probably our best player if he just started playing well - like we know he can from the start of the season!

9245~~~
And that's your opinion. Just as it is to not minding him being sold and spending that money on an actual world class central midfielder which is what we actually need. He's not a world class winger which is where he'll play for us.

9246~~~
He seemed to play like a world class winger when he played there in the World Cup a lot? I've seen glimpses of what he can do, and I still believe if he wasn't dislodged by Ashley Young's out of the blue amazing performances, he would've done a lot better for us.

9247~~~
What World Cup were you watching? He was playing in central midfield and was awful anyway.

9248~~~
Like who ?

I'm all ears. We could throw 60mil at pogba and veratti, they still wouldn't bat an eyelid.

9249~~~
Yes but on occasion he played as a winger. We all know he's a good winger, he's played there several times.
And he had a good World Cup? What are you talking about. I remember a few games where he was shit but in general he had a good World Cup. It's widely agreed that Argentina missed him in the final and would've done a lot better with him playing.

9250~~~
Spot on. I know that football fans in recent times have become very short termist, but wanting to sell Di Maria after just a season just takes the cake really.

9251~~~
Who on earth would want this guy out of our club.

9252~~~
He wasn't going to say that in an interview, was he? He was asked what happened at Man United after such a successful season at Real Madrid? And the translation of what he said was "it's difficult to explain why I was left out", hardly anything wrong with saying that.

9253~~~
The money men at the club don't want to, the manager (presumably) doesn't want to, the player himself says wants to stay. Yet some of our fans want to "cash in". Go figure.

9254~~~
Me, 100%... I don't want him here, he's a luxury player, a deep lying playmaker without the passing, a winger who will drift out of games, he is a centre midfielder, when played alongside players like Schneiderlin with Carrick behind.. Either that or the left part of the diamond, if he is to be used as a winger, for £60m, he is barely a £30m winger..

9255~~~
Couldn't be more wrong if you tried.

9256~~~
Why the feck not? Nothing wrong with saying he wasn't good enough and needs to improve. Many players have done it before.

He comes across as someone who thinks he shouldn't have been dropped.

9257~~~
There's no point in arguing about this as neither of us know Spanish, and we haven't seen the interview to be able to interpret it properly.

And wrt the second part, you're wrong as he simply doesn't say that. If had said something along the lines of "I don't understand why I wasn't starting" then I'd agree with you.

You're reading far too much into one or two parts of the interview. People need to stop being so analytical about everything...

9258~~~
I don't think he suits the way van Gaal wants us to play and this might relegated him to even lesser role next season, in which case it'd be better to let him go to a club that will utilise him in the best possible way.

9259~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How do you compare the performance of a manager and a player ?

Well with Moyes we finished seventh, with Di maria we finished fourth. He also helped by getting the most assists and chances created along the way <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

9260~~~
I can definitely see what you are saying and on balance I agree but with Di Maria there look to be fundamental compatibility issues with Van Gaal. Even his biggest fans do not argue Di Maria is a £60m winger. I have to admit I rarely watch Spanish football so I am going on second hand reports here mostly, but from what I gather, as a winger he is quite comparable to Nani - very talented but also very temperamental.  

His biggest fans say he justifies that price tag for what he offers playing in midfield. But there is a massive question mark over whether Van Gaal will ever be comfortable playing him in that position.

Anyway, I wouldnt advocate selling him, I think he probably does deserve a second season to put things right. Maybe Van Gaal will find a way to use him effectively. Maybe he can put in consistently brilliant performances on the wing. But I dont think people arguing we should cut our losses are bring spoilt or retarded.

9261~~~
You can get 4/1 on him joining Barca this window at Laddies. Quite possibly the worst bet of all time considering the transfer ban renders it an impossibility.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.oddschecker.com/football/football-specials/angel-di-maria/club-after-summer-transfer-window" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oddschecker.com/football...el-di-maria/club-after-summer-transfer-window</a>

9262~~~
I would keep him 100% and if LvG still can't get the best out of him next season then at the end of this season at least one of LvG or Di Maria have to go anyway:

* Di Maria has to go if he can't get enough games next season either but the team does well without him

* LvG has to go if Di Maria doesn't fit his philosophy but with the players who apparently do he still manages to disappoint in every competition and we look as predictable as we have this season or his teams have at times in the past.

9263~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Classic!

Selling Di Maria would be insane in all honesty. World Class players are thin on the at Manchester United, we should invest in getting the best out of Angel IMO.

9264~~~
How so? Wasted as a 2 man mid and not effective enough as a winger... I dont doubt his talent but i dont think we use him properly, nor has he perhaps hardened up, tailored his skill set to suit the PL, his tracking back is lacking too. Bear in mind as i write this im considering the fact he cost 60m which is comparable to other players we cpuld have got like De Rossi the season before last, Sanchez or Vidal last season... Instead we buy a 3rd midfielder or a CM who needs to be partnered with dedensive stability and play him on the wings.. Meanwhile Arsenal and Chelsea needed a winger and got Sanchez and Hazard, i appreciate there were also flops likeCuadrado but they played him in the position he played...

9265~~~
How so? They can purchase players, a transfer bans stops you from registering them.

9266~~~
'Or, I should say, we don't have wingers of the highest level, like Ronaldo or Di Maria or somebody like that. So, I have to play another way –and you have seen that already. I only buy when I think we need to buy –the position that is necessary.' - van Gaal

You might see Di Maria as a midfielder since he's had an amazing half a season there for RM, but we don't have the same team and play very different football. LvG obviously sees him as a winger (he signed him as his '7' and he's pretty adamant about numbers) and that would make sense since Di Maria doesn't posses the strenghts of a van Gaal midfielder, but of a winger. He's inconsistent there like most wingers but still better than Mata, Januzaj, Memphis and Young. Di Maria also was used in the Robben role in 352, as a 10 and in his Benfica left-side of the diamond as van Gaal likes multifunctional players, he hasn't been moved from the wing in his final months when he did play so LvG found out Di Maria isn't as multifunctional for his style of football.

He suited RM's midfield but he suits us as a winger. He's still gotten plenty of assists in a season where some describe him as a flop and ofcourse we overpaid for him without CL. I think Di Maria can easily turn it around on the right wing next season once the whole team understands van Gaal better and we plugged some holes in the squad.

9267~~~
The fact that some people think that di Maria will continue to not do well under van Gaal surprises me. van Gaal has been able to set up teams during his career that accommodated players who played instinctively and even transformed them for the better. This is someone who set up Barcelona with a 4-3-3 with the point backwards in order to give Rivaldo the freedom to play at his best. He's someone who transformed Ribery from a near-world-class winger into one of, if not the best, winger in the world, and that was when Ribery was 26. It's not the first time van Gaal has dealt with such players, but what makes this easier for him is that di Maria won't give up on van Gaal like Rivaldo and Ribery did. di Maria's a fighter who'll never give up, and this attitude will help him in becoming a better, hopefully more consistent, winger under van Gaal.

9268~~~
Would Ribery agree with that assessment? Genuine question, I honestly dont know much about the dynamic between them except that Ribery couldnt stand the man, I assumed if LVG had been the one who transformed him into one of the very best players in the world Ribery would have more positive things to say about him.

9269~~~
Ribery wouldn't agree with that assessment, of course, but since van Gaal's spell there, Ribery has shown better decision making and more intelligence in his game. Before, he would drift into the middle too often, but since van Gaal arrived, he showed more discipline and better decision making in his game. I expect the same to happen with di Maria as well, and I hope that the relationship between them doesn't turn sour.

9270~~~
Eh no it doesn't. Can't believe how many people I have come across on here that think they can't sign players.

9271~~~
No <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . It's also not true at all.

9272~~~
Ribery is garbage!

9273~~~
How is he doing at the Copa?

9274~~~
He started off being quite reserved and unconfident in his own game. He was as sloppy and inconsistent as he was with us in the first couple of matches. However, as the tournament went on, di Maria got better and more influential, and now, he's one of Argentina's best players. He's still playing his own game, but he's playing it with confidence, and it shows with more successful dribbles, better deliveries, and being one of the men Messi looks for when on the ball.

9275~~~
Thanks. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 
Hope he'll turn it around for us next season.

9276~~~
Decent game from him yesterday, not back to his best but he looks very lively

9277~~~
The same player with the same performances seen at United.

9278~~~
Agreed, the last 2 games have been a marked improvement for him.

9279~~~
I just don't know what to believe.

For the love of God someone tell me what to think!!!!

9280~~~
It's not so much people want him out its just if we did cash in on him it's not as if we would miss him.

When ronaldo left we lost a huge goal scoring threat player, when scholes left we lost the all round midfielder. They had massive impact on games and we definately missed them if ADM left we wouldn't miss anything because he's not actually done anything.


Of course we should keep him though because we know what he's capable of. Hopefully he kicks on next year.

9281~~~
BBC rumour page is linking him with a swap deal for Cavani at PSG. I truly hope that this is bollocks.

9282~~~
They have it from the Daily Star Sunday page. Need I say more...

9283~~~
Ah. That's reassuring then lol.

9284~~~
So what's the consensus?  Personally I think he can be a success as either a midfielder or winger.  I'd keep him in the hope he can regain his form.  If he can get to his top level and stay relatively consistent he'd be like a new top class signing.

My preferred alleged formation would be:

                                 De Gea
Coleman/Rafael           Ramos              Smalling        Shaw

                   Herrera             Schneiderlin         Di Maria


Mata                                Rooney                     Young/Depay

Subs:  Valdes, Rojo, Valencia/Rafael, Jones, Carrick, Blind, Pereira, Fellaini, Janujaz, Hernandez/RVP, Wilson

Signing Schweinsteiger/ Gundogan for the first team would further improve this again and possibly consign Di Maria to the wing.  Even without them this looks like a very strong side if every player is fit and in form.  I'd give us a great chance of winning the League and if the players were to play to their best in the Champions League I'd put us only behind Real/Bayern/Barca and level with PSG/Chelsea/Juve/City and possibly Atletico.  

I just don't seethe point in getting rid of him yet unless he wants to leave.  If he does we either need to go all out for a player like Reus/Bale or else find someone to play that midfield role he's capable of.  Probably be easier to take the chance keeping him than finding a ready made, equally as talented replacement (Pogba is the only obvious target for that midfield role).

9285~~~
He was brilliant the season before last, excellent at the world cup & now he is very good at the Copa.

Was last season's slump because of Manchester, Van Gaal or Angel himself?

9286~~~
He was actually poor at the World Cup but I'm delighted for him for his performances in the semis last night. Two goals, some quality crossing and a quality performance in the biggest match he's played this year.

9287~~~
this guy can only play on the left?

9288~~~
Disagree. He had a very good world cup, no way he was poor.

9289~~~
It's this big myth that has somehow developed over time, that Di Maria had a very good World Cup. He was a pale shadow of his normal self and incomparable to the one that was key to Madrid's CL. Most of argentina's attack was poor at the wc.

9290~~~
I saw him in each and every game at the world cup, I don't believe in myths. He had a good world cup, his pace and industry were a plus for Argentina. In fact, they missed those two attributes in the final.

9291~~~
The group stage hero was only Messi. AdM got an assist akin to the assist he got for the falcao goal vs Leicester. He took a shot which hit the post and fell to Messi who scored. And the Swiss game he scored a goal but he was really poor. United style poor. Think he attempted 36 crosses and all of them failed or something. Then he got injured in the first half of the Belgium game.

He had a brilliant friendly game vs Germany though which was mainly why people started this notion that had he started the final Argentina would have won. In my opinion it wouldn't have made a lot of difference.

9292~~~
I didn't say that they would have won the final.

Anyway, what I am really interested in is the reason his form dipped so badly that he couldn't even displace Ashley Young, and then he goes to play for Argentina and looks the same player again.

First season in a totally new environment? 
The managers tactics? 
Burglary or what ever? 
Couldn't get over the disappoinment of not signing for PSG?

9293~~~
He gave them pace, yes, because he has pace. But other than that he was average.

9294~~~
He shouldnt get used to fast playing football with freedom for attackers, we dont do that over here !

9295~~~
I have come down from 'excellent' to' very good', you have raised it from 'poor' to 'average'. Can we settle at 'good'? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

What do you think was the reason he spent half the season on United bench, amol?

9296~~~
I still think he's a much better version of Nani. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Is that wrong? Personally I'd prefer Mata in the starting eleven over Angel if we were to choose one.

9297~~~
I'd add injuries to that, but only to a point. Boring answer, but I'd say a mixture of all three. Van Gaal playing him as a centre forward one or twice wasn't bright. Settling in Manchester isn't always easy, plus his home being broken into should be taken into account. Di Maria himself has to bulk up I reckon to succeed in England.

9298~~~
if adm plays like what he did in the friendly game against germany, he will start every single game for lvg

when he tried too hard to prove himself by trying to dictate the play under his own feet,  when he was not able to deliver just like what he did by his last season with real, and constantly lost out possession too cheaply, and this not happened just once but repeatedly, then lvg put him on the bench when young come out and caught his chance to prove his value in a rat race

adm was the only player once allowed of full freedom to do anything he wanted in upfront sometimes during the mid season.   so he was rated by lvg but lvg needs him to play his game

9299~~~
Hah, let's just to agree to disagree, <i>slightly</i>.

Ah, so many reasons.

For one, adapting to the premiere league is a process that can often take a fair bit of time. See Vidic. See Evra. See in particular, Didier Drogba. And unlike at least two of those three, and most likely all three, Di Maria has always been a bit frail<i>, </i>unlike someone like Sanchez who enjoys the physical side to the game. Di Maria is like Nani is this one sense, he feels contact more easily than most. Also refs in England do enjoy not protecting flair players so it can make them feel helpless at times. Nothing he can't conquer of course. His performance in the last two copa America games, a tournament that has brutal physicality, and in Classico games with insane pressing from Barcelona, prove that, as does his body of work. So he's got it in him. Will just require a bit of will to fight it.

Then, I think us not sticking with him is another reason. We've stuck through some regularly terrible performance from a lot of our players, whether it be Valencia or even Rooney. We stick with them  particularly the latter because we know how good he is. With Di Maria, Lvg put the need for immediate results ahead of a star player gaining his confidence and quality. Rightfully so I reckon but one of the reasons for it was..

Thirdly, Di Maria has to make adjustments in his game. From lvg's comments this seems obvious. And this seems to be why he wasn't given the patience that someone like Rooney was. If he plays like usually self always he might struggle under Lvg. What these changes he has to make are, requires further insight. But on face value, Di Maria isn't even a possession based player, so maybe there are some things with regards to his erratic and gambling nature that Lvg demands him to change, before he becomes HIS player.

9300~~~
Both. He started the season off really well and then suffered that injury. After he came back from the injury, LvG had him playing different positions which affected his form. Towards the end of the season, it looked like he was not even trying. From my observation, he would lose the ball every time he had possession and the look around in amusement.

9301~~~
Angel will be tearing up the league come next season. Mark my words.

9302~~~
Actually he can join Barcelona this Summer, only cannot be registered.

9303~~~
Di Maria played poorly, but he delivered the numbers.

Moyes' team played poorly, and he delivered feck all.

Di Maria had won the CL, La Liga, Portuguese league and even went all the way to the final of World Cup only to miss it, and his absence was believe to be the main reason Argentina lost.

Moyes finished 4th with Everton. Once. In 11 years.

Of course if you think they are comparable at all, feel free to do so...

9304~~~
I hope you're right. The idea of a peak trio of Di Maria-Rooney-Depay sounds mouthwatering if they're all comfortable in their positions.

9305~~~
What  position has he been playing for Argentina?

9306~~~
If he's playing along side players like Depay, Herrera and hopefully Schneiderlin in midfield, then he'll flourish.

Our transfer targets this summer promisingly indicate that we're trying to get out of this zombie football rut since we're going for Schneiderlin and a ball playing CB in Ramos.

9307~~~
Part of the front three along with Messi & Aguero.

9308~~~
He needs to stop hoofing long balls all over the place for a start. English teams tend to sit back and park their buses as though its a free parking day. 

He will be much more effective dribbling and playing short passes with other players than crossing balls where none of our strikers are actually specialize to attack it.

9309~~~
Great run and finishing on his first goal. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nzFu2D9xYI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

9310~~~
If he can get back to his best form next season, could turn out to be our best "signing" really. He's a world class player when on form and one of the top 3-5 in the premier league, but he didn't show that last season apart from that first month or 2. Next season our whole team should be more settled and play with more freedom, and with the additions of Depay and other players giving the team more solidity, we should have more attacking freedom to let Di Maria do his thing. He'll definitely be better then last season I think, just a matter of what level he will get to. A Di Maria at his best, supporting Rooney, Depay and Mata is pretty wankworthy though.

9311~~~
Where was he playing position wise, looked like out wide front 3? This is where personally I think his best position is. Argentina playing some great football in those highlights.

Looking forward to watching him again this season. Think he'll be back. Not fully sure what happened last few months of last season when he was dreadful. But think he'll be back from August.

9312~~~
So has he played well against the teams that are better than the likes of Paraguay and Jamaica? I haven't been watching this tournament.

It's a confidence booster for him helping to wipe a team out.

9313~~~
But but but isn't he being wasted unless he's played in central midfield?!?

9314~~~
Personally I think he's far better in the midfield. His best performances in his career have been in midfield. He can play out wide but he isn't as effective.

All in my opinion.

9315~~~
Think they played like this

Di Maria----Aguero----Messi
Pastore--Mascherano--Biglia

9316~~~
So what about the rumours about us selling AdM to Bayern? They don`t seem to go away - even after Douglas Costa signing for them.

I for one hope they are nonsense.

9317~~~
I'd be shocked if they were true, I mean why would we spend €60m for one season? I don't even think we would include him for a deal for Mueller. It just doesn't make sense.

9318~~~
Bayern don't spend that much for a single player, they paid 28m Euro for Martinez as their record. I doubt they want to spend over 75m Euro (weak Euro) on Di Maria.

9319~~~
I think that's an opinion the majority of the Café agree on, if I remember one poll ages back.

For me though, he gives the ball away a ridiculous amount of times in centre mid and can get bullied and hassled off it.

Out wide, he's got the space for his incredible pace, and in theory should be a stunning winger. Van Gaal mentioned we didn't have a top winger last summer, then specifically name checked him as one such player.

9320~~~
I would say that all three things played a part in di Maria's performances last season. At the start, van Gaal gave him total freedom to play as a left winger/wide central midfielder, and he flourished in such a role. When van Gaal changed to a 4-3-3 formation, though, di Maria played a more restricted winger role whilst not getting much support from the midfielders, which made it tougher for him to perform well. This was when we had Fellaini in the side and wanted to take advantage of his aerial strengths. It was during this period when he faced more physical challenges from opposing markers, and he struggled to deal with them. His confidence dipped as he was beaten by his marker more often, and his performances dipped as a result. I wouldn't really say that van Gaal was the primary cause of di Maria's dip in performances in this period as di Maria himself had yet to adjust to the physical nature of the Premier League, and he was bound to face more of these physical challenges anyways once other teams got to know him better.

After he came back from his November injuries, van Gaal tried to fit him into a role where he was given all of the attacking freedom and no defensive responsibility. Seeing that di Maria struggled with the physical challenges from opponents, he tried to put di Maria into a role where losing the ball wouldn't hurt us that much. This was when he played up front for us in the 3-1-4-2, then as an attacking midfielder in a diamond, and then on the right wing similar to his Benfica, Real Madrid (under Mourinho), and Argentina winger roles. During this time, di Maria's confidence was low, and that showed in his inconsistent performances (moments of brilliance + several chances created followed by poor deliveries, losing the ball easily, and moments of frustration).

I believe di Maria's performances last season were more down to his adjustment to the Premier League and a lack of confidence resulting from that adjustment. All of this culminated in him being benched, and during this time, his confidence was shot down even more. I doubt that he's faced this many physical challenges ever in Portugal and Spain, and I doubt that he was ever benched for a couple of months due to inconsistent performances outside of England. However, as we've seen in the Copa America, he's learned from his first season here, and he now deals with the physical challenges better. His confidence is back, and he's playing at his best once again. After adjusting to the league in the first season, I believe that di Maria will be a much better player for us in the second season, and I'm sure that he'll be more of a consistent threat than he was in the first season.

9321~~~
If we're talking about di Maria, he was shit at the world cup.

9322~~~
He was great for us when he was playing left of a diamond. I think the position changes really fecked him. He's clearly world class.

9323~~~
I think he's a player that supporters have to accept will be frustrating at times during matches but can always produce a match-winning moment. I remember one cameo towards the end of last season (West Brom?) where he was dreadful but still came closer to scoring a goal to get us back into it than anybody else on the pitch. 

At times with Young and Mata on the wings we have been guilty of just passing it side to side on the edge of the box without going for the throat, whereas Di Maria is a player who can whip in a cross from most angles and is prepared to try and beat his man. He will lose the ball more often as a result but his mindset of taking risks in the final third will open things up for us.

9324~~~
All reasons why this insistence by so many people that he needs to play in central midfield blows my mind. All the more so with him consistently playing wide in a front three for Argentina. It's like they're denying the evidence in front of their own eyes.

9325~~~
I hope he gets his break through this coming season. Selling him on immediately should only be considered if LvG came to Woodward and said that he isn't a fit for his system and won't be a starter next season as well.

9326~~~
Can't wait to see Angel next season, I just know he'll be a complete different player. Would be shocking to let him go now

9327~~~
He will leave this summer.

PSG has been cleared from the FFP yesterday, and they have now their financial power back. They don't mind paying 70M for Angel and giving him huge wages

9328~~~
He won't leave. He's said he'll stay, and we paid £60m for him. Unless, like you said, we somehow got offered more than that for him then it's a possibility but he's by far our most talented player and he just needs to fit in (like Rojo said).

9329~~~
I'm curious to see their soon to be received offer.

9330~~~
They will attack him. Al Khelaifi is a big admirer of him. Last season they were close to sign him, but the FFP stopped them. Since this failure, they kept asking his agent about his situation at United, and a lot of PSG's insiders are convinced that they will go for him, because he's an absolute must for them.

He will fit in their team either on a 4-3-3 with Ibra and Cavani upfront, and Pastore behind, or more a 4-4-2 diamond.

Anyway, Paris are so focused on him, the staff, the fans, but also the players... 

I don't want him to leave, but knowing LVG, if PSG offers 80M€ for him (they're able to), then he'll be off to Madrid.... It'll all down the player I guess

9331~~~
Zero chance we sell him imo.

9332~~~
Oh! I think you are right, when I heard about the lift of the restrictions, like a lot people I thought about Di Maria, he is the left winger that they lack.

9333~~~
It all depends on who can replace him, because I think that PSG will make an offer that makes you think twice.

9334~~~
I can't think of anyone good enough who is available.

9335~~~
I only have Griezmann and Turan. The money might turn Madrid's head regarding Bale. But yeah the market is tight.

9336~~~
We won't look for a replacement if we sell him imo. Just go with what we have unless someone like Bale becomes available. It's not like he was a key player we couldn't do without last season.

9337~~~
The issue here is different from a name or so.

This year Di Maria couldn't cope with LVG's philosophy and players like Young and Mata were above him in the pecking order, and as much as we like him, we all know that Di Maria was poor last season. I'm rude enough because someone with his talent and his price should have done better, so he was poor.

We know that he can produce at United, but this is only thinking about the player. What about the team ? Will he be able to do what he didn't last year for LVG ? 

In a hand, you have issues on and off the field at Manchester, and in an other hand you have the possibility to leave and find another big club. You doing big efforts or you leave.

I think that he's more down the second thing. And to be honest, if Paris gives us 75-80M€ for him, I guess that Woody will be there to sell him and try to recruit somebody else. 

Then who ? Do we really need to buy another winger if he leaves, or can we buy a striker ? (Cavani ? I hate him but there were talks), Kane for 50M, or trying to force Muller or going back to Bale ? .... Maybe another top midfielder like Koke, Vidal...

Di Maria was not a starter last year when we finished for. We all know that if he manages to come in this team he will do great thing, but the fact is that PSG can propose a huge offer for a sub

9338~~~
It has surprised me all season, of course a bit of the call for a central role came from the wish to make a point about LvG playing players out of their position, but some seemed to think that if he was classified as a midfielder in the match statistics for RM or Argentinia, it makes him a central midfielder.

He runs at defenders, can beat his man, is fast and has a great cross, but needs to risk loss of posession to be dangerous. That is <i>the</i> ideal profile for a front row winger in 4-3-3, and if despite this player one decides to play 4-4-2, he has to play as a midfield winger. On the axis you need solid players, who know when not to lose posession.

9339~~~
I had to read that at least twice to properly understand it Chaky! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

But yeah, agreed. If PSG offer, at a minumum what we paid for AdM, I can see LvG and Woody being interested. 

We could always try and nab one of their stars in turn (and like you, I'm not a Cavani fan at all), but Verratti or Marquinhos <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> could do nicely. Not sure how Lucas Moura have progressed but he doesn't seem to get too many starts over there?

9340~~~
Definitely wouldn't take either of those two instead of Di Maria.

9341~~~
If Di Maria wants to stay I wouldn't myself, but if he wants to leave, I'll let him go.

9342~~~
We won't sell him. We don't need the money. There are no players at PSG who we could acquire in a possible trade (please don't say Verratti, he won't be leaving Paris for Manchester). He's coming off a superb Copa America, which I'm sure LvG has been watching and will take some notes from. Given our potential targets, and the acquisition of Depay, you'd think we're transitioning to a 4-3-3 comprising a front three of LW-ST-RW and we have three players who fit each of those positions. 

We broke both our and the British transfer record to bring this guy to Manchester; there is no way we'd be stupid enough to sell him a year later.

9343~~~
There have been no indications whatsoever that he wants to leave. He is away with Argentina currently and has the perfect platform to give interviews in his native language with Argentine TV/newspapers and still he hadn't indicated that he wants to leave.

9344~~~
That goes without saying for me. I wasn't fussed seeing ronaldo go when he wanted to leave. I don't care about de gea either. If lvg wanted out I'd say good riddance.

But it seems he's determined to be successful in England if that's the case, then from our perspective I don't see anyone better and hence I'd definitely keep him.

9345~~~
You're thinking too hard about this. We have a top attacking midfielder in our squad who has pace, dribbling ability and skill. We're rich and we clearly rate him. It makes no sense to let him go unless we actually can identify other names who can bring us the same. If Psg offer us 100 million for him I reckon we'd accept it. But then again Real Madrid might accept 150 million for ronaldo so it's pointless speculation.

9346~~~
Again, no. That's not about the player, it's the team. Di Maria producing like he can at United is <i>about</i> United.

9347~~~
The only way I can see di Maria leave is if Mendes decides to send him to Paris to pocket some cash. Ever since di Maria moved to Europe, Mendes was involved in all of di Maria's transfers. Knowing this, I get the feeling that di Maria doesn't really care what club he plays for as long as Mendes is involved.

Given the statements he came out with, however, it seems as if Mendes isn't yet interested in moving di Maria on. Either that, or di Maria has told Mendes that he wants to stay with us for a while longer. Or, PSG don't really involve Mendes in their transfers, which is good news for them and for us Re: di Maria staying or leaving.

9348~~~
We aren't going to sell him IMO. No matter what money is thrown our way.

9349~~~
Did you thought that one properly? He joined Benfica, Madrid and Manchester, there is nothing abnormal in that and there isn't anything to put on Mendes.
Another thing Mendes only decides for the players that he owns, like it was the case for Falcao who was partially owned by Mendes the other players are free to do what they want and Di Maria is one of them.

9350~~~
I think we will sell if we get a good offer. But we will want close to what we paid Madrid and Di Maria will want the same massive salary he is on here. Clubs that can afford that are few and far between. We won't sell to City/Chelsea, Madrid didn't want him, Bayern just bought Costa. Only PSG or Barcelona left.

9351~~~
Mendes was involved in transferring di Maria from Benfica to Real Madrid, and he was also involved in transferring him from Real Madrid to us. I haven't suggested that he partially owns di Maria through a third-party company, but he has been involved in both of the transfers I previously mentioned. Hence, why I said that the only way di Maria could move this summer is if Mendes was involved.

If PSG decide not to contact Mendes to get di Maria, then great, because di Maria, personally, seems to be more interested in playing for us than anywhere else at the moment.

9352~~~
I hope the club shows courage and refuse any kinda bid for ADM.

9353~~~
Obviously he is involved, Di Maria is a Gestifute client, Mendes will take care of the negotiations, he is paid by Di Maria to do that. I don't know if Benfica paid the full price for Di Maria, so he might have been owned by Gestifute but it's not the case since Madrid, so no Mendes doesn't decide where Di Maria goes.

9354~~~
If PSG are so hellbent on getting ADM I would suggest a trade in which Verratti comes our way...that is a win/win for all parties. 
Verratti is exactly the sort of CM we should be in for.

9355~~~
I definitely agree with that, and again, I haven't suggested that Mendes will decide di Maria's fate. However, what Mendes will do is make any future di Maria transfer smoother. During last summer, di Maria was talking about how he thought he would end up at Paris. This indicated that di Maria didn't care whether he stayed or left; if he was to leave to Paris, he'd have no issue with that. Instead, we showed interest when PSG started to get involved, and we got him with the high transfer fee and Mendes helping out with the logistics. Right now, di Maria seems committed with us, which is great news, but I wonder what could happen if he actually lost some interest in this club. Will he be okay with moving to PSG especially if PSG call in Mendes to help out with the transfer? Not to say that this is a possibility; it's just a thought experiment I'm currently conducting.

9356~~~
I agree about Verratti being an excellent fit for us, but I doubt PSG would do that deal, as they won't need the money.

9357~~~
We dont need the money either, and ADM has stated twice he wants to stay so PSG would have to come up with a hell of an offer to tempt both him and MUFC. I dont think usually we would have a chance  at getting Verratti but we could if PSG wants ADM badly enough.

9358~~~
This PSG myth
Who did they sign before they had the restrictions? 31 year old Ibra? Or Thiago Silva who literally came out and said he didn't want to leave Milan and was sold against his will.
Where are all these 80m bids and all these stars desperate for Paris?
Nobody will go to PSG willingly in their prime. If Angel wanted to leave United he's already be away.
They're a myth, the boogeyman of world football... Oh we better get this deal done before PSG swoop in, oh it's ok, they've signed Charlie Austin for 47m..

9359~~~
The chance of PSG swapping Verratti for Di Maria is basically zero. Verratti is worth more than di Maria, and he is a player that makes the whole team tick, he is irreplaceable.

9360~~~
i see diMaria is a very humble person.  as an argentine he's also a built in team player.

he changed his game significantly by his last season with madrid.  he turned himself selfish after real brought in bale.  he would still pass to ronaldo.  other than that he would try to do it all on his own just like what we observed by the last season occasionally.   but we all know of that season he was delivering some very outstanding plays, made his name and put himself to be a world class player.

however, when he could outrun most latino players in la liga, he doesn't have any edge with his speed in the premier league.  he always looked tall when i watch him played in la liga but his size trimmed down immediately whenever he played england.  he was not getting used to be bullied out by the muscle play happened in this league neither.  that's all making him struggling in this league when he tried to repeat what had done by his last year in spain.

he played excellently at the friendly game against germany.  if i'm not wrong messi was missing out of that game and diMaria played as an inside right to preplace for the playmaking role.  throught out the game he made himself mobile and was focus in the passing game, penetrated in between the lines of the german defense frequently.  when he broke in he was able to make an critical assist as well as take his chance to score by himself also.  just imaginee this was a diMaria version of iniesta playing in the right flank.  he led argentina totally outplayed the germen on that day.

he has been picking up his form a bit again in the copa america games, but not that much to say he's really shining.  it's not like that.  the argentina display was pretty much a collective performance of their bunch of high quality individual footballers.  taking the paraguay game for instance, the best performers i would say were pastore (damn, i really like him), messi & mascherano.  aquero, diMaria, rojo, higuain & zabaleta all delivered on par.

9361~~~
And Di Maria is just the sort of creative force we need. So we'd need to find an adequate replacement. We have issues with creativity. Verrati won't solve them. A firing Di Maria possibly could.

I'm not saying we shouldn't accept that deal but we don't need to fill holes by opening others unless we have others to fill the emptied holes.

That reads brilliantly and disgustingly.

9362~~~
Would still love Verrati at Old Trafford. Even if it cost Di Maria

9363~~~
What length contract did he sign last year - 4/5? Regardless, if PSG want him now, he would cost a new world record fee. Never mind a poor season, he is still one of the biggest names out there. 
Even if united needed to get rid (which we don't and the player is happy'wish), then contact length would dictate a much bigger fee than what we paid.
Unless United were to get enough money to mean recruiting Bale (which seems just as unlikely a transfer), then I can't see him going.
Personally, I think he will be brilliant this season.

9364~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

On a serious note if they want him they will have to go deep because we hold all the cards on this one.

I'd say they can have him for Cavani + Verratti or €120m cash.

9365~~~
I think you forget that we are MUFC. 
We buy high and sell cheap.
Like it or not, this is factually correct.

Aren't we selling Nani for £3.5M? I read that somewhere.
We are terrible when it comes to selling our players for the right money.
If we sold Di Maria, a likely fee would be in the region of £35M I think.
The 1 player which we are demanding good payment for is DDG and that is because he is our best player for the last 2 years. Di Maria doesnt fall into this category.

Personally thought, I think Di Maria will be playing for us next season and if he fails, then he will be off in 12 months.

9366~~~
2
We won't sell him for 35 million. I'm confident of that. We bought him for almost 60. He's different from Nani in that he's still a hugely relevant player.

9367~~~
Even if he has another sup-par season I doubt his value would plummet to under £40M, there are quite a few top tier teams (PSG,Bayern etc) that want him.

9368~~~
No way should we even think about selling him. He's having a good Copa America and I think will come very good for us this season. PSG with their ridiculous 60 million EURO offer can do one.

9369~~~
Yep. Besides, they're supposed to be limited to £50m net spending this summer. Daddy might have got them off this but we can't in good conscience aid them in breaking their prior agreement.

9370~~~
I expect him to go to PSG this summer for a reasonably high fee, though not what we paid for him. I can't see him wanting to stay given the risk of being a sub. All the french press seem to think he is PSG's priority target for this transfer window. The articles I was reading state that PSG no longer have the imposed financial fair play spending limit, though they do have to make sure they stay within the normal rules.

9371~~~
Khelaifi isn't a fan of overpaying, he still has to balance the books and buying Di Maria surely would mean most of their budget is gone since we won't sell for less than what we've paid for Di Maria. He's going nowhere.

9372~~~
There is no logic in selling him. It would be even beyond Real Madrid level of stupid to buy one of the best players in the world at a record fee and sell him after one bad season at a loss.

9373~~~
He's said he's staying in more than one interview and Rojo said as much in a Q and A the other day. For now, he's not going anywhere.

9374~~~
They can give us Verratti <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Then they can fill that whole in midfield with either David Lolz or Yohan Kebab!

Ps I'm just joking. I know the Verratti thing won't happen but he's the only player I'd think of swapping for, plus a bit of cash from their side. (I don't think Verratti is a 60m pound player, yet).

I wouldn't sell AdM for a cent less then we paid - and he has to personally want to leave.

9375~~~
I doubt that matters. He will stay and start the entire season.

9376~~~
I don't know why all of these rumors are still being created. He's repeatedly stated he wants to fight his way back with us.

9377~~~
Arguably the best young midfielder in world football (better than Pogba imo) -- actually, other than Neymar, I don't think there's a player around, of a similar age bracket, who's as good as him. Easily a 60m pound player in today's market.

9378~~~
I agree - why aren't we hearing anything about Verratti? Is it a case of "run silent, run deep" from Woodward?

9379~~~
I actually tend to agree with you. Just don't want to go "overboard" on him because I've recently criticised the Pogba hype (price and wages!) around here.

But yeah. I wouldn't mind a straight swap with AdM. But the prices just goes to show the valuation in today's market. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's insane. 60m pounds should have gotten you 2 Bale's, but today you can't even buy 1 Bale.

9380~~~
Bild are saying that United have asked for 50mil euro for him.

9381~~~
Bild really aren't very reliable.

9382~~~
Quick glance at SportBild and nothing there. Are you sure you're not talking about the alleged 'Anti-Barca' clause inserted by Madrid?

9383~~~
There's no way we're going to let him leave, especially for a 25m pound loss.

9384~~~

9385~~~
The rumors aren't about him leaving, but about PSG making a big offer.

9386~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/51MVlpLhaHE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

9387~~~
If Verratti is included in that offer then maybe a dialogue can be started.

9388~~~
Forget about that, unless United offer 60m+ Di Maria.

9389~~~
You seriously rate Verratti at around 100m?!
That is just taking the piss man.

Verratti and Di Maria should be a straight swap, both of their value is around the £50m mark today.

9390~~~
I wouldn't sell him for anything less than a £10m profit.

We have yet to see the best of him and we'd be a laughing stock around Europe paying such an amount of money on one player only to lose patience and take a huge financial hit this early in his contract.

It makes no sense from any perspective.

9391~~~
No I don't, but PSG don't need the money and they highly rate him. Only a totally absurd offer will make them change their mind or the only other possibility will be if Verratti goes on a strike and act unprofessionally.

9392~~~
Same can be said for Manchester United and di Maria.

9393~~~
Yeah, and that's why United won't sell.

9394~~~
If Bayern want him it'll take Muller, if PSG want him it'll take Verratti, in other words Di Maria better get ready for another year in Manchester.

9395~~~
For our purposes at this time: Verratti>Di Maria>Muller.

9396~~~
I'm not sure I agree, Muller can play anywhere across the frontline and is such a smart player that knows LvG and his methods well. The fact he would score goals from either side of the #9 or as the #9 if Rooney is out would be a huge bonus to us.

9397~~~
But buying Muller would mean Rooney back in the CM or CAM and I don't think anyone here wants that on a permanent basis.

9398~~~
Not if Di Maria went the opposite way. It would be Memphis-Rooney-Muller as the front 3, and when Rooney was out Muller could cover as the #9.

9399~~~
That could work, as long as we get Schneiderlin.
Herrera-Carrick-Schneiderlin behind those 3 would be solid IMO.

9400~~~
Quote from Interview with Argentinian Media

Sounds like he is raring to go!

9401~~~
You have to say, all this comments in the press have been great. No moaning, or feeling sorry for himself, just positive that he'll get it right this season.

If we can get him playing like this again...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9402~~~
RVP comes to UTD as a WC striker, has one good year then becomes crap. Falcao, WC striker, albeit recovering from a serious injury, comes to Utd and becomes crap. DiMaria, WC player comes to us and ends up being a back up for Ashley Young.
Something may be wrong with our set-up
Well we will see if Di Maria settles in better next season or if his replacement fares better.

9403~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfcasia.com/copa-america/83/blog/post/2512091/angel-di-maria-finds-groove-with-argentina" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfcasia.com/copa-amer...91/angel-di-maria-finds-groove-with-argentina</a>

Delaney repeats a popular argument - LVG's system restricts Di Maria, he needs more space to run into, we're not using him properly, etc. He also talks about patience, since Di Maria didn't have a chance to properly bed in. 

We're not selling him or swapping him for anyone. That's stupid. He's probably the best player in our team after DDG. I mean, have people forgotten what he can do?

9404~~~
People, and in particular football fans, generally are idiots. Their opinions sway with the wind.

9405~~~
Brilliant.

On form, he's our best player IMO. So it really is vital for us next season that he begins to feel at home with English football and Lvg's philosophy. Naturally, the fortunes of your best players can decide whether you challenge foe the league title or challenge for 4th.

And like I've said before, I wish we could see more of the defensive side of his game that was evident from his time at Madrid. Not that he was a defensive rock, but his chasing and harrying was fantastic, and one of the things I really liked about him.

9406~~~
RVP didn't become crap. Second season, Moyes happened

Third season, he played too much football for his age and he said it himself, the WC took a lot out of him.

9407~~~
Former Manchester United striker Diego Forlan has slammed Louis van Gaal’s handling of Angel Di Maria and accused the Dutch boss of having a problem with South American players throughout his managerial career.

The Uruguayan striker spent four seasons at Old Trafford between 2001 and 2005 but left for Villarreal after struggling to adapt to life in the Premier League.

Despite initially thriving in England, Di Maria has suffered a similar fate since sealing a £59.7million move to the Red Devils last summer.

But Forlan has defended the Argentine’s form at Old Trafford and has accused Van Gaal of failing to get the best out of the former Benfica winger.

‘I thought he was a superb signing for United because he’s one of the best players in the world but I was slightly suprised too,” said Forlan.

“Louis van Gaal has never been a fan of South American players, as my good friend Juan Roman Riquelme will tell you from his time under the Dutchman at Barcelona.

‘Di Maria started out in England like the player we knew he was at Real Madrid in the 2013/14 season. He looked a class above opponents, he ran at defenders, he was a danger around the box and he covered so much ground. Less talented players have felt they were too good to work as hard as him.

‘Players are not robots and if there’s something wrong then their coaches need to find out what the problem is. Di Maria is worth the effort. He offers something different from almost every other player.

‘United will regret it if he leaves. He should be given another season to prove himself and United should try to understand him better and trust him.

‘Great coaches and great players don’t always get on and not every player fits into rigid systems, but Di Maria is worth persisting with.’

9408~~~
I honestly think Di Maria could turn out to be our player of the season this season. He's one of those players who you can just see they are naturally talented, but every player has their ups and downs. As they say, form is temporary, class is permanent. I genuinely think he is a bag of class and we haven't had the best from him yet.

9409~~~
It'll be criminal if we sell him, even if PSG wave a massive cheque in front of us.

We're Manchester United - if we can't find a way to integrate a world class flair attacking player, then there's something wrong with the set up of the club.

9410~~~
said this mid-may. I honestly believe he will tear the league up next season.

9411~~~
Ffs the amount of people who have an axe to grind against lvg.

9412~~~
Tbf South Americans play more intuitive football whereas the Dutch and Germans more tactical. No wonder LvG loves his Dutch and German players. However in a successful team you need both type of players and hopefully with Ramos' experience in defence and Schneiderlin in midfield Di Maria will be allowed to play his natural game a bit more.

9413~~~
Coincidence or not?

9414~~~
I think di Maria just prefers Adidas. This is the first time since he came to Europe that he played with Nike. (Benfica, Real, Argentina since, all adidas). So he'll be on fire soon enough.

9415~~~
Even if they offer that much, we would be still selling him for less that we paid for.

I think that the only way we're gonna sell him is if they offer 60+m pounds and LVG isn't convinced that Di Maria is going to return to his best.

9416~~~
This is dead spot on. In fact he looked a class above everyone in our team at that time, then suddenly its like a switch was hit and he started playing like Nani...

Whatever we do, we have to get this guy to his very best next season. I'd go as far as saying we won't be successful otherwise

9417~~~
Are these quotes real?

9418~~~
At the start of last year, he was playing so loose and relaxed. The flicks, the dribbles, the crossing all looked spontaneous and effortless - defenders couldn't predict his next move. He went to shit when he lost that instinctive style and you could see he was telegraphing his play. Funny enough, I think that's what Young was doing before last year, just being entirely too predictable and trying to force things with the same old moves. If he could figure it out and regain his confidence under LVG, I think di Maria can do the same.

9419~~~
Isn't it quite likely that Van Gaal was telling him not to play so loose?

9420~~~
Correct. If we let him go, we'd be back to square one, in terms of improving our attacking play. There's no one on the market to replace him with, either. 
Well, there is Sterling, but we can't sign him.

9421~~~
I think the same can be said of carzola,ozil or even silva during their first season. Players moving from the Spanish league often face this and it isn't surprising. I think he will come good for us next season and lvg can mentor him better. Unlike ozil or carzola he won't fall prey to shouldering the team's offence every time we go forward. He has got great quality players around him to work with.

9422~~~
I think it can be both. I'm sure LVG asked him to pump the brakes a bit but then the pendulum swung too far the other way. I just see di Maria as too talented a player to not regain his form with us, unless he and LVG really don't get along. Shame he won't get a full preseason this year but at least he's playing himself back into form with Argentina.

9423~~~
For what it's worth, I disagree with the Ozil/Cazorla bit. Ozil got a lot of stick but even during his worst performances his underlying class has shone through in some way. His best performances were a joy to watch.

Neither of them ever came close to playing as poorly as Di Maria did for large parts of last season!

I think Di Maria will come good next season but only if its at a different club. LVG puts the system over the individual and has done throughout his career. The player fits the system and not vice versa.

9424~~~
You say that, but among the poor touches or easy dispossession he would have some defence splitting passes that should be nailed on goals. Our strikers messed up a lot of good chances he creates, which makes it look even worse.

9425~~~
No doubt about it, mate. That's because he's a fantastic player. The problem IMO is he's not a LVG player. LVG prefers robotic players who play the system for 90 minutes. He has fallen out with a lot of world class players over this very fact and most of the time, the player is finished under LVG and is benched or sold. All I'll say is, taking account of LVGs history, it would be unusual for Di Maria to bounce back at United. Like I say, it is certainly possible if LVG lets him play with a bit more freedom because he's a fantastic player but that's the part I don't see happening.

9426~~~
He was pretty bad during the second half of the season but LVG knows the kind of player he has at his disposal. If utilised propelrly, we have seen what he is capable of. LVG was experimenting a lot with our formation and approach going forward. But if he can figure out how to use di maria, he can play a massive role for us next season. I think it is great that LVG's approach moves away from depending too much on individual players and instead focussing on the system. Its an approach that suites the pl more than any other league.

9427~~~
How can anyone not like this guy? He's fully committed to the cause and everything he's said this summer has been positive, his stance has impressed me.

9428~~~
I hope he tears it up this season. We really need a top performing talent like him in attack.

9429~~~
Wasn't there an interview not long ago where he came out and basically said he didn't understand why he was dropped and stuff?

9430~~~
Figures the only time since he joined we've had a lot of sunshine he's off in South America. I bet it pisses it down as soon as he lands back in Manchester.

9431~~~
You ignore the fact that di Maria could actually be a massive improvement from within, an improvement that we'll need in order to reach the levels we're more accustomed to again. Who's to say that if we bring in Cavani or Verratti, they'll automatically perform? They could just as much become subs on a team that finishes fourth. di Maria is a heck of a player with a lot of abilities, instead of just dropping him after a poor start in a new league and at a new club, we should be patient and let him adapt to his new surroundings. LVG seems to expect a lot from his players from a tactical standpoint, so I'd rather have the massively di Maria, who has now experienced a year in the BPL and played a year und LVG than a new guy who basically has to start all over again.

9432~~~
Maybe this is because there is something to really grind.

9433~~~
hamstring

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9434~~~
A nice holiday, then back to training after the tour, he'll be fine for the CL qualifiers if we need him.

9435~~~
Fecking great.

9436~~~
Injured, what a surprise

9437~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

9438~~~
As of now nothing has changed, he wasn't going on the pre-season tour anyway was he?

9439~~~
Hamstring is usually 3-4 weeks and he would probably not have come on tour anyways. Not a biggie.

The worrying thing is that we've already started picking up injuries. Doesn't look like our luck will be changing this season. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9440~~~
Last game before joining United and he gets injured again? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9441~~~
There's like 5 weeks until the start of the season, hopefully he'll be healed up by then. Probably won't play the first game against Spurs though because he lacks match rhythm or something.

9442~~~
Our season is finally beginning, great ! Must be awful to lose 2 huge finals in a row btw.

9443~~~
No, he said it was hard for him to deal with that he was being dropped.

9444~~~
Gotta feel for him, pulled his hamstring both for the world cup final last year and now at the start of the copa america final.

9445~~~
Hopefully it's not too bad. He seems to be aware of his own body and usually gets himself out of situation where he feels he can do further injury, such a shame though as he was playing really well and now the rhythm has been broken.

9446~~~
Of all times to get injured this would be the best, he can relax now and he'll be back for the start in August.

9447~~~
He did actually give an interview where he said he didn't think he should have been dropped. Or words to that effect. You must have missed it.

This latest interview is more encouraging.

9448~~~
I think he said "it's a little hard to explain why I don't play", which IMO sounds a lot less worse than saying "I shouldn't have been dropped". My interpretation was that he was basically shrugging it off, rather than showing entitlement to play every game.

IIRC the British media just gave a sensationalist headline to the same interview.

I think a Spanish speaker would be better suited to interpret what he might have actually meant. <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a>?

9449~~~
I think they must have asked him something about it being odd because United had paid so much money for him. He did say, "it's a little difficult to explain why I'm not playing." Which is one of those things that's hard to pin down. The way I read it was that he was actually saying, "I'm not going to explain it." But it's a print interview so you don't really know how it was said, or even what was cut/paraphrased by the reporter.

The bit where he does sound frustrated to me is when they ask what position he'd been playing for LvG. He says something like,  "Ahead of Rooney, in the middle, wide. I don't care where I play, if I'm playing." But he also talks about being criticised and heckled by Madrid fans, but proving himself there, and that he can prove himself again at United.

I really didn't see much negative in that interview. He doesn't like being on the bench - good. He knows that just because he cost a lot of money, he doesn't have the right to be an automatic starter - also good. He thinks he can do better - very good.

Incidentally it's at:

9450~~~
Hopefully Giggs will be giving him advise on how to prevent hamstring injuries.

9451~~~
He was out of form but he was still really productive, he just needs to make those really simple passes without losing possession and also calm down on the long range shots but even then I don't mind those or the crosses that miss their target by miles because he will still create a great chance or two or three in a match, the simple short passes he somehow messes up are the dangerous ones because then we get hit on the counter.

I want him to play though, he can have the ball on the touchline but still deliver a pin point cross to Rooney or now even Depay will probably score a few headers. I also like Juan Mata since he is productive too but the midfield of Carrick, Herrera and Mata is probably too light weight and playing him just off the striker would mean more defensive responsibility for Depay and Angel di Maria.

9452~~~
Thank you. It's good to hear that he wants to fight it out and is focused on making it here.

9453~~~
Yeah I was thinking that. Given that Argentina got to the final of the CA I assume he would have been joining the pre-season tour late anyway.

9454~~~
Rooney on the bench works too.

9455~~~
Hopefully the injury is only a tweak, he seemed to be moving fine after the game.

9456~~~
Just rewatching his performance against QPR, was stunning that day. Dying to see him get back to that level in our shirt, hopefully this injury isn't too serious. Talk of selling him is a joke.

9457~~~
It will never happen at Utd no matter who is bought.
