New thread for the new season.

He's been really impressive on tour. One weakness I think is his newly acquired inability to stop penalties but Louis can fix that. Other than that it's hard to find a single major flaw in his game. Also hope Frans Hoek improves his distribution like he did with Van der Sar and Valdes. It used to be one of his strengths at Atletico but quite frequently last season he was taking aimless punts up-field. So glad we have one of the very best at such a critical position. Think he'll go up a couple of notches in performance, now that another heir apparent to the throne is playing at Chelsea.

PS : Give the man a new contract.

2~~~
I'm looking forward to him vs Courtois this season, the two best young GK's in the world, I still can't really decide who's better.

3~~~
Time to ditch her Dave:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/david-de-geas-girlfriend-edurne-garcia-admits-she-would-like-him-to-move-back-to-spain/152945?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/david-d...-would-like-him-to-move-back-to-spain/152945?</a>

4~~~
Mata is his girlfriend

5~~~
I'm a bit worried tbh, he only has two years left on his contract too.

6~~~
That's alright then <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7~~~
feckin hell. The next one. Women eh.

8~~~
Well she can go feck herself, Dave is ours.. probably crush poor Mata too.

9~~~
Thank god Barca have got 2 goalkeepers in with Ter Stegen just 22. Barcelona would probably be the only team he would move to in Spain and not Real due to his Atletico allegiances. He looks like someone who is passionate about United and I can see him becoming a future United captain once he becomes more experienced. A truly brilliant keeper who is outrageously consistent. The only mistake I remember him making last season was against Sunderland in the semi final of the Carling Cup.

10~~~
Ed needs to stop signing sponsors and give our Dave a new deal asap..

11~~~
Not sure what the fuss is over his penalty stopping ability. The goalkeeper has to guess which side. Sometimes they guess right, other times they don't. It's not a problem at all.

12~~~
DailyStar articles should be taken with a pinch of salt TBF..

13~~~
It's very likely that he will leave one day, not just cause of his girlfriend. Hope that's just very far away

14~~~
Why can't she move to Cheshire? It's beautiful in the Summer.

15~~~
Can't remember the last time he stopped a penalty since the 8-2 game against RVP. We barely even conceded penalties since then anyway, but it could be a problem if this defence continues to make silly mistakes.

Although out of the penalties conceded, 1 was Michael Keane's rather unfair handball against Roma, another was Micheal Keane being unable to stop one of the best players in the world in Bale and the other was a silly Jones mistake against a highly talented player in Sterling.

16~~~
You can bet that will be worked on this season

17~~~
You can't blame a keeper for letting in a penalty unless he was the cause of it, otherwise its unfair.

18~~~
His kicking was poor last night.

19~~~
Sunderland semi finals.

20~~~
Ah yeah you're right. Didn't want to remember that game though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

21~~~
Not counting penalty shootouts I think about 75% of the penalties he's faced since the 8-2 were taken by Gerrard.

22~~~
Why doesn't she just move to Manchester? Unless our Dave has a few birds on the go here that he doesn't want her finding out about?

23~~~
Hopefully gets the new deal sorted very soon.

24~~~
She is a singer or something! Anyway, nothing wrong with what she said, of course it's better to live closer, but she said she wants the best for him and Manchester is not far away!

Inam just glad Barca got Ter Stegen and I would like to believe he won't go to RM because of his Atletico connections. But I am not sure how strongly he really feels for them. After all he already left them as a kid, if he wanted he could have happily stayed there for some more years.

Anyway, he seems extremely happy with us and now with Mata and Herrera there are even more reasons for him to stay here!

25~~~
De Gea should just dump her and go out and pull women with Herrera and Mata.

26~~~
Well we conceded 3 in 2011/12, 0 in 2012/13 and 4 in 2013/14. Not sure exactly who they were against but yeah that Liverpool game probably made up most of it.

27~~~
Indeed. Should be one of the top priorities for the club.

28~~~
If he has Herrera & Mata, what does he need women for?

29~~~
Should be an absolute priority for the club to sign him up to a new deal.. Real and Barca otherwise will be sniffing around soon. 

Top drawer keeper, who this season will more than likely go on to become Spain's no.1

30~~~
Or, alternatively, just pull Herrera and Mata.

31~~~
Exactly, they will find someone better <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

After the transfer window a new contract for Dave should be priority numero uno.

32~~~
Have you seen Edurne? If I were him, I'd be in Spain already for a slice of that. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

And yes, give him whatever he wants. He's our best player, for me.

33~~~
Does anyone else find that half the time you're watching goals being scored in football matches you're just thinking 'Good strike, but Dave would have saved that.' Feels oddly disrespectful to the striker, but it's hard to deny. Definitely a touch of that going on watching Lewandowski's goal against the MLS all-stars.

It's not just other teams, either. I've had the same thought about a few of our goals on tour.

34~~~
Yep I do it a lot aswell. When a goal goes in I am almost surprised these days unless its point blank. If it is anything near the edge of the box I have full confidence he will save it.

35~~~
Just read the comments online from his girlfriend. If she misses him that much why doesn't she just come and live here? I know she's a singer/actress/whatever but she can't be that well known, I have a few friends who have lived in Spain for some time now and none of them have heard of her. Get rid of her Dave and Louis shall find you a nice northern lass.

36~~~
You'd move anywhere to live with De Gea wouldn't you?

He's probably my favourite United player at the moment, he's just fecking wonderful. I hope he never leaves. He'll be a bigger legend than Schmeichel in 3/4 years.

37~~~
Think her name to fame is finishing third on X Factor. Genuinely.

38~~~
I think it says a lot that they are still together despite spending 3 years apart location-wise. It also says a lot that she hasn't moved to Manchester despite De Gea's foreseeable future being at United.

39~~~
I'm drunk as feck, but can I just say this... I love de Gea. God bless that lovely bearded man.

40~~~
Amen.

41~~~
Remember when people thought Lindegaard should be our starting keeper? My god that feels like an eternity ago, Dave has gotten so ridiculously good in the past couple of years. If we don't get Hummels to improve our defence, then our back 3 might be needing a LOT of bailing out this season. Big Dave's gonna have a busy year.

42~~~
It's a bit worrying he hasn't signed an extension. Two years left on his current deal, his girlfriend wants him to play in Spain again and Madrid will be on the search for a new long term GK in a year or two.

43~~~
He seems really happy here, he'll sign a new deal. Not worried in the slightest.

44~~~
Navas is 27 years old, I don't think Real will look for a new GK for the next few seasons, if he is doing fine. Barca has Ter Stegen, so they are sorted for the next years. Maybe a return to Atletico? But they need to be competetive the next years and with Oblak they signed also a very young talented goalkeeper this season. Give him a good payrise and add more spanish wizards in the upcoming seasons and Dave will stay here <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

45~~~
The battle that everyone wanted to see is about to happen this year; De Gea vs Courtois which for me De Gea edges it but then again I am a massive of Big Dave, and every now and then I think he's just too good when he saves an outrageous shot, its quite funny tbf.  No doubt the two best young keepers in the world but who do you think is better? Even if De Gea has a season noticeably better than Courtois almost every top 5 fan will say he didn't because their hate for United.

46~~~
de Gea has the advantage of already been used to the physicality of the Premier League. It will be interesting to see how quickly Courtois adapts over the coming months.

47~~~
With the cards as they are at the moment, I'd say Courtois is going to be playing in a more settled team and more organized defensively, at least at first. Our defence is still experimenting a new system, has had some important players leaving and is still pretty young. Playing behind a settled defence is an important factor for a GK, imagine our Dave behind the defensive unit Van der Sar used to have. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Even though Dave had a good season last year, it wasn't documented at all because our team looked a mess and we conceeded stupid goals (for which he wasn't at fault). He made one blunder whole season (COC against Sunderland after which he did tremendously in the kick out session, let down by our players incompetent penalties) and had a pretty stellar individual record apart from that, but it won't especially be remembered. 

What I'm trying to say is that for a big team, the way the GK is judged is also due to where the team finishes and the overall impression of solidity it's given. It's not ALL in his hands, imo.

48~~~
De Gea will never get the credit he deserves until he has a good and settled defense in front of him.

49~~~
Seeing as this thread is about his performances, I thought he wasn't great against Valencia. A couple of really poor/dangerous clearances and that shot down his throat which he spilled in a dangerous area.

I know people are going to start accusing me of being biased against him but I really don't see him as being at the same level as many seem to see him on here. He's a really talented young keeper, with loads of great qualities but still definitely a work in progress.

50~~~
Interview with him on MUTV right now. His English has really improved.

51~~~
Was just about to post it Damien. He really has come on very well.

52~~~
That's great. I remember reading last September from Eric Steele that he was lazy in his learning of english. Also, before that interview even happened he said when we played Madrid away in the CL, he was disappointed to get any questions asked in English rather than Spanish to point out he knew it

53~~~
Did he say anything interesting?

54~~~
Is it possible to not love him?

55~~~
He's fantastic. We need to give him a new contract pronto.

56~~~
He is a dude. Big time.

57~~~
For a second I thought he was injured, too ...

58~~~
I'm proud I've backed him since day 1 regardless of all the trouble.

59~~~
SAF's last gift before he stepped down. The way SAF controlled both DDG and the stupid media surrounding his first season has proved correct once again.

I hope we are celebrating his 10th ear at the club, but for that to happen the team needs to get back into the CL otherwise the big Spanish teams will be sniffing around him.

60~~~
Nothing much really. Just saying he is happy that there is Spanish speaking contingent in the squad so new players can settle in easier. Excited to play under a new manager and its a new era etc.

61~~~
Need to get that new contract sorted soon.

62~~~
Just saw his interview (from Friday) on MUTV. I know he was being interviewed in English last season but he's properly fluent now. 
Isn't his contract situation the same as Welbeck's with just 2 seasons left? Without sounding Moyes-esque, we need to take a leaf out of City's book. Players like De Gea need to be signed up to new long term contracts asap. Hopefully once the transfer window foolishness is out of the way, Woodward can focus on that.

63~~~
We need to tie him down to a long term contract asap. Among all the players in our club at this point of time,if we were to lose a player, I think losing DDG will pain the most.

64~~~
I love him.

Still wish it had been him who was made captain. 

Agent Dave, what a guy.

65~~~
We do but you can tell he feels at home between the sticks here, I don't think an offer even from Bayern, Barca or Real would make him consider leaving and that's comforting.

66~~~
On a different note, how far off of Edwin Van Der Sar level do we think De Gea is.

67~~~
I think it would be extremely naïve of us to allow his contract to run below two years regardless.

68~~~
GIVE HIM A NEW DEAL WOODY! It's just as important as making a signing I think (maybe not yet but it will be if we let his contract go closer to running out).

69~~~
I think the club will give new contracts to a few players after the international break in September

The job for Woodward & Co. was first new signings and then new contracts

70~~~
He's brilliant but I do feel he's a little while off from van Der Sar. His performance in the CL final was immense.

71~~~
edwin was special for us. up there with schmeichel as our best goalie imo. and of course he was very lucky to have rio, vidic and evra all at their peak infront of him.

hopefully we can sort out our defense. david deserves one. and of course a new contract too.

72~~~
I'd say he's far superior to what VDS was at a similar age and that says something about the lad! Now if we were to compare glory years VDS to DDG, I think  they're not too far apart. The only thing he needs to work on now is his ability to arrange a defence during  set pieces. Also, a bit more commanding in the air (he's been improving that surely).

The best part about DDG is that he's only turning 24 in two months. 24!! This is a lad who is in the high echelon of great talents - Courtois, Ter Stegen and DDG have a begun a new era of great goalkeepers.

73~~~
Hopefully he's around long enough for that to eventually happen.

74~~~
He deserves so much more.

Awesome keeper with rubbish in front of him. On a personal level he should have way more clean sheets and recognition than he gets but the rest in front of him cost him.

75~~~
Absolutely, if the team was up to scratch people would talk about him with the likes of Neur and courtios

76~~~
Really? I'd say van der Sar was an outstanding young keeper and was at a similar age than de Gea now during Ajax' brilliant years in the 90's. He was 24 when he won the CL. I rate de Gea a lot, he's maybe even at a comparable level than van der Sar back then, but he's definitely not far superior. The strange thing about van der Sar's career was always the years which should have been his peak. It seems that the problems in his first year in Italy completely destroyed his confidence and he needed years to rebuild it and get back to his best and then he got another shot at the top level late in his career at United. But you could argue that his peak form was at Ajax, not at United, and that was between 23 and 26.

77~~~
Fair point. However VDS had a superior defence in front of him then. For the last year and half De Gea has been let down an awful lot.

78~~~
Sounds probably weird, but I actually think that helps de Gea look truely great at the moment. He's an freakishly brilliant shotstopper and he gets more than enough chances to show that. VDS back then was part of a tactically complex system and was very important to make that 343 with a high line in defense work. He needed to excel in much more than shotstopping at an early age and he did.

79~~~
I take it you are not a big fan of casillas then? (ie rated him as among the best keepers or the best keeper at any point I his career)

80~~~
I always thought his saves look so spectacular because he's so small for a keeper and tehrefore makes easy saves look great <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Of course Casillas was an excellent keeper, but he's nowhere near the greats of the past 25 years in my opinion. I'd even rate his peak a level below Cech and van der Sar. Doesn't mean he wasn't important to his teams, but I always thought his personality was more influential than his actual ability as a keeper.

81~~~
I am obviously biased towards casillas but personally I would have him as one of the best (probably second best) of his generation after Buffon. I concede though that Casillas was overrated to a certain extent due to him being from Madrid and coming from madrids youth system and also being the Spanish captain so he got a lot of protection from the media (he also got a similar treatment to messi due to the fact that he is perceived as humble and quiet etc). He is not as complete as a lot of the other keepers but I though his shot-stopping was at such a high level that it propelled him higher than a lot of keepers that were better all-round. There were a couple of seasons where he really was a one-man wall as (especially during 03 to 09) Madrid had some really bad defenders (although some keepers benefit from that as it helps them keep their concentration whereas it is also difficult for a keeper to have nothing to deal with and then pull off a great save out of nowhere). I also thought his ability to make saves at decisive moments (like I the WC final and the CL final in 02) was what made him special as not every player has that. I definitely would have him higher than Cech and van der sar but I guess it depends what you want from your keeper.

82~~~
Whoops didn't see the new thread.

We're only two games in but De Gea seems to be playing a bit differently already. Seems rooted to his line. There have been a few occasions where he could have easily come and collected the ball, but he chooses not to, often resulting in a defender hoofing it out for a throw.

83~~~
Solid performance yesterday. His passing is slowly improving. In pre-season, his problem was his long passing, but he looks more and more comfortable playing long balls now. However, he needs to be more authoritative in open play. Jones and Blackett had a go at him for not coming out to deal with the ball on two separate occasions, and that's one of his "weaknesses", IMO.

84~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/5co3tBy.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/5co3tBy.png"/>

85~~~
World class 'keeper. Hopefully he finally receives the protection he deserves this season, the poor bastard is constantly over worked.

86~~~
Agreed. We need a settled back four/five for once but our defenders all seem to be made out of glass.

87~~~
Jones, Evans and Smalling definitely are. Which is a massive issue. I very much doubt we'll see a settled defence this season, due to both injuries and changes in formation. Thank Christ he's such a top shot stopper.

88~~~
Probably going against the usual opinion here of 'he's class' but does he ever save?

Lately (and the back end of last season) it seems, whenever the opposition have a shot, the ball goes in the net, sometimes goalkeepers get you out of messes and mistakes by defenders, with De Gea it seems all mistakes are punished.

89~~~
I'm unsure. Goalkeeper isn't a position I'd be overly observant of but I wouldn't have blamed him for the majority of the goals we've conceded in recent months. In fact I'd feel he's definitely earned us more points than he's lost us. I think he's a world class 'keeper, just below the level of Neuer, who's in a league of his own.

90~~~
He's a lot more composed on the ball than some of our defenders.

91~~~
As a former keeper myself...it comes with the job. De Gea is one of the best in the league and his shot stopping is almost impeccable. Utd should be lucky to have a keeper like him and IMHO, he should be given the #1 spot for Spain. I'm still trying to ascertain how he saved that free-kick from Mata 2 seasons ago.

92~~~
Bit harsh but have to say I feel like you have a point. It's great how blunder-free he's been in recent memory but he's not doing anything special, he's not great one on one and it's a rarity he has a game where you credit him with keeping us in it, and he's had ample opportunities to do that. Sunderland away and Olympiakos home are the only ones that stand out from last season. 

He's probably the least of our problems right now but he's been a bit overrated on here. He's definitely got another level to go to with the talent he possesses. Rather than just being solid enough that you can't criticise him, we should be coming out of more games thinking "thank god we had De Gea today". I do feel sorry for him, it seems like every season since he arrived here we've been saying "once the defence in front of him is sorted..." and here we are 3 years later. He can't save our arses <i>every </i>week but right now he can't save our arses <i>any </i>week.

93~~~
Thought he could've did better with one of the goals today which was close to him, slightly ridiculous the regularity at which strikers get unchallenged shots at him in and around the box though. Must be so frustrating when you're attempting to keep a clean sheet and then a defender presents the opponent with virtually an open net.

94~~~
Made a good save from Suarez at OT last season. I think his one-on-one stuff is quite good. Needs a better defence in front of him though. I can't see him sticking around if we keep sinking like this.

95~~~
I don't want to frame this as a criticism but rather as an observation. Why is he so deep inside his area at almost all times? There were a number of times even yesterday where the defence would have been better off if he had not been stuck so deep inside his box. With his ability on the ball he should look to play more of the sweeper role, and that should help our defence too. It is definitely an area of improvement for him.

96~~~
Like I said in the other thread I think he's been pretty average in the 3 games this season, he could have done better for the 2nd Swansea goal and he should have done better for the 3rd goal last night.

The thing is I wouldn't be surprised if errors started to creep into his game after the shit he's had to put up with in the last 12 months. I've played in net a few times and if your defence is useless and you've already conceded a few goals it's human nature that your performance levels drop too. As others have said though he's the least of our problems at the minute.

97~~~
He seems to struggle to get to the bottom corner ones that roll in with a lack of pace. One's like Cabaye and Ki Seung Yeung's. He has immense reflexes and when the ball is off the ground he makes some incredible saves, maybe he just can't get to ground quick enough to save them. I wouldn't necessarily say they are shots he should be saving but you do see top class keepers tipping them round the post. 

Still he's an incredible keeper who will only get better.

98~~~
I had a dream this morning that we had let him join a club in America called "Atlanta". It was his wish to leave the club as he'd always wanted to go to an American College like they have in the movies. I woke up grieving.

99~~~
They now have Rojo and Di Maria to speak Spanish with, with possibly Vidal to come too.

feck, that's 7 spanish-speaking players in our squad!?!? Incredible to think.

Do feel bad for him, he's got yet more dogshite to play behind this season. Only one goal out of <b>7</b> should have been saved by him, otherwise the rest were just dreadful defending. Hopefully a switch to 4-3-3 with a competent DM in front will see less goals leak through.

100~~~
I do worry that now a 2nd straight season where the midfield and defense are not doing enough in front of him, that it will start shaking his confidence or worse his will to stay at United.

101~~~
Needs a better defence in front of him.

I love Dave he's brilliant.

102~~~
Erm, last season it was a 'Thank god we had De Gea all year'.. We would've finished 9th or so if he didn't show up as many times as he did.

103~~~
Need to get him signed up asap. Player I'd hate to lose most. Missed the game last night, but from what seen of him this season it has looked like he is quite rooted to his line and isn't coming out even to claim the ball at times. There'll obviously be some confusion with inexperienced players at the back and a bit of musical chairs so far. The new formation leaves him horribly exposed and it looks like he'll be in for a busy time of it. He's coming on nicely hopefully under LVG he can keep on developing his distribution as it was a trait of his he didn't use as much last season.

104~~~
no surprise got nominated to the spain squad. No Mata though.

105~~~
Casillas still there, will they ever drop him? I wouldn't be surprised if DDG still doesn't start a game for Spain. At least they dropped the mascot!

106~~~
He isnt in his best form recently imo, Casillas is still better atm.

107~~~
What is up with his distribution currently? Admittedly some times the defenders aren't helping him but other occasions, he isn't helping himself.

108~~~
There's your fecking problem. We have cowards like Evans and Jones who can't pass it forward and insist on having de Gea kick it long for them.

109~~~
He got a clean sheet. Get the feck in!

110~~~
True, I think Blackett was the only one again willing to pick up the ball and look for the forward pass.

111~~~
Nobody showed for the ball in CM. Hence all the long balls.

112~~~
That and Evans/Jones slipping over or underhitting balls to de Gea.

113~~~
His reaction in about 75th minute said it all. Jonny idiot passed the ball to him when the striker was about 5 yard away from DDG and started pressing him, David dribbled him and kicked the ball on out. Then he looked at Evans who made himself available in shit zone DDG had no chance to pass to and shrugged at him with this 'feck off you cnut' look on his face.

Our defenders are a joke at distribution and in 352 they're responsible for it. Our strikers can't keep the ball when he's hoofing it at them and our midfield is too stupid to get the second balls so what the feck is he supposed to do with it.

114~~~
Also, doesn't come enough for the long balls over the top, appears that is due to shite communication.

115~~~
Yeah, he seems to stick to his line a lot more than he used too.

116~~~
With the way our defence were half asleep and making schoolboy like errors in front of him there today it was a good job he was as alert as he was or we wouldn't even have gotten away with a point.

117~~~
I thought he was quiet good at that today. There was even an instance where he rushed out of his box to prevent a one-on-one situation. Evans gave him a bollocking in the first half when he didn't come to collect a long ball which was bizarre as it landed around 12 yards from goal and it was never on for him to catch it.

118~~~
Yeah he made a good challenge, but a few times the defenders (if they can call themselves that!) were trying to usher the ball back but he didn't want any part of it, causing the now traditional panic clearance, which usually results in a corner or thrown in.

119~~~
I can think of one instance where either Jones or Evans were holding of a defender and he should have come out for the ball. Like I said when Evans gave out to him for not coming off his line it was really bizarre as it was never on for him to collect it.

120~~~
someone can gif that dribbling skills in six yard box? if anything his confidence is sky high and glad to see him improving every match

121~~~
Thought he was quite good today actually. A few times his poor distribution was the fault of the defender giving him the ball under pressure. A few times it was just poor from him but he was one of our best.

122~~~
Strangely poor with the ball at his feet today at times, otherwise his usual goodness. We are also going back to the keeper far too much this season, it's very annoying

123~~~
Twitter rumours are that we are to sign Sergio Romero, this won't impact De Gea will it?

124~~~
I'm worried about his contractual situation and have been for a while.

125~~~
Um... why? He'll be given a new deal this year. That's how these things work. The last year or the year before that the club moces in and negotiates a new deal.

126~~~
Under normal circumstances yes, but United hacks have been reporting in regards a new contract for almost 12 months now, yet no concrete movement. We're out of the top four and our arguably greatest asset has less than two years left on his deal. We should have acted, if we haven't already, a lot sooner.

127~~~
Good for us that he is from Athletico therefore probably won't play for Real Madrid and also Barcelona have an embargo next year + Bayern have Neuer. 

Who are you worried about tapping him up?

128~~~
Calm down would you? He loves the club. He's said it over and over again. The one thing that can be understood is that he won't actively work towards moving away from the club. We'll lock it down by Christmas.

129~~~
He loves us at the moment. If we continue this slide then his love will be tested.

130~~~
Signing yet another spanish speaking beast of a forward ought to sway him a for a good couple years <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

131~~~
Frans Hoek, our goalkeeping coach, asked Eric Steele back to the club.

Just read it there in UWS....Our keepers must think highly of him

132~~~
He is starting.

133~~~
So we will have two goalkeeping coaches? That's a strange one.

134~~~
Starting tonight! Delighted for him, he deserves it!

135~~~
For anyone that wants to watch in the UK, the match is on Sky Sports 5.

136~~~
Good luck to him!

137~~~
Never thought id see the day when Chelsea have more players than Barcelona in the Spanish eleven. How times have changed.

138~~~
I really hope he does well. He deserves to be the certain starter for Spain. He's not going to get any recognition until he puts in his performances at international level as well. 

How is he doing?

139~~~
He's not had much to do. Made 3 routine saves and that's about it.

I don't think he's even had to deal with any crosses either.

140~~~
Now the game is over, how did he do overall? Glad to hear he is getting game time.

141~~~
It was a bit of a nothing match I thought. He had a few comfortable saves to make. He couldn't do anything about the goal. He didn't make any mistakes but because he didn't have an awful lot to do it can't really be used as a way to push up the pecking order.

142~~~
Made a few decent saves. Remy's shot was unstoppable.

143~~~
Nothing he could have done for the goal (which is the usual excuse whenever De Gea doesn't save it!)

General play was good and he was fairly busy so it was a good workout for him at least...that is what i got form the choppy stream i was watching anyway.

144~~~

145~~~
That would be nice.

146~~~
I think he is mapped out as Spain's new number one and I think he did well tonight. Would there be any point in them picking someone else now I wonder?

147~~~
When he came people would defend every mistake he made, but now some people try to pick mistakes in the good performances he gives.

He has really turned it around for himself and he's sure to soon be spains number 1.

148~~~
Getting a bit worried about his current contract situation to be honest. A little under 2 years left on it.

149~~~
I'd say he'll likely start on Monday but del Bosque refused to confirm, just said he wanted to give de Gea minutes in a tough game and that he performed well.

Would be my choice from now on too, but we'll see.

150~~~
Yep, hes somebody you absolutely lock down on a 6 year'er and renew every 2.

151~~~
Casillas is going downhill. De Gea is the better keeper nowadays.

152~~~
Going?

153~~~
I think he can become top 3 goalkeeper and maintain that position for a long time but dont see him as absolutley worlds no1. Obviously Neuer is the best right now and I dont think David can ever be better than Curtois just because they are quite similar and curtois is bigger having as good reflexes but covers more space in gaol and is becoming very dominant in the box, very comfortable in the air for still young goalkeeper. DDG got better in it and will be even better but I cant see him being that dominant. But hes got arguably best reflexes and great feet. He is great character and agent for us and after all the clearance he became my top3 favourite player in the club with Rafael and Anderson lol.. 1. Neuer 2. Curtois 3. DDG 4. Howard 5. Cech. Anyway we should be very satisfied that he is at our club and I wouldnt compare him to others after all its like comparing Ronaldo, Messi, Robben or diMaría, we are lucky to get arguably the third best goalkeeper in the world and thats great.

154~~~
I don't think Courtois's physicality will have any impact on him being better than De Gea.

155~~~
Me too but at least his agent is Woody's big mate.

156~~~
Honestly it's crazy he even has to worry about that, he should be no.1 for them under any sane metric. After the last WC, Del Bosque must surely know it is time to bring in the promising younger generation.

157~~~
He's by far and away the best Spanish goalkeeper and I think Del Bosque knows that.

158~~~
Dave loves the club so I'll reckon he'll Pen a new contract sometime this year. I think when we got behind him at the start he realised just how special this club is. Definantly a future captain in the making.

159~~~
It seems like it from Del Bosque's hint about the game against Macedonia.  De Gea still has some things to work on.  Hopefully an improvement in what goes on in front of him at United will enable him to look like the goalkeeper he should be rather than continually trying to put out fires lit by Evans et al.

160~~~
With the way Casillas played in the world cup, i would be surprised if De Gea is not first now.

161~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Spain coach Del Bosque: Man Utd keeper De Gea deserved chance</b></span>

Spain coach Vicente del Bosque was happy to hand <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/english-premier-league/manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper David de Gea a debut in defeat to France.

Del Bosque went with De Gea ahead of <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/spanish-liga/real-madrid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Real Madrid</a> captain Iker Casillas.

The coach said: “De Gea did well, we are all happy with him.

"We needed to give him a run-out and we took advantage of this game to field him in a big game."


Bout time.

162~~~
one thing about de gea that i hope he can improve is his dominance inside his own box. it seems that he rarely goes beyond his six yard box to collect the ball and ending up with one of our defenders needing to make unnecessary rash clearance when they got pressed by the oppositions.

apart from that he has been one of our best performer for the last 2 years and deserves a much more reliable cover infront of him. oh and a new contract too.

163~~~
Won't be surprised if Casillas just strolls back into the starting line-up under Del Bosque. Even at Real, they ditched a better goalkeeper in Diego Lopez and now have Navas in the wings waiting for his chance... Really wish they would go forward and give De Gea a run in the first team. Hopefully, Del Bosque proves me wrong but there is just too much politics involved in such a move ala Raul being dropped in 2008.

164~~~
He has massively improved that part of his game since he has come here. Also, his decision making is one of the best in the league.

165~~~
I remember a point in the Burnley game where he played sweeper keeper a.l.a. Neuer/Lloris. He came out to help the defense well outside the box and swept the ball. I think this was one aspect missing from his game as the 'modern keeper' and clearly he seems to have worked on it. I don't think Courtois has that aspect to his game (Not that he needed it in Atletico). But with LVG playing a high line, this facet of his game will be good to see.

166~~~

167~~~
Best news since Moyes' sacking!!! Yeahhh!!!!!!

168~~~
Oh yes, excellent news if true! It should have been a priority for some time to be honest.

169~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Is that report from Ducker?

170~~~
I have no idea! I don't know if it is genuinely from the Times either, but I haven't really looked that hard.

171~~~
Excellent news. Outstanding keeper and in my opinion will be up there with the likes of Schmeichel and VDS as a world class keeper at United over my lifetime

172~~~
I'm guessing it's in this article. It's behind a paywall so not sure what it says. <a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> could you summarise?

173~~~
Unfortunately I can't. My Times account is suspended for money reasons and everytime I try renewing my subscription the site errors out.

174~~~
No worries. That sounds pretty strange. Maybe if try setting up a new account altogether it might work then. Thanks anyhow.

175~~~
Nothing on the times website about a new contract.

176~~~
This was the article I meant to post above: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/clubs/manchesterunited/article4197135.ece" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/clubs/manchesterunited/article4197135.ece</a>

It could be just something he mentioned in that article rather than an entire article written about the negotiations.

177~~~
It's just the last paragraph. Mentions how Jones and de Gea will have one year remaining next summer and they are in talks.

178~~~
Cheers.

179~~~
Guessing you'll all be more interested to know than me, but del Bosque has confirmed that Iker starts tomorrow...so no de Gea.

180~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Such a joke. Spanish fans must be relieved that Xavi retired as otherwise he would still be in the starting XI.

181~~~
He'd still play Raul and Marcos Senna if he could probably, the old gimp.

182~~~
Ya he is still living off winning the World Cup and Euros but to be fair they would have won those even with Moyes in charge such was their dominance.

183~~~
Tell him pick what ever wage he thinks he's worth, then double it.

184~~~
We need to tie him down on an 8 year contract. Come on, you can do it!

185~~~
So do we want him to play sweeper - keeper again after yesterday? <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

186~~~
I wonder whether he's been working in training on coming out more and commanding the box as he's normally pretty tight to his line? It clearly doesn't come naturally to him though, could lead to a few mistakes like yesterday.

187~~~
It looks like it given the high line which LVG wants to play. It certainly doesn't come naturally to him, just like say Courtois

188~~~
Not the first time he has been shaky in the last few matches..

189~~~
Not playing behind a settled defence hasn't really helped much and would go to explain some of the shakiness. Still, 2 clean sheets in a row is a good start.

190~~~
Got away with a brain fart but saved smartly in the second half. Top class 'keeper, hopefully with Blind screening the defence he'll receive more protection, the poor bastard has been completely overworked during his period with the club.

191~~~
The only real weakness to his game seems to be knowing when to come out and when to stay. Hopefully he'll nail that quickly.

192~~~
De Gea doesn't like coming out and has always been fairly hesitant when it comes to this kind of thing. Perhaps we're actively trying to change that. If we are, if it leads to the odd error like yesterday then that won't be too surprising. 

We sometimes forget just how young he is. If he can add the odd string or two to his bow then the better. His starting position and alertness to the ball over the top is the best place to start.

193~~~
Judging by what I read on Van Gaal and how he wants his goalkeepers to play, that's a certainty.

194~~~
Any updates on how the contract negotiations are going on? Just tie him down for 8 years ffs! Tell him he can bang Ed's wife if he wants to before he signs the contract.

195~~~
Does he ever move? Or dive? That is the question.

196~~~
Everything on target is going in. Not good at all. Not blaming him for the goals but he hasn't been saving much.

197~~~
He hasn't given a shit since Moyes took over. Last year killed his enthusiasm; he doesn't want to be here any more, and it couldn't be more obvious.

198~~~
Are you guys serious? 2 penalties and 3 goals right in the corner

199~~~
I don't know what's up with him but he should at least try to make a save sometimes. He's can't be in shock everytime as he's been lately.

200~~~
^^^
Said this about him end of August and i'll say it again.

The guy, for a 'supposedly' top goalkeeper, one of the best in the world (a few people say on here).

He never makes a save, it's like every shot the opposition have *bang* goal, even if its 25 yards out - When the Leicester player was clean through, you just knew it was going to be a goal, he doesn't get you out of messes.

201~~~
Last year was his best season for us though.

202~~~
No Courtois isnt significantly better than de Gea.. Loool. He is Mignolet level atm, literally everything goes in.

203~~~
Looks like a ten a penny GK this season. Nothing special.

204~~~
He was our best player last year ffs

205~~~
Looks totally void of confidence, not surprising given the defence thats playing in front of him.

206~~~
Very disappointing season from him so far, everything goes in, penalties or not, if it's on target it's in.

207~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This thread.

208~~~
That's more than quite a stretch.

209~~~
Some really terrible posts in here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

210~~~
Assessing each goal today, which ones should he have done better in? 2 were penalties, and each of the ones from open play were in the corner, absolutely no chance.

211~~~
Do some of you people overreact like this if you make a bad cup of tea some days? The knee jerk hurts my eyes.

212~~~
Its not only today, its a while now. 1 vs 1 is a goal nowadays.

213~~~
Can't really blame him for any goal today but I've said it all along, he is insanely overrated by us.

214~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Shocking posts in here. 5 goals conceded. 2 pens, 1 free header, 1 one on one and another a snap shot from around 8 yards. What do you expect him to do?

215~~~
It's fecking embarrassing.

216~~~
What are some examples where the opposition scored a 1on1 goal that he should have done better on? I didn't see the carling cup match but I can't think of any relevant examples in the league this season right.

217~~~
Do people really blame DDG? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Do some here even play football or just watching games? He didn't make any mistakes and was fine till our defence and the referee decide to change the game. It was basically a free run for every attacking Leicester player after the penalty, every goalkeeper looks bad in those moments, what else can he do? And I don't even want to mention that stupid "He never save penalties". Every one who plays football and took a penalty by himself knows that it's just a bonus if a keeper can save it and that he needs a lot of luck to do it.

218~~~
Who are these posters? Who promotes these guys?

219~~~
Not sure he has enough authority in his box. It was fine with experience in front of him.

Still so young though

220~~~
Could have maybe came off his line to stop their...4th? Or was that a penalty? I don't remember. One of the ones at the end anyway. Otherwise the others weren't really his fault.

221~~~
Oh my fecking God.

222~~~
You mean it's a jump?

223~~~
He was brilliant last season, but this season literally every chance goes in. He also doesnt coach his defenders at all.

224~~~
Why is he kicking the ball up to the half way line? We don't have the players to win the ball. Play it out from the back.

225~~~
Honest question, did he make a single save all game?

226~~~
Are you talking about the 1v1 for the 4th? If he had come forward too much he would have just been dinked. The finish was low and hard right into the corner, nothing he could have done right.

227~~~
Yea, could be something to do with our defenders changing every single fecking game because they're getting injured in every single match or with them being just fecking awful.

228~~~
He's been poor recently. Is it me or every shot at his goal seems to go in.

229~~~
thats the problem with him. He gets 5 shots at the goal, 3 go in. He doesnt save enough. Good keeper, not world class. No wonder he doesnt get past Casillas.

230~~~
Still waiting for your explanations about which particular goals in the league were his fault.

231~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This thread is mind blowing right now..

People slating him but not saying which goal exactly he could have saved..

232~~~
I fail to see how he could have stopped any of their goals today.

233~~~
Some people hate to see certain players criticised. DDG and Rafael are untouchable for some fans. Rafael certainly deserves far more abuse but DDG is not looking like a big influence at this moment.

234~~~
Jesus H Christ, what's wrong with people in here. There was nothing he could do today.

235~~~
Could you please provide examples of which goals conceded in the league were due to De Gea not being good enough?

236~~~
Yeah. It was a lost cause but I thought that would have been the best chance to make the save. Even if it 90% still would have been a goal, at least try and pressure the guy. He just waited for him to slide it into the net.

237~~~
Not saying he has made any faults, but he's done nothing special/world class. If a half deacent ball is shot, it goes in. Or do you think we would have the same amount of goals against with Neuer?

238~~~
Some people criticise DDG and Rafael just for the sake of it it seems.

239~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78708, @okLaptop1" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78708/">@okLaptop1</a> this guy has elaborated it perfectly, you cant say a keeper is at fault if a 1 vs 1 scores, but its just like he doesnt even try, there is 100% it goes in with ddg nowadays.

240~~~
Are you taking drugs?

241~~~
You're making a claim, I'm asking you to prove it. Which half decent shots would another keeper have saved?

242~~~
Gripes I have with DDG...

in possession he is so poor.. I rarely see him play out the ball with confidence. Take a risk ffs, just hits it long and we end up facing another attack. One v ones, someone mentioned it but you don't get the feeling he's gonna best the striker and be really hard to get past. Penalties.. no presence whatsoever. Communication? where is the leadership, command that backline.. position them, does he have Van der Sar's tactical awareness?

Needs to up his game - can't rest on his laurels just cause the rest of the team is poor.

243~~~
Which one should he save? It's not like Leicester had tons of chances. He had pretty much nothing to do 60-70 minutes and then we went completely bananas and he was in situations where a goalkeeper has barely a chance if the attacking player does most things right.

244~~~
It doesnt even try. What the hell does that mean. Noone of you criticising him has elaborated which goals he could have saved. 2 pens, one free header, one free shot and a 1 on 1 situation. Maybe that 1 on 1 situation and that's about it.

245~~~
Oh dear, DDG was brilliant last season. Ok, he hasn't started this season in great form but with that shambles of a defence in front of him, it can't be easy.

246~~~
Wow, how is he getting blamed?

247~~~
I'm done. THere are some lunatics in here it seems. Suddenly it's his fault he cant command this defense and he 'doesnt even try' whatever the hell that means... 

My god.. I'm off this forum for a week. Cant stand this much of stupidity.

248~~~
He stayed on his line to make the 1v1 save, and the shot was too clinical. If he had dashed forward and gotten rounded or dinked he would also get crap for it. So no, that's not a good example of De Gea not trying or being at fault.

249~~~
it has not just to do with the goals, it is his whole presence and nervousness. Never was a big fan and never will be. he is a favourite on here like Rafael, not for me. His anticipation is not there, he never saves a penalty. Comparing him to great keepers, he is good but not class. Neuer saves the unsavables just like Courtois. de Gea laways lets the 1vs 1 in. Has he saved one this season?

250~~~
I agree, not much he could do about any of the goals, still last season and the season before I would say he could have stopped at least one...

251~~~
Wait, so in possession what is he meant to do with it? Run with it? Pass it to one of our 'defenders' ? Nobody's making himself available for the ball and when they do, they usually hoof it themselves unless Blind clocks in to get it. You're right about commanding or VDS's presence, he doesn't have it and we'll have to deal with it by buying defenders who're not brainless zombies.

252~~~
I was surprised to see this thread was even being repeatedly bumped. DDG is the least of my worries after the way we capitulated after the penalty.

253~~~
Yes, because he should be saving penalties and mistakes from our defenders which leave 1 on 1s and pot shots from 8 yards out.

It's actually quite embarrassing. Yes, de Gea should get flak if he doesn't make some saves, but today's were ridiculous to criticize him on.

254~~~
I am not saying he is at fault. I am just saying he <i>COULD </i>have came off his line rather than standing there. it was probably going in either way.

255~~~
He shouldn't be blamed.

He's not like VDS though. Who would be shouting at Rafael or Evans to mark the only Leicester player for the first goal. We need a leader at the back.

256~~~
No he hasn't, but I am pretty sure van der Sar hasn't it too in DDG's age. I agree on the confidence factor, but it's really not easy if you conceding tons of goals every game without doing anything wrong, our defence doesn't give him any support and like last season it is expected that he will save us because our defence is not able to stop the attacking opponents anyway.

257~~~
Some of the posts in here are hilarious ffs what more could he really do when our defense is a shambles in front of him? He's 23 and already one of the best keepers around and one of the only positives from last season too. If he let in some easy goals or something then yeah, call him out for it, but when there's next to nothing he can do about the goals it's baffling how he gets any of the blame.

258~~~
On the whole, he definitely has looked a bit off his game lately. I'm not sure if it's perhaps a very different defence in front of him though which won't be instilling a lot of confidence in him with it's performances. Hopefully it's just a temporary thing, as opposed to something more long-term like we've seen with Hart who's a shadow of the GK he was a couple of years ago.

Some of today's criticism on him has been harsh though.

259~~~
I also say he isnt at fault, but its just likes he doesnt even try. You cant say a keeper is at fault when a 1 vs 1 scores, but you can try something, or make it at least hard for the attacker.

260~~~
He is least of our worries. But I am wondering if amidst all the possession training the staff is still working on shot stopping, etc. or not? Coaching of defense and gk needs to improve!

261~~~
Then why are we talking about it? Either he's preventing goals or he's not. Not sure what else is relevant in this discussion.

Penalties are a lottery most times. A save is a bonus not a requirement.

Off the top of my head I don't know, but it's not something I consider to be an issue. And 1 vs 1s are more about the strikers than the keepers; a keeper only stands a chance if the shot is savable. If it's not (and today it wasn't) then the keeper isn't at fault.

262~~~
Not sure you're allowed to bring firearms into stadium, plus where would he fit it in?

263~~~
He needs to pass it to them, if they feck up - so be it. Many times they are completely open and he refuses to pass to them and prefers to punt it and even then a lot of his punts go out of play. If someone like Mignolet can pass the ball out from the back, I'm sure De Gea is capable of it. He is the type who looks very technically gifted, because he is young and athletic.. but in terms of his efficiency on the ball, I think it is poor. He needs to be like a backboard to this team, when ever it goes back to him it needs to be recycled and another attack begins.. instead alot of our possession breaks down.

264~~~
This is so wrong on so many levels.

265~~~
i dont say he is a bad keeper, not as good as people think on here.

266~~~
So it appears people are blaming him for conceding 5 goals even though there was nothing he could have done about any of them. The general consensus is that he needs to dive more! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So what would people be happy if when the ball flies past him he just does a token dive or something?! Can only assume that those criticising him are either 12 years of age or know nothing about football.

267~~~
Maybe, but the only reason why we expect from him to do those saves is because he was so good the last 2 seasons. But we really shouldn't hope that he will do wondersaves every season and try to use a defence in front of him. The goalkeeper is a poor guy if your team gets overrun every minute.

268~~~
What is wrong is that people label him world class.

269~~~
1 v 1.. you can manage the situation, push the striker into making a certain shot etc. Research by the keeper of who he is up against can be very important, but this is the least of his worries at the moment.. tactical awareness would be my main concern at the moment.

270~~~
I think David is suffering from having his goalkeeping coach changed yet again. He needs continuity. He was playing really well and his training methods have been disrupted. The goalkeeper to me is the most important position. He has been messed about to much.

271~~~
Coming off his line just increases the possibility of betting lobbed or rounded. And he's not just "standing there", he just knew that there was no point diving once the shot was past him. If the shot is clinical enough, there's literally nothing the keeper could do. Diving for the sake of diving increases his chances of saving by exactly 0%.

272~~~
I agree that you can manage the situation but there wasn't anything he could for the 4th goal today except rush forward. I'm not saying he's perfect or the best in the world, I'm just saying that there was nothing he could do about the 5 today.

273~~~
That term is such tripe that I would not even bother discussing it. But to only label him as "good" isn't right, where he won the player of the year award because he got us out of so much shit. Short term revisionism I feel.

274~~~
No, Neuer dives around and rarley gets lobbed. Last game the keeper went staight from his line and saved Falcaos shot. If he stayed on the line his chances would be worse. Waiting there and giving the player 10 seconds to shoot and pick a spot isnt the solution either.

275~~~
To be honest, my concerns are general long term ones I have had for a while rather than anything specifically related to this game. DDG is not to blame for the defeat - far from it, I'm just making points which I hope he improves on for his sake as well as ours.

276~~~
You cant judge a player from last year. we finished 7th, he was the best of the rest. But comparing him to world class keepers is nonsense too.

277~~~
The situation to save Falcao's shot and the one today couldn't be more different. The angle, the defenders in the area, the space before the attacker receives the ball all factor into the whether or not you should smother, and none of those factors were the same for those two examples.

278~~~
And how are you judging the other goalies then, from 4 matches this season? This is baffling to be honest.

279~~~
One of my favourites, but he should try saving a pen. for a change. He's zero threat to the pen. takers. It did look like he could have done little to nothing about the rest of the goals, though.

280~~~
Some of your opinions of DDG have actually cheered me up. Shifting blame on him after a game like today <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

281~~~
Massive DDG fan but (non) attempt in 1v1 pissed me off, partly because it was a pivotal goal and first time we went behind. One thing letting in a goal, another letting it in without trying. Yes odds are against keepers in 1v1 situations but it's not impossible to come out on top. He did absolutely nothing and if anything made it easier for Vardy.

By contrast, here is Courtois 1v1 against Leicester.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTvE9zPNCMc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

282~~~
Jeez...

283~~~
Incredible, isn't it.

284~~~
I didnt compare the 2 situations, it is just the coming out and letting Falcao having no space and time that matters.

i wont discuss pointless discussions. If De Gea is on Neuers level, that says it all. Of course i compare Ge Gea to Neuer from this season. I compared them the last 5 years, why should i just compare them this season. It is like comparing Welbeck to Falcao. He is not the scapegoat, but he could have saved one. It is not a must to save one, but that is the differnece between good and world class keepers. Still baffled that some think he couldnt have done better than waiting and letting them bang the goals in.

285~~~
Not blaming him at all, but in 1 v 1 situations he should have a plan worked out, by all means stay on your line for a while and then creep quickly but as anyone who has been a striker in that position there's nothing better than seeing the keeper staying on the line. e.g. Welbeck against Neuer last season, Stayed on his line and then charged put him off. 
Not a criticism but lack of a plan is worrying as he may be in that situation a few times more...

He guessed for the first which all goalkeepers do. He guessed correctly for the second but it was a well placed penalty. What else is he supposed to do?

287~~~
This. People were raving about his ball skills for ages. Yet every game he shanks a clearance or two like he did today. He's okay with the ball - nothing more, nothing less.

Still has quite a bit of work to do, which is fine as he's young. But I feel for him. He's barely played in front of a decent, settled defence since the day he arrived here.

He's being tested week in -week out like a 'keeper playing for a bottom six team. He shouldn't need to do as much as he does.

288~~~
Christ <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

289~~~
Obviously it was said in jest. Convenient to ignore the mention that he isn't posing a threat to the pen. takers, eh? Jeez, these people defending players hard, one would think some players are just immune to any criticism.

290~~~
What do you want him to do, keep an AK-47 next to the goalpost?

291~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well, let me put it this way. I'd be comfortable taking a pen. against him than any other top keepers at the moment. He strikes me as the more nervous and anxious of the two - the GK and the striker.

292~~~
It'd be nice if the lad made a save once in a while.

Leicester had five shots on target...

293~~~
I know criticizing de Gea is frowned upon generally, but I've been disappointed with him so far this season. Two goals today that, although I'm not saying he should have saved, he should have done much better. I remember at least one other goal (can't remember if it was Swansea or Sunderland) where he stood there and watched it without making any attempt at a save.

I know he's playing behind a shambles of a back line, but his saves to goals ratio must be one of the worst in the league right now.

294~~~
And were any of them saveable?

295~~~
letting in 4 against MK dons, 5 against Leicester isn't really acceptable for a top level keeper,

I'll put it down to terrible form though and having a nonexistent defence in front of him.

296~~~
Put it this way: he is one of the players I am least concerned about in this situation.

297~~~
Swansea had four shots on target, scored two.
MK Dons had seven shots on target, scored four.
Sunderland had three shots on target, one goal.
Leicester had five shots on target, scored five.

He's kept clean sheets against QPR and Burnley.

It's not a great record.

298~~~
His distribution has gone to whack. Letting in so many goals recently that hasnt been his fault is obviously affecting his confidence. He needs more clean sheets but doubt that is going to happen with our defense and the opposition we will be up against in the next few weeks.

299~~~
I thought he could do better yes, he certainly made much harder saves in his career. He used to have great reflexes and so far this season everything goes in, and he never saves penalties.

Why is he above criticism all of the sudden?

300~~~
His body language makes me lose confidence in him. Not because he doesn't try but because he looks like no matter how many saves he makes he looks like it'll be inevitable before he concedes. 

Some keepers thrive on this and launch tirades at their defenders for letting the shots come in. He isn't that personality.

301~~~
I feel like the last few seasons he started off like this. A bit slow and not being noticed too much, not making mistakes really but not really saving much. Not worried about him because he's a great keeper, we just allow the opposition to have so many clear cut chances and they don't give him much of a chance. 

One thing that I think he needs to improve with is when the opponent is clear through on goal. He rarely ever saves break aways, probably because he doesn't close them down enough or make himself big enough.

302~~~
Great observation - he's way behind the likes of Neuer, Hart and Coutois in this regard.

303~~~
De Gea couldn't do a great deal on today's goals but I agree with the points about his body language - it looks poor and almost self defeatist. This could be influenced by the state of the defensive display in front of him today of course but he did barely move for the goals.

I'm a big DDG fan and I remain committed to the belief that he is the future for us. My concern is that he may be too comfortable at the moment. Last season was an horrendous time, LVG could do with imposing new standards. The thing is, if he had good competition or if LVG could rely on his defence to protect the goalkpeeper more, then we could drop him for a week or 2 like Pellegrini did to Joe Hart and make him fight for the place back. But given our present situation, adding Lindegaard, Amos or Johnson to the frame is just creating more potential problems than it's worth, especially against the physicality of West Ham.

304~~~
Some of the comments in here are actually giving me cancer.

305~~~
Have you seen those goals?

306~~~
You were talking about the Leicester game. Why bring up the others?

How exactly could he have done better? On what goals? 

As for saving penalties he has saved them in the past (both for us and Athletico). People seem to have forgotten that the odds are stacked against the goalkeeper when it comes to penalties.

Who said he is above criticism? Like all our players he is above unfounded criticism. Complaining about his performance today when there was little or nothing he could do about the goals is an example of this.

307~~~
I think some if us though he Is at vds level.
But he is work in progress. VDS could have sort out defence him-self.
There is nothing to blame but nothing to take positive.
The situation is we have bad defense and keeper who is still work I'm progress.
He is not VDS who will boss the defense tell them what to do, and what not.

308~~~
I'll field this one. The two I think he could have done better with are:
First - it was a good header, but it wasn't point blank range and it was at his near post. He didn't dive at all for it. I think this was because he took a step to his right just before the header, either because he was slow to shift himself into position when the cross came in or because he anticipated a header towards the back post. Not saying he would necessarily have saved it if he'd been set properly, but he'd have stood a chance at least as the ball was at a perfect height for the keeper.

Fourth - As Bosnian_red pointed out, one-on-ones are probably his biggest weakness. Part of that is because he lacks the imposing size of other top keepers, but he also doesn't seem to have the decisiveness, certainly at the moment. It could be a confidence thing, but he really ought to be coming all the way out and putting pressure on the striker. Instead he only takes a couple of steps forward and the striker is given plenty of time to just slot it past him.

309~~~
I actually think he could be in trouble, I'm a fan and he is a great shot stopper but I can't help but think the powers that be will decide to get someone in with more presence, more commanding in the box and just more of a bully.

I hope I'm wrong, I hope he steps up, but he seems to lack the confidence to get stuck in to defenders, or wipe a striker out, whilst taking a knock in the process. Ultimately that could be his downfall.

310~~~
Shot stopper... he seems capeable of once every 10 games saving an outrageous shot that he has aboslutely no right to, most games though we have minimal shots against our goal and conceed more than our share.

311~~~
Ok this is getting out of hand here. Some of the posts are mental. He was our best player last season, concedes five goals, none of which are his fault, and all of sudden there is talk of replacing him?! I just give up.

312~~~
World class 'keeper, perhaps he's simply out of form? It can happen.

313~~~
I'm going to pretend there can't possibly be people daft enough to place blame on Dave for today.

He did make a mistake against QPR but he was left defenceless today. Catch a grip some of you.

314~~~
Guys, making some brilliant saves isnt the criteria to be world class. When I even look at keepers like Adrian, they also make them. Or even Kasper makes a lot of brilliant saves, but its just far more to that. If some saw Courtois today, the way he sets up his defence, his dominance, his calmness, his distribution, thats what makes a world class keeper, not just the spectacular saves. De Gea is in terms of saves maybe the best/most spectacular keeper, but I would be crying for Cech.

315~~~
Looking at it again, he should do a lot more for the first goal and at least fecking try and dive. He can clearly see that Uchoa is free from markers and is going to get a header in on goal. React, man.

316~~~
No blame, but he does lack presence and was slow off the line for the 4th goal. As soon as Mata slipped it was obvious it was going to end in a 1 on 1, and he stuck to his line, applying no pressure to the striker.  

Needs to man up a bit and he will be fine.

317~~~
Wow, it seems to some that because he hasn't got the presence of a Neuer and is not a penalty specialist that he's pretty shit.

318~~~
I'm not saying he's been found culpable for any of the goals against this season but he doesn't seem to be saving much either

Other than against RVP has he ever saved a pen for us?

319~~~
If only he tried to save those penalties insted of just staying and not moving.. Oh wait..

It's astonishing how many kneejerk reactions people have here about DDG.

320~~~
Wow, it seems that if you criticize a player for having a bad game (even though he's usually almost world class) you're being blasphemous on this forum....

321~~~
My biggest concern is whether he's up to the job of organising the back four. The keeper should be constantly talking and making sure everyone knows their job. Hard to be certain on Tv but he seems a bit quiet. 

That and his slight indecision about coming off his line are the two areas he most needs to work on. I've always maintained he's nowhere near as good as he's portrayed on here (being called the best keeper in the league ffs) but he is yong and lernin.

322~~~
vs Sunderland.

323~~~
He has played behind some terrible defending in his time at the club.

Not worried about him personally, but you can't hide the fact 2 teams have put 4 and 5 goals passed him already this season.

The balance of the team needs to be adjusted again to stop the goals leaking.

324~~~
I've thought DDG has been overated on here for a while, just can't ever try and bring up a point without people jumping on you.
It's actually a fair point in my eyes, does he have any enough presence ? does he command his box enough yet? he seem rooted to his line too often in general and I can't for the life of me work out how he seems to have no chance on so many chances.

325~~~
Out of form possibly but needs a settled back four in front of him to get an understanding together. Schmeichel and van der Sar benefited massively from this.

Of course, with our injuries, we can't get that settled back four. It's a big problem.

326~~~
He might not be conceding goals that are his fault but there have been a few goals this season that he has conceded in which he should have done better. He hasn't anticipated the shots well. Could have saved the first goal today. Could have made saves against MK Dons. Could have saved Swansea's 2nd. Wardy never looked like missing when he went on through.

DDG is definitely not in top form at the moment.

327~~~
Maybe if he didn't have a different back four-five every single match due to our defenders being either injured or complete flops it would be easier, I hardly remember people complaining about him being quiet when Vidić/Rio were there.

I really hoped some of the bullshit spouted here would stop when everybody is chilled but apparently not ( not aimed at you Pogue ).

328~~~
Last year he was argubally the best GK in the league Pogue and the only competition was Begavic and Cech.

329~~~
DDG's supporters are saying that he hasn't had a chance with a lot of the goals conceded and that's true to a large degree. However, to be a truly world class 'keeper, you need to make saves that are out of the ordinary - the ones that bail your team out. At the moment, unless it's a completely routine stop, it's a goal. It's disconcerting how frequently the ball is hitting the net and DDG isn't moving.

The only game he's come out of with any major credit was Burnley, otherwise he's been very disappointing.

330~~~
Maybe you should look at the goals.

He's been overrated?

My god...

Its not that people are jumping on people who criticise him, its people criticising him for ridiculous reasons. 
Suddenly he regressed and he's not that good....

And also he's gulty of not organising defense in front of him, some say. 

 different defense every game doesn't help him exactly nor does defense in general and how they're playing atm.

331~~~
I don't think this can be underestimated. We need a settled back four. Without this we'll always be inconsistent back there. Look at two of Fergie's best teams, a number of midfielders/attackers rotated but Bruce & Pallister/Ferdinand & Vidic were constant. Until we get that consistency, we've got a problem and so has De Gea.

332~~~
You knew from the moment Vardy was through it was a goal. He's a great keeper but he needs to strap on a pair and actually make it difficult for a striker one on one.

333~~~
To be honest, you can trace our newfound shambolic defending back to the retirement of VdS. Obviously, it's possible that Rio and Vidic both went to shit at precisely that moment but we've racked up an unfeasible number of defensive horror shows since the big Dutch man hung up his gloves. I don't think that's a coincidence. 

Mind you, De Gea is far better than Ed was at the same age and his skills as a leader and organiser will improve, year on year. He's clearly still a bit green though. Which is bad news when our central defence is also a work in progress.

334~~~
Ah I remember the good old days when people wanted us to buy Begović and dump DDG. 

It seems those days will happen again.

335~~~
Look at the goals again, you think I base my opinion on 1 game? or expected him to magically save penaltys today?
And yes, Overrated on here, "best goalkeeper in the league" every other post on him, he's not.

336~~~
I think you're overreacting.

Who's better in the league if we dont count Curtois who is better atm?

337~~~
He isnt, de Gea isnt the best goalkeeper in the league, Cech, Neuer, arguably Lloris are better.

338~~~
I agree. He hesitates to come forward and he's often rooted to his spot. We've got a young, inexperienced keeper and an average, injury prone, dare I even say shite defence. It's a lethal combination that will cost us top 4 this season.

not to mention the defensive part of our midfield....ffs future is looking bleak

339~~~
Bayern Munich plays in Bundesliga. 

Cech is better? 
Lloris? 


I'm done here.

340~~~
This is the most idiotic thing I think. We're expecting our Spanish goalkeeper to be some kind of a leader and organiser ( after all, he's a part of the defence formation, right ? ) when we've got 3 'senior' CBs who are English speaking and all three look as if they were retarded. Not able to to organise or leader anything. I wouldn't let them carry my baby because they're so fecking unreliable.

341~~~
Sorry, I meant Courtois.

Yeah you can say Lloris but he is ridiculously underrated here. Like many Spurs players.

342~~~
Jones could be the leader, if he wasn't made of glass.

343~~~
Curtois is better. 

Chech and Lloris certainly arent better. 

Lloris is an all right keeper, nothing more.

344~~~
Spot on, I don't remember any of our keepers being yelled at even by Vidic or Ferdinand who are vocal, and today he had Evans giving him bollocks. 

Also, he is shit at defending penalties, he would be better if he just stays on the middle and hope they will try panenka because he looks like he'll never save one.

345~~~
He's genuinely up there with the best young players in the world.

346~~~
Evans is always giving him bollocks.... 
Its his thing, his angry face and looking pissed while playing awful. Maybe he hopes nobody will notice it if he yells at DDG.

347~~~
Lloris is actually a very decent keeper, the number of games you watch Spuds and he routinely bails them out sweeping up behind their back line is quite significant.
DeGea clearly is a talented young keeper but there's much more you'd like for him to improve upon, did anyone today have any hope when taxidriver went through 1v1 today that DDG would do anything other than stand there half heartedly and be beaten.

348~~~
Cech is better, dont know how you can say he isnt. Cech has far more to offer.

349~~~
Cech who is Chelsea's 2nd choice and has been average for 2 or 3 years now? 

All right, whatever.

350~~~
I believe he could have done better in the first and the third goal. In both occasions, the moment Ulloa's header and Cambiasso's shot are attempted, he is making a little side step towards the middle of his post. This is bad positioning and it doesn't give him the opportunity to react on time. 

But i have seen worse, there's no need to overreact. For instance Courtois could have saved City's goal today and please don't tell me you'd prefer someone like Mignolet or Szczesny. When he starts conceding goals on the corner he has covered, like Cech, then start worrying.

De Gea isn't overrated, he is one of the best goalkeepers around when he's on his line and he is trying to improve the other aspects of his game. Right now he happens to be out of form, but that could be said for the majority of our players. Once we manage to deploy the same back four for more than 2 or three games in a row, i believe the communication between the defenders and the goalkeeper will start getting better and better and we will look more confident at the back.

351~~~
Cech average for 2 or 3 years? He is Chelsea's second choice pure because they have Courtois, the 2nd best goalkeeper in the world. De Gea would have been third if he was at Chelsea.

352~~~
Cech was fantastic last season.

353~~~
You havent been watching Cech and DDG a lot in recent years havent you. Or you're just kneejerking after today's game.

Whatever it is this conversation doesnt make any sense.

354~~~
Seems to have regressed a fair bit since this time last season. He was very lucky not to cost us a goal against QPR last weekend when he ran out and confused Rojo. I don't think he's going to grow any more so he'll never be dominant in the air the way Courtois or Neuer are so he needs to make up for that with his shot stopping and pace off his line.

355~~~
The guy above you says the same, Cech average? How can you even say that, the only thing in which DDG beats him are spectacular saves, apart from them ddg has a lot to learn to be on the same level as Cech.

356~~~
Wov if the guy above me says the same that must be it then... 

Cech on his day was one of the best in the world. He hasnt been in that kind of form for a while now.

357~~~
So we are having a go a DDG cause he didn't save 2 penalties, a 1on 1, a perfect placed header with power and an unstoppable strike? And have also decided cause of this Cech and Lloris are better? Hahaha I think I'll stay away from this tread.

358~~~
Yup. Mental, just mental.

359~~~
Welcome to 2011 everybody.

360~~~
Yeah it's a joke, we have so many problems, but talking about our goalkeeper, who was our best player in the last 2 seasons and saved our ass with ridiculous saves all the time. But hey he didn't do anything spectacular this season and he didn't save penalties, so blame him for our shit defence, makes sense^^

361~~~
No welcome to the Caf.

362~~~
De Gea was better
Also it's not his fault the defence in front of him is awful and been rotated every single game, Take De Gea out of our team and we are far worse. Move on the problem in the team is not De Gea

363~~~
I'd say they were both around a similar level last season and were among the best GK's in the league.

While the defence has been average and it's rotation doesn't help DDG in the slightest, as I've already stated in this thread, DDG isn't immune to criticism and if people don't feel he's performing at his very best then they'll say so. It's not a massive problem at the moment, but people are entitled to state their opinion on him nevertheless.

364~~~
No you have the right to your opinion but there is 7 or more positions on the pitch that should be criticized before De Gea, also he didn't even make a mistake today his defenders let him down he faced 2 pens and a one on one for the 4th, he deserves better players protecting him. Jones is the only player capable and he is injured, Also found it weird that Shaw wasn't LB and Rojo CB

365~~~
I'm a massive De Gea fan, but he isn't playing as well as he could be, regardless of how bad the back four is playing or who they are. I don't really re call him saving a lot so far this year, apart from the Burnley game, which is strange as his stop stopping is normally excellent. I guess it has a lot to do with confidence though, and conceding so many goals already is not going to help.

366~~~
Watching MOTD now. Poor goalkeeping for their fourth. Had so much time to close the angle and was still at the edge of his 6 yard box when the goal went in. Schoolboy error really.

367~~~
Have to agree. He's been pretty shite this season. Immobile and his kicking has been piss poor. Can't seem to make a save when needed at the moment either.

368~~~
Have to admit I don't think he's been very good recently. He's primarily a shot stopper so it's understandable that commanding his area and aerial ability isn't the strongest part of his game however he would usually stop a shot that he has no right getting to and it was all rosy. Recently though I can't think of many things on target that haven't gone in. Not necessarily that there have been any clangers that he should definitely have saved but as a fantastic shot stopper it's disappointing that he hasn't seemingly made many great saves for awhile. He's been fantastic for a few seasons so it's understandable to have a dip in form, just hope he gets back quick.

369~~~
How could he have saved the first? Even the commentator was saying he had no chance. It was a powerful header just inside the post. No keeper would have saved that.

370~~~
Agree that he did nothing wrong today. What was missing from him is that goalkeepers are the last line of defence when all else fails, so you look for a keeper of his calibre to do something special now and then.

371~~~
Exactly my thinking too (which was shot down earlier in the thread). I agree with you though, was too stationary. I think he is out of form, which happens and is understandable. The defence in front of him is exposing him too much though.

372~~~
You guys must be fecking kidding <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

373~~~
This is gold <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

374~~~
Crazy posts <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

375~~~
He's not very good at saving penalties is he? I can only remember him saving one

Not a massive criticism, he's very good at pretty much everything else.

376~~~
Basically this. Schmeichel played behind defenders that were full of leaders - Bruce, Irwin and Neville were all part of our leadership group while Schmeichel was here, and Pallister, Stam and Johnsen were hardly shirkers. Van der Sar played behind Neville (captain), Vidic (captain), Ferdinand (vice captain), and Evra (vice captain) while he was here. 

At the moment the closest we've got to anyone with any guts in defence is Rafael, and he's far from a leader at the back.

377~~~
De Gea and Immobile in the same sentence is essentially an oxymoron.

But this is the Caf, so..

378~~~
This.

I would also say that his distribution needs to improve, especially when he plays the long ball. Its fine when he passes to the back-4, but the quality of his long passes really declines when under pressure.

379~~~
Well he has been. I'm not saying that's a trait but you can't deny he was static for a couple of the goals yesterday, notably the fourth and his kicking has been indifferent. He's off form but seemingly no excuse for it as I don't think he was all that good in pre-season IMO.

380~~~
Priceless......

381~~~
Thank you for this. You've provided terrific insight into why you think I was wrong <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

382~~~
This is what I was hinting at yesterday. It may have been masked with Vidic and Evra in front of him, but he doesnt seem to be vocal or have much presence. And with the state of our current defense its not helping.

383~~~
DDG was poor for the fourth - sure, Varney would probably have scored regardless as it's an open 1 vs. 1 - but DDG really didn't do much in ways to prevent him from scoring (I mean, for a start, he was nowhere near him when he actually shot.)

384~~~
He was standing on the edge of the frigging six yard box as Varney approached, one on one. I said schoolboy error earlier on and I stand by that. If a 12 year old keeper was that slow of his line he'd get a bollocking. Really simple stuff.

I have a nagging suspicion that he's not the bravest, physically. When did you last see him sliding in where it hurts? Look at this. Same opposition, same situation. See how far out Courtois is when he makes the save. That's a proper keeper, right there.

Compare and contrast.

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/O7mhE0dJq2Q/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

385~~~
He's been hesitant a lot lately. I thought he was developing more confidence at coming out of his goal. Not saying he should have saved any of the goals yesterday but he needed to try close the angle for the 4th as it looked far too easy.

386~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

387~~~
Dave used to save.

388~~~
You know, I was thinking about that save from Nugent at the time yesterday - but to be fair, there was so much wrong with that 4th goal (Smalling originally charging up field, least I think he did, Rojo not having any awareness for what was behind him and also charging up field, Mata for giving the ball away cheaply, Blackett taking up a ridiuclous position, and DDG not being quick enough to close down the shot/do anything in particular).

It's one of the worst goals we've conceded for quite sometime I reckon - and that's saying something.

389~~~
Yeah, it was horrendous stuff all round.

I am very worried about De Gea's form though. The last fecking thing we need is a timid, out of form keeper to add to all our other woes. 

I suspect he's going to be seeing a lot of action in the coming weeks/months and if he keeps up his current ratio of shots/saves we're in serious trouble.

390~~~
I said to few of my mates yesterday it seems like a fear of getting sent off or something. The Courtois save you posted above he's basically going all out for doing it. Potentially running the risk of a red card or looking like a bit of an idiot by rushing out (if it doesn't come off) but he's confident in himself that none of them will happen. The De Gea attempt above is poor it's like he's not even bothered to try and get it...I thought it was perhaps due to the feck up with Rojo last week, maybe he's not to confident to rush out again after that. Again it's all speculation and no one actually knows, it's probably over analysis really to be honest.

It's funny how de Gea gets leapt to the defence of so much though, no one is suggesting he's an awful keeper by any stretch of the imagination. Most the time the replies don't even counter argue anything it seems just say stuff like "haha...laughable" the guy isn't immune to criticism. Go to previous seasons and everyone was seemingly obsessed with saying "If de Gea did that..." for every single Hart mistake. I'd hazard a guess that if Joe Hart made such a feeble attempt for that goal as de Gea did there'd be a few comments taking the piss of him on here.

391~~~
I am coming to the conclusion that actually, he isn't a very good keeper.

There's a good chance that he's just learning a lot at the moment and struggles to adapt. He never played behind a high line before and was never involved as much as van Gaal demands from him. A horrendous defense in front of him makes it all even more difficult. Frans Hoek is an excellent goalkeeping coach and de Gea is way too talented to struggle longterm, it just takes a bit of time. It's not surprising that his form drops, that his decision making and positioning is far from perfect during that transition, maybe even worse than before for a while. As long as van Gaal and Frans Hoek believe in him and back him up, it's no problem and he'll develop into an overall excellent goalkeeper. While he was an incredible shotstopper in the past 2 years, his overall game was always a bit overrated on the caf, but I really wouldn't worry about him and his development. He'll come back even stronger.

393~~~
you're coming to a stupid conclusion then.

394~~~
That's hardly the greatest counter argument in the world.

He is slow off his line, doesn't command his box has virtually zero communication with his defenders and is not particularly brave.

I don't think he reads the game particularly well either.

I am sure these are things he can address in the long term.

395~~~
He was our player of the season last year and in the PFA team of the year the season before, he's also only 23 and most GK's don't peak til they're at least 27/28. It's a ridiculous conclusion to come to based off the fact that he's had a poor start to the season. A young player going through a bad spell of form, what a shocker.

396~~~
DDG has been flat-footed on a lot of the goals we have conceded. He seems to leave a lot of the shots close to the post. At least make an effort. He's not really had chance to prove his worth so far this season as he's been exposed heavily to be fair.

397~~~
All those saying he couldn't save any goals yesterday are wrong

At fault for the 4th no doubt

Didn't attempt to save the 1st 

He doesn't look capable of saving a penalty 

Whichever way you look at it if a team has 5 shots on target and the keeper lets all 5 in that's not acceptable at any Level.

398~~~
We shall see.

399~~~
I've disagreed with <a class="username" data-user="60671, @Ducklegs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/60671/">@Ducklegs</a> about a lot of stuff before but share his concerns on this one. His specific criticisms are all completely valid IMO. As he says, though, De Gea can address them in the long term but that's really not ideal.

I mean, De Gea might be yong and lernin but goalkeeper is one position where sticking with someone through a learning curve can really feck a team over. Look at Tim Howard. I'd say he's arguably a better keeper than De Gea is right now but when he was much younger, Fergie got rid because he knew we couldn't carry a keeper who was still learning the game.

400~~~
What does it mean to look like not being able to save a pen ?

401~~~
It means feck all.

Although it's all part of the bigger picture. He lacks presence. Top keepers make the goal look small and penalties that much more difficult to score. De Gea - on this seasons form - makes the goals look big and penalties never in doubt.

402~~~
I honestly think he is capable of much better. Even before the game i was watching us doing drills and Falcao and Di Maria put a few past De Gea and his lack of effort for any shots on target were very disheartening. Read somewhere a while back that when fergie was here he had a promblem with his visual (maybe bull) but could this actually be his problem, i say this as this is the only plausable reason to me as to why he seems to makes no effort to attempt some saves. To him they look like they are going wide maybe? Could his short/ long sight be at fault. He always seems a second or two too late, maybe just me. Its hard to believe that the reason De Gea is conceding so many is because our opposition are putting worldies past him weekly.

403~~~
On this particular point, I noticed this last season, I think there was a deliberate change in approach to how he'd been previously. He also worked with a new GK coach and I wondered whether this was a specific instruction that he'd received?

404~~~
Probably my favorite player, but he's been average at best this season. Sure, some will say he was not at fault at any of the goals and maybe they are correct, but I expect better from a top GK.

Also looks dodgy coming out of his line and that is essential in our new setup, he was very lucky last game when he fecked it up at 1-0 and could have cost us.

He's already shipped in more than 2 goals/game this season and he needs to step up his game. I genuinely can't think of a top save he made this season.

405~~~
I can see the concerns but he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

With so much uncertainty on front of him the constant changing of centre halves it cant be easy. Add in a new manager with a totally different mind-set on what a keepers role should be. Plus yet another new goalkeeping coach.

That's enough for me to forgive anything I see for the moment.

there's a thread in the newbies saying he should be dropped in favour of Lindergard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

406~~~
Yeah, those are valid excuses for him to be below his best.

I haven't been entirely convinced by him before, though. Even last season when he was generally very good, I wasn't happy with some aspects of his game. Particularly his footwork and apparent reluctance to come of his line. Everyone spent so much time taking the piss out of Joe Hart, it was as though De Gea can do no wrong. Ditto Chesney at Arsenal.

Meanwhile, there's been a whole bunch of games where those two have pulled off a string of top saves and been the difference between winning and losing for their teams. If we're really honest to ourselves, how many games can we think of in the last two seasons where that could describe a performance from De Gea? One? Two? And it's not as though he's not been seeing much of the ball. IMO there's been a worrying amount of games where we've conceded a lot of goals, from relatively few shots at our goal*. And that's not even getting into the lack of organisation throughout our defence.




*Some stats from last season on saves/shots.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.barriesview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/premier-league-2013-14-save-percentage.png" src="http://www.barriesview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/premier-league-2013-14-save-percentage.png"/> 

Dave doesn't even make the top 10.

407~~~
Did he make a save yesterday?

408~~~
More stats, again from last season. Number of saves/goal conceded.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.barriesview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/premier-league-2013-14-saves-per-goal-conceded.png" src="http://www.barriesview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/premier-league-2013-14-saves-per-goal-conceded.png"/>

Again, not in the top 10.

In fact, his highest finish in all those stats is a table where the lower down you finish the better!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.barriesview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/premier-league-2013-14-long-shots-conceded.png" src="http://www.barriesview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/premier-league-2013-14-long-shots-conceded.png"/>





<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.barriesview.com/2014/05/premier-league-2013-14-goalkeeper-stats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Link</a>

409~~~
Useless stats without any context.

Some of the players on there are gash as well.

410~~~
Our defense is a shambles and has been for 3 years now. Mourinho bought P. Luis - who was part of Europe's best defense last season - but hardly plays him. This way Courtois can get use to the same back 4, and an experienced and much better one than ours, too. While our defenders always are in and out through injuries, are on top of that young and actually not that good. Then we keep changing formations AND LvG wants him to play in a completely different way than Moyes did last season.

So as bad as he has been, he has the best excuses for his performance. Give him Chelsea's defense and Mourinho's defensive organisation and you won't see 5 goals conceded against a promoted team!

411~~~
So now we reached a point, where we are rewriting history and are saying that De Gea's last 2 seasons weren't brilliant? And I hate stats, they are so useless without any context and can't replace what we all see on the pitch. How can someone say that he saved our ass in only 2 games? Come on. Why did they vote him best goalkeeper in the PL 2 seasons ago? And he would be a good candidate last year too, if we wouldn't have finish 7th imo. Also the biggest difference between Dave and for example Hart or Chesny is that Dave did barely any big mistakes the last 2 seasons. Give me a stat for that, Hart and Chesny would be on top of the table in a "silly mistake" list. Dave did what? That one mistake in the Carling Cup. Even someone like Courtois made more howlers than him.

412~~~
History is in the eye of the beholder and I personally thought De Gea wasn't brilliant last season. Lots of posts in this thread from me saying exactly that. By no means poor and a lot of good performances. Especially a big improvement under the high ball. He did have his flaws though and I genuinely struggle to think of many games we won where you could point to a string of good saves from De Gea being the difference between winning and losing. Maybe a couple, at most.

413~~~
Goalkeeper is probably the position where stats are of the least use in judging a players performance.

In fact I'd go as far as to say that stats are of absolutely zero use whatsoever in judging a goalkeeper.

That said, he's definitely regressed a bit, probably due to a complete lack of confidence in the people in front of him.

414~~~
Here's a context. They're all from competitive games played against Premier League opposition.

415~~~
Agree with your first sentence, disagree with the second.

Saves/shot is about as useful as pass completion or chance conversion IMO. Doesn't tell you everything about a player but if you have a player with stats that are significantly worse than his peers, it is cause for concern. Especially if you're analysing data from an entire season's worth of games.

I also think you can forgive a low save % if you know the keeper makes up for it with other aspects of his game. Controlling his area, distribution, organisation, ability to act as a sweeper when his team plays a high line. None of these are things you would say De Gea is particularly strong at. If anything, the opposite. Which is grand if he was a brilliant shot-stopper but - according to these stats - he's not as good a shot-stopper as we might think.

416~~~
I have to agree with Pogue that last season people were so busy taking the piss out of Joe Hart that suddenly De Gea could do no wrong.
The idea that people had for ages that Joe Hart is woeful at kicking, while De Gea is some sort of ball-playing king, for example.

When I've seen De Gea shank at least one simple roll-back and/or punt it off the pitch almost every game.

417~~~
To be fair Hart was making mistakes that was costing City points before he initially got dropped. De Gea didn't do that which is why he completely ousted Lindegaard to the number 1 spot. 

I think there are right to be concerns over De Gea, the most valid point is that he hasn't been a great "matchwinner" in the past couple of years. However having stable defence which we haven't had for 3 years now is much more of a bigger concern.

418~~~
An outfield player has far more control over his pass completion stats than a keeper does over his saves/shots stats, though. 

As I said I'm not arguing that he's regressed, but the stats won't show you how woefully exposed he's been the last season and a bit.

419~~~
To be fair, it's not as obvious a statistic as it might first seem. Considering how many of our goals come from opportunities where strikers find themselves in a position where they'd be foolish to miss.

Our defence is constantly leaving DDG in one on one situations and his statistics are going to be heavily skewed by that.

420~~~
Aye, that's true but again it's a big sample size. We're so used to being in the top four we do kind of forget that 7th isn't that bad. As you can see, De Gea's stats are a lot worse than a number of keepers from 8th place and lower. I doubt they got much more protection. Plus Moyes was hammered for his negativity. It's not as though we played gung ho football with a really high line and loads of wide open spaces at the back (which, to be fair, does seem to be happening this season).

421~~~
The long shots conceded are particularly misleading, because our lack of any coherent midfield gave the opposition endless opportunities to take their time and pick out the perfect spot in the net.

You give a Premiership footballer time on the ball and there won't be much the keeper can do a lot of the time.

422~~~
Is that unique to our defence? What about the 12 clubs who did worse than us in the league last season? Were they really protecting their keepers that much better than we did?

423~~~
Stats didn't show us much here, because the defence affect those statistics. You can't blame De Gea when he save several shots and then conceded a goal because our defence did a horrible mistake. If De Gea saves 20 out of 40 shots, he is much worse than Cech, who saved 3 out of 4. And I don't even know how shots, who didn't need a save, affect those stats. But the main difference is just that Chelsea had a good defence in front of him, where Cech has not much to do and De Gea is/was in consistent trouble. Minutes without a goal are nice, but in most cases it's more a sign for a fantastic defence than a brilliant goalkeeper imo. 
Mignolet is another example who is completely missing on those lists, but while he is awful so far this season, he wasn't last year, but like United Pool's defence was horrible, even worse than ours, so again not a surprise that he can't look good in those stats.

424~~~
Shots that aren't on target don't count. 

I think Mignolet is a bit crap actually. Not good enough for a team with aspirations of winning the league. Can see him being moved on soon enough.

425~~~
I'm not saying it's unique to us, I'm just saying that you have to take into consideration the type of goal we always seem to concede. It's an equivalent argument to what you had about Assist's vs Goals stats.

If you have Ronaldo or Messi on the end of your passes, you'll get more assists.

Well if a higher percentage of the shots on target come from gifts from our defence where the attacker has time to put a good shot away, then the keeper will have less chance of saving them and their saves/shots ratio will reflect that.


Come on Pogue, you of all people are surely not going to argue that a statistic is telling the whole truth?

426~~~
Not a fan of these kind of stats personally. If one looks at the top half, it's full of some truly awful keepers. I mean - Boruc, Adrian, Speroni really ?

A much better comparison for De Gea would be Thibaut Courtois from this season (because they're of about the same age and stage in their progression) or Petr Cech from last season (who is the benchmark for keepers in the league despite the relative decline in his ability). We have to look at bulk saves. Saves/ goal conceded is misleading because it's not just the keeper's responsibility. Yeah superficially it kind of is but the whole defense if not the whole team has to shoulder the blame, a keeper can only do so much.

In 5 league games this season De Gea and Courtois have made an identical 1.4 saves per game compared to 1.53 per game for Cech last season. De Gea also has deceptively good distribution compared to them. It's 71 % for David this season, 54 % for Courtois and 60 % for Cech last season.

De Gea is getting used to a new system right now, both Van Gaal and Hoek are fans of cerebral training and controlling spaces. Prior to this season David was used to Rio and Vida sitting deep and he had to resort to punts as a means of expansive distribution. This has changed with Hoek who wants him to be like his former proteges Van der Sar and Valdes, a goalkeeper yes but almost an outfield player who's comfortable with the ball at his feet. De Gea has to unlearn a lot of what he was taught through the last 3 seasons and that is a time consuming process. This leads to uncertainty because it's kind of alien to him and what Steele/ Wood professed has become second nature to him. Once he does imbibe everything we'll see a much better keeper who'll far exceed the De Gea of 2012/ 2013, which for me was his peak so far.

People are also forgetting that he's just 23, a bambi of the goalkeeping world. Very few top clubs have such young keepers because there's a massive maturation curve. De Gea is going through it right now and will get over the relative bumps. It's unfair to compare him to our past keepers in terms of leadership ability. Schmeichel was almost 30 when we signed him and Van der Sar was almost 35. Even some of the greats including Edwin (endured a horror time at Juventus behind Buffon) and Casillas (dropped in favor of Sanchez) went through it.

427~~~
Not at all. This is the same way I always use stats. I make my own opinion clear, then try to see if the stats fit in with what I've noticed.

If they do, I think my opinion carries a little more weight (not much but definitely a little). If they don't, I might start to question it. Ultimately, though, it's my opinion that's the main thing when I'm talking about how highly I rate any player. Of course, my opinion (and yours) is likely to be just as flawed as any of these stats!

428~~~
Well, exactly. Now I'm sure you don't need reminding who has had more opportunities to make a save?

429~~~
In fairness to De Gea, even considering that, there's not a massive difference. David has 0.9 per goal conceded and Courtois has 1.1. So it's a really fine margin, despite Courtois playing behind a more composed defense that doesn't poo its undies at the sight of every counter.

430~~~
That's interesting. Had to check how many goals Chelsea have conceded this season. Had no idea the two totals were so similar. They've only conceded one less goal than we have. Which is a bit mad really. Very un-Mourinho.

Of course, the tiny sample size in terms of games played makes comparing stats from this season a bit pointless.

431~~~
Dunno why you're bringing up Mignolet as an example. He had a few good months but was terrible from Christmas onwards. It's no surprise to see him rank poorly in those lists, though I'm surprised by de Gea.

432~~~
Have a strong feeling come April or May he will be turning in a transfer request for summer 2015.

433~~~
Im a big fan of David but maybe there has been a reason the club are holding out on his new deal after all,  I agree with the people who say it seems like a lack of interest from him, The fourth goal yesterday I was shocked at how static he was, reminded me of when we played City a few years back (the drubbing) and it was similar in that instead of closing the angles down like Van Der Saar or Schmeichel would of he just stood barely from his line giving the striker acres to choose a target from. I don't know if that he is slightly timid to want to do that but he is going to have learn to exert himself more because his current form is slightly concerning, it appears he is confident in his English language speaking now so that can't even be used as an excuse anymore either. Big few months for Dave coming up, LVG says no player is guaranteed a place and that will apply to De Gea also

434~~~
Agreed.

435~~~
Not hugely at fault for the 4th as Rojo, Blackett and Smalling take the bulk of the blame, but he should make it more difficult for Vardy. I think I probably would've scored that if it was me through on goal.

The other goals I have no issues but just too easy for the 4th. 

I didn't think de Gea performed well against MK Dons either. He's not made any blunders which is good but I'm still confident he will pick up his form.

436~~~
I am of the impression recently that he does not let in bad goals, but his inability to stop anything that is a good shot on goal, great goalkeepers all have this ability

437~~~
Seems very happy though? You can tell that just by looking at some of his tweets.

438~~~
Probably won't be leaving but who knows really? 

Maybe he wants to go back to athletic seen as though they are on the up now with great players and great young manager.

Real Madrid need a new keeper too Casillas isn't getting any younger and navas is really a rotation keeper not a number 1. Don't think he'll go being an athletic boy but who knows?. Surely for any spanish youth player barca and real are the "dream".

439~~~
Just another example for a keeper who could do what he want and still wouldn't look good in those lists because of the defence in front of him. And I don't think he was overall that terrible, he wasn't good at the end of the season and he is terrible this season so far. But he had a good first half at Pool imo and wasn't really a problem overall last year. This season he is and will be soon replaced if he continues like that.

440~~~
He must be low on confidence, any keeper conceding 5 would be. Confident he will turn it around once what is ahead of him improves

441~~~
Because it wasn't that far from him. From the direction the ball was coming and the way the attacker was standing it was highly likely that the ball was going to end up where it did. I'm not faulting him for the goal. It was an example of a goal he's conceded this season that he could have saved. He hasn't done a lot of saving this season.

Even the commentator said? I'm sorry but what the commentator says doesn't matter at all.

442~~~
And De Gea also had the fewest mistakes leading to goals.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/j42IvlMRV8cWJ.png" src="http://i.minus.com/j42IvlMRV8cWJ.png"/>

443~~~
When was the last time Dave saved a penalty? Honestly every time the opponent gets one I feel it's a nailed on goal. 



I feel bad critiicizing him because he's one of my favourite players but still.

444~~~
Saved two penalties vs Sunderland in January. Before that was in the 8-2 vs Arsenal (in his defence we didn't concede a PL penalty in 12/13).

445~~~
Thats my take on him, basically, everytime there's any type of half decent shot against our goal these days I think it's in, he also still seems glued to his line far too often for my liking,
No he doesn't make horrendous mistakes but so often I feel like he could be doing more, much more in order to keep hold this "best keeper in the PL" tag  he seems to have picked up on here.

This is the first time I've felt like I could actually say something slightly negative on DDG without 100 Caf fanboi's (for lack of a better term, apologies in advance for any offense it may cause) instantly jumping down my throat.

446~~~
I have a suspicion that he could be more vocal in organizing the defence but, beyond that, I don't think he's done much wrong this season. Solid goalkeeper.

That said, this is someone we like to think is maybe the best in the PL and one of the best in the world. Being "solid" isn't quite good enough, is it?

So yeah, hopefully he improves as the season goes on. It would be particularly nice if he could learn how to save penalties...

447~~~
His weight was going the other way and the ball was headed back across him. It could have been glanced towards the far corner so it wasn't obvious where the ball was going to go. With the power on the header it was past him so quick that it was impossible for him to move his feet and dive back in the direction opposite to which he was moving.

The commentators opinion doesn't matter at all? Why is that? I can just as easily say that what you say doesn't matter at all. No offence but I would be more inclined to listen to someone whose job involves football than you.

448~~~
He reminds me of Cillessen, 20 penalties and hasnt saved one. I dont know his penalty statistics, but it reflects his confidence overall. On another note, what happened to the deal with Romero? Maybe we will be back for him in Januray, De Gea needs some serious competition, even though i dont rate the guy.

449~~~
Here's a theory: De Gea's shot stopping has regressed due to working so much on the other areas of his game and piling on some muscle. He's vastly improved in those areas in recent years. He still sticks to his line a bit too much for my liking because that's the kind of keeper he's always been. However aerially and in general reliability he's come on leaps and bounds. That mixup in the QPR game was the first real mistake I can recall from him for ages.

We must remember he's still only 23 which is absolutely no age for a keeper. I imagine he's working more now on becoming more of a sweeper keeper as such a high defensive line really demands it. Eventually he'll be a great well rounded keeper. I do think the bread and butter shot stopping ability has taken a back seat though and he doesn't seem to stop many decent shots from going in which leave you thinking "Feck me, how has he done that?" these days. He was pulling them out every couple of weeks at one point.

Period of poor form. Still Developing. Will be good in the short term when he rediscovers his form. Will be great in the long term.

450~~~
Okay, now how about context in terms of which of these shots are actually saveable? The players taking these shots? The defence in front of him? Manchester United as a defensive unit? Stats won't tell you this.

451~~~
A goood keeper needs good defenders. People can't expect him to save shots that shouldn't have even happened every game and keep us in it.

452~~~
I said it first and I'd say it again. Should either tell Evans or Rafael to pick up the only Leicester player in the box for the first goal. 

We just have no leaders at the back.

453~~~
When he first joined us he went through a phase where he seemed hesitant, a less effective player than he'd been at Atletico the year before. I put it down to him learning a new system of play, in effect he was overriding his instincts to try and follow instructions.

It feels like it's happening again now. He's more experienced so he's less likely to make a mistake, but he's also not quite trusting his instincts, so he's that bit slower and the miracle saves aren't happening either. Of course a lot of it's down to having a bunch of ever-changing strangers in front of him. I know some would argue that he should be organising them, but that doesn't work if he's having to think about his own positioning.

I do wonder if he's one of the players who has suffered by changing coaches three times in 18 months. Some parts of his game improved last year (like claiming the ball) but others regressed (like distribution). It might take a couple more moths before it all comes together again, but I'm an optimist, I think he'll end up stronger.

454~~~
Wasn't providing you with anything other than it's a view of no value.

455~~~
He saved one from Van Persie in the famous 8:2. I don't think that he saved another one for us.

456~~~
I always thought DDG has gotten off lightly on this forum relative to almost every other player.  I think he's been great over the past few seasons at not making big and obvious mistakes.  HOWEVER, as people seem to be noting especially after Leicester, he has never really seemed to me to pull off the big game-saving stops.  I mean how many times did Van Der Sar come up with BIG saves in BIG games that probably SHOULD have been goals?  I remember plenty.  On the other hand, especially last season, despite the poor results, we actually dominated possession most games only to be pipped by a counterattack goal and end up losing.  Several of these matches saw our opponent's keeper have the match of his life, then we'd get caught out and their one shot all game ends up in the net.  This is why I found it a bit difficult to understand why so many voted for DDG as POTY last season (I guess there were no other contenders in such a poor season).  But the reality is I think we need to see some unexpected saves more frequently, because many of those are as good as 3 points.

457~~~
He made a few match winning saves last season.

458~~~
He's got a lot of Spanish speaking friends at United though, some who he's known from his youth teams like Mata and Herrera. All seem to be enjoying themselves at united and I'm sure they understand the situation we're in.

459~~~
So harsh to blame De Gea. Couldn't have done a thing about any of the goals. 

He's biggest fault is still communication and not coming when he sometimes should but just consider how many different CB combinations he's played with and imagine the difficulty you'd have as a GK in that situation. 

Once we finally get a settled back 4 we'll be back to seeing Dave at his best.

460~~~
Don't you know we're not meant to post sense the week following a defeat?

461~~~
Yeah course. Has nothing to do with the fact you have nothing worthy to say. Nevermind though. Clown.

462~~~
Quite. The most balanced post I have seen since the defeat in fact of de Gea.

463~~~
It doesn't matter as an argument. Just because someone said something doesn't make the argument stronger.

It wasn't impossible. DDG was less than 2m from the post. He was almost as close to the post as he was to the middle of the goal.
He was also nowhere to be seen when Varny scored his goal. Came barely outside the 6 yard box. Way too late to have any chance of saving.

He isn't a problem but so far this season there aren't any positives from him either.

464~~~
De Gea's shot-stopping is excellent, but his decision making needs improving. He deserves to be criticised - though not to the point where we're re-writing history - and not all the blame should be on our defence, IMO. In a high line and a completely different system to what Ferguson and Moyes played, his weaknesses were going to be exposed. He needs to improve on his communication skills, show more authority, and come out and sweep instead of rely on his defenders to do the work for him - he should be in complete control of his box. However, he is adapting to a different system just like the rest of our players and he's been unfortunate that we haven't had a settled defence, which isn't an excuse for his poor communication skills. He's had three different goalkeeping coaches since he joined us, and I'm pretty sure that Frans Hoek is going to need more than a couple of months to help De Gea with his weaknesses.

Edit - Hoek's vision which is something new to De Gea and takes more than a month to get used to:

465~~~
What was he doing for the fourth goal? Nothing much. You feel he could be more proactive with one on ones, like Neuer is.

466~~~
Good point, I buy into that theory.

467~~~
His shot stopping seems to have regressed. Every team needs their keeper bailing them out here and there.

468~~~
Agree. As a keeper, should especially relish 1on1s and pens. Chance to come out on top in an odds against situation. He did nothing. If anything made himself smaller and just hoped ball would hit him.

469~~~
Rewriting history I see.


2 vs Sunderland in January.

470~~~
Sorry but that's just wrong.

Look at the two clips in <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/david-de-gea-2014-2015-performances.394335/page-10#post-16506883">this post</a>.

I know that goalkeeping is kind of specialised, so anyone who has never played in nets might not spot the mistakes in terms of positioning that would be really obvious to them if it was an outfield player. Take it from someone who played that position that's just really poor play. Narrowing the angles in a 1v1 is one of the most basic skills of being a keeper. Unforgivable to be so slow off his line and give the striker that much room to aim at.

I also think a really elite keeper (which is the level we should be expecting from him) might have got a hand (or even foot) on Cambiasso's shot. It was actually very close to him.

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/O7mmMreJa65/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

He'll definitely look a lot less uncertain in terms of controlling his box when he has a settled back four in front of him but meanwhile, he needs to up his game in terms of shot-stopping and 1v1s because right now he looks a tier below the best keepers in the league.

471~~~
I'm looking at it again and again, and I still can't see how anyone would think he could have saved that.

If there's one thing he's always shown is his stopping ability. There's no reason to doubt that part of his game.

472~~~
The Cambiasso shot?

It was hit from 3 or 4 yards beyond the penalty shot and went past him about a yard away from his left foot. It was hit very hard so would have needed a really special save but if you read back through this thread you'd see most people claiming that we have a really special keeper.

473~~~
All true. But even special goalkeepers concede goals. Sometimes saves are more luck than anything else. Like you said, it flew a yard from his left foot. If that foot stands a bit to the left, he saves it simply through positioning and everyone hails him. Sometimes it's that simple.

474~~~
He saved two in january, and saved one against RVP in 2011-12. How the hell has he gone from 2nd best keeper in this thread to fecking Cillessen? Dear god the level of posting has degenerated.

475~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> i didnt say he was Cillessen, just his penalty saving skills remind me of him.

476~~~
He is just talking about the penalty part, and its not like Cillessen is a bad keeper, reckon he is better than Wojiech for example.

477~~~
He hasn't really played behind a settled defence apart from the season we won the league, when he got into the team of the season. He could definitely command the defence more but it can't help when it's a different group every other game.

478~~~
But even their penalty saving skills are different. De Gea HAS saved them, Cillessen hasn't. You are utterly wrong. And I wasn't saying you said he was, I was disagreeing with your comparison.

As I said above, I disagreed with his comparison I did not say he said De Gea is cillessen.

479~~~
it doesnt matter if he saved some penalties, every time we get a penatly against us, you know he probably wont save it. Luck or no luck, i think that he should work on it and improve.

480~~~
Any goalkeeper in the world <i>probably </i>won't save a penalty.

481~~~
Vermeer has stopped 7 of the last 7 penalties against him, he is the one who would.

482~~~
Yeah but you said de Gea went from 2nd keeper to Cillessen in this thread. And thats not the case.

483~~~
Nice.

But still, most would expect that he wouldn't save the next one.

484~~~
Regardless of if he could/should be saving penalties or not my main gripe on DDG, as Pogue mentioned, is... is it unfair for us to ask a tagged "Special Player" to pull off something.. actually special once in a while? other than the most routine stops that any keeper in any professional league should be collecting, he's not been close to much as of late, particuarly for his certified "shotstopper" tag.
While he seems far more comfortable between our sticks than before, yes I'm well aware, for me, and perhaps some others.. he still seems to find safety the closer he is to his goalline, he doesn't come out to claim very much and attempt to relieve pressure on our defense either despite bulking up and a year or so back and showing promise this aspect of his game would progress further.
The one time that springs to mind where he didn't have to go for a ball, but came off his goaline and showed some bollocks, was against QPR, which he fecked up royally after calling out to Rojo and then not getting there.

Do I think he's garbage, no, do I blame him above others for the 5 conceeded against Leicester, again no, of course not, but I can't help but feel he could be doing better right now to claim the "special player", "best keeper in the PL", "best young keeper in the world" labels he's afforded almost as a given on here.
The other issue I believe is our unsettled back four is a legitimate point, yet It shouldn't automatically absolve DDG so much so that we can't even discuss him on here, otherwise we risk the "Kagawa excuse" once again.. <i> "It's not his fault! it's everyone else around him!"</i>

485~~~
Well having 3 different coaches in 3 seasons hasn't done him any good..

486~~~
I don't know but these days it's like any shot on target goes in. I hate how he just stands and watches the ball as it goes into the net. Atleast make an attempt.

487~~~
Wouldn't be the first keeper at a big club to have to cope with that.

488~~~
True but still young and not the complete package so could be harder than for Cech for example..

489~~~
Whatever about any of the other goals suggesting he even had a slight chance of saving Cambiasso's goal is simply ludicrous. No keeper, no matter how "special", would have saved that. 

At the rate things are going people are going to start blaming him for chances missed up the other end! There's only so much the man can do. People have every right to criticise him if they feel he could do better but at least try to make a reasonable argument.

490~~~
It's a difficult one with De Gea at the minute because if you individually look at the goals he's conceded it's not like any were really his fault or that he absolutely should have saved them, bar one against MK Dons I think.

It's just that I think he's a fine keeper and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect him to make a great save every now and then. I'll admit I'm starting to get annoyed by the fact that it feels like everybody scores with their first shot against us.  It's probably a little harsh because we're criticising him for not making wonder saves but I think it's a compliment to him that we expect that.

He's been average this season but he's the least of our issues.

491~~~
Maybe the fact that many believe he was helpless in all five goals is a clear indication of mispositioning. If he had positioned himself better in goal, he could've helped himself in his attempts to make a save.

492~~~
De Gea is quality, he's just playing with a bunch of clowns infront of him.

493~~~
I wonder if all that agenting in the summer hindered his pre-season training. 

In all seriousness though, I haven't felt as confident in him this season so far. I don't recall him actually saving anything against Leicester. Not saying that he should definitely have saved any of the goals - Cambiasso's was probably the most saveable, but he did have bodies in front of him,so to criticise him for that would be harsh.

494~~~
The thing with De Gea so far this season is that if you watch every goal he's conceded individually you can excuse him not saving 99% of them but when you look at them in context you can't help but think that a stopper of his quality should've been able to pull some magic out of the bag for at least a couple of them.

495~~~
That's actually quite interesting. I have always had a nagging suspicion that he doesn't do enough on one on ones but always just put it down to me being a bit paranoid as I've never really seen it get a mention.

496~~~
Interestingly (kinda), Chelsea have not changed goalkeeping coach since 2007, when they appointed the bloke who was Cechs coach at Rennes.

497~~~
He was v good but not brilliant. The rest of the team was just shit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He doesn't communicate enough after 3 years as our main goalie. He should know enough English by now so it can't be that. He might still be deferring to senior players but he has to take the bull by the horns. Given the CBs keep changing he has to step up to the plate. Even if you feel he was brilliant last year he hasn't produced that form this season so far.

I also agree with an earlier poster - he needs to actually <i>attempt</i> to save more shots. Doesn't matter if they score - if you don't actually try you can't save them. Too many shots find him rooted to the spot staring behind him as the net ripples - he's only going down for save she already knows he will reach. 2 years ago he would attempt the save anyway, and (in my opinion of course) that's how he managed to pull off quite a few world class saves since he's been with us e.g. the Mata free kick. 

I think his confidence has been knocked by Moyes' tenure and he hasn't found it back yet. He doesn't even spread himself (aka "make himself BIG") in 1 on 1 situations to attempt to make the attacker panic. 

Penalties is another issue and not one I would pin on him. Only the best save penalties and even then it's not a regular occurrence unless you're Taffarel! Saving those it's a technique you get from experience e.g. learning to read a striker's intent based on your knowledge of him.. half of which you're possibly getting from notes from the coaches. It's not a big issue, but he needs to step up in the other departments i.e. organisation, reaction time.

He's still the right goalie imo and can be world class but he's going to have to get over this hump and learn to organise a defence - being the only constant factor he <i>has</i> to learn this so that it lessens the impact of our revolving CB policies! You hope this gk coach who taught VDS everything he knows will do the same for him.

498~~~
He's just stumbled a bit I think, with regards to his form. Needs to keep a couple of clean-sheets in a row and not making any nervy mistakes (like the QPR game).

499~~~
Just read the arguments coming from the Rooney thread (cannot see the videos - in office).

You have a fair point there.. However, I would give DDG the benefit of the doubt for he would have been a little wary of a foul outside the box/red card which would have been disastrous. Besides, if you remember, he did come out of the box in the last game to make a clearance so I'd not call him "not the bravest". Of course, that effort being a feck up would have made him wary of coming out of the box again. That said, where your argument is valid is him taking those 2-3 steps towards the line.

500~~~
Youve got to go in on your striker, if he has breached the back line and is one on with you, you have to be on him and close those angles down.

Yes he still has a good chance of scoring, but if you just stand there like a lemon and do nothing, then you have even more of a chance of being beaten.

You have to command your area, you have to put yourself on the line, you have to close the angles, you have to bully your own defenders, you have to be on your toes for 90 minutes of potentially doing feck all else other than being on your toes, countless "excellent shot stoppers" have fallen by the wayside because they do not get the fundamentals right.

501~~~
Some of the criticisms of him have been over the top. However, I do feel he lacks that aura and stature when it comes to 1 on 1 and penalties. His reflexes and reactionary saves are top notch though. I am not saying he is hapless when it comes to one-on-ones (remember his Suarez save) and penalties, it's just that against certain keepers you get the feeling of the onus being on the striker to somehow beat the keeper instead of how the keeper can miraculously keep out the shot from the striker. Certain keepers such as Kahn, Schemeichel, Buffon and Neuer had this aura of invincibility around them and you'd fancy them in one on ones more often than not.

De Gea is yet to have that commanding nature and aura even when he was at his best last season, whether that is due to his lack of size or dominating mentality, I am not sure. I just don't think it's fair for us to expect him to morph into Schmeichel MK II. He can perform better right now but I won't call him a one-on-one specialist and would expect him to concede most of it, just like most keepers do. It is the defenders' job to restrict the number of one-on-ones and penalties tha their keeper faces.

502~~~
This thread needs a re-name to something about being camped in his own 6 yard box. I have never seen a keeper literally not want to come out and sweep up attacks. Do we think that this is a coached tactic? Or his own little gremlin?

It's just a strange thing. A 'new generational' thing possibly?

503~~~
He tried it against QPR and it almost resulted in a goal. Also if you look at the league there are a few 'keepers who do it and cost their team goals. Mignolet has done it twice this year, Joe Hart has had problems with it. Lloris seemed to rush out often last season and I am not sure how successful he was (got knocked out badly once). I don't think De Gea has the confidence or bravery for it yet. It'll come though, he's still young.

504~~~
Yeah, it's fair enough <a class="username" data-user="83951, @ZDwyr" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83951/">@ZDwyr</a> I am not having a go at him. It's almost a foible that you come to realize through repetitive watching of United 'hey.. this is something DDG does.. Hmm, that is a bit weird that I noticed that? There must be more to it..' I actually noticed it about 3/4 through his first season. I hypothesize that in that little period where he was struggling with communication and the strength and bravery, someone has said to him. "Look - don't come out of your six yard box unless you absolutely have to.. Also if Vidic/Rio is anywhere near the ball, let them have it. Blanket rule."

Takes away a little bit of his dynamism. But I think someone said above; his distribution really has gone down hill of late now that it has been mentioned.

505~~~
Sounds like a confidence thing to me. Keepers rushing out are obviously taking a big gamble, and can be made to look like quite the fool when it inevitably doesn't pay off.

506~~~
I know it's easier to say it from the armchair but I would much rather my keeper rush out and be beaten one on one than be beaten like that. But as I said, from the armchair. I've played in goals a few times and early on in my piece I rushed out so far that the guy just turned to the left and slotted it and I looked back and was literally facing the dugout at halfway thinking my net was directly behind me. Weird feeling.

507~~~
His problem is lack of physical presence simply. He isn't tall like a Cech or Van Der Saar or as wide and commanding like a Schmeichel and Courtois and he seems bit scared of coming out and commanding his box aerially or charging for shots and making himself big where he could get hurt.

These aren't obvious mistakes that some can pick out and laugh at so he gets away with it mostly but as Pogue pointed out other top keepers like Courtois do this kind of stuff.

508~~~
*sigh*

509~~~
We need him to start performing sooner rather than later. If he doesn't, his position should be called into question.

510~~~
If he trusts that we have defenders capable of dealing with situations then he wouldn't come for that and the goal isn't conceded.

Sadly we've not had a trustworthy defence for most of his career at United.

511~~~
I'm sorry but I'm not having that. That mistake was 100% De Gea.

512~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He is untouchable

513~~~
People forget how young DDG is. He will make mistakes and of course with the defensive changes he will be a bit more on edge. He'll settle down eventually.

514~~~
Rubbish. Claiming the ball is part and parcel of any keeper's job. He fecked up, and not for the first time this season.

515~~~
He's become shiite this season, might not be a bad idea to drop him for a few games.

516~~~
It was, I'm not debating that.

I'm just suggesting why he felt the need to come out. He doesn't trust anyone in front of him so feels he needs to deal with it himself and therefore cocks up massively.

517~~~
Should have done much better. Questions have to be asked how a West Ham player had all the time in the world in our 6 yard box though.

518~~~
Did he ever have periods with Atleti when he was out of form?

519~~~
Too timid, he's a baby goalkeeping wise but why he doesn't take charge of situations more baffles me. Take one-on-ones for instance, he's always rooted to his line. He'll adapt but I'd like to see him take a leaf out of Neuer's book and considering he's good on the ball that shouldn't be too much of a leap.

520~~~
100% his mistake, but his confidence is shattered. Doesn't have that assurance about him.

521~~~
Problem is, Lindegaard is Captain Cock-up.

522~~~
While true, the fact he's still young doesn't help us at the moment. He seems to need a kick up the arse or something and being dropped might just be that.

523~~~
Is he degrading to his early days at man utd?

524~~~
Been a bit shit since the start of the season, if I'm being honest

525~~~
He's going through his Joe Hart phase, he'll get better, he's a baby for a goalkeeper.

526~~~
Very harsh. You don't have enough evidence to back that up at all. Ridiculous.

527~~~
Nobody should be guaranteed starts. De Gea hasn't looked up to par for a while and we might need to give Lindegaard a game if this continues. He needs a wake up call and a spell out of the team might do it. He's showing too much vulnerability for my liking, and hasn't been pulling off saves like we know he can.

528~~~
He's made enough mistakes in his time here.

We always seem to concede when he plays.

529~~~
Lindegaard isn't great but reliable i feel.

530~~~
He's a quality keeper who made a bad mistake, it happens, people need to remember that he was our most consistent player last season and once we get a settled back 4 he'll be fine.

531~~~
he peaked already<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">just kidding</span>

532~~~
Sloppy on the corner. Could it have something to do with us changing GK coaches for the third time?

Hopefully he stays mistake free in the second half.

533~~~
How will that help him? You back players. If LVG thinks he needs it, he'll talk to David. There's no point people saying drop this player or that. You lose a players confidence. What if who you bring in makes a mistake? Do you drop them too? I would trust LVG to sort it out with the goalkeeping coach.

534~~~
He's not been great but he's got get another different defence in front of him. 

Once the defence get settled it'll help him no end. 

I'd still rather have him in net than Lindegaard.

535~~~
And De Gea hasn't? Regardless of age, if you're going to bring up the amount of mistakes a goalkeeper makes then he's made less than DDG. I'm not supporting or against the idea of dropping De Gea for Lindegaard - but it's harsh to just label Lindegaard that. He's been a very good back up goalkeeper to us - too good to be a back up in all honestly. 

West Ham's goal was his fault, and he's been at fault for other goals we've conceded this season. No point beating around the bush. He needs to buck up his game.

536~~~
It depends on the player. Some players react postively to getting dropped, some just lose confidence. The last time he got dropped De Gea really proved himself and had a couple of great seasons.

537~~~
Yeah, I'm hoping this is the case. He's been a bit shady at times this season, but like with our new manager, it's still early in the season and difficult to judge. Hopefully this is just a temporary thing, and he'll find his form of last season once he has a more settled defence in front of him.

538~~~
One save off the near post very good.

But he was all over the place besides that today. 

Whether it be distribution, coming or not coming off the line.

539~~~
He's made mistakes, but I actually think it's been the first time we've conceded a goal that is his fault this season.

540~~~
He's had a bad start this season BUT he will get better once we settle on a back 4 (IF that happens).

541~~~
Remember when he used to be good?

Little harsh probably, given what he has playing in front of him. Still, he looks miserable on the pitch, and don't think he'll still be here in 12 months time.

542~~~
I can understand having a shit day in terms of saves but I don't understand why he takes so long to come off his line.

543~~~
Poor mistake today, but also a good save in the second half. Otherwise I don't remember big problems or opportunities to save us. He is not in his best form so far and I think in the situation which results in the goal he just wanted to prove that he gets out of his goal, which went completely wrong. I hope that doesn't mean he will not do it anymore and just stay on his line, but please not like that Dave.

544~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Ridiculous post.

545~~~
I wonder if the constant changes to the GK coach has unsettled him somewhat.

546~~~
A young keeper like him could use some experienced back up. His kicking has also become very iffy.

547~~~
What the hell have you been smoking?

548~~~
Saved smartly in the second half and was generally good after his mistake, although his kicking wasn't great.

549~~~
He has been poor this season. I fully expect him to bounce back once he gets some semblance of a settled defence in front of him.

550~~~
Their goal was entirely his fault however other than that I thought he performed very well. One or two smart saves and he commanded the aerial threat very well. His distribution has gone to shit a bit...well simply less good than his pinpoint accurate past.

551~~~
Sums it up for me.

552~~~
I said my initial assessment was harsh in the very same post!

As for not being here in 12 months, he doesn't look like he's enjoying it, his distribution is horrendous (a quality Van Gaal prizes very highly for his keepers), his contract expires at the end of next season, and Real Madrid are likely to be in the hunt for a keeper to replace Casillas long-term. Is it nailed on he's off? - no of course not, but it's not a 'ridiculous' thing to speculate on. 

Anyway, he had a bad day, and has made a poor start to the season. Lets hope he turns it around.

553~~~
He clearly doesnt trust his defence. Given it keeps changing time and time again, and the number of mistakes, it will happen to any goalkeeper. This was the problem Howard at when he was with us.

Once he gets a settled defence in front of him, he will feel more confident, the communication will come and he will cut out the mistakes.

554~~~
I think that's probably right.

555~~~
No you said it was a "little harsh probably". It was quiet clearly very harsh. If you thought it was harsh why would you even say it? Also his distribution is not horrendous. What about the great throw to Di Maria today? His distribution seems to have regressed a bit since SAF retired but overall there is not much wrong with it and it certainly isn't "horrendous". 

He strikes me as a player that loves the club. He is Athletico through and through so he won't be joining Real if he was to leave.

556~~~
That's part of his problem though, he's the keeper and should be aware of his surroundings more or communicating more with the defence. He has had stable defences in his time as well. Rafael, Rio, Vidic and Evra for example isn't exactly a bad defence.

I heard a few people say that at the game, it was such a straight forward save, was literally straight at him, f he didn't save it I'd be hugely worried. People seem to clutch at straws to praise him at times.

He's started the season slow but so have a lot of players, all the defence (him included) need to improve a lot. If it was any other keeper he'd be slated on here for that goal, regardless of their defence in front of them.

557~~~
So nitpicking aside, we both agree that assessment was harsh, we both agree his distribution has regressed/is regressing, and neither of us have any idea whether or not he'd join Real Madrid.

I think Sylar is right, once Rojo, Shaw, Rafael and one other are settled in front of him, his form will probably pick up.

558~~~
I fully agree he should be more commanding and aware, he should definitely be blamed for what happened. It's understandable why he isn't though.

That may be a good defence but how often did he actually have that four in front of him for a run of games?

For the most part he's been fine as well but with the uncertainty at the back we've got, it's not a surprise he's making mistakes trying to compensate for their shambolic displays.

559~~~
I agree that his distribution has regressed but not to the point that it is "horrendous". I would be very surprised if he went to Real. I expect him to renew his contract. 

It goes without saying that a settled back 4 will be huge for him. It would be the same for any other goalkeeper. If Vidic and Ferdinand from a few years ago were playing today he would not be coming for that corner.

560~~~
LVG won't drop de Gea over his distribution because it's miles better than Lindegaard's distribution.

561~~~
A commanding centre half is a must. De Gea is a very fine keeper, but coming for those kind of balls is never going to be his strength.

562~~~
Hummels would be ideal. We need to replace Vidic.

563~~~
Disappointing day for De Gea today, I thought he was over his nervousness at dealing with set plays but today shows he is not entirely over it, His distribution was poor again to. People can say about him being young and to an extent that is correct but you see Courtois performing at a much higher standard, that shows the level De Gea should be at by now but it seems his progress has stalled.
He may pick back up once he gets a settled defence but either way he needs to really up his game ASAP

564~~~
Earlier in the season I believed it was unfair to judge the center forwards due to the crappy midfield playing behind them. Once the midfield was improved, the chances were created, and RVP and co. have started scoring again.

So whilst De Gea is being played behind a different defensive back line every match, errors and uncertainty will appear in his performances.

565~~~
His distribution is annoying.

566~~~
I don't really understand what's happened to his kicking tbh. In his first season it was the one thing that really stood out, his ability to pick a pass, and ping the ball all round the shop. Its slowly regressed to nearly Kuszack-esqu standards.

Very strange <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

567~~~
Not his best by any means but that 2nd half, facing the sun, he made a crucial save that really had a goal written all over it, so he did his job.

568~~~
He's never played in front of these guys before in his life, as the season progresses so will his ability and standard of performance. The trust isn't there between the guys and that will be solved with more playing time together.

569~~~
It's a shame because it has been one of his strengths in the past.

570~~~
I just hope we keep this goalkeeping coach for longer than a year as well as hopefully having a more consistent back four ahead of him. You need consistency <i>around</i> you as a goalkeeper, and that is one thing de Gea has lacked in his career. No excuses for some things today though, such as his distribution and coming out for the West Ham goal.

571~~~
I reckon the confidence of a goalkeeper is very much driven by the quality of the defence in front of him. He's probably having to second guess everything since there has been no continuity in front and he doesn't quite know how each of the defence will play. It was a mistake, but actually, overall I thought he coped pretty well. He's obviously not a Schmikes or a VDS yet, but the potential is there for what is a very young goalkeeper....

572~~~
I'm almost certain it has. His first months with us, he was a poorer keeper than he'd been for Atletico - his instincts seemed to be battling with his new instructions. Last season he seemed to grow in confidence in the area, but lost some of his distribution skills.

We've had two seasons from him where he has been one of our best players. This season I think he's being asked to change his game again and he's doing it with a goalkeeping coach who isn't familiar with the PL and a defence that not only changes every game, it's full of players who aren't familiar with playing as PL defenders.

I think that "give it three months" talk from LvG applies just as much to DdG as to the outfield and perhaps even more, because LvG and his coaching team are learning about PL defending as well.

573~~~
The goal was entirely his fault but after that I thought he made one or two decent saves, particuarly the one by his near post from behind Shaw.
Still seems stuttering when coming out to claim things but was mentioned prior yesterdays gaff, hope he comes back into some form soon, we need him back to his best really.

574~~~

575~~~
Not really. 

He came with a reputation for being great with the ball at his feet but he's never shown this at United. Not consistently anyway. He's really excellent kicking the ball out of his hands but his kicking from the ground has always been fairly erratic and his long throws are almost non-existent. 

Don't think his mistake at the weekend was particularly terrible fwiw. Although it is part of a general pattern this season of him not playing very well.

576~~~
It wasn't a strength but it was a darn sight better than what it has regressed to. People say it is because he doesn't trust his defenders but that can be blamed for the failure to keep goals out but not distribution.. if a pass is there to be made, make it.. you can't blame the fact he doesn't trust his defenders and especially not in a LVG side. The dutch keeper for example was excellent at passing the ball out, in fact there were many keepers who impressed during the world cup and became cult figures.. DDG needs to up his game on this front - I can't stand keepers with shit distribution, reminds me of watching England whenever the ball gets played back to him.

Not that much of the value was lost...

My only concern with DDG is the contract. I hope we don't leave it until the summer or next season before negotiating a new deal with him. If anyone deserves a pay rise it's DDG.

He made a mistake on Saturday, but as Ogden points out, it's testament to how much he has developed that nobody discussed it. Once he has a settled back-4 in front of him he'll be back to his best. Courtois is getting a lot of praise, rightfully so, but if he kept having a new defence to protect him every game then he too would struggle for his best form.

580~~~
Nice, thank you.

EDIT:

As said, nothing of great value would be lost.

EDIT2: Of course, meant Ogden and Telegraph content, not De Gea!

581~~~
It is not surprising he struggled against West Ham, it is just the way they play, load the box up with their 7ft 16 stone cloggers, smash into everyone on set pieces.
A more substantial keeper would of just cleared them out when he went to claim the ball, but he also wasnt helped by our lack of physical presence across the back in general.

582~~~

583~~~
Legend! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

584~~~
Today

585~~~
But he can't save penalties..........

<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

586~~~
Can't save penalties apparently.

587~~~
Omg he actually saved a pen!!!

588~~~
Really needed that. Think he knows he had a poor start to the season and hopefully that'll give him some much needed confidence. First time Baines has had a penalty saved in the PL too.

589~~~
Yay! He's saved a pen., lads! He's done it <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

590~~~
On one hand, it was a shit pen. On the other, Dave saves <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

591~~~
From Baines too.

592~~~
Like Cillessen eh? Hang your head in shame! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

593~~~
The difference between someone like Simon Mignolet and David De Gea is simple. David makes the big saves. The stuff of legends. 

Both may be great shotstoppers but De Gea has that extra something that guarantees him a note in the history books. Well done David!

594~~~
That should help his confidence considering some of the criticism lately. It was a fairly poor penalty from Baines, but De Gea dealt with it well and the save was good all things considered.

595~~~
Get in Dave!!

596~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

597~~~
Love me some Dave <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I took him out of FF though <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

598~~~
And some said he didn't save penalties! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

599~~~
Best thing about this is that the "he never saves penalties" gang will finally shut the feck up.

600~~~
That save will hopefully act as a catalyst in an upturn in form from de Gea.

601~~~
14 out of 14 before today, broke the streak <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>.

Huge improvement on his distribution today, seems he is making them stick much more often. Also turned someone who charged him down which was great to see. Should be a massive confidence boost for him this match.

602~~~
Definitely needed that.

603~~~
The sad thing is I reckon they won't; the excuse of "it was a shit pen" may pop up ...

604~~~
Is that his first penalty save since the 8-2 vs Arsenal?

605~~~
<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

606~~~
Yes! He saved a penalty! Hope he can kick on from here.

607~~~
What a fecking save

608~~~
Great save that.

609~~~
Fair to say if we manage to hold out he's gained us (at least) 2 points today then?

610~~~
Holy shit Dave, another one.

611~~~
And he's back. What a match from him. Well done.

612~~~
Man of the Match performance today.

613~~~
Bit premature giving Di Maria motm.

614~~~
Engage god mode.

615~~~
He sure shut up his critics.

616~~~
He needed a big performance but he has given a god like one

617~~~
He's been incredible in the second half. Had three absolutely brilliant saves towards the end of the match and reminded us why he's a top keeper. Comfortably his best performance of the season.

618~~~
Best keeper performance I've seen at the club for years. What a man.

619~~~
How he wasn't GK of the year last season was beyond me. If he keeps up this form, even the biggest of ABUs cannot deny his class.

620~~~
Unreal saves.

621~~~
Match winner. Unbelievable performance.

622~~~
Jesus I want to have babies with this man.

623~~~
Drop him.

624~~~
Whatttayyy performance today! Unbelievable saves.

625~~~
Probably the best signing since Cristiano Ronaldo, his progress at this stage in his career is frightening. Been a world class keeper for two years now but what a fecking game he's just had today.

626~~~
There won't be a better goalkeeping performance this season. feck sakes!

627~~~
Great performance today, it's the difference between winning and losing.

628~~~
Should have been the MOTM. That's the DDG we all know and love <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

629~~~
Probably his best performance as a United player. Definitely a 10 rating

630~~~
Excellent today.

631~~~
match-winning performance? <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>

632~~~
He makes me wish I was gay.

633~~~
Been a critic of his lately, what an amazing performance though.

634~~~
Best keeper in the league. Playing behind a shambles of a defence half the time doesn't do him justice.

635~~~
About time.. good to see him back.

636~~~
Our wonderful Spaniard.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

637~~~
I want his man babies

638~~~
10/10

639~~~
He was the difference between 3 and 0 points today. Unbelievable performance!

640~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

641~~~
What a way to stand up and be counted after a tough game last week. He really did remind us how good he is and how he can make some extraordinary saves that other keepers can only dream of.

642~~~
As much of a match winning performance as you'll ever seen from a goalkeeper.

643~~~
Top performance.

644~~~
Suck on that, doubters. Schmeichelesque.

645~~~
And some wanted this guy dropped

646~~~
You gotta feel for the Evertonians, just what could they possibly do that they didn't? That's cheating basically!

647~~~
Loved his reaction at the final whistle. Knew he'd made the difference.

648~~~
10/10.  Would bang.

649~~~
So he can still make saves then?!

Brilliant performance. Get him that new contract!!

650~~~
Can't believe how good he was today for you.

651~~~
No words. There are just no words.

652~~~
AAA rated this is the David I know. Heroic...

653~~~
... and <i>that </i>is why he's our best player after Di Maria. Love DDG! Easily MOTM today!

654~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

655~~~
Now that's why there was criticism of him. That's what he's capable of! Man of the match without question.

656~~~
Monstrous performance, I couldn't believe that last save on that great Oviedo volley. I'd be gutted if a keeper denied me a goal like that

657~~~
Really saved the three points today. Hopefully these kind of performances from De Gea can have an effect on the defense as well, which was panicking again under pressure today.

658~~~
Dave at his fecking best. Among the flashy stops, let us not forget the save that he saw late, that went through Rojo's legs. He gets down quick after seeing it late, with really safe hands.

659~~~
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. MOTM for me.

660~~~
Save our ass today. Brilliant goalkeeping

661~~~
Great game for him today. Saves the Penalty, and then two massive saves at the end. All those threads questioning if we should be dropping him look even sillier now.

662~~~
Those De Gea saves were like young Casillas! Incredible!

663~~~
His best attribute has always been reflex saves. Glad to see that he hasn't lost that, especially after a few comments about him standing still for shots.

664~~~
Gifs, we need gifs!

From dozen of angles!

665~~~
Best GK performance for United since Schmikes against Newcastle?

666~~~
MOTM for me fantastic performance.

667~~~
Spot on. We could've easily left with 0 points today if not for DDG

668~~~
Average day for him really...

My god he was beastly. He pretty much just got back into Deity mode like he did several times last season.

669~~~
That was some performance, well done.

670~~~
David de God.

671~~~
Get this fella on a 10 year contract! Terrific performance today. Imagine how good he could be with a settled defence in front of him.

672~~~
Turned a 2-4 defeat into a 2-1 victory single-handedly, what a performance.

673~~~
match winning saves today, welcome back Dave

674~~~
Jesus Daves.

675~~~
Match winner. Great performance.

676~~~
I loved his reaction when the final whistle went. What a man.

677~~~
De Gea being De Gea.

678~~~
Three absolutely huge saves from De Gea, he was incredible today and what a way to respond to some recent critiques!

679~~~
They weren't even easy saves, great reflexes.

680~~~
I love him.

681~~~
Monster. Best keeper in the league.

682~~~
Won us the game

683~~~
Unbelievable stuff, 3 saves the equivalent of a hat-trick for striker today.

684~~~
Had a bit of a crap start to the season but he's definitely back. Great saves

685~~~
He hasn't made those types of saves in a while and one can easily forget how bloody quick he actually is to react. He saved three difficult ones and saved a penalty today.

Outstanding performance.

686~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://marsyrblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/matrix1.jpg" src="http://marsyrblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/matrix1.jpg"/> 

That's our David today.

687~~~
Wow.

688~~~

689~~~
Don't know why but a comment on Facebook said DDG was MOTM and somebody said Messi was unlucky not to get it made me laugh.

690~~~
The low shot he kept was really tough, he could have easily spilled it.

691~~~
Courtois may be the better commander of the box. But when it comes to shot stopping De Gea is the best. No question. He just is.

692~~~
His reflex saves are incredible. Amazing reaction time. Love him.

693~~~

694~~~
What a 'keeper!

695~~~
Add De Gea's head and make them miniature footballs. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

696~~~
I was going to complain about his haircut but this man! so much love for him right now <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

697~~~
my words exactley

698~~~
Weren't some people on the caf questioning his form last week...? Madness. Saved a penalty and two clear cut chances. It's harder to get past De Gea than it is to cross the Wall in Westeros.

699~~~
Hope a lot of our fans were reminded of what a great keeper he is today. He went through a bit of a slump early season but I hope today signaled the end to that.

700~~~
<a class="username" data-user="32240, @Olly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/32240/">@Olly</a> can you gif De Gea's head on to Keanu Reaves when he deflects bullets with his hand in the matrix, please? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

701~~~
He was MUCH better today.

He needs to keep it up because he has been shocking this season up until now.

702~~~
3rd save is one of the best ive seen in years - hes on the ground from the first shot thats blocked then gets up and saves that WOW

703~~~
Unreal, sublime keeping.  We should've lost that match but DDG gave us all 3 points.

704~~~
Immense.

705~~~
I'm only saying this now that we've secured the 3 points, but I'm glad we had those nervy last 15 minutes. Until today I thought DDG had been unconvincing this season. Not blaming him for the goals we've conceded, but he hasn't looked like getting anywhere near most of them. So today's match-defining contribution was a relief for me and probably for him too. 

That may sound like a weird way of spinning things, but so far this season he has been our only constant, and in a back-line that has had to rely on so much youth and inexperience, we should be expecting better things from DDG, one of our truly world class players. Today he showed that and the defenders will hopefully be a bit more reassured by having him behind him. 

Now, I'm going to spend the next hour watching those GIFs again. Beautiful. Though we should really add the low shot that went through Rojo's legs. Could easily have found its way in but he showed great handling there.

706~~~
10 year contract please

707~~~
All praise Giflord and his works.

708~~~
Fantastic game from him today. Didn't have much problems, distrubution was fine and saved our ass with 2 excellent saves and a saved penalty. Hope that's enough for the next weeks, he had just an average start, he didn't turn into an awful keeper, who won't save anything.

709~~~
Yes, the usual fools of course. 

The guy is one of the best around and he does it without a consistent defence in front of him. This guy with a rock partnership like Ferdinand/Vidic when they were in front of VDS would be seriously incredible. People easily forget that he hasn't had any consistent partnership in front of him.

710~~~

711~~~
You're a legend mate, much appreciated!

712~~~
That last save is just <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

Brilliant today, nice of Sir Alex to leave us with goalkeeper for 10+ years <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

713~~~
Yep, through a crowd of players!

714~~~
I enjoyed his celebration at the end almost as much as I enjoyed his saves.

715~~~
He's hardly been shocking, just a lot below what we expect of him. He's set very high standards. You forget he's still a baby in terms of a goalkeepers career though. He's going to go through rough patches here and there.

716~~~
Was it the first time this season when he's played two consecutive matches behind the same back line?

717~~~
Have <b>to</b> be honest, Jamie Carragher just ruined the English language.

718~~~
After a couple of dodgy performances, his heroics today will help him out a lot in terms of confidence.

719~~~
The last save was one of his best ever - on par with his save of Mata's fk v Chelsea.

720~~~
What a performance. He has taken a bit of unwarranted criticism here this season but he displayed a strong performance today.

721~~~
That last one, how the feck did he even get near it after being on his arse? Nevermind actually put it over <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

722~~~

723~~~
Wonder what Gary Neville will have to say about that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

724~~~

725~~~
David wasn't up to his best this season and I wouldn't blame it entirely on our changing backline, but he was just impressive today. The save at the end was as good as it gets, especially with him being on the ground after the blocked shot from Barry. Matchwinning performace, keep it up!

726~~~
i think so. has been a while also.

incredible performance from de gea. i just hope one day around the corner we can present him with a decent defense infront of him.

727~~~
Quote from a very bitter Liverpool fan on my FB, to be fair a lot of ABU's have been making similar comments.

<b>"That showed the diff a worldclass keeper can make. DeGea won that for utd."</b>

728~~~
Thats one of the best ever PL saves for me. Reminiscent of the Barthez save from Hamman all those years ago.

729~~~
Fair play that.

Edit: he's getting praise from Ashley Young on facebook now as well.

730~~~
MOTM for sure, just a shame he had to be. Everyone other than him bottled it again.

731~~~
The last 10 minutes was horrific again, but I wouldn't say we bottled it. Fellaini was a terrible sub to make and it completely destroyed us defensively.

732~~~
Perfect time for the real De Gea to show up again. Some of those saves were jaw dropping when we were under pressure. He's just got that agility to reach places he has no right to. He deservedly won us this game. I was getting worried by some of his performances in the earlier games. He just looked beatable again and wasn't defending his goalmouth like this. We're starting to click into some form in our various positions and it's about time he reminded us why he's so highly rated. Now if we can just get a settled defence in front of him..

733~~~
Was gonna say to be fair even under Fergie we ended many a match the way we ended this match, sitting back and inviting pressure and that doesn't suit United we need to be attacking.

It's highlighted now cause if all the drama at United of late but it's not a new thing, and before the last 15 mins we were comfortable.

And de Gea..... just wow <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

734~~~
Praising his diving technique, perchance?

735~~~
Meh.....Half decent saves.
Needs to be holding on to the ball

What a performance.

741~~~
Name them and Shame them!!!!

742~~~
That last save was made harder by Jagielka standing infront of him. His save from Osman was top class but i was most impressed by a shot that went through Rojo's legs and he smartly got down and kept hold, that showed real quality!

743~~~
saved United's bacon today. 

sitting back inviting pressure was reckless when we HAD good defenders...doing it now is ridiculous.

744~~~
That last save is just sublime.

745~~~
One of, if not the best save I've seen at Old Trafford with my own two eyes. Extraordinary.

After Courtois (maybe Cech) yes.

749~~~
I love how the crowd behind celebrate that as they would a United goal.

750~~~
What a performance, worth more than gold that boy. Makes the most extraordinary of saves so effortlessly. Best shot stopper in the league by far and for me he is the best keeper too. Happy to see him save a penalty, course it they are struck well keepers have no chance but it hasn't necessarily been one of his qualities. Stood up to be counted when we needed it, great confidence boost after a slightly patchy start to the season. Love for the Spanish cat knows no bounds!

751~~~
I was in East T2 so right behind the shot and I was up jumping around like a maniac when he pushed it over.

752~~~

Okay, he is. Thought he came off for Podolski.

755~~~
Amazing that only a week or two ago some of the best posters on here were actually claiming he's not that good at all.

756~~~
He is past Cech now, come on.

757~~~
His English has improved a hell of a lot!

758~~~
He's been better then Cech for a few years now. Dont think there's generally much between him and courtois based on the last few years.

759~~~
Some were saying he hasn't done anything this season. They were right. He was superb today though but that doesn't change the fact that he has had a slow start to the season.

760~~~
He's not been in great form this season before today, but overall I think he's better than Courtois.

761~~~
You guys really needed me to come back from holiday. Who said that nonsense Cina? Name and shame.

762~~~
Hard to say. I think De Gea is a better shot stopper but Courtois is better for set pieces and has a better command of area.

Basically if you combined the two you'd get the perfect GK, or, well, Neuer.
Some were saying he wasn't actually that good.

That save is right up there with his save against sunderland, the Giachherini one. Amazing.

765~~~
Blackett's block is crazy too.

766~~~

767~~~
There is, Courtois is much more complete, De Gea is the best linekeeper, and has the best reflexes/saves, but Courtois also is very commanding and is excellent coming out of his goal.

Love Rojo celebrating the save.

777~~~
His save against Osman was unbelievable also

778~~~
I can't stop watching that GIF. Its mesmerising.

779~~~
At least Dave didn't use the emojis he used in the tweet to Edurne not long after.

780~~~
That last save is overshadowing his save before that from Leon Osman! I demand justice for the Osman save!!!!!

781~~~
Rightly so. Last save >>> Osman save.

782~~~
hes a phenomenon. Just so, so good.

783~~~

I wish I was in Shaw's position.

784~~~
Oh yeah, definitely. But the Osman one was class too. Superb reflexes.

785~~~
Well that's the pinnacle of e every footballer's career ...

786~~~
I can't recall being in a crowd that cheered a save from open play quite as wildly as that last one (Penalty saves sure, but this felt like something else)... we all went mental, as if it was a last minute goal for us almost... look at the way the crowd jump up on the gif!

787~~~
*Insert obvious Ashley Young is the expert of diving in the box joke*

788~~~
Was quite picture perfect in the sense that we were defending the Stretford end in the second half tonight.

789~~~
I wouldn't say he's much more complete at all. De Gea isn't that bad at commanding the ball in the air anymore and I'd say his distribution is better than Courtois. Some of the saves that Dave makes look impossible too stop. He's up there near the top for me now.

790~~~
I love him! Give him a 10 year contract already!!

791~~~
What a man.  Been a while, so great to be reminded of what he can do, let's hope he can push on from this and establish himself as the best in the league, take the Spain shirt and start getting talked about in world's best conversations.  Because he's good enough.

792~~~
Can't stop laughing Everytime I watch the clip. Love it.

793~~~
A sensational performance, one of the best I've seen for a long time.

A penalty save from someone who had a 14/14 Premiership penalty record beforehand and then two wonder saves in the last 5 minutes? Absolutely incredible.

That tip over the bar in injury time will be remembered for a long long time.

794~~~
Best pure shot stopper in the world! He has incredible agility.

795~~~
10 years? Give him a 100 year contract!

796~~~
Absolutely fabulous tonight.

797~~~
His save compilation when his days are done here will be incredible!

798~~~
In minor news, he seems to be sporting Puma boots and gloves now.

799~~~
Is that Nick Frost behind them?

Wonderful photo.

801~~~
Look we've figured out already you're an ABU but now you're just being idiotic for the sake of it, Cech? Come on. And switch the defences and see how brilliant Courtois is in DDG's situation.

EDIT: Not saying DDG is better but it's not clear-cut at all to judge who's the better keeper, they both excel in very different areas.

802~~~
So many anxious faces in the crowd there! Beautiful picture indeed

803~~~
Exactly the kind of performance everyone wanted. Now his season has properly started. Great thing for him to earn United those 2-3 points. Games like this is the mark of a great keeper. Love it. The pundit that I work with loathes him which makes it that little bit extra special.

804~~~
We may not have defense recently but Dave is the fortress Old Trafford itself.

Hats off.

805~~~
The 3 spectacular saves aside, I also thought he did well to get down low to that shot that went through a few bodies, including Rojo's legs, from such close range too. Good anticipation to not gamble on a deflection. They don't look as emphatic on camera, but still top goalkeeping. I think my heart was in my mouth just as much then as it was when Gareth Barry blasted it at Blackett's arse in stoppage time.

806~~~

807~~~
Schmeichel like performance from him today.

808~~~
10 year new contract and the captaincy please.

809~~~
I moaned after Leicester but that is more like it. All things considered, is that his best performance for us or is that still madrid? Hopefully another defining performance anyway

810~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

811~~~
World class performance from a world class 'keeper.

Me and my mate were bemoaning his lack of penalty saves just before he saved Baines' penalty. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

812~~~
Yes !!!

813~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

814~~~
So pleased he saved that pen especially, no way that should have been given.

815~~~
I said to my mate 'I never fancy him to save a pen'...

816~~~
I said 'Dave we need you to start saving some of these' and so he duly did <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

817~~~
Surely he'll start for Spain?

818~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

819~~~
Beautiful.

820~~~
The saves in injury time were brilliant, you know he is capable of those, his reaction and reflex is incredible but the concentration level at that stage was most pleasing, he still has issues commanding the box and in one on one situations but you have to remind yourself he is still only 23, today will do his confidence good too very happy with him.

821~~~
Wasnt he goalkeeper of the year, he was still just excellent. Very reliable, his saves arent of de Gea's level but due to his experience he just excelled in all the other aspects. So if you dont stick up feathers in your players asses you are a ABU huh?

822~~~
Not at all but if you do it constantly then yes, as you do in almost every thread I've seen you in.

823~~~
Hope you'll understand if I just ignore you. What I said today wasnt negative at all, logically some opinions here are a bit red tinted, (a lot). I doubt there are non-Mancunians who would say that Courtouis isnt better than de Gea, but if you say that on here, you soon look like an ABU/negative guy. Sorry for not always singing hosanna and going against the red tinted talk.

824~~~
The issue was that you said Cech is better. I'm sure plenty of neutrals see De Gea as the better of the two.

825~~~
Class <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

826~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

827~~~
An absolute class performance after a while. Thought the penalty he saved today was hit in the same spot as the one he saved against RvP vs Arsenal.

828~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

829~~~
Yeah, I think even most casual watchers would admit that De Gea is either best or second best keeper in the league, between him and Courtois pretty much. There is a reason he won our player of the year last season and the year before he was in the premier league team of the year.

830~~~
All been said but what an amazing performance. We are lucky to have a keeper like him. Hope to see that for another 10 years.

831~~~
Guaranteed to go viral.....

832~~~
Not the most commanding goalkeeper in the world.

Best shot stoppper for 2-3 years for me though.

Fu eking love you Dave.

He won this.

833~~~
We'll split all the millions as a team effort.

834~~~
Someone tweet it on the CAF twitter. It will spread like crazy.

835~~~
The best shot stopper on the world and has been so since his time at Atletico. About the best keeper in the league it is between him and Courtuis, who are at around the same level.

836~~~

837~~~
can't even see the last one until the last split second

sensational 

(I didn't think he'd make it at Utd first season)

838~~~

839~~~
All hail super Dave. He is a world class keeper.

840~~~
Some whopping comments slammed straight up the shitter. Well in Dave, lad.

841~~~
Hell yes. Outstanding. Was hoping for a bit more from him but that exceeded any expectations. Final save one of the best I've ever seen. Must have seen the ball so late. Incredible.

Don't really get all the comments about how this makes previous criticsm this season reduntant though. Bit silly tbh. He's clearly not been at his best before today. Penalty will hopefully be a turning point. Keepers are no different to anyone else.  All about confidence.

842~~~
Martinez praised him too!

Also good to see our players are acknowledging him after great saves! Didn't usually happen last season. But then nothing actually happened last season!
Last season actually never happened <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

843~~~
Rojo's hands in the air celebration was great.

844~~~
Who is this nobody?

845~~~
The King of our Castle today. Long may he reign!

846~~~
Yeh, seeing the instant reaction of some of the players was funny. Celebrated like fans knowing just how good it was.

847~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> who is he?

848~~~
Worrying that he hasn't signed a contract yet. Madrid need a keeper too.

849~~~
He will never join Real, ever. Colchonero for life, grandfather's an Atleti supporter as are his parents. Him joining Real would be heresy of the order of Gary Neville joining City. Even David's farewell letter was touching and heartfelt :

850~~~
Did do about an hour before your post <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

and you're right.


RT: 30, Fav: 19


RT: 78, Fav: 34

Most likely been tweeted a lot more since then but without the caf or Vato mentioned.

851~~~
Fecking twitter. The Cole thread was ruined with the amount of shitminglers nicking it and spreading them on twitter.

852~~~
Was streaming the match and it was obviously a few seconds behind. Received a message just before the FK that read "DDG!!!!!!11" so I knew he had done something spectacular again, just on the heels of that other save. And then, even though I knew <i>something</i> was coming, I still couldn't believe it when I saw it and was jumping out of my seat. Match winner, genuinely world class and seems to love the team (famous last words, I know). Hope he's here for another decade.

853~~~
Just when some freaks thought they can start moaning about his performences, he shuts them up rightaway <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

854~~~
There was a fan video showing his saves and it showed Naismith going up to congratulate him for the Oviedo save.

855~~~
I quite like this...

856~~~

857~~~
Good photo

858~~~
Which moron on BT Sport voted Di Maria as MoTM? Michael Owen?

859~~~
There was a great short shot of David after one of his saves. He was face down after landing and the camera was on a close up of his face when he burst into a smile. Then he lost the smile as he stood up. I think it was a personal moment for him as he realised just how good a save it was. Brilliant.

860~~~

861~~~
What's amazing is not the distance he covers to save the ball, so much as the traffic it travels through on the way to the goal. He must have seen the ball insanely late. Which is what makes the save so impressive.

862~~~
To be fair to Owen, he was asked to give the MoTM award with around 15 minutes to go before any of those final 3 saves were made.  He did say in the commentary that had they asked him later De Gea would have got his vote ahead of Di Maria.

863~~~
Never mind the quotes, still a shit headline from Mail.

864~~~
David hadn't made those saves then. He admitted he had made a mistake when David made them.

865~~~

866~~~
That's unexpected and cool from Cech.  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

867~~~
Michael Owen mentioned that in commentary. Where does it come from?

I was always coached that you should use your "upper" arm to save shots in the top half of the goal. That was a long time ago though. Have coaching opinions changed?

868~~~
If anything it makes the previous criticism more valid, because he has proven once again that we have every right to expect more from him than he has shown before the Everton match. It might not seem fair, but that's the point - he's being held to a higher standard, one which he has set himself. He has shown he can perform brilliantly, and he has shown he can do this consistently, so why be content with 5/6 out of 10 performances when he can achieve higher.

869~~~
Contracted until 2016 but yeah, it'd actually be shocking if Real Madrid don't try to get him in the summer. He's obviously the future Spanish number one. And let's face it, it would not be a shock if he wanted to go.

870~~~
Honestly don't know. I find it hard to work out how you could save a shot like that if you didn't use your upper arm, but then I've never been hot on the tactics/strategy behind goalkeeping. One area of the game where I'm happy to admit total ignorance.

871~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OKhgYUnMaPV/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

872~~~
He arrived last season you gimp (to the writer of the article not the poster). He was our player of the year. Daily Fail gets on my nerves sometimes.

873~~~
I'd been one to be critical of him over his.. what I'd call.. average form to the start of the season, but have to admit he was great yesterday, showed not only saves but confidence and composure in his box, happy to be wrong!, lets hope he can carry this on, we all know he has the talent to do so.

874~~~
Goalkeepers unite. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Great to see from Cech.

875~~~
That last one with his left. Feck me,that fractions decision,its just instinctual with the kid.

The other two with has right sure they werent even tests<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

876~~~
Some clueless cnut born in 1976.

877~~~
Even his first 6 months or so are largely overstated as being shit. Most said that the criticism was over the top on here and in my eyes the amount of mistakes he was making was less than I expected from a 20 year old. The first few months, we allowed the opponents to have a good amount of shots on goal, Cleverley and Anderson weren't offering as much protection as other midfield pairings and the more harmful rotation with Lindegaard, all these things considered, he didn't do as bad as journalists or anyone outside United said.

878~~~
A lot of goalkeepers have always maintained that the way De Gea did it is the proper way.

Big Pete said it was the correct technique, if he says it is right, don't argue.

879~~~
In Australia last night Mark Bosnich commented and said that De Gea's technique was the correct way.

880~~~
I dont really care about technique as long as he stops almost certain goals

881~~~
Agree with the bolded part, even though it was a bit shaky and wasn't in the class he is today, it was still a fairly decent debut for a guy so young coming in to replace Van der Sar. There was however a media narrative that blew up all the mistakes and put aside all his good performances. As you say, he was called into action a lot right from the start and displayed his excellent shot stopping straight away. In no way were his first 6 months 'horrendous'.

882~~~
You can reach further with the top arm cos it's nearest to the top of the goal, it's hardly rocket science.

Must feel a bit unnatural though being the opposite of what is nearest when you're stood vertical.  Perhaps it is a bit devious, I dunno.

That's what i was told by a top rated Bury Schools XI GK anyway,

883~~~
Best keepers are almost always unorthodox. Schmikes for example!

884~~~
He's also definitely improved his deflecting. Shots rarely get parried back into play, even when he has to make the most ridiculous saves. He's actually improved on every area he has needed to since he arrived.

885~~~
He actually arrived the season before that again when he got in the PFA's team of the season. Also he is now one of the best in the world, let alone the PL.

886~~~
That's abut harsh imo. Cambiasso absolutely batters that one. It's importsnt to remember that even top keepers don't make great saves all the time. But I do agree that he should have bailed us out at least a few times this season before the everton game, which he hasn't. Don't agree with that example however.

887~~~

Some people will still say that the keepers shouldn't use the opposite hand :-) what about this ...

888~~~
Wow that's just beautiful.

889~~~
His kicking was noticeably better yesterday as well.

890~~~
Seriously could watch it all day long. Type of moment you watch football for, top lad, right at the death of injury time, would of been hugely demoralizing instead of boosting the whole team and everything, and on his 100 PL game.

He's the new Scholes in that even ABU's love him.

891~~~
As far as I know the argument against using the right hand for a shot to the left is essentially that is reduces reach. Some people also think it's a bit flashy.

The argument in its favour is that it provides extra height and power.

I'm fairly sure most goalkeepers are already in the process of diving before they decide which hand to go with so it basically comes down to the flight of the ball. If the shot is lower but further away then using the left hand makes sense, whereas if it's closer but rising high then the right hand would be more effective.

So in this case it was good technique, I think.

892~~~
This is up there with my biggest accomplishments in life.

893~~~
How far he's come since this game vs City.

I've had mates send me the pic, I nearly replied "Yeah, seen it, Vato is a funny bastard." before realising they wouldn't have a clue who or what I was talking about.

Saw this on twitter that made me laugh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

896~~~
I've always liked keepers who try unorthodox saves. Usually means they're something special.

897~~~

898~~~
Paul Merson <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That statement was wide off the mark already back then!

899~~~
While I love to laugh at Merson as much as the next person, does anyone know if this is actually true?

I still laugh at Paddy Barclay's comments about de Gea early into his debut season.

Those reactions

904~~~
So pleased for the lad. He is now known to me and my friends only as "the cat". His reaction's are just ridiculous.

905~~~
It's true, he said we should sign Given for Champions league because de Gea can't be trusted(at the time Given was second choice at Villa).

906~~~
Have the feeling he genuinely loves the club as well, hopefully he will never leave.

907~~~
I didn't think he was having a good season until the weekend. I think that penalty save really fired him up.

908~~~
A bit worried that we haven't even started talks over a new contract.
(At least that i can gather)

909~~~
I saw an article yesterday saying his form was to be rewarded by a contract extension but I can't remember which paper it was.

910~~~
Merson is always good for a laugh.

911~~~
Good.
I've been waiting for talks of contract extension for a year.
I know Barca got Stegen and that he wouldn't likely want to move to Real Madrid, but you never know what will happen if you wait for too long with offering players something close to what they feel like they deserve.

912~~~
I'm 100% sure I watched him say this on Gillette Soccer Saturday.

917~~~
Yeah i think the penalty save got his season back on track, normally i'm used to seeing DDG save more one-on-one duels or chances, but having picked the ball out of his net 9 times against Burnley/Leicester it must have had an effect on his confidence. But the Everton performance will have erased any negative thoughts from his mind.

It's going to be a very interesting month ahead. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

918~~~
Had an absolute worldie on Sunday but what else do you expect from our Dave? 

Here's a good video that shows the reactions to his save at OT as well as the two United goals. The last save even Naismith had to acknowledge Big Dave.

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/108071591" width="500"></iframe>

919~~~
It's true. I posted a transcript of the Soccer Saturday stuff at the time.

920~~~
He only conceded 5 goals in those two games.

Edit: I'm guessing you meant MK Dons instead of Burnely. He kept a clean sheet against Burnley.

921~~~
I should have never doubted Merson would say something like that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

922~~~
I don't want to deflect from the amazing save but Fellaini disgusts me in this gif. Sums him up.

923~~~
Yeah I think in august his confidence for whatever reason was low and it's why he pulled few saves off. The two seasons prior to this we got used to him pulling class saves of regularly but the first 4 or 5 games we didn't are that.  His ability is world class but until the last few weeks he hadn't shown it this season. Hopefully finally saving a penalty again and what followed will mean a return to him consistently showing that ability. Will make us twice as hard to score on.

924~~~
What did he say?

925~~~
In 2011 or 2012 he suggested that we should look for another keeper to replace de Gea, picking out Shay Given as an option.

926~~~
Yeah my mistake i was referring to the Caring Cup game (or whatever it is called these days)

927~~~
I don't really think De Gea has any confidence in the defence and that lowers his confidence also. You can see in the QPR game and the others before that he tried to play like Neuer and take matter in his own hands. He cut that off in these past two games though.

I can't blame him though, he can't keep a clean sheet in front of him because the defence is constantly injured and he has youngsters playing ahead of him. Let's hope that Jones doesn't injure himself again when he comes back. If we can make Rojo-Jones work, then we won't have such troubles.

928~~~
Terrified he's going to leave us at some point in the short term. If the worst happens and we fail to challenge next year i can see him being tempted by Barca or madrid who are looking for a new long term no.1

Even though barca have signed a few theres no doubt they would sack them off for De gea.

929~~~
I think theres some doubt. They've signed two exceptional goalies in Bravo and Ter-Stegen and the latter is younger than Dave with great potential to replace Neuer as Germany's number one.

930~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> maybe i should get out more, but this one just cracks me up!! Just imagine if we sold de Gea to Barcelona, then have Shay Given in goal. feck me.

931~~~
Ya what was the useless sack of s**t doing? I only notice now that he completely loses Barry. But for a great block by Blackett he would have cost us 2 points.

932~~~
I had noticed Rojo celebrating the save like a goal but I've only just noticed RVP doing the same. 

I've watched that gif too many times now...

933~~~
It is very likely that that will happen in the future. RM will need a new goalkeeper and I doubt he would reject them despite playing for Atletico. Let's just hope he's here for at least another 5 years or so

934~~~
He is going nowhere in the next few years. He already seemed to love the club in the last few years and always seems to enjoy himself! The fans esp at OT have always loved him and he appreciates it. And now with half of Spain/South America at United there's no way he is leaving anytime soon!

935~~~
It's 100% true, I was watching Soccer Saturday when he said it, I remember it well. This was during the height of the "he's Taibi ver. 2" media agenda. Merson is a bellend, you get more knowledgable people than him at the pub.

936~~~
It's not even a rarity he does things like that far too often. If I never saw him in a United shirt ever again, it'd be too soon.

937~~~
Ya I never realised what a lazy player he is until he joined us. He has a reputation as a box-to-box midfielder but no idea where that came from.

938~~~
And the worst thing is that several of us could foresee this. 
Anyway I don't want to derail the DDG thread too much because he wal excellent, but I was watching that gif and looking at some of the great reactions to the save - Rojo, RvP, McNair... then I saw the shambles that is Fellaini.

939~~~
I think he does cover a lot of ground but like Cleverley, it tends to be when he's chasing play rather than in anticipation of action.

940~~~
About time he establish himself as the no. 1keeper in Spain?

941~~~
Sentiment stopped him establishing him as #1, despite being by far their best keeper. After the world cup debacle there's no excuse not to solidate him as #1.

942~~~
Casillas starts again for Spain <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

943~~~
Del bosque is a joke

944~~~
Casillas is the real joke IMO. He should have some integrity at this stage.

945~~~
How long do you hold him back? He's the best Spain have by a considerable distance now; he should be starting.

946~~~
As a professional I'm sure he'd back himself to improve and get back to himself rather then give up. Its up to the manager to tell him when he's done. Del bosque not wanting to move the older generation aside is the reason Spain were humiliated at the last world cup.

947~~~
his time will come. Next year i expect him to be the no1. I criticised him a lot in the last weeks, but seems to be now back to his best. Hopefully he will play against Luxembourg.

948~~~
This. Should have been sacked after the WC debacle but he is still living of his past success. Given the players at his disposal Spain should have gotten into the semis at least. The reason they struggled was due to the use of players such as Casillas and Xavi who are past it.

949~~~
Problem is he was probably the best Spanish keeper during the 2012 Euros, and 2 years later he's only just got in the squad finally. Sure he'll become a starter soon probably but he should have been that for a while now.

950~~~
Ridiculous.

951~~~
After the debacle of the WC, Del Bosque needed to make some bold decisions. Should have started with establishing De Gea as first choice. I also think Ander will be an asset for them when fit.

952~~~
We should sign a new contract with him already.

953~~~
Fecking Casillas.

954~~~
I'm not to worried, I think he loves it here.

955~~~
My 13 year old son was asking me why Fellaini was the furthest defender back defending that free kick.
I have found it strange too that he always takes up a position at the far post defending corners
when his physical presence would be much better utlised just after the near post position or somewhere in th middle? I wonder if he was just playing to instructions, which doesn't make sense to me.

956~~~
I guess you have a point. It just feels like Casillas is a special case with so much power both for Spain and Madrid.

957~~~
It's obviously a joke that Del Bosque starts Casillas over DDG but as long as the top clubs in Spain keep making decisions for political reasons rather than performance ones I'll be happy.

958~~~
He wasn't the furthest defender back. Barry was his man so he was positioned wherever Barry stood, yet it was pointless as he barely attempted to track him after the first few strides. Just let him run off and get a shot in. He's useless.

959~~~
That was today?  fecking hell

960~~~
Yep. Spain losing 2-1

961~~~
Fellaini really is an abomination of a Manchester United footballer, an utter sack of shit.

That GIF is horrible - fails to track Barry because he'd rather ball watch, then he turns his back on Oviedo's shot. Awful defending twice in the space of about five seconds.

Wage thief.

962~~~
Slovakias second goal.

963~~~
Surely DDG has to get a look in soon.

964~~~
He deserves his chance now but Spain seems to have a political problem

965~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

966~~~
Don't think Casillas can save the second goal but wtf was he doing, he virtually let the guy head into an open goal

967~~~
Del Bosque won't drop Casillas. Not many changes from Del Bosque considering their debacle on the World Cup. Hopefully, they will get embarrased again.

It is beyond a joke now. De Gea has been for more than 2 years the best Spanish keeper but still has played a game (and a minue on an another game) for them. Both of them friendlies.

968~~~
Yea I know he has a problem with change and seems to make selections on reputation etc, but Christ on a bike, there's surely a tipping point?!

969~~~
Feck all he could do about the second goal. Terrible keeping for the FK though.

970~~~
Barcelona cant do any transfers because of the transferban and i doubt David wants to sign for Real considering he's an Atletico youth product. We're safe for the next few years.

971~~~
No chance he says no to RM because of his Atletico past. This will happen, probably even next summer.

972~~~
Based on what, exactly?

973~~~
Strange tweet from that account, not much he can do there.

974~~~
Yeah, so many spanish players turned down a move to RM ... Even with his Atletico roots, I can't see him saying no to them and DDG is the perfect keeper for them. Spanish, Madrid born, would be classified as a "Galactico" and the best heir they could find for Casillas.

The only thing that could be a deal breaker for RM are his Atletico roots, but as many players have shown in the past, as a professional you think different than supporters. I just don't think that De Gea will say no to them and I have no doubt that RM will try everything next summer.

975~~~
So you're saying he's still available to switch nationality? <i>Technically</i>, two more years and he'll be able to play for England qualifying through residency, eh?

Hang in there, San Iker!!! You're not done, just yet!

#DaveForEngland

976~~~
Caring Cup <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

977~~~
I'm not sure if it'll happen, and I'd be surprised if it happens that soon. But part of ensuring he stays will be getting back into the CL and into title contention again. As much as he seems content here, is loyal and enjoys playing for us, if we don't reach our former heights again then he may eventually want to move to a club where he's winning more trophies since he's likely to be one of the best GK's around if he continues to develop and improve.

978~~~
Not sure what he did it wrong there. It was a fast counter attack situation, it could either be a shoot or a cross. Yea, it looked bad because Iker was a bit slow but not much he could do.

979~~~
Had someone tell me today that 
Gorka Iraizoz should get the Spain #1 jersey ahead of De Gea. I'd this Iraizoz any good? I know very little of him.

980~~~
He is ok, Nowhere near the level of De Gea or even Casillas for that matter, Plus he is 33 now

981~~~
Del Bosque should have resigned and Casillas should have followed him out of the Spain team. Embarrassing after the world cup how they are both still there.

982~~~
Rubbish, it's like saying Gerrard would play for us.

983~~~
I doubt that we will go for De Gea seeing as we just bought Navas. He'll be our first team goalkeeper next season. Only chance we will go for DDG is if Casillas wouldn't want to be second choice.

984~~~
Real Madrid don't do expensive keepers and neither do many clubs, very few clubs would pay what we paid for him and I don't see who would pay what we would demand for him.

985~~~
Dave is the best keeper Spain have.

986~~~
It's a rather strange phenomenon this. One would think a high quality starting keeper should be of prime value as the last man in defense. Would even go as far as to claim that Pinto cost Barcelona the league title in 2013/ 2014 and Casillas almost ended up costing Madrid the Decima. Considering that and the fact that most major clubs have no issues with signing rotational players for upwards of 20 million, it's decidedly bizzare that they don't splurge on a top bracket keeper, especially since the have a longer shelf life compared to outfield players and rarely seek a move. You could spend big on a quality young keeper and sleep peacefully for a decade with the knowledge that one position on the field doesn't need replacing in the medium to long term future. Juventus spent heavily with Buffon, Bayern on Neuer, United on De Gea, Inter on Toldo, Chelsea on Cech and and none of the clubs have regretted the decision as things stand. But then maybe there aren't many world-class keepers worth spending that kind of money on.

987~~~
This.

988~~~
I bloddy hate RM's arrogance.... Why DDG would left United for RM bench ?

989~~~
Is Dave no.2 for Spain then?

990~~~
But what we can demand for him in that scenario would depend on his contract status - if it's running down then we could be forced to deal rather than lose him on a free. It's not like we ever get respectable value for our departing players either - hell even when dealing with Real Madrid the ultimate muppet club, we've given them a season of their highly converted shirt sales in Mexico without them even buying Chicharito. 

I do however think he won't join Real anyway, but with Atletico riding high I wouldn't rule out a cheap return there at some point if his contract does run down. The point is that renewing DDG's contract has to be a high priority right now, especially when we're in the state we are in. I trust the club are sorting this out, but until it's confirmed then it is a worry.

991~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.oneworldsports.com/stories/david-de-geas-man-utd-contract-unsettled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oneworldsports.com/stories/david-de-geas-man-utd-contract-unsettled</a>


feck

992~~~
I just saw that. Goalkeepers are probably the hardest players to replace and we have one of the world's best in our team. I would give him a massive contract as soon as possible.

He also happens to be one of my favourite players, so would be distraught if we lost him, especially to Madrid or Barca.

993~~~
Considering his age and the level of talent and maturity, De Gea is a once in a decade (or more) kind of keeper.  We would probably be held to ransom by his agents but he completely deserves it.

994~~~
Relax, it's Duncan Castles.

995~~~
Honestly, what the feck are we waiting for? Pay him whatever he wants and throw in Anderson as his pet.

996~~~
It's been going for quite a while.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KRDQcCeKfAE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

997~~~
Casillas - 165k
Neuer - 125k
Cech - 120k
Lorris - 85k
Buffon - 80k
Joe Hart - 80k
<b>De Gea - 75k</b>
Courtois - 60k


He's not on a bad wage so I wonder what the contract stalling is about? Personally I'd throw what ever he wanted at him, although 100k seems justified considering if he does spend his career here between renewals he'll probably end up on 150k either way. Having said that if Madrid did want to replace Casillas you have to admit it would be hard to turn down 150-165k wages at the age of 23.

998~~~
The RM rumours will grow with every mistake Casillas makes and every week which passes without us offering him a new contract. This should be priority after the international break. 
If LvG lets him go and buys Argentina's keeper instead I bloody hope Woodward blocks it without any hesitation! 

I am not worried that DDG wants to leave as he clearly loves it here, but I still can't decide what kind of players LvG likes at United. He didn't rate Welbeck. Does he rate Mata? Does he rate Rooney as a striker? He wanted bloody Vermaelen. Does he rate Januzaj? Considering all this I am a bit worried he might be indifferent in regards to keeping or letting DDG go. I want his contract sorted out immediately because of this! I will fall into a coma if DDG leaves us because of LvG! DDG is priceless as far as I am concerned!

999~~~
He'll sign a new deal soon, relax.

1000~~~
If De Gea were to be one of the highest earners in the squad then I wouldn't have a problem with that. We have our attacking 'stars' that by necessity earn the most money, such as Rooney, Van Persie, Falcao, Mata and Di Maria, but De Gea should be awarded a contract in line with his position at the club, which is a pretty damn important one.

1001~~~
With all of the Spanish-speaking players coming in, I was under the impression we're building around De Gea, but that's just me.

1002~~~
Yeah, I'd rather see us offer him a big money contract which he deserves now than have to revisit the issue a few years down the line, presuming he continues to improve and doesn't do a Joe Hart, which is unlikely.

1003~~~
Kind of difficult to build around a GK, but we certainly value him highly and will do what is needed to keep him content.

1004~~~
There's a separate thread where you can talk about LVG, his likes, dislikes and other grudges you might have against him.

1005~~~
? It's about DDG and that's his thread. And no, I don't have many grudges with him, but that doesn't mean I an not aware of bad decisions he has made in the past or is capable of making.

1006~~~
This is said every time and then they leave.

1007~~~
Great, and those bad decisions are better discussed in the thread dedicated for LVG is all I'm saying <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1008~~~
If he leaves Manchester United will cease to exist? You all claim that United are "the biggest club in the world" but then get shit scared of foreign talents leaving the club [yes, because we sold one Ronaldo]. Some of you act like we are Everton or some small club. The only player we have sold that we wanted to keep/or would have liked to keep was Ronaldo. De Gea will be here for the considerable future, but if he decides he wants to move to Real Madrid then they'll have to pay top dollar for him, that's how it works.

1009~~~
And so it begins...
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.marca.com/en/2014/10/11/en/football/real_madrid/1413014778.html?a=64f0a5da62b67e52b308c98c4b5684d7&amp;t=1413024869" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.marca.com/en/2014/10/11/...64f0a5da62b67e52b308c98c4b5684d7&amp;t=1413024869</a>

I've been saying since last season this renewal needs to be at the top of Woodward's priority list.

1010~~~
Not at all bothered by Marca. They're a bit rubbish and tend to link every good player with Madrid.

1011~~~
You just got to United from Atletico Madrid, and agent is already promising you a place in Real Madrid? Hah.

1012~~~
We should definitely give him whatever he wants and tie him for the next 5-6 years. If he doesn't renew his contract then we will be in a very bad position on the summer considering that he'll have only one year left.

On the bright side, he looks to be happy here and we have good relations with Mendez, but if Real Madrid wants him, we will struggle to keep him if he doesn't have a long contract. I don't think that him being a lifelong Atletico fan will mae any difference. Unlike in England, in Spain players go to rival clubs without many hesitations.

1013~~~
I'd agree. Both Falcao and Aguero, although foreign, have had public flirtations with Real Madrid, and both are considered Atletico legends.

1014~~~
That's not true with regards to Ath. and Real. This was obvious when Ath. refused to let Aguero go to Real. Aguero honoured that and went to City instead. If Sergio had wanted to go to Real that badly, he'd probably be there right now. Anyone know the last player to leave  Athletico Madrid and go to Real? It's definitely not common.

1015~~~
Not worried about this, we'll have this tied up. When did we last lose a player, in such a manner (apart from Pogba..)?

1016~~~
A bit different though if you have come from their ranks or just got transferred there and left after some years.

Still the sooner he extends the better!

1017~~~
Agree with this as we won't be able to replace him with anyone near as good.

1018~~~
Probably some kind of managerial tricks, after all the time when the club will have to offer a new contract to De Gea is approaching. I'm sure his manager would love to enter the negotiations with Woodward with all the press in England and Spain saying that Real Madrid are looking at the possibility of signing De Gea.

Real Madrid spent 10m euros last summer to sign Keylor Navas, probably the best keeper in La Liga in the previous season, a player who also had an incredible World Cup with Costa Rica. And i know that when you're playing for Levante and Real Madrid are declaring their interest in you it's hard to resist the temptation, but i pretty much doubt that Navas, at 27, would sign a six year contract, if he was not promised that he will at least get a decent chance at #1 when Casillas is no longer considered Real Madrid's first choice keeper.

I feel that the club has treated De Gea very well. When he joined United he was a super talent from the Spanish "school" of goalkeepers, very confident on his goal line and a great shot blocker. During his three seasons at United De Gea has improved his overall game a lot, he's become better at dealing with crosses, he's more decisive when coming off his line and now, under LvG, he's learning to communicate better with the defense and he's becoming better on the ball.

He's now considered one of the best goal keepers in the world, at the age of 23, and he will be Spain's #1 sooner or later. I think he realizes how much United have helped him in his career and i'm confident that the club does appreciate the progress he's been making and will offer him the contract he deserves and keep him at OT for many years. Imo a 5-6 year contract that will make him the second highest paid keeper, behind Neuer who is the best and most complete keeper in the world right now, will satisfy him and keep him motivated.

1019~~~
It isn't exactly common, but it happens quite often. It definitely isn't as rare as United-Liverpool (or indeed United-any other top English club). The last player to play for both sides is Juanfran (current Atletico's right back). Other examples are Solari, Reyes, Aragonez, Schuster and Hugo Sanchez. Even Raul Gonzales started his career at Atletico.

1020~~~
Marca blabbing on about him today, basically saying he likes the idea of going to Real and that Mendes has told him he could make it happen at some point.

1021~~~
Madrid can feck off.

If he goes to Real Madrid it will be a HUGE shame, massive loss.

Always struggled with goalkeepers other than Schmeichel and VDS, let's not get rid of DDG.

1022~~~
I think he will end up there at some stage,the question is who the hell can we replace him with ?

1023~~~
No one at the moment.

1024~~~
If DDG moves to Madrid, then it's a no-brainer that we should look at Cech or Begovic.

1025~~~
Agree on Cech. He's still got another quality 7 to 8 years in him.

1026~~~
Player X is linked with United and they are looking for an improved contract with their existing club.

United player Y is linked with a move away and we descend into panic.

1027~~~
How old is he now? I think 7 to 8 is pushing it, 4 or 5 is more likely, IMO.

1028~~~
I don't think Chelsea would sell us Cech. They didn't consider us a rival when they sold us Mata but we've spent so much since then.

Lloris would be my first choice if De Gea keeps stalling.

1029~~~
I don't rate Lloris and Cech is nowhere near his best anymore. But De Gea is not going anywhere just because Marca (who we all know publish articles out of thin air about every player, fake or real) is saying Madrid want him and his agent wants him to go. Nowhere else is reporting it, and they already have Navas (who they should be playing). It really annoys me to see how our fans can say we're the biggest in the world yet panic and act like we're a selling club like Everton because some shitty newspaper has linked one of our players to another club. Get over it.

1030~~~
United aren't the biggest club in the world though. Madrid happen to be one of the clubs that are bigger and it's also the city where De Gea grew up. I think it's understandable that people are a little worried about these rumours.

1031~~~
To be fair Lloris and Cech are probably the best <i>available </i>keepers in the world and Cech has done nothing wrong in the past few seasons to go as far as saying he's nowhere near his best. 

Madrid want the shiniest new toy, De Gea is absolute quality with a massive potential and will probably be one of the best of his generation along with Courtios but Madrid have two keepers so the only way I see them ''coming'' for De Gea is when he is established as the best goal keeper in the world and the Spainish no.1.  Maybe I'm naive but I don't see De Gea ever leaving us.

1032~~~
I didn't say we were, just said other people say we were then freak out over nonsense stories.

I don't see De Gea leaving for them in the near future, contract talks aren't done in ten seconds like on football manager.

1033~~~
Exactly! It really is laughable. One report in Marca and people are already discussing potential replacements! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> De Gea seems to love it here and I would be surprised if he doesn't renew his contract. Also if in the unlikely event he was to leave I can't see him going to Real as he is a huge Athletico fan.

1034~~~
Seemingly he didn't at the start of his United career, hopefully he has a different train of thought these days..

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.givemesport.com/511776-david-de-gea-was-horrendous-when-he-join-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.givemesport.com/511776-david-de-gea-was-horrendous-when-he-join-manchester-united</a>

1035~~~
A lingering doubt in the back of his mind which has been twisted into him actually wanting to leave. Who wouldn't have doubts when your career doesn't start in the best of form etc. The fact he did press on and overcome his doubts shows to me, that he wanted to stay and become a great player for us, not someone else. Give me sport is hardly the best sporting website to prove a point, as well.

1036~~~
What a paranoid clusterfeck this thread is.

He'll sign a new contract and stay here for a few more years at least.

1037~~~
The only way I can see De Gea leaving is if we fail at top 4 again and he wants to go to Spain. Aside from that, we can offer De Gea anything Madrid can offer him.

And it's really debatable who the biggest club in the world is at the moment. We surely have a bigger fanbase and our revenues, when you include the Chevrolet and Adidas deals, are equal or even exceede theirs.

1038~~~
As posted above the fact he considered leaving during the early days is completely irrelevant now. The main reasons he was considering his future at the club back then was the criticism he was getting from the press and the fact he was struggling to adapt to the league. Neither of these are issues anymore. He recently said that he hopes to emulate the likes of Schmeichel and Edwin at the club. He hardly thinks he is going to be able to do that if he leaves after only a couple of years at the club and one league title to his name.

1039~~~
Yeah, I think he'll definitely stay if we get back into the Champions League.

1040~~~
Nobody is panicking you whoppers. There is no reason not to discuss who could replace him. It's an interesting question to pose; if he quit football altogether tomorrow then who would you seek to replace him? 

Cech is 32 and is coming off the back of an excellent season. He really would be a no brainer for any top team looking for a goalkeeper. Perhaps Madrid can nab him after Dave signs his new contract.

1041~~~
Hope that he starts playing regularly for his country. He is still young but could be a possibility of him returning to Spain to improve his chances of cementing a place in his NT.

1042~~~
No chance he'll leave just to play for spain, if he's playing regularly in one of the biggest clubs in the world and playing well, he will cement his spot. If Costa is starting and he plays in the exact same league, how come De gea has to leave to get game time?

1043~~~
That is true about Costa, I sightly worry that it could still be a factor though. Del Bosque really sticks by players, however he probably won't be manager to much longer given his age and how Spain are fairing.

1044~~~
I predict (and hope) De Gea not getting games is more to do with Del Bosque having certain players who he favours over others, and as you say, he may not be in charge much longer. He does seem very loyal to the certain players he believes in, regardless of form. I'm sure Fernando Torres could be playing Sunday League football whilst Negredo and Llorente banged them in for Barca and Madrid respectively, and Torres would probably still get the nod more often than not.

It's surely just a matter of time for De Gea. Casillas, Valdes and Reina's best years are probably behind them, and I don't think De Gea has any real competition in or around his age.

1045~~~
He loves it here, on his 3rd United birthday a few months ago he called the day he signed for United the best day of his life (and got understandably cheeky responses back from Atletico fans who didn't like him saying this). I am not worried that he wants to leave, I just hope we don't wait too long and make clear to him that we want him here for years to come and offer him a new contract very soon.

1046~~~
I can't believe it's taken up to the game vs. Everton for the media to realise he's good. Funny how the stories of him going to Madrid have coincided with this MotM performance, these journo are useless.

1047~~~
de Gea to start this evening then? If I was Spanish I'd be getting pissed at del Bosque if he doesn't

1048~~~
Doesn't make much sense going to Real Madrid as a former athletico madrid youth and fan..
Apart that he looks very much settled and loving it here according to his statements and comments but everything can happen. Nevertheless I believe that we have it covered with Johnstone (he might not be patient in the future as he is only three years or so younger which doesn't give him much hope starting for us anytime soon but he might do curtois and be loaned out in similar fashion. There is also Pereira and that serbian goalkeeper both looks like quality goalkeepers anyway I don't think there is space for speculation about degeas potential move out of old trafford. I absolutely have no doubt that he will be here in 5 years if everything goes well, I rather think he will be here in 10 as well

1049~~~
Starts against lux..about time.

1050~~~
Good luck to him, hope he can nail down a starting position soon.

1051~~~
I'd be bitterly disappointed if he was engineering a free transfer to Madrid by running his contract down but it's Dave...he'll surely sign on for a few years and at least have to decency to allow United to receive a fee should he ever want to leave.

I always thought he'd go to Barca one day so I'm not one of those who think he'll stay for 20 years or whatever, that kind of thing rarely happens. But if he is to leave one day I hope it's done in a way where everyone can be somewhat satisfied.

If Woody is supposedly throwing 50k a week at Blackett, I'm sure he can give Dave a decent pay package to tempt him into staying a few more seasons.

1052~~~
About time from Del Bosque. Should have been starting for the national team 2 years ago.

1053~~~
Finally.

1054~~~
Hope he does well so he can come back to us still buzzing.

1055~~~
Is this his first national team start?

1056~~~
About time. Finally.

1057~~~
Now let's keep everything crossed he does well. He always strikes me as a very confidence driven lad, so a good performance will continue his good run of form, but a bad performance could shake his confidence and possibly set him on a bad run... It's Luxembourg though so I'm sure it'll be the former.

1058~~~
No he started against France in a friendly back in September.

1059~~~
Great to see De Gea get a start for Spain. He is the best goalkeeper they have imo. Should be first choice.

1060~~~
So this is his first start in a competitive game? That's crazy really, but still leaves him with many years of service ahead.

1061~~~
It's probably the right time for him to get phased in more and more, unless Casillas manages to get back to his very best. I could kind of understand why they largely stuck by Casillas during the WC, since he had a lot more experience and suddenly going with De Gea would've been a very sudden change. But now, it might be the right time for De Gea to start playing a lot more often, since he's likely to keep on getting better and better, and is obviously a lot younger than Casillas.

1062~~~
Ya. A really strange one that it took so long for VDB to realise he is Spains best goalkeeper but better late than never I suppose.

1063~~~
Very good to see. Hopefully he makes some incredible saves and Costa injures himself for long enough to be out of the game against us.

1064~~~
I think it's more that in De Gea's early days, Spain had three top keepers in Casillas, Reina and Valdes, meaning he was hardly going to get into the squad nevermind the starting 11, and in later days you still had Casillas starting a lot of the time, even if he wasn't at his best. Of course, it might be that Casillas isn't completely done for Spain yet, but despite De Gea's ability it's understandable why he didn't get a lot of game time for a while. Now, I expect he'll gradually establish himself as their long-term number 1.

1065~~~
Get in.

1066~~~
The thing is for the last 2 years De Gea has been better than those three goalkeepers. Valdes was excellent last season for Barca but De Gea was fantastic for us too. Reina has been in decline for at least the the last 3 years. As for Casillas he has probably only had a real decline in the last 18 months so it is debatable whether Dave should have started ahead of him at the Euro's but he should been in the squad at least. But for Valdes' injury he probably wouldn't have made the World Cup squad either which is a bit of a joke, with the fact Reina was 2nd choice at that tournament taking the biscuit altogether.

1067~~~
Yeah, I'd agree that Reina still managing to be 2nd choice wasn't the best of decisions. It's not easy for a manager to simply put in a younger GK though, especially when Casillas didn't really decline all that much until fairly recently.

1068~~~
Ya the main gripe I'd have is the fact Reina was getting in the squad ahead of him for so long. Like I said it is debatable whether Casillas should have been replaced earlier. It could have been done before the World Cup but VDB would never has just thrown De Gea in the deep end in the tournament itself.

1069~~~
I'm kind or glad he didn't get the go ahead in the world cup, Spain were dreadful and De Gea wouldn't have made a huge difference in that. As the debutant he would've been made a scapegoat for Spain's failed tournament.

1070~~~
Watching the game, he's done well so far. Spain really aren't the side they use to be, de Gea shouldn't even be busy in a game like this but he's been involved.

1071~~~
And as I say that Spain score a second.

1072~~~
Hopefully he gets a clean sheet tonight. Considering the opposition he really should.

1073~~~
Yep, though a CB pairing of Pique & Bartra doesn't fill anyone with confidence! (That said, Barca's not done too badly in the league, have they?).

1074~~~
Yep, but with Mascherano and Mathieu in defence.

1075~~~
Glad to see that De Gea seems to have finally cracked into the starting XI, should have happened before the world cup really. The only situation where I could have see him leaving United relatively soon would have been if his achievements for us had continued to be overlooked in favour of players based in Spain so good news all round.

1076~~~
Very true. It's amazing - their defensive record. Even that 2 doesn't fill anyone with great confidence as a CB pairing.

1077~~~

1078~~~
Give him a lifelong contract.

1079~~~
Awww... I want to cry <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1080~~~
Feck off Real. Sign Dave to a 20 year contract.

1081~~~
3.99 million followers. 
Woah. He's kind of a big deal.

1082~~~
More followers than the official United twitter. 

#BiggerThanTheClub

1083~~~
Casillas only has 3.41 million, even more reason to drop him.

1084~~~
sell him.

1085~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1086~~~
I love him.

1087~~~
It's going to be very painful when he leaves for a club in Spain, whether that be now or in a while.

1088~~~
Or maybe he will stay at United for the rest of his career? Who knows. I don't understand this assumption that he will go back to Spain. There are more Spaniards in the PL than ever before and they seem to settle just fine.

1089~~~
He can go back to Atleti when he's thirty something, they'll get plenty more years out of him. Once his prime years are here he'll be a Manchester United legend. That must be a motivation for him. Isn't he a massive van der Sar fan?

1090~~~
How often do big money transfers happen between two clubs regarding goalkeepers anyway? I can remember people saying the same about Pepe Reina when Liverpool were rock bottom and he didn't end up moving until Liverpool wanted to move him on.

1091~~~
hope the board will offer him a new contract ASAP. if everything is fine i think he is going to be at OT for years to come.

and yes he can return to atletico once he is 35 or something and play a season or two there before retire .

1092~~~
He needs to be offered top top dollar for a young keeper of his stature. not talking 200k a week, but something unparalleled for a keeper of his prestige

1093~~~
Glad he finally started for Spain in a match that wasn't meaningless. Please re-sign him ASAP. I will be devastated if he leaves. My favourite player by a long way.

1094~~~
If he becomes Spains number one I think it is inevitable he will join Real/Barc sooner rather than later

1095~~~
I don't think he's going to play for Real Madrid, he's Atletico fan.

1096~~~
Why does becoming number one make any difference compared to being number two? He'll be travelling with the squad regardless.

1097~~~
Because one of them will want Spains number one...its the way they work

1098~~~
He's Spanish, so if he becomes a really brilliant keeper then Real or Barca will be interested. That stands to reason. Not sure his pecking order in the squad is all that important tbh. His individual performances for United will be just as important. Especially if/when we start competing in the CL again.

Semantics, though. I do agree he'll be on the radar of both those clubs. Probably already is. I'm struggling to think of any really top class Spanish player that came to prominence in a foreign league and <i>didn't </i>end up playing for one of those two clubs. Anyone?

1099~~~
Fernando Torres. Was building a reputation up at Atletico but exploded at Liverpool. Shame it all went downhill for him.

1100~~~
I don't think that's the case at all. Many journalists have praised him since the season we won the league. The story did come up after the Everton game but that's just common sense really. It's when interest in him from the public is at it's highest and he will sell papers so it makes sense to put him in them. I don't think there was an "Is he any good?" thing with him until the Everton game at all, he had a slow season but people clearly rate him highly.

1101~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86346, @RedDevilsUK" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86346/">@RedDevilsUK</a> just suggested David Silva. Good call.

So there's hope!

1102~~~
Javi Martinez too, maybe? Although he's still relatively young and has only really had one top class season so far.

Still, it is quite alarming. It won't be long before Koke heads to Barca too, I think.

1103~~~
Arteta, Reina, Silva, Almunia<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> and Torres. But big spanish players playing outside of la Liga is new.

1104~~~
Arteta started his career at Barcelona and never made it so don't know if could really count him given they had the chance and passed on it.

It depends on how you would define them coming to prominence I suppose (which is getting really pedantic I admit!) For example Reina and Almunia did come to prominence to an extent but there's no way they were ever good enough to play at Madrid or Barcelona. 

I've always been of the same belief that any truly brilliant Spanish players end up playing at Barcelona or Madrid eventually. The one who come over here either aren't actually at that level or they failed there previously. Silva's probably the only one at the moment who's good enough to get in one of their teams. I'd say even the likes of Mata who are very good players aren't at that level.

1105~~~
I hope Real try to sign him, so we can slap a £780M price tag on his head.

1106~~~
I actually think Mata would have been great for the Spain/Barcelona sides in those times when they've looked completely toothless against a packed defence (e.g. - vs. Switzerland in 2010). His end product is a level above that of any Spanish midfielder barring Fabregas and his lack of speed wouldn't really matter in a system where the team is dominating possession and 'letting the ball do the work'. Obviously he's not on top of his game right now but when he's on top form he's easily one of the best players in the league (and I actually think he should have won player of the year over RVP and Bale in 2011-2 and 2012-13).

With De Gea it seems unlikely he'll go to Madrid and hopefully Ter Stegen is a marker that Barca wont be looking for a new keeper any time soon.

1107~~~
The question is "where they ended up ?" And why saying that for Arteta and not for  Reina ? Furthermore Arteta never played for Barcelona fc.

Now Madrid and Barcelona were never in competition with foreign clubs for the best spanish players, so we can't predict what will happen when they miss a young player and let him sign for a big club.

Thiago, De Gea or Silva, may never play for them because they already are in big clubs. And if they want them, they will have to spend a lot.

1108~~~
Indeed. That list bit is very reassuring.

1109~~~
Because I forgot Reina played for Barcelona...

Surely that contradicts the whole thing though? This is getting pedantic but then the question raised is "Didn't end up playing for 1 of them 2?" So Reina and Arteta played for Barca and didn't make it. The fact they came to prominence in a foreign league is somewhat irrelevant to them not ending up at 1 of the 2 big Spanish clubs. The reason they didn't end up there is because they weren't good enough to the first time and never imrpvoed enough to go back (unlike Fabregas for example.)

I don't think spending is ever a worry for Real or Barcelona, if they want someone they will pay the money. Time will tell with the 3 players you mention there though. I don't think Thiago is a brilliant example of someone coming to prominence in a foreign league though, he came to prominence in a hugely successful Barcelona team...he's won La Liga's, Copa del Reys and a Champions League with them so it's not like he was an unknown player. De Gea is probably the most likely of them 3 to go to one of the 2 Spanish clubs, the ship has sailed somewhat with Silva due to age. He's not old but he doesn't seem to suit the current policies at Barca and Real which is buying younger superstar players. 

He's a very good player but I'm not sure if he's one of the best. With Madrid and Barcelona's Spanish players I don't think they play just because they're Spanish it's because they're the best in that position...or one of the best. Casillas, Ramos, Alba, Xavi, Iniesta etc are all brilliant players. I don't know if Mata would be able to consistently play in one of the 2 teams. It's all opinions of course though.

I suppose the point I'm making is that out of all the Spanish players around in other leagues Barca or Real don't need or miss any of them. The only 1 who could come close is De Gea but like you say it seems Barca have that position covered and I don't know if he'd go to Madrid due to previosu ties.

1110~~~
Well as long as we're successful, I think we can keep him happy over here. At least that's what I hope happens <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

On another note, Fergie got a few keepers wrong in his time, but the 3 that he did get right, were phenomenally right.

1111~~~
Silva was who I was going to suggest but Mata is another one I'd say you can make a case for.

1112~~~
Our of interest sake how much would you value him at? His potential is sky high. May I also remind you that Buffon went for €50 million 13 years ago.

1113~~~
50m, or 35m+Ter Stegen or 40m+Keylor Navas or 10m+De Gea for Bale.

1114~~~

£25 million?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1115~~~
For his gloves.

1116~~~
We could throw in a doughnut at that price to sweeten the deal.

1117~~~
£25m is low but you have to remember his contract situation at the moment. I think he will renew with us but if he was to be sold, I'm not sure that we'd get much more than that for him. Probably 30m at best.

1118~~~
Lol.

Seriously they will need to break the transfer record for a goalie to get him, something like £50m. Juve bought a 18 yo Buffon for £32m at the time, must be £50m in todays money minimum.

The worrying thing is that his contract is up in 20 months, and we will never get this kind of cash if he doesn't extend.

1119~~~
If he signs a new contract then we should refuse to sell him unless they pay something ridiculous (and I am talking about world transfer record, something like 100m). Even 50m will be too low IMO simply because we cannot get a great goalkeeper to replace him for that amount of money.

1120~~~
The contract should be the priority and really should've been signed by now. Hopefully it's done by the end of January or next summer could be a long one with constant rumours.

1121~~~
Agree. Before any other transfers or anything else, re-signing De Gea is the most important bit of player business we have to do.

1122~~~
If times get desperate, we should use a Gooner tactic.

1123~~~
If Mata stays, Dave stays.
Full stop.

1124~~~
I think Spain have managed him brilliantly.

Far too often top youngsters are thrown in the deep end of international football when someone more experienced is struggling for form. Spain have played De Gea through the age groups, made him part of two u21 European Championship winning teams and now given him the chance he earned by proving he can keep up his performances for several seasons at the top level. He's still only 23.

Say what you want about Casillas's form over the past year or so but he's captained his country to a World Cup and two European Championships over the past 7 years. He's one of the most experienced players in international football so he absolutely deserved a bit of faith when he was going through a tough period and struggling to get into the Madrid side. Valdes has been part of one of the most successful club sides in decades and was consistently performing at the top level, so he deserved a spot too. Reina has kept up a decent level for a long time, he's nothing special but he's a solid keeper who's been a squad man throughout their success, so it's hardly a surprise that he kept his place. 

Why make De Gea sit on the bench when he could be leading another brilliant Spain u21 side to another tournament win? Is he Spain's best keeper now? Probably. But he's earned his place and proven over a long period that he deserves it.

1125~~~
Andy Mitten's latest piece:

Are Manchester United at risk of losing David De Gea to Real Madrid?

1128~~~
Feck off Mendez, we won't sign Falcao if you don't convince De Goat to sign a new lifetime contract. And we'll ask for Bebe's money back.

1129~~~
He'll stay and sign a new contract. Wait and see.

1130~~~
I'd be surprised if Mendes started to mess us about, we've fattened his pockets a hell of a lot.

1131~~~
Mendes just wants DDG (and himself) to earn more money and I can't blame him after Woodward has probably shown him our bank accounts! 

At least I hope it's just that. When the likes of Shaw (very young and not that experienced) and Fellaini (useless) earn more than him, or Januzaj (young and inexperienced) just earns slightly less than him, he has every right to demand much more money. Just give him what he wants and get done with it, please!!

1132~~~
if he was desperate to leave in a ronaldo like situation it would have to be around 50m+ to madrid or barca

1134~~~
The contract renewal issue is certainly a worry. If it goes down to 12 months on the clock then Real Madrid would certainly bid. Madrid are very anxious about creating a Spanish core, by which they mean a young Spanish NT core. 0 months and Barcelona will be back in the market - despite signing two keepers this summer.

Reina meant nothing to either club. They both had top class homegrown keepers. Mata's ex-Real Madrid, they (and Barca) have had multiple chances to get him, same with Silva - they like them, but they don't see them as essentials or even as first XI.

I hope that all that's happening with DDG is a negotiation. But I admit that if he (and his family) are starting to feel homesick for Spain or if he wants to live fulltime with his girlfriend Edurne (allegedly a Real Madrid fan) then we've got a fight on our hands.

1135~~~
Without an extension to his contract, it would be nothing like that fee. He's a free transfer at the end of next season.

1136~~~
What Madrid want, Madrid will get, especially if it's a Spaniard.

1137~~~
Good thing Cech is gettable from Chelsea, not that fussed if he doesn't commit. I don't know why but he just doesn't strike me as someone who'll stay 10 years + here.

1138~~~
Kin ell, stop panicking, he's not going to leave ffs. Its all paper talk.

1139~~~
There is always paper talk before players leaving.

1140~~~
We should get that time out of him though, or else it was no use to get a young keeper and back him through his growing pains!

1141~~~
So, most of it is bullshit and you should not believe everything that is being said.

1142~~~
I'm quite relaxed about this as I suspect it's just a negotiating tactic to extract more from us. And if he does leave he won't go for free and a replacement shouldn't be too hard to find, in the worst case. And there is always Cech who could be our new Edwin.

1143~~~
He's an Athletico boy, can't see him ending up at Real. He will sign a new contract with us soon enough, the time to worry will be at themed of that contract. He will be at his peak and there will be plenty of clubs sniffing around.

1144~~~
I know the fans want it but if Madrid were that worried about it surely they wouldn't have bought Rodriguez to limit Isco's minutes further... Kroos to limit Illarramendi's etc (I know Illaarramendi wasn't great last season but I think Isco is a very good young player and has the ability to be fantastic).
I think it maybe is inevitable that Madrid will be interested but I still hold hope that he will sign an extension with us. Worryingly I just stumbled across this thread and two of the 4 mentioned have moved on: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/phil-jones-danny-welbeck-david-de-gea-and-tom-cleverley-set-for-new-contracts.390957/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/phil...d-tom-cleverley-set-for-new-contracts.390957/</a> <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1145~~~
I'd be absolutely devastated beyond belief if he left for that circus now. I don't think he will though.

1146~~~
A replacement of the same quality would be very hard to find.

1147~~~
Not worried yet but it is pissing me off that we haven't renewed his contract anytime in the last two years. Obviously we don't know what's going on behind the scenes but he should have got a improved contract at least - he's fecking deserved of it!

1148~~~
I think he'll go back to Spain at some point, but I think he'll sign a new deal soon, and will be here for little while yet.
He may like the idea of going back to Spain (which is understandable), but it's not like he's not happy here, or is actively looking to leave. We've still got him for a while.

I don't see Barcelona as a major threat in terms of signing him. I don't see them spending huge money on a goalkeeper, and they certainly aren't the draw they were three years ago.
It's only Madrid really.
And if they do go for him, they'll probably wait until his stock is at it's highest, knowing them. And we'd surely make sure they don't get him cheap, as a result of his contract.

If, for whatever reason, De Gea isn't interested in Madrid - or visa versa, then I don't really see anywhere else for him to go to. And in that case, I'm sure he'd love to stay here for a decade.

1149~~~
We should just bomb the Santiago Bernabeu, Real Madrid is a detestable club and the fact that they are always trying to sign our players makes it even worse.

Can see both Januzaj and De Gea both leaving us for Real Madrid at some point.

1150~~~
But we like Vato, right guys?

1151~~~
Probably what will happen, but won't be surprised if he doesn't commit. He might want to stay but not his entourage.

1152~~~
People need to calm down. He'll sign a new contract, it's only a matter of time. 

Journos always write garbage during international breaks.

1153~~~
You're right about that and it's a tricky position to fill but, all the same, his departure shouldn't be terminal to our progression or allowed to set us back significantly. Just another sign that people running the club aren't at the top of their game, de Gea's contract should have been sorted ages ago and now Mendes has got us where he wants us and will bleed us dry, he will demand parity with the likes of Fellaini now and he deserves it- and more for his DoF duties too.

1154~~~
I would add the managerial changes at the club has been the main factor in DDG's contract not being top priority.

But I would expect LVG has made up his mind 100% after the Everton result (if he needed convincing) and giving the current media frenzy over his contract I'm pretty sure it will become top priority now! or straight after the January window closes.

1155~~~
I would be really disappointed with that.
I'd like to think that he'd sign a good deal, give it a few years, and possibly go when he's achieved something substantial here, his stock is high and he can be the marquee signing Madrid crave.

And that's what I see happening. The contract issue doesn't change much, in my opinion. If he's going to Madrid, he's going regardless.

1156~~~
Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, Jorge Mendes always wins.

1157~~~
If we lose De Gea, i will be disappointed but i think that it wouldn't necessarily be dramatic because we could have a player that we need in exchange, and that by two ways either by a swap deal for Varane or by demanding a lot of money for him, and then finance the purchase of a CB or a midfielder.

And as for the goalkeepers, there is good prospects at the moments with players like Moya, Leno or Oblak, and there is experienced players like Cech, Mandanda or Valdes who could be available.

1158~~~
He will only have a year next June so it wouldn't put us in a great position. Real would get him on the cheap.

1159~~~
Moya isn't young and Mandanda isn't good enough to be a starter for someone like United, IMO. Not sure Mourinho would let Cech move to us either.

1160~~~
The links with Real Madrid are logical. I expected them to happen at some point but now that they have it is a bit worrying. Please re-sign soon Dave.

1161~~~
Contract renewal talks must be ongoing. Hence all the murmurs of Madrid interest. Nothing to see here IMO. He's a lot more likely to move to Barca

1162~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you are right, he is 30. 
And i think someone of Mandanda level is good enough (he is almost as good as Lloris) if you have a strong team, otherwise you obviously need a top top goalkeeper.

1163~~~
And considering they spent best part of £30m in the summer on two goalkeepers, one of which being a young and very promising keeper I don't see Barcelona making moves any time soon.

1164~~~
Do people think him being ex-Athletico is really going make a move to Real implausible? They're pretty much the flagship club of Spanish football and he's pretty much the future no.1 of Spain for the next decade at least. Put 2 and 2 together.

Either way get him on a big contract. So if he does decide to leave us then it can be for silly money.

1165~~~
He's not just an ex Atletico player, he and his family are lifelong supporters of Atleti, so this can't be compared to the likes of Reyes, Juanfran, Hugo Sanchez, Solari and Schuster. Torres never moved to Real and neither will Koke, who is also wanted by lots of big clubs.

We're the flagship club of the premier league but that doesn't mean any Liverpool or City players/fans want to join us.

1166~~~
Steven Gerrard being the obvious example.

1167~~~
If De Gea does leave we have to get Cech and another younger keeper in. I really hope it doesn't have to come down to that though.

Make him the highest paid keeper in the world.

1168~~~
Stop pissing your pants, de Gea is going nowhere. He keeps talking about how he loves the club and wants to stay, and appreciates how the fans supported him.

Like others have stated, it's just the press deciding to make a few headlines, maybe a leak by the agent to bump up his new deal.

I am fully confident he is going nowhere.

1169~~~
I just think that it's a tactic from Mendes to use Real Madrid, in order to get DDG a better contract, wages... and a better incentive himself.. mister 10% will take is part in a new deal

I won't be afraid by that. Madrid still have Casillas and Navas too

1170~~~
It's not impossible of course but it is less likely. Sometimes players will be loyal to the team they or their family support.

Even if he is Spanish number 1 how much does that realistically make him worth in terms of wages to Madrid that United couldn't match? He won't be on Messi/Neymar/Ronaldo level of super stardom for example. I'm sure United would offer the same or better than Madrid to keep him. 

Whenever you hear him talk he seems happy here. He may not be around forever but I would be surprised if he didn't at least sign a new contract.

1171~~~
God I hope he signs a new contract.

Easily up there with Di Maria in terms of importance to the team.

1172~~~
4 mil followers on twitter, no other goal keeper in the world has so many followers. Indeed, very few outfield players have more followers than him. Therefore there's no way he is leaving us!

1173~~~
Give him the same wage as Neuer and be done with it.

1174~~~
How ? He's not anywhere near his level. That's not how you run a football club. Should be given the same contract as Courtois, certainly not Neuer.

1175~~~
Isn't Courtois on half the wages that Cech is?

Anyway, I don't really see the point in using players at other clubs as the basis for wages. I think you need to more so judge it on their importance to the club, and their importance compared to other players at the club and what they should warrant in contrast to them.

Personally I think DDG is one of our top 5/6 most important players and should be given a wage to reflect that.

1176~~~
To be honest, I always felt that if De Gea kept progressing, it was always a matter of time before he ended up at one of the Spanish Giants

1177~~~
I believe he will sign a new contract,he would be of great help to Vanja Milinković-Savić when he joins next year.

1178~~~
That's not how it works. A lot of our players are/have been on much higher wages than Bayern players, but are/have been nowhere as good as them. DDG at least is much closer to world class level (for me he already is) than those other players on which we have wasted money.

1179~~~
what real madrid wants real madrid gets.

1180~~~
We've been down this road with them a few times now and if they decide the want De Gea, then they'll sign him.

1181~~~
This round of contract negotiations should be a doddle compared to the next contract in 3-4 years! That is when i will be worried.

1182~~~
I hate Real Madrid.

1183~~~
This.
The contract situation right now isn't really that significant. If Madrid want him, it doesn't matter when he last signed a contract - they'll still get him.

I think he'll sign a deal soon, but that doesn't really secure anything, other than more money if he goes.

1184~~~
That's a massive exaggeration. It's also irrelevant, as DDG is every bit as important to United as Neuer is to Bayern, which is what matters.

I'm not worried about DDG's contract, I've every confidence he'll sign a new one soon and that he's not interested in Real.

1185~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1186~~~
Not a sworn Atletico fan though, IMO.

1187~~~
RM basically get the player they want. Once they really go for him in a couple of years, there is not much we can do. Except do our homework, keep scouting goalkeepers and hope his successor is also pretty good. But let's be realistic, contracts dont prevent players from leaving.

1188~~~
Not the most reliable of sources, by all accounts.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.givemesport.com/512737-manchester-united-to-hand-david-de-gea-lucrative-new-contract?autoplay=on" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.givemesport.com/512737-m...vid-de-gea-lucrative-new-contract?autoplay=on</a>

1189~~~
i hope you are right b/c i dont think there are other GK that good around his age except Courtois or Ter Stegen(who's not starting for Barca).

1190~~~
No way will Dave go to Real. You really get the feeling he genuinely loves it here and he's got two friends here, one being his best mate in Mata, the other a player he played youth football with in Herrera.

He's said himself it's an honour everytime he pulls on that shirt, and he wants to stay for many years. Real Madrid may be tempting as it's his home country, but a humble and loyal man like Dave won't just pack up and leave a club that stood by him and trusted him. He loves United, it's clear.

You all need to follow him on Twitter to get a greater sense of that!

1191~~~
A new 5 year double money contract will see things right. I am sure he is excited by what is going on at the club now and wont be in any hurry to leave.

1192~~~
Oh please, Beckham and RVN were sold because SAF wanted them gone, not because they wanted to go to RM. The only player who we wanted to keep and still wanted to go was Ronaldo.

1193~~~
Didn't get Neymar though!

1194~~~
Because De Gea came through Atleti and is a die hard fan for them, and because of how good they are now, I don't think De Gea would go to Real Madrid. He's at one of the 2-3 clubs who could say they are as big globally and commercially as Real Madrid, and surely last season was just a one off and we'll be back to challenging for everything come next year. Having so many latino players certainly can't hurt either, with De Gea having plenty of good friends at the club like Mata (for now) and Herrera.

Of course, anything is possible, but I hope he doesn't and I don't think he will leave anytime soon. He genuinely seems to love it here at United and with him getting the #1 spot at Madrid anyways, there isn't that incentive to go to Madrid as there would have been before.

1195~~~
Nor Falcao.

1196~~~
That's because they did not want Falcao. Remember he was offered to them. 
and who got neymar? and Barca had already paid Santos for the rights to buy first.

1197~~~
Not talking about now, in the past they wanted him.

1198~~~
There was no way Atletico would have sold him to Madrid though. He was hoping to join Madrid after Monaco.

1199~~~
This nonsense is completely manufactured. His agent is Mendes though.

1200~~~
It's well-known RM also tried everything to get Neymar, including willing to get involved in all the wrong-doings Barca did to get him.

1201~~~
Barca had already made the first move. 

Its amazing how Neymar and his father made somewhere around 60m pounds off that transfer. And who knows what type of under the table money Barca gave on top of that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1202~~~
For a period Barcelona arguably surpassed Madrid as the club to join.

1203~~~
Just like all of the rumours before Januzaj signed the contract. Hopefully it turns out the same.

1204~~~
Oh please what? Real spent an entire fecking season publicly tapping up Ronaldo. The first question he was asked at the conclusion of the 2008 European Cup final was "are you staying?" What makes you think they wouldn't try something similar with De Gea? So you can shove your "oh please" where the sun doesn't shine.

1205~~~
"Ferguson adds Van Nistelrooy asked for a clause to be inserted into a new contract after his second, 44-goal season with United which would enable him to join Real Madrid. Eventually, United agreed to a £35 million figure a year later, believing the price would deter any potential bidders."
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/22/sir-alex-ferguson-autobiography-van-nistelrooy_n_4141315.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/201...n-autobiography-van-nistelrooy_n_4141315.html</a>

According to Sir Alex, van Nistelrooy was eyeing Madrid before United wanted him gone.

1206~~~
Or Ribery. Bayern said "Feck off." When he signs this contract we can do the same.

I am not too worried to be honest for now. Iker is still at Real and has more years on his contract, they also signed Navas, who will get a chance, when they drop Iker. Barca has Ter Stegen for the long-term and even if he is a flop, they still have a decent keeper in Bravo. I think a return to Atletico is something which isn't completely unlikely, if they continue like that under Simeone. But right now, he won't leave us.

1207~~~
"“It was harder to leave Manchester United. That was my club, like PSV and Den Bosch. Real Madrid was different. I had a tremendous time there and a warm relationship with the fans, but Real is more business like. I had a reason to go and they had a reason to allow me. That’s all good. With Manchester, I had that thing with Sir Alex Ferguson and that hurt. That was emotional. For him too, I suppose. I didn’t have that emotional layer with Real. But I look back at my period there with great joy and pride and some of my best mates were there. I count Guti, Raul and Casillas as good friends and playing with Beckham is always a thrill.”"


It depends on who you want to believe. As much as I love SAF, he always tries to justify his mistakes. Also, Ruud wanted to leave because he was getting benched in his last months and his problems with SAF, not because he loved Real Madrid or something.

Really, the notion that Real Madrid is some kind of an impossible to stop juggernaut that buys every player they want is absurd. Most of their buys are done by paying ridiculous sum of money to smaller clubs while the other big clubs are unwilling to pay. If we wanted to, we could spend like Real Madrid and not many clubs are going to reject us (like this transfer window). By all accounts, Ancelotti and Real Madrid wanted to keep Di Maria, but Di Maria wanted to leave... What does that make us?

I stand by what I said: the only player we didn't want to sell and we sold was Ronaldo. We were the best club behind Barcelona at the time that he left us and certainly the biggest commercial giant, yet he left us... Why? More money, better weather, similiar culture.

1208~~~
With other words, Real dont get anyone they want.

1209~~~
On the positive side, you couldn't really ask for a better potential bidder than Real, once they start their muppet media campaign and start giving promises to their fans over potential signings they end up having to pony over the dough, 85mill for Bale for just one example.
If DDG doesn't end up signing a new contract for whatever reason at least we can charge extortionate amounts to those chimps, even with a year left on his deal it's not likely they'll want to wait around, muppet hysteria demands instant gratification.

1210~~~
Apparently van Nistelrooy wanted a Real Madrid clause as early as two seasons in. According to Sir Alex, this was actually one of the things that initiated the friction.

But I guess we'll never know. van Nistelrooy loving United and finding it hard to leave doesn't mean he didn't want to go to Madrid.
But, it's not really important anyway.

True about the money. Obviously that plays a big part. But Madrid, in my opinion have a different type of prestige, especially to players from Portugal, Spain, South America.

I thought Di Maria <i>didn't </i>feel wanted by Madrid? Ancelotti loved him, but Di Maria didn't feel valued, and Madrid weren't willing to pay him what he wanted:
<i>"I never said I wanted to leave Real Madrid, I never wanted that, but you have to move when they don't want you. Let them say what they want about me, the millions they received for selling me will help the Real Madrid economy very well."</i>

And he was reportedly as interested (maybe more interested) in moving to PSG.

It may have been a situation, like with Ozil, where they effectively force the player out (for a new signing) and try to spin it to make it look like the player forced <i>his </i>way out.
That's fair enough. We aren't a selling club, so it's not surprising. And we've rarely had South Americans, Portuguese or Spanish players.
Ronaldo left us because - to him - Madrid, despite having a weaker team at the time, are/were bigger. There's no shame in that.
Money and culture was obviously a factor too, but I don't think they'd have even needed to pay him much more to convince him.

But it's not like we couldn't have bought Robben, Sneidjer or Makelele off them in similar circumstances to Beckham if we wanted, so it's not like it's a one way street.

1211~~~
Well, I think it's obvious that Spanish speaking players are going to prefer RM considering most their whole team speaks Spanish and their culture is not that different from the South American countries, but money is the biggest part. Nobody had heard about PSG or City a few years ago, but now they buy any player they want because of the money. If club "A" offers more money and better wages to the player and the club that it wants to buy the player from than club "B", who has a much richer history, then club "A" will get the player 9 out of 10. It's just how it is.

By all accounts RM and Ancelotti wanted to keep him and even wanted to pay his demands, if i'm not mistaken (think Ancelotti said it), but Di Maria wanted to leave. I don't know, if Di Maria wanted to come to United or PSG, but he definetly wanted to leave Madrid while they wanted to keep him which kinda proves my point.

To him... well, I don't know how to take that. Trophy wise? Definetly, but commercially we were the top team in 2009 and I imagine, if Ronaldo decided to stay, we would have never been taken over by Real Madrid in that regard. I don't really know what made Ronaldo go to real Madrid, maybe it's his boyhood team or something, but it doesn't really matter.

The point I'm trying to get across is that any club that is willing to pay an absurd amount of money for a player is not going to be denied, it's just that Real does it way more often than any other club. I sincerely doubt we would have accepted their offer for anything less than a world breaking fee at the time. Example: If we offer to Barca 400 million and double Messi's wages, you seriously think they won't agree? Getting Bale for 100 million from Tottenham isn't something amazing, it's just throwing money around.

1212~~~
I haven't seen any reports to suggest Madrid wanted to keep Di Maria. Ancelotti clearly did though.
Ancelotti (as he would) claims that Di Maria demanded too much money.
Di Maria's father (as he would) claims that Di Maria had barely had a wage rise since joining the club, and didn't feel valued or wanted.

My hunch is that, like Ozil, they saw an opportunity to make good money on a player who wouldn't fit in once the new guys arrived.

Derailing the thread quite a bit anyway. So I'll probably leave it at that.

1213~~~
I've not been keeping up with this thread so this may have already been mentioned:

The Mirror reporting we've offered him £120k per week apparently.

1214~~~
First time I think United isn't offering enough money (if this is true)

1215~~~
Reckon the Madrid rumours were spread by his agent so the deal at United can be wrapped up here. He seems happy here, although it must be hard maintaining a long distance relationship especially as she seems to be very busy in the public eye in spain looking at Insta and twitter. I have every faith he will stay. I now seems to get the club and the fans and their is a bond between him and the fans and it will only increase now his English has progressed to a level that he will do interviews in english. He still has work to do to improve to the level he should eventually reach but he is in the top 5 in the world. The state of goalkeeping is at a high level with Neuer setting the standards and De Gea and Courtois and they are still young!

1216~~~
What? If that source is true he'd be the best paid goalkeeper in the world.

1217~~~
Sounds like a pretty good wage to me. If it is true then his next contract renewal will be very, very large.

1218~~~
120 k sounds good. And in 3 years when we renew again then we can offer 150 - 180 k so RM/Barca don't even think about touching him <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1219~~~
Compared to other goalkeepers it would be the right/a high fee, but if I compare to other players in our team, Januzaj, Shaw, Young, Fellaini, Rooney, that's not enough.

1220~~~

1221~~~
I think Neuer is on a little bit more and Casillas is on around £150k a week, but he would be one of the best paid for certain.

1222~~~
Yeah, what I said above:

This contract situation doesn't really create any new issues in terms of him staying or going.
Signing a new contract barely does anything to prevent Real Madrid getting him if they wanted to.
What it does is bump the price though, so I guess that's good enough.

1223~~~
If he wanted to be a top earner he should have become a fast winger with good crossing and some skills on the ball or a goalscoring striker. He became a worldclass goalkeeper instead and goalkeepers earn less money.. eventhough they are just as important.

1224~~~
I love the Caf... Everywhere I look it's people saying how United is the biggest club in the world, then I look at the transfer forum and at our best players threads and the same people act like we are fecking Stoke. Apparently players are only here because Madrid or Barca didn't want them yet...

And all this because in our whole history we sold one player that we didn't want to and that was after him being unhappy for at least 2 years and getting for him two times the transfer record at that time. 

The same guy who came out and said that he was feeling like a slave at United, yet he still has his name sang every game, but you can rarely hear Scholes(or most of the other United true legends) chants. It makes me sick every time I hear it.

1225~~~

Great video, dunno if it's been posted before!

1226~~~
I hate videos with effects and music but feck me this is absolutely quality.. he's so fecking good <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1227~~~
It's only really being discussed in this thread. And it's quite obvious why it's being discussed in this thread.

1228~~~
In my game of FIFA he got upset about the weather and put in a transfer request. Board sold him for £11m.

1229~~~
That save at 1:35 was scandalous.

1230~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I love how he celebrates our goals.

1231~~~
Metro reporting that he's agreed a new deal.

1232~~~
Hope that is true.. But with Metro you just can't rely on them for info.

Edit: in the above video around 1:40 his celebration of our goal is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1233~~~
Loved that. Dave <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1234~~~
Enjoyed that. So many outrageous saves in his career already, I'd struggle to pick my favourite. There was one against Sunderland, I think, where I thought he had no right saving it, just like the Mata save from the top corner. The last Everton one a couple of weeks ago also ranks very high. 

When he retires, whoever does a highlight reel is going to need a lot of patience, cos it's going to take ages to put together! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1235~~~
The Sunderland one was ridiculous. The guy even started celebrating after he headed the ball! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1236~~~
That mata save from the top corner will probably go down as my favourite save of all time, it was just a moment that stays with you.

Also make him captain.

1237~~~
Mata was ready to run off celebrating. Incredible save that was.

1238~~~
I wish somebody would cut the invisible rope that ties him to his line when a striker goes through one on one with him.

1239~~~
I was just about to post the same. One would be insane to blame him for their goals, but how often does DDG actually save a one on one situation? He's a little to hesitant when coming off his line. Remember when strikers faced Schmeichel? They shat themselves.

1240~~~
One on ones are a weakness of his, of that there is no doubt. Thisis one area where Neuer is vastly superior to him.

1241~~~
Thought his positioning was a bit better last night than the Leicester goal I was complaining about. A good 3 or 4 yards further out. Almost got a hand to what was a brilliant finish, off the base of the post.

1242~~~
When you see the replay when Berahinho goes through he actually takes a step backwards even closer to his line. I do wonder if it's coached into him or he doesn't like coming off his line for whatever reason. If I was a striker though I'd be wanting a keeper backing away in one on ones.

1243~~~
Pretty much every keeper is better than him on one on ones chances. He should really fix that part of the game, otherwise the likes of Neuer and Courtuis will always be better than him.

About those type of chances, I think that Valdez might be the best one I have ever seen. Neuer, Buffon, Schmeichel and Casillas were all great too. Generally great keepers are good at it, with De Gea being the exception. If the defense is great, it won't matter that much but when you have two David Luiz's above you on defense, then really being good at it matters.

1244~~~
Actually, you're spot on. I misremembered the incident. He takes several steps backwards as Berahino approaches the box. Is standing on his 6 yard box when the ball goes past him. After last weeks heroics it's really frustrating to see him getting the basics wrong again. FFS...

EDIT: can't get the fecking thing to embed. here's a <a class="externalLink" href="http://notvine.co/v/1136078986561404928/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>

1245~~~
I don't see one on ones as his weakness, in fact I don't see many a keeper better at that than him. A few of his very best saves have come from the one-on-ones like with Suarez, Osman last week and so on. I do agree that he's gotta make himself bigger and make it a lot tougher for the striker in those situations, he's rather relying too much on reflexes I think.

1246~~~
It's even worse if you close the gap and the player goes around you. A player should score a one on one 100% of the time, any time he doesn't, the blame lies solely with the striker.

1247~~~
It's not though. You're actually forcing the striker to make a decision if you come out. As it is he can run through unimpeded with all the time in the world to pick your spot. The striker actually gave De Gea a chance by hitting it so early.

1248~~~
Using that logic, De Gea doesn't deserve any of the praise he got for saving a penalty last week.

1249~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">'I'm happy here' - De Gea dismisses Real Madrid links</span></b>

David de Gea has brushed off links with a move to Real Madrid, insisting he is happy at Manchester United.

The Spanish goalkeeper, who joined the Reds from Atletico Madrid in 2011, has overcome an inauspicious start to his Old Trafford career to become a reliable performer between the sticks.

And his impressive form has recently seen him touted as a potential replacement for Iker Casillas at the Santiago Bernabeu.

However, when asked about the rumours by <i>Kicker</i> , the 23-year-old said: 


De Gea has been one of few United stars to avoid criticism during a difficult start to the new season under new boss Louis van Gaal.

But the former Atletico star believes things will get better as the Reds push for a return to the top four.
</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px">
De Gea also underlined the importance of Sir Alex Ferguson's support during a run of patchy early form following his move to United.

1250~~~
Good news. I would hate to lose him. Don't get me wrong, I wish the lad the best, but we need him.

1251~~~
Another brilliant performance.

1252~~~
Currently, 3rd best keeper in the world in my opinion, subject to change. Was brilliant today. Should be Spain's number 1 without a doubt.

1253~~~
He is not good enough

<span style="color: #ffffff">according to Gaz</span>

1254~~~
Seemed quicker off his line today. Did brilliantly in that one v one with Hazard. Good stuff.

1255~~~
He was class again today. Safe hands.

1256~~~
Brilliant goalie, absolutely brilliant. He's so much better at controlling the box these days.

1257~~~
Brilliant keeper. Nothing between him and Courtois, both part of the top 3 keepers in the word by far.

1258~~~
He saved a one on one!!

1259~~~
A couple of fantastic saves today. After his disappoint start, he's hitting his best form again.

1260~~~
Made the two best saves of the game. Neville barely even mentioned anything he did, but gave Courtois the MOTM and gushed over everything he did, including a fairly simple punch from a cross. I'm not doubting Courtois' quality, and he was good today, but De Gea kept us in it on two or three occasions.

1261~~~
Superb. Played better than Courtois for me. Both quality keepers but with the lack of protection from the defenders, I think De Gea's playing better than Courtois. 

Get him the new contract....

1262~~~
He's the business. We need to get that new contract signed as soon as possible.

1263~~~
Anybody else notice him pointing to the other side of the goals when Hazard got in for the one on one?

1264~~~
Van Gaal in the presser just called him fantastic.

No worries with him at all. Just sign a contract

1265~~~
Another good game.

1266~~~
He seems on fire. Would hate to lose the kid, he is in the top 5 of Goal Keepers in my book.

1267~~~
Big Dave

1268~~~
Coming into his own after a slow start. Wasn't great against West Brom, but after his performance today his saves against Everton really could prove as a catalyst for an upsurge in form. Incredible save against Hazard too and dominated his area.

1269~~~
What a man. We need to tie him down until he retires.

1270~~~
Everything was comfortable for him or straight to him [/Gary Neville]

1271~~~
Did Neville say that?

1272~~~
2 huge saves today.


He doesn't command his box as Courtois though.

1273~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I didn't want to be too harsh on Neville again but that's what it sounds like sometimes, almost brushed aside the save because Courtois commands his box.

1274~~~
To be fair Dave doesn't have Gary Neville holding him up so he can suck his balls.

1275~~~
I think with us lacking in height on set pieces he really should be helping out in coming out and catching/punching out more balls. Courtois always is on front foot while De Gea seems to stick to his line more. Think he lacks in frame and height and hence has struggled in that department previously but is something he needs to grow into.

1276~~~
Said both in commentary, whilst at the same time choking his cock when Courtois caught a floated cross.

1277~~~
Been a bit tired with some of Neville's agendas when it comes to his United punditry recently.

1278~~~
Epic save from Hazard, need to see more of that, deserved more from the resulting corner <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1279~~~
I can only assume that Mata, Rafael and DDG gang banged his mum and sent him the full 5 hour uncut DVD.

1280~~~
Neville's infatuation with Courtois was embarrassing. Things like catching the ball were suddenly the hallmark of a great goalkeeper.

1281~~~
While David Moyes, Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young managed to prevent those 5 hours from going on any longer.

1282~~~
Courtois' a top quality keeper to be fair and made some good saves today, but it'd be nice to see Neville give De Gea some more praise.

1283~~~
He really does love Courtois. More or less every cross he caught, Neville was praising him. De Gea plucks a few corners out of the air and nothing is said.

1284~~~
He definitely is however there were a couple of moments where all he did was catch the ball (I'd have fancied my chances) and suddenly it was proof that he was the best goalkeeper to have ever lived.

1285~~~
It is beyond absurd. De Gea was arguably even better than Courtuis today and made some unbelievable saves, including a perfect one to one save. He was also great on the air, catching the ball there but no praise at all, while on the other hand Courtuis was getting praise for the same things.

Can't stand at all Neville commenting. It seems very personal with quite a few players (on both praising and criticizing). He was great on his first year, but since then he has been so bad that I have to change my stream when I see him as a pundit.

1286~~~
probably SAF said that he loves them more then he loves him.

1287~~~
Neville has something against him. Courtouis superior to him, let alone MOTM? Give me a fecking break.

1288~~~
yeah it was a bit ridiculous. I think that the Liverpool's legend Rawkish magic dust is starting to rub on him

1289~~~
Thought both GKs were excellent but a bit weird by Neville to give one without the other so much praise! If DDG had been Hart then you get a feeling Neville would be praising him! Bit pish by Gaz!

1290~~~
Courtouis is not better than him, and certainly not superior. I love Neville but somethimes it's like he's on something!

1291~~~
Neville giving Courtois MOTM today was bizarre. If you exclude everyone else for a second and just compare the two goalkeeping performances, De Gea was better, he made the better saves today and didn't put a foot wrong either.

1292~~~
I loved LvGs comment at the end regarding the MOTM award: "But their keeper did not do what DDG did"

1293~~~
I think Nev was just trying to big up United's peformance. Good on him really. Might give us a confidence boost if the media narrative has their keeper as MOTM.

1294~~~
He's definitely on something when it comes to de Gea. It goes way back to that Spurs game in January 2013 where he crucified him for their last minute equaliser.

1295~~~
I haven't been taking Neville seriously for over a year now. With ppl like him England will get nowhere, but couldn't care less. I am sure DDG doesn't take what he says seriously either, I just hope also in future Neville stays as far away from United as possible.

1296~~~
De Gea eh? He's certainly proved Ferguson was right to take a punt on him and have total faith in him even when things were not going so well. I truly hope we hang on to him because he's going to be the top goalkeeper in the world in the not too distant future.

1297~~~
You think it was that contrived? He did praise our performance in the studio, calling it our best of the season against a strong Chelsea (which I'd agree with), so perhaps. I still think it was an odd choice, mind.

1298~~~
I think we need an outing of the clowns who suggest he's not good 1vs1

1299~~~
Yep, very odd decision.  I dobut either goalie deserved it, but in a straight shoot-out between the two, it was only De Gea who had made a true world-class save.  

Just very unfortunate for De Gea that his wonder-save led to the corner they scored from.

1300~~~
they compare him to Neuer and Courtois, so he is good but not as good as them basically.

1301~~~
Saves one 1vs1 and we need an outing? What? He has to do this more often.

1302~~~
He's not goot at 1vs1. It was a fantastic save (actually I can't remember a better one on these situations) but generally he's not as good in these cases as the likes of Neuer, Courtuis and co. On other aspects of defending he's every bit as good as them (or even better when it comes to shoot stopping).

1303~~~
Nah no way, he was blowing smoke up Courtois arse all game and belittling everything DDG did.

1304~~~
Makes no sense otherwise. Neither keeper did enough to be MOTM.

1305~~~
When Hazard went through, I just sank and my eyes closed as I didn't want to see the ball hit the net, when I heard that De Gea saved it, it felt just like a penalty save. He is still proving just what a great keeper he is.

1306~~~
I don't get why people think Neville praising Courtois means he is belittling De Gea.  Courtois did have a very good game today and looks a very good keeper.  He made 3 good saves and was really commanding in dealing with Di Maria's crosses.  He just kept coming and claiming them almost from every delivery.   Until the goal, he did not put a foot wrong and in a game where there was no real outstanding player I could see why he would give him MOTN.   He also made the MOTN decision before we equalised.

Who else was there?  No one outfield player from Chelsea or United had beyond a decent game.  I thought Shaw, Smalling and Fellaini all played relatively well for United but there were large parts of the second half when United were hardly in the game.  I'd say the same for Chelsea as well.

1307~~~
True or false statement? I say true.

1308~~~
Because when Courtois did pretty much anything, Neville praised him. When de Gea made some good saves he either didn't say anything at all or detracted from it saying, for example, that Drogba shot too close to him. If it was Courtois in goal and van Persie making that shot, he'd have praised Courtois.

1309~~~
That save from Hazard was as good as that one vs Everton for me.

1310~~~
Reminds me a bit of Moscow 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZ6-0TAegHY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

That split second is pivotal. Get into the head of the player coming in on you and it can make an impact.

1311~~~
Fantastic save v Hazard and felt he well for there set pieces today. Came of his line and good hands. Certainly glad he is at United <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1312~~~
The 1v1 against Suarez last year was a better save (for the reflex). However, what's being discussed on this page, that he may have actually influenced Hazard, would put it just above.

1313~~~
Don't care about Neville's agenda with Courtois, I was just pleased to see Van Gaal giving him the praise he deserves.

1314~~~
Is that the only example?  Neville saying Drogba shot to close to De Gea when he had that chance.  I seem to recall Neville praising the save against Hazard which was a fantastic stop and he did not criticise anything De Gea did.

He praised Courtois because Courtois looks a really impressive young keeper.  He's commanding, imposing and he made some good saves today.  I was impressed by the way he kept taking crosses out of the sky as well.

Gary Neville praised De Gea against Everton when he was fantastic.  Why would he do that if he has something personal against him.

Do you honestly think Gary Neville, life-long United fan and one club man has something personal against against the current very good United keeper to the point where he would actively belittle him?   It just sounds ridiculous to be honest.

1315~~~
Another fantastic match where he's bailing us out, him hugging RVP after the final whistle was fantastic to watch as well. He's such a goat.

1316~~~
He clearly likes some players more than others and has almost no objectivity when it comes to United and not in a good way.

1317~~~
Thought he was great today, one save I particularly like was the long shot by Willian, I think, that he catched brilliantly.

1318~~~
I will ask the question again do you think Gary Neville, life-long United fan and one club player, has something personal against the current United goalkeeper to the point where he would actively belittle him?  

Can you give an example of where he has no objectivity towards United here?  

Praising Courtois for his performance today is what an objective pundit would do.  He had a good game and looked impressive.

1319~~~
He didn't so much as actively belittle him. He just hardly said anything when de Gea did something well.

1320~~~
Reminds me of Barthez vs Di Canio..lol

1322~~~
I think people hear what they want to hear a lot of the time. 

I've had Liverpool fans tell me they believe Mark Lawrenson is anti-Liverpool. 
And you can find <i>"why does Niall Quinn hate City?"</i> on Bluemoon.

1323~~~
When De Gea saved from Hazard he praised that.    Likewise Neville praised all the saves De Gea made against Everton which was another live game.  When De Gea has done something worthy of praise, Neville has generally given it to him.

Courtois actually had a good game today and was the busier of the two keepers.  By circumstances, he is going to get more praise than De Gea on today's game.

1324~~~
If only he'd used his left hand.

1325~~~
He's quality. Seemed to be off his line a bit more today too which was good.

1326~~~
Saved the one against Dempsey I believe it was two years ago as well against Tottenham at the lane

1327~~~
We need to give him a new contract and soon.

1328~~~
tbh I get Nevilles love of Courtios and rightly or wrongly I get why he doesn't shower De Gea with praise; surely no one can argue that when it comes to dominating his area Courtios does it better than De Gea and its that confidence and ability to do so which gives Neville a hard on. As for his seeming lack of desire to shower De Gea with praise can anyone really say hand on heart however well De Gea does week in week out you don't have it in the back of your mind he does have a mistake in him? That's the difference between the two in the eyes of 'most' one looks solid as a rock and the other you can't help but remember the past

Once Courtois starts to make the odd mistake (which will happen) balance will no doubt be restored....although I'm sure in the media they still rate Hart > De Gea so maybe not....

1329~~~
I think Courtois can thank the defence he has in front of him for that though, can't he? De Gea has hardly had any settled back four in front of him for at least 18 months. If they had the defensive injuries we've had I'd have liked to see how he got on then.

1330~~~
Nevilles love for Courtois goes back to his Madrid days so not just this season

As for a settled defence De Gea hasn't had that for the 4 years he's been here <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1331~~~
Hand on heart, I have no worries over De Gea whatsoever and even today when Hazard went through I thought he'd save it. He's just turned into a brilliant keeper, and those mistakes he made with crosses were basically completely eliminated 2 years ago almost. Since the start of 2013, he's been brilliant all around, with very little mistakes. All keepers make the occasional blunder, like De Gea vs Sunderland in the Capital one cup, and Courtois had a few of them last season as well I remember.

1332~~~
Great today. The save vs Hazard was brilliant, was gutted they scored for the following corner. 

As for Neville I would have to agree he was a little OTT with his praise for Courtois. De Gea was the better keeper today. Not that Cortouis wasn't good, he played well but De Gea made better saves throughout the game for me. I have gone off Gary Neville tbh. He was really good in his first year but since he's been tied up with England and Phil was coaching at United I've found plenty of his analysis to be inconsistent and at times wide of the mark. I think him and Carragher talk a good game but I don't have confidence in either of them as future coaches sadly.

1333~~~
He seems to be becoming more vocal towards the men in front of him. Does anyone think he could be the, kind of, defensive leader we need?

1334~~~
That would have gone down as legendary if Di Canio had been fooled by it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1335~~~
I agree. Although I think Neville would make a good first team coach - but not as a manager.

1336~~~
True. the moment Hazard looks up is when DDG raises his arm, tricking hazard into thinking he will dive that way, hazard then shoots the other way. I always do it when im in goal saving penalties and it usually works.

1337~~~
I can't believe someone just said De Gea isn't good at one on ones.

1338~~~
Was fantastic again today. That save from hazard was so good, I was proper gutted for him when they scored straight after.

That and the saves against Everton, he's been on fire recently.

1339~~~
He should literally be given a Spiderman costume instead of the traditional goalkeepers kit. Why isn't he allowed to wear a spiderman costume? Makes no sense.

1340~~~
I`ve been critical of David De Gea in regards to 1 on 1s where his attempts should have been better against Leicester for their 4-3 goal..

but he`s had a few ridiculous 1 on 1 saves... against Hazard today, then against Everton the other day, and who remembers this against Liverpool from Suarez. This is just a ridiculous piece of goal keeping!

1344~~~
Courtois catches a ball pinged just over his head and he gets praised for it. I see nothing special in that.
Anyone else notice he raised his left hand on this occasion as well? Did it yesterday for the Hazard save.

1345~~~
Left hand raising is very important. It makes hazard not take the obvious choice of putting it to far corner and makes him instantly go to the near corner and de gea is there.
Van der sar did the same to nicolas anelka in the champions league final. That was the save that won us the champions league.

1346~~~
He was great in the air, Chelsea had so much corners in the first half, but he was the boss in the box, good thing.

1347~~~
Think this hand raising is getting analyzed a bit too much. The speed at which Hazard went past our defenders was electric. It all happened in a matter of seconds. No way he could have looked up and seen where De Gea's hand is pointing. Strikers are supposed to use peripheral vision. I bet Hazard just looks up enough to see where De Gea is positioned and chooses a side to shoot. De Gea anticipates it perfectly and goes the right way to stop it. His left hand plays no part in Hazard's decision making process.

During penalties it's a different thing, but in open play when the tempo is so quick it doesn't make a difference. Don't have any problem with him trying to distract the striker though. It may work once in a while.

1348~~~
Collected everything with ease today and made a couple of excellent saves, nice to hear the praise for him by LvG ain the post match interview.

1349~~~
It's this forum, opinions change every minute

1350~~~
Slowly but surely he is finding his best form after a shaky start. If we finally have a settled back 4 and midfield, he will get his clean sheets.

1351~~~
Waving his left hand again, just like yesterday.

1352~~~
Isn't that another example where his positioning in 1 on 1 situations is questionable and his absolutely fantastic shotstopping ability bailed him out? He just kept his position and I'd argue a goalkeeper who is moving towards the attacker and closes down the angle will save more goals in a situation like that in the longterm, even if he's not as good a shotstopper as de Gea.

Yesterday he made two small steps towards Hazard, and even though he still looked a bit timid coming off his line in that moment, I'm pretty sure that was way more influential in that situation than the hand waving thing. Hazard had less time to shoot and a smaller angle on either side of de Gea. Good signs though, Frans Hoek is a fantastic goalkeeping coach and will make de Gea a more proactive goalkeeper. I wouldn't be worried at all, de Gea will continue to improve in these situations.

1353~~~
Exactly, in his peripheral vision, he sees movement towards one side of the goal, so he puts it the other way. You're right that it won't always work though, as a lot of strikers aren't reactive in that situation and would just pick a side regardless.

1354~~~
I'm not GK coach, but on the Liverpool one, if he came rushing out, I think he could have made it easier for Suarez in the way the ball sat up for him.

His one-on-ones in general are not top level though I think. It didn't get as much praise, but Courtois' save against RVP when he came rushing out, I thought was brilliant, I don't think even RVP knew he was there.

1355~~~
I think the problem is when ex players become pundits is it's a lose/lose situation for them. Whenever I see Neville or Carragher for example they tend to be overly critical of their ex clubs. Maybe it's so they're not accused of biased. I bet if Neville came out singing De Gea's praises yesterday for example he'd of got stick off other fans for being biased. Same as what happens if Carragher praises Liverpool. As a result they tend to be more critical which annoys our fans but not others as much.

1356~~~
Probably says more about RvP. He should have been expecting it, but it was a good save nonetheless.

1357~~~
I noticed that in the game aswell, seems to have taken it on himself more. Also tried a few quick throws, looks like he's been asked to assert himself more.

1358~~~
There is a reason I call him Dave the Cat <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1359~~~
Good read.

1360~~~
Still hasn't signed a new contract <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1361~~~

1363~~~
Should come as no bloody surprise that he was voted best player of the month. He has so many class saves, but above all, he is starting to imitate VDS by rarely making mistakes these days - soon to be Mr. Consistency.

1364~~~
And still only 24...

1365~~~
Goood stuff. Now let's hope that's the last time this season our goalkeeper is busy enough to win a player of the month award!

1366~~~
23 for another week <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1368~~~
Happy he was voted player of the month, well deserved!

1369~~~
Thought I'd leave this here. Good work by Dan Kennet.

1370~~~
He has turned into a world class player i have to say, when he arrived we could all see his saving was top notch but his all round game lacked. Seems to have put his head down and worked his socks off to improve.

1371~~~
He loves it here. His reaction after RVP's goal.

1372~~~
Wouldnt swap him for any keeper in the world. Sure, neuer is currently the top of the trade, but everything about de gea, and the character he brings is just fantastic. best shot stopper in the world.

1373~~~
How do you define an error though?

1374~~~
God!

1376~~~
He deserves much better, now we won't keep a clean sheet again especially after the red.

1377~~~
This guy is a genuine legend. Our results would look like dog's mess without De Gea.

1378~~~
He's a god. 

15 year contract please.

1379~~~
Dave the save<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1380~~~
Once again the only thing stopping us getting beaten, we'd be 15th if it wasn't for this lad so far this season

1381~~~
He's saving us so far. Hopefully he can come up with a heroic performance and win us a point.

1382~~~
Yet another performance where he plays out of skin to keep us in it, only to be horribly let down by all our other defenders.

He's not going to want to stick around when everything he does turns out to be for naught. He's too good for us at the moment.

1383~~~
Keeping us in the game, once again. 

His task is made harder by the feckheads 'defending' in front of him.

1384~~~
what a goallie we have here.

1385~~~
We're probably gonna need a legendary performance to keep a clean sheet today. As in Neuer vs us 2010/11 legendary.

1386~~~
Terrific saves. Kept us in the game.

1387~~~
If he doesn't get a new contract soon I am going to get concerned.

1388~~~
The guy would be breaking clean sheet records if it it wasnt for that non existent defence in front of him.

1389~~~
Imagine DDG in the era when Ferdy and Vidic were at the peak of their careers! We would have simply forgotten about conceding that our only worry would have been about scoring!

1390~~~
We did... His name was VDS.

Its scary how much DDG reminds me of him

1391~~~
Great again.

1392~~~
True, but when DDG retires, we will have seen a GK that's head and shoulders above VDS.

1393~~~
Giving him a new long term contract should be treated as top priority.

1394~~~
I feel bad for him that he plays absolute blinders and yet we still lose. He must go insane with that defence in front of him.

1395~~~
That's the general feeling for every fan after a game we lose or even concede a stupid goal in. Poor De Gea, such a beast.

1396~~~
Van der Sar didnt have De Gea his reflexes and de Gea isnt influencing the defence like van der Sar could... not yet anyway but it improves with age and experience.

However i believe he was called 'the next van der Sar' while he was still playing in Spain?

1397~~~
For his own sake he should probably just move to madrid, after a year he would be looked at in the same vein as neuer. He's starting to look out of place in our team, streets ahead apart from di maria.

1398~~~
VDS in his prime (and even for us) was a brilliant shot stopper. I think DDG has the advantage over him but the similarities are striking. Both commanding with crosses, good shot stopping, great distribution and are good with their feet.

1399~~~
I still think he has a lot of work to do to be the player some people are seeing in here. 

His shot stopping is excellent, world class in fact, possibly the best in the business. But I still don't think he commands his back 4 well enough, is confident enough coming to get the ball (either along the ground or in the air) and his distribution has regressed since he's been here.

Obviously a few of those are issues of not having a settled back 4 he trusts in front of him as much as anything, but when you have a look at VDS by comparison there's a lot to work on.

1400~~~
Coincidence that he looks brave as a charging Schmeichel in one on one's since Valdes started training with us?

1401~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ffs. Aren't you the cheery chappy?

Who was Di Maria "streets ahead of" yesterday, anyway?

1402~~~
Watching the saves again just makes me shake my head at how brilliant he is. I was wrong to doubt him earlier in the season. He's been our best player for a long time now. A few of the outfield players should look to mirror his consistency.

1403~~~
Get him signed asap and buy him a new defense.

1404~~~
Tbh, yeah its outrageous that he can pull of world class saves nearly every game then almost always our defence will do something stupid and it leads to a goal. Our defence has cost him so many clean sheet bonuses last two seasons.

1405~~~
You can spot points in De Gea's career where he made errors and worked on them with the GK coach - catching/punching being the most obvious. I'd be very surprised if they didn't work on coming off his line following Leicester.

1406~~~
That block of Aguero shot when he closed the angle was brilliant.

1407~~~
It might just be a coincidence,but ever since Valdes has been training with us it feels like DDG has suddenly become imposing in one on one situations.. Not that he was bad before(the save of suarez comes to mind),but these days I have immense confidence that he ll stop even one on one's.. Or maybe all of it is just down to Hoek.. Anyway hope he signs an extension in the near future..

1408~~~

1409~~~
Happy birthday Dave! Give him a nice new contract as a present...

1410~~~
what a save that was.

1411~~~
Happy Birthday you tall Spanish titan.

1412~~~
Give him the keys to Manchester, his own doughnut shop, Lou Macari's chippy, whatever he wants. Just get him signed up asap!

1413~~~
It is a bit of a worry that Real are going to be in the market for a keeper, and that De Gea is the obvious choice.

1414~~~
Real have just bought a young keeper if I am not mistaken. I think DDG might want to return to Spain at some point but I hope that is not for at least another 10-12 years.

1415~~~
Was really pleased with his block on Aguero's one v one. Had been slow off his line in similar situations earlier this season but shot off his line this time. Hopefully the dead leg won't put him off doing it again!

1416~~~
We REALLY need to get him signed up with Real sniffing around. If he does go - and it's kinda understandable why he might, then we need some big money for him so we can get in a replacement.

1417~~~
Thank god that he is happy here, and that he is a true Atleti fan, which should stop him hopefully going aslong as we treat him fairly and with respect.

1418~~~
So the word on twitter is that he will be at Real Madrid next season, that's great, we should be looking to sign players that are not "destined" to go to Madrid at some point, we should focus on signing a British GK next time.

Who represents De Gea? Mendes?

I think he'll sign a new contract, I honestly don't care if it means him as the highest paid keeper in the league. 

All these rumors about Madrid are making me nervous though, I'd actually be hart broken if they took our Spainish Dave <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1420~~~
Please stay Dave <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1421~~~
What exactly does 'the word on Twitter' mean? 

You realise that's no different to saying 'the word on the internet'? 

People on Twitter are no more reliable than anywhere else, and if it's coming from The Express story that he'll go to Madrid if we fail to get into the CL then it can be filed under bollocks, just like everything that 'newspaper' has ever reported, ever.

1422~~~
Not only don't I care, I think it would be well deserved.

1423~~~
Nothing whatsoever on twitter suggesting that.

1424~~~
Get that man a fecking cake... pronto!

1427~~~
Looks like his new contract will be announced soon. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1428~~~
No chance will we let that handsome magnificent bastard leave. I think he will want to repay us too for having faith in him. He seem's a loyal guy and is clearly happy here. He can go back to Atletico when he is 40.

1429~~~
Him signing a new contract will be as good as the Di Maria signing <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1430~~~
I love Rojo's celebration in that vine <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1431~~~
Also DDG is having to work with a different CB pairing every matchday. United have used something like 12 different CB pairings already this season, ffs sort it out United and make DDG's life easier.

1432~~~
Best keeper in the league and I'm sure if we weren't shit at the minute and higher up in the league, many would argue him being the best in the world, which I agree with.

1433~~~
How did you infer that from the link above?

1434~~~
I agree he's one of the best in the world anyway, most likely 2nd best but Neuer however is head and shoulders the best.

1435~~~
he's definitely not better than Courtois and if he is then the difference is marginal at most. I find them difficult to separate, DDG's the better shot stopper but Courtois is definitely the more commanding and better with set pieces. Combine them both and you'd get the perfect GK.

1436~~~
Courtois hasn't really been all that this season, probably still getting used to English football.

1437~~~
Seriously?

He's been excellent. Almost flawless.

1438~~~
Yes. We've reached the point where I'm surprised if we finish a game with the same centreback pair that started. Repeating formations still sounds like daydreaming.

1439~~~
If his performances so far haven't been 'all that' then I shudder to think what he'll be like when he is.

1440~~~
I think that's slightly unfair, I can't think of a single mistake he's made. Maybe he has a bigger advantage than de Gea as he actually has a good defence in front of him but he himself as done nothing wrong that I can think of.

1441~~~
Obviously a very small sample size but he was immense in their game against us, I was under the impression he was living up to his billing (whilst admittedly not having a chance to do anything particularly spectacular due to how good Chelsea are at the moment)

1442~~~
I dunno, that goal against QPR when he pawed the ball out with his 'wrong' hand from a cross and it was ultimately flicked in by Austin wasn't all that great. I tend to think other keepers might have been criticised for that. But otherwise he's looked really solid, annoyingly.

1443~~~
I hope we sent him a cake and prezzie for his Birthday, we don't want a Yaya situation! 

I wish we'd announce a new 6 year contract before Christmas.

1444~~~
He's steadily improving on his weak aspects and that's the most important thing at the moment. His distribution wasn't that great in the first few weeks of this season, but for the last month he's looked very comfortable on the ball, to the point where he's not fazed by forwards pressing him. 

Against Crystal Palace, he was very good IMO. He's a reactive goalkeeper when it comes to 1 v 1s, but it was good to see him come out and pressure Campbell for Crystal Palace's best chance of the game. And his claim from a cross in the second half was superb which reminded me of this:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/EvilHorribleBlackpanther.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/EvilHorribleBlackpanther.gif"/>

1445~~~
New video up on the United site with his best saves. This whole De Gea week smells a bit like a build-up to him signing a new contract.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/David-De-Gea.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/David-De-Gea.aspx </a>

1446~~~
6 years? You award 6 year contracts to dross like Moyes. Nothing less than 10 for De Gea please.

1447~~~
Aka a "Pat Jennings Special"

1448~~~
Any movement on getting him renewed?  I'm more concerned about this than I'd like to admit!  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1449~~~
Ahh I remember that one. My favourite DDG moment to date.

1450~~~
5 year limit in English football no? A disadvantage for English clubs for big signings as clubs like Madrid can offer longer contracts to offset FFP. Plus it also means we're pretty much always having to renegotiate every 3 years for our players.

1451~~~
Not that I know of. Didn't Fabregas sign a 6/7 year deal with Arsenal before?

1452~~~
I live in hope!

Enjoying all the De Gea love on the OS though, whatever it is for <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1453~~~
That moment against Palace where he plucked the ball out of the air one handed (just like the video above) would almost certainly caused him trouble, and probably resulted in a goal, a couple of years ago.

Its quite strange watching that video just to see how much he's grown up in the few years he's been here. He looks like a timid little boy in the clips from his first season, almost unrecognizable both in physical appearance and stature to the player we see now. 

I'd be gutted if we lost him to Madrid/Barca now, after watching him grow up and become such a good keeper. It would feel like a proper kick in the teeth.

1454~~~
As Rawkish as this sounds, there is honestly no keeper in world football that I would rather have than David De Gea. Neuer and (maybe, though I don't think so) Courtois are possibly better than him at the moment, but I would not take them over him.

DDG has shown something that a lot of footballers don't - progress. His weaknesses were identified and he has worked on them immensely. I sort of wish that we had a better defence in front of him so that he didn't have a record of only one clean sheet in (about) three. He is a much better keeper than stats might suggest. A consistent and better quality back four would undoubtedly give him the stats he deserves.

1455~~~
Just let it out mate. De Gea leaving would be the hardest for me to take of any other player at the club, and I mean anyone!

1456~~~
I'm enjoying the De Gea love that the official club social media accounts are promoting the last week or so. Can never get enough Dave <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1457~~~
Lazy compilation, he's had more saves than that, better too.

1458~~~
Well I sincerely hope this is bollocks..

If he goes its a hammer blow

1459~~~
Didn't Madrid just buy a replacement for Casillas? (Navas?)

<b><span style="font-size: 12px">David de Gea to Real Madrid: Manchester United see Victor Valdes as replacement - not back-up</span></b>

Hope that's not the case.

1461~~~
That wouldn't make any sense at all from our perspective.

1462~~~
Who are the Indy quoting in that article with the 'reports from Spain'? It's probably just Marca trying to stir it up as per usual. I don't think there's anything to see here.

1463~~~
But let's face it, the longer we languish, the longer we fail to perform and look convincing, the more likely such a move is. Mata off for 20m I have also read! Laughable if true.

1464~~~
Genuinely not worried by the Real Madrid links, for once. De Gea is Athletico through and through, I would be very surprised to see him ever play for Real.

1465~~~
Correct. That FK from Mata seemed unstoppable.

1466~~~
I'm fully prepared for him going. Why has the club left it this late, his contract is finished this season? His Mrs doesn't live over here, which obviously isn't ideal for him. Let's face it, we're shit right now and he could have his pick of top clubs, on massive wages on a free. The signs aren't good.

1467~~~
No it isn't. His contract runs to June '16.

He'll sign a new one soon.

1468~~~
Talk about overreactions. I'm not remotely worried about him leaving. He'll sign a new contract in or around the usual 18 month mark.

1469~~~
I read that article wrong. Next season <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>. 

Nothing to worry about then. Plenty of time.

1470~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this thread.

1471~~~
I came into this thread expecting the bump to be about him signing a new contract, turns out its an article about him moving to Madrid and us signing Valdes as his replacement.

Nope. I'm out.

1472~~~
If he's stalling on signing the new contract then we have to be ready for him to go.

I don't think Valdes would be the man to replace him though, he could be good backup but we'd need someone like Lloris.

Still hopeful we'll make enough progress to convince him to stay but he shouldn't have to wait.

1473~~~
Isn't it the 18 month mark now? I'm not too worried yet anyway, I'll be shitting bricks if he still hasn't signed by March/April time though.

1474~~~
Around January I think. Contract's usually finish up in June/July.

1475~~~
His parents are here though, so it is not as if he is here alone. To be honest, he should just ditch her and find a nice mancunian lass. Everyone is happy that way.

1476~~~
These stories were inevitable as soon as LVG offered Valdes to train here.

1477~~~
It'll be a shame if he leaves but hardly a massive surprise. I always kinda thought he'd end up at one of the Spanish giants if he met his potential.

1478~~~
No chance we sell him to Madrid unless they break the world record for a kepper by about 15m.

1479~~~
One year left on his deal, though? If he wants out he's a goner.

1480~~~
Hypothetical: Would people be happy with us signing Valdes as a replacement if De Gea were to leave?

1481~~~
Yes, hes a very good, experienced keeper, fantastic shot stopper and hes on a free, can't be too unhappy with that though obviously nobody want's to lose De Gea.

1482~~~
If we can't do anything to prevent De Gea departure, valdes is a good replacement.

1483~~~
I think De Gea knows himself it's too early for a move just yet. He's still developing and I genuinely believe he is thoroughly enjoying playing here. We've got a large Spanish speaking group now and he seems to be best mates with Mata which helps. The club knows how important he is as much as De Gea does so all this is just classic posturing before a new deal is agreed. 

Make it at least 6 years though Ed and match him with our highest earners, he deserves it on talent, performances and importance to the side.

1484~~~
He could develop just as well with Madrid though, who have a bigger Spanish speaking contingent and can match our wages.

Mata was linked with a move today too.

1485~~~
After last summer, Woody can do no wrong...he will have it under control i'm sure.

The media knows nothing!

1486~~~
Is Valdes much older now than VdS was when we signed him?

I think Johnstone is a flipping excellent young keeper (who's doing really well on loan) so maybe, just maybe we could cope if DDG left. Would suck balls, though, obviously.

1487~~~
3 years younger? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1488~~~
Yeah Van Der Sar was like 34/35 when we signed him. Still, Van Der Sar was still excellent at a ridiculous age.

1489~~~
Nay to Valdes as a potential De Gea replacement. We'd need someone who offers more consistent quality. Mattia Perin would be an excellent choice. Just turned 22, excellent reflexes, maintains concentration during long periods of inaction, big game performer (had 15 saves vs Fiorentina last season, highest of any keeper in the major leagues and was Genoa's best performer in the recent 1-0 win vs Juventus) very good shot and penalty saving ability, likely heir to Buffon for the Italian national team.

We're not shopping David to Madrid though, so it's all moot. He loves it at United, we don't need the money, Van Gaal really rates him and perhaps most importantly - he is a lifelong Colchonero. All these reports are probably press-briefs for leverage to maybe thrash out contract terms sharpish.

1490~~~
Ok, thanks. Reassuring.

1491~~~
Isn't that supposed to be Scuffet? 

I agree that De Gea won't be leaving any time soon, especially to Madrid.

1492~~~
Scuffet's got over-hyped as the next Buffon IMO and his development has really stalled this season with Orestis Karnezis' return from Granada (0 league starts for Scuffet). He's talented but is a bit error prone and his mentality has been questioned at times this season, which is very important for the position.

Perrin was in the World Cup squad and for his club - he already plays like a veteran in terms of confidence and consistency, very rarely makes any errors, turns up vs Juventus, Napoli, Fiorentina, Roma; and has had a massive part in leading Genoa to 5th in the league this season after also keeping 11 clean sheets last season. Definitely the best young keeper in Seria A as of right now - ahead of Romero and Handanovic.

Their developmental rift is too huge right now considering the age difference between them - only 3 years. That said Scuffet is certainly capable of being a special goalkeeper, as are Leali and Bardi. Funny how Italy always manage to produce great goalkeepers - Zoff, Zenga, Pagliuca, Buffon, Peruzzi, De Sanctis, Combi, Toldo, Galli while others struggle to find even one of equivalent quality. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1493~~~
Ya Italy love their goalkeepers and defenders. Wingers on the other hand...

1494~~~

1495~~~
Whats going on with his contract renewal? I am really concerned about Real coming in for him ...

1496~~~
I'm hoping that all this attention United are giving De Gea on social media is building up to the announcement of a new deal.

If not and he has to leave (which would be awful), Then Victor Valdes is a very good replacement IMO, Experienced and classy, Plus won't want to feck off in a few years like any other world class young keeper may want to if they joined us.

1497~~~
High praise from Shaw

But considering Shaw had no idea who Tony Adams was, i'd be surprised if he could actually name 10 goal keepers! <i>joke</i>

1498~~~
Hope he doesn't go, especially not to fecking Madrid. Can't stand them.

1499~~~
Pretty sure he can't stand them either.

1500~~~
Our social media team can be cringe at times to be honest. They're all over Ronaldo's balls anytime they get. The same can be said about de Gea recently. Call me a pessimist, but it reeks of desperation to me.

1501~~~
I don't mind it with de Gea cause he's ours. At least for now but they are constantly licking Ronaldo's balls.

1502~~~
Sign a contract De Gea, you dopey twat. You and Ronaldo owe United your careers.

1503~~~
The transfer muppetry of our club flows all the way from Ed Woodward to <a class="username" data-user="23151, @iSparky" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23151/">@iSparky</a> with De Gea and Rio in between somewhere. No one will complaint if it results in us signing Ronaldo next summer <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1504~~~
No he doesn't, he was already one of the best prospects in the World in his position before we signed him.

He's already one of the top keepers around so why should he wait 3 more years for us to be competitive? I'm just hoping he's seen enough progress this season to keep him here but maybe he doesn't like playing behind incompetent defenders that are responsible for him conceding 5 against Leicester and 4 against MK Dons.

1505~~~
manutd.com are really obsessed with him in the last weeks......every day a new article or interview with him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1506~~~
If we sell another world class player to fecking Real Madrid we simply cannot claim to be in the same tier of clubs are them, I still actually hate them from the Ronaldo sale.

If they want him it's either a straight swap for Bale or nothing.

1507~~~
Agree, it's just his contract that complicates things for us, if he signs up then we hold all the aces, and Madrid can either give us a top player in return or beggar right off, but this lack of a new contract is dragging on now which is a worry, if it's still not happend by the end of the season then we'll no doubt cash him in.

1508~~~
Why hate them? You didn't have to sell him. It's United you should blame.

1509~~~
In fairness to the club they did similar to honour RvP the other day when he scored his 50th goal for the club. This fuss now for DDG is all following his 50th clean sheet. They're making a big deal of it but they tend to for these 'milestones'.

1510~~~
For about 3 years prior to the sale, Madrid were fecking around big time using the media to such an extent that Ronaldo considered himself a slave. That's just low.

1511~~~
He gave us another year even though he was desperate to go.

If we go after players from Spain or Portugal it's only natural that they will want to go back to own type of climate at some stage.

1512~~~
Ronaldo is responsible for his own actions, you can't blame Real for wanting a player.

1513~~~
What's the general consensus then, do we think he's going to sign a new contract or have Madrid convinced him that they'll swallow on a first date?

1514~~~
Don't leave us David <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Always thought he'd end up at Madrid.

I don't think it will be next season, I think he will sign a new contract, everyone will be happy then after 2 or so more years especially if we are still struggling he will leave to Madrid for around 25-30 mil and go on to be the best keeper in the world with Curtois.

1515~~~
The only player at United I would be floored if we sold.. But we need to get this contract thing sorted asap, another thing Moyes fecked up! <span style="color: #ffffff">(he needs more stick)</span>

1516~~~
Based on absolutely nothing I'd say his contract is getting done piece by piece to satisfy him which naturally takes time and that, Madrid being interested is just shit-stirring from his agent/Spanish press (who by the way claim all of Herrera, Mata and de Gea could be on their way out...).

1517~~~
I reckon he's not that keen on signing and is trying to string it out. Valdes isn't here to be second choice, IMO.

1518~~~
You mean that club would took on loan pur 4th choice striker? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Chill it isn't happening, he'll sign an extension some point soon.

1519~~~
He may well want to go back to Spain in the near future. But I'm confident that he will extend his contract and not leave us in a weak negotiating position.

1520~~~
I'm pretty confident he'll sign a new deal and will be with us for another two seasons at least. Depends how well we do though, he should be competing for trophies every year.

1521~~~
No way would be bigging him up like this if he was leaving this summer, we would look like absolute morons.

1522~~~
He's our teams Superstar tbh.

1523~~~
De Gea leaving would be like a knife to the heart. I would spend endless days crying like a bitch dreaming of all the times I've shared with him. Whilst he's grown from a boy to a man, so have I. You don't just break that type of bond.

1524~~~
Woody told us that he is fed up with seeing the best players featuring in La Liga. I think its more likely that we sign Ronaldo than let DDG leave.

1525~~~
Interesting interview, but it's in spanish.

For a goalkeeper painful and handicapping.

1541~~~
AS only say he's <i>likely </i>to be rested for Spain so I doubt it's anything that'll keep him out long at all. It's an aggravated old injury to his little finger.

1542~~~
The curse continues....

1543~~~
Surely a City fan would injure Chelsea players?
More likely a Liverpool fan.

1544~~~
Yeah according to first reports it seems he should be okay for the Arsenal match.......the injury isn't too serious (and he could play if Spain had a World Cup final tomorrow)

1545~~~
Thank feck!

1546~~~
You underestimate the bitterness of the common birtie my friend.

It's beyond a joke now.

1553~~~
I've dislocated a finger during football..It's not good actually, especially for a goalkeeper.

1554~~~
I injured the same finger (in rather weird circumstances), he'll be fine after a week or two. I was a kid and fractured it so I guess mine took longer (absolutely milked the hell out of it to not do any PE <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>)

1555~~~
Is this Lindegaard's doing?

It's beyond fecking ridiculous. It's not just about being injury prone, it's a bloody disease at this club. 

Though he should be fine for Arsenal I think.

1556~~~
Yippee, no worries then. I hope right spot on there. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Have far along are them Valdez contract talks? What a joke this is becoming with injuries

1561~~~
So much for the optimism Monsieur rabat-joie.

*Sobs in a corner*

1562~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  If you want optimism, i played and fight with a dislocated finger, it is possible, it is painful, you are not comfortable but it's possible.
The only problem is that in the premier league you need to be 100% fit, with all the crosses and long shots.

1563~~~
Didn't VDS miss the start of the 2009/10 season with a finger injury from a pre-season save (possibly a penalty in the shoot-out at the Allianz?) which resulted in the Ben Foster fiasco?

If DDG is missing then I think it'd have to be Lindegaard even if he could sign Valdes in time - the language barrier with the defence (whatever combination that would even be) plus the difference of playing in the Premier League might make throwing him in a bigger risk despite him bring the better keeper.

1564~~~
Yeah I remember that, I'll never forget Ben Foster in that 4-3 game against City.

Lindegaard is a more than capable replacement than Foster so I'm not as worried (though against Arsenal we're definitely going to need our best keeper).

1565~~~
I think I'm actually going to cry this time. Please don't take Dave, Mrs Injureé <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1566~~~
You have to be fecking kidding me. 

What kind of voodoo shit has cursed our players? Is this Moyes getting back at us?

1567~~~
How did De Gea get injured on international duty? What was Phil Jones doing there?

1568~~~
The scene of the crime:

1569~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Of course this was going to happen.

1570~~~
Feck it.

Has he ever been injured for us before? Can't remember one off the top of my head.

Lindegaard's decent, anyway. He's no Dave, obviously, but as good as you can expect from a second keeper.

1571~~~
He dislocated his pinky. He should be fine in a few days, never mind 10.

1572~~~
He dislocated his little finger. Pop it back in and he'll he fine to play for you lot for you next game.

1573~~~
Oh, well, as you were then.

1574~~~
I remember that in one game in 2011-2012 both him and Lindegaard weren't available. I am not sure if he was injured or he only had stomach problems.

Amos was keeper on that night, and he didn't had anything to do in a comfortable United victory. That didn't stop some well one or two) people here to say that he should be called on Euros though.

1575~~~
This is beyond riddiculous I'm just expecting our players to get injured now whenever they get out of bed or stand up. I mean, do we even have 11 first team players fit for the Arsenal game?

1576~~~
No need for hysteria. It's good that it's a dislocated finger rather than a broken one.

1577~~~
As long as we have 11 semi healthy players for arsenal i'm happy.

1578~~~
Can't rely on him to stay fit, a goalkeeper should not be getting injured. Need to find someone who we can rely on week in week out.

<span style="color: #ffffff">That's the thing to say when a player gets injured isn't it?</span>

1579~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> It's sad how bad and laughable our injury problems are when all the reaction from me was an eye-roll after reading about this.

1580~~~
Unbelievable.

It's one thing for God to take Phil Jones away from us, but quite another to take David De Gea.

1581~~~
You know your injury crisis is bad when you goalkeeper is getting in on the act.

1582~~~
The tea lady has an ingrowing toenail.

1583~~~
Ridiculous. Will it ever end? 

Shame we've been playing Amos in the reserves games and not Lindegaard. I think we will be ok though. Lindegaard isn't on DDGs level but he's a good 'keeper.

1584~~~
Why are you all acting as if he isn't going to get ready for the game against Arsenal?

1585~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You just have to laugh.

1586~~~
It was long overdue.

I'm going to start criticising LvG relentlessly - I'm worried that if I start defending him I'll get crocked too.

1587~~~
Ohh ffs. Which gods did united offend to deserve this.

1588~~~
Its a dislocated little finger, he will be fine.

1589~~~
It's hardly the same with Rafael, Evans, Jones and Smalling.

1590~~~
Hopefully he'll be OK for Arsenal. Bloody international breaks.

1591~~~
If he is out we'll have to get Valdes signed before the Arsenal game.

1592~~~
You know it's no 'tactical' withdrawal either since he just got in the team.

It never ends!!

1593~~~
Luckily we have a very good #2 in Lindegaard. Still a big blow though, Dave has saved us a few points this season.

1594~~~
He will be fine it's only his little finger! might be a little bruised but aslong as its bandaged it will be fine.

1595~~~
Twitter rumours saying 4 week out.

feck sakes if true

1596~~~
Unfortunately, Di Maria will be next. I can just feel it.

1597~~~
I did too. You just expect it to happen.

1598~~~
Why hasn't Lindegaard been playing?

1599~~~
4 weeks for a dislocated pinky seems a bit much to me.

1600~~~
Relax. Its just that twat IndyKaila saying it.

1601~~~
I would say he's a bit too old to be playing week in week out for the U21s but Amos is as well. He's played the odd game though, I think.

1602~~~
Oh, I see. It's good that Amos got playing time as well though.

1603~~~
being called the red devils. Pretty self explanatory <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1604~~~
Thank feck. All these injuries are becoming depressing.

1605~~~
Beeb saying he could be out for four weeks. Lindegaard is not a bad replacement.

1606~~~
Sign Valdes!!!!!!! I don't trust Lindegaard (outside of Instagram)

1607~~~
Link? De Gea out for 4 weeks seems to have originated from the Daily Fail.

1608~~~
I don't feel comfortable with Lindegaard in goal either. fecking hell, de Gea better be back for Arsenal!

1609~~~
A dislocated finger is a 3 day injury, 5 day max

1610~~~
It shouldn't be a long time out. Why is he otherwise still staying with the Spanish squad?

1611~~~
Give him the FM treatment, injections to get through the Arsenal game and then rest him against Hull at home so he can be fit for the December fixtures.

1612~~~
To the horse placenta!

1613~~~
Arguably better than any goal keeper in the world at reactions and shot stopping.

1614~~~
Didnt Casillas have a broken/dislocated finger once? I thought they gave him a special type of glove (4 fingers) so he could still play? Maybe Dave can ask Casillas to borrow them so he can play against Arsenal.

1615~~~
I think he'll be okay. If not, we sign Valdes on a short-term deal.

1616~~~
I could easily see him back for Arsenal. As long as he didn't do any other damage, it should heal pretty quickly but obviously would be sore. Whatever painkillers footballers use would probably negate this though. The fact he is still with the Spanish squad is promising. 


At least I hope, otherwise we just lost our best player from this year and last... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1617~~~
Yes and they bought Diego Lopes.

If it's dislocated 4 weeks are about right

1618~~~
He'll be back from the Arsenal game, its only his baby finger. Only problem he might find pain with is punching the ball but thankfully Arsenal aren't an excessive crossing them.  Thank god it wasn't a shoulder injury.

1619~~~
Just patch him up for Arsenal and then rest him..!

1620~~~
He'll be ok for Arsenal. 
But whats all this about signing Valdes. Why dont people trust Lindegaard?

1621~~~
I'm not an expert on dislocated fingers, but surely he's not looking  good for next weekend?

1622~~~
He isn't very good.

1623~~~
They're talking about him possibly even being in contention for the international game, so if this is to be believed then it looks good for Arsenal.

1624~~~
He's on the bench tonight, according to the BBC.

1625~~~
For a backup keeper he is.

1626~~~
I guess, but I just don't trust him.

1627~~~
Dislocated his finger. feck feck feck.

1628~~~
Read back two or three posts.

1629~~~
Yeh I did after I posted haha. Got a notification on my phone late so thought it was brand new information.

1630~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-worry-transfer-interest-4633474" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-worry-transfer-interest-4633474</a>

Wants a move to Madrid according to the Mirror.

1631~~~
This shit wont go away until we extend his contract.. I am getting a bit nervous..

1632~~~
The reports are still baseless nonsense though. No quotes or anything. I don't understand how the papers can publish stuff like this as news with no source or actual news. The media have seemed desperate to pull the team apart since Fergie stepped down. I don't see the tabloids targeting other teams anywhere near as much as us. Every day, it's De Gea, Falcao, Di Maria, Mata. Last season it was constantly Rooney and RvP. It's boring. Best to just avoid the gossip.

1633~~~
Anything followed by 'according to the mirror' can be happily ignored.

1634~~~
Hope he's back for the Arsenal game. If not, I feel Lindegaard is a good enough back up, thankfully.

1635~~~
Even if it was Barca, it would still be very unlikely but I don't think he's ever join Real Madrid.

1636~~~
Madrid usually get who they want TBF. If De Gea is open to it then he'll end up there at some point. Don't think the Athletico connection is a huge deterrent.

The only question is if Perez would spend a huge amount on a "Galactio" goalkeeper. They've always had Casillas as their "Galactico" and Perez doesn't like spending big money on defensive players.

1637~~~
maybe old news , just seen it now.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/man-utd-alerted-bale-availability-8117513" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/man-utd-alerted-bale-availability-8117513</a>

1638~~~
Just seen that too. If true, Madrid are sat in the driving seat when it comes to negotiations.

1639~~~
There is a separate thread for transfer speculation and contract renewal stuff.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/hands-off-our-dave-transfer-speculation-contract-renewal-stuff.397568/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/hand...er-speculation-contract-renewal-stuff.397568/</a>

1640~~~
They can feck right off if they want De Gea,  as good as Bale is we stand a better chance of signing Reus for €35 million in the summer who is just as good while keeping the world's best keeper.

1641~~~
Worlds best?

1642~~~
Is there any definite time frame on his injury? Seems to range from a few days to 4 weeks...

1643~~~
Doubt it. Don't think Iker is going to be playing back-up to anyone again, so unless he left no chance Dave goes there.

In all seriousness though, if we could do something like Dave +15m for Bale, would anyone be ok with that?

1644~~~
No. We're top heavy as it is. Rather have a world class keeper like Dave.

1645~~~
Agreed, not interested in any deal that sees De Gea leave. Unless he pushes for it himself we should just stonewall it.

1646~~~
Yes, and i buy Zieler, Leno, Begovic or someone like that.

1647~~~
David plays down Real's rumor

Yeah yeah David we love you !

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2837965/I-feel-loved-Manchester-United-insists-David-Gea-crocked-keeper-plays-Real-Madrid-switch.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...-crocked-keeper-plays-Real-Madrid-switch.html</a>

1648~~~
Yep not interested at all in anyone coming to OT in a swap deal with DDG.

1649~~~
He was on the bench for Spain the day after the injury, rather than being excluded from the matchday squad altogether. So I assume it was just a lot of noise about nothing?

1650~~~
Yea, I would, If he doesn't sign a contract by summer he'll have 1 year left , if offered Bale/Varane etc in part exchange by that point i'd consider it a good deal considering he'd walk on a free 12 months later, them's the facts.

1651~~~
That's encouraging to hear.

1652~~~
Was he the only goalkeeper on the bench ?

1653~~~
Nope. All the squad was on the bench so not sure if it means anything.

1654~~~
That's what i think i have seen an injured Ribery on the bench with France, i hope that i'm wrong.

1655~~~
Dislocated pinky means he could be back as early as Arsenal, if we really wanted.

If they reduce the dislocation and buddy strap it, customize a three fingered glove for him (a la Neuer) he would be able to play.

If our medics suggest it aint worth the risk, then they'll keep it buddy strapped with pain killers and re-evaluate by next week.

1656~~~
Was it only his pinky? If that's the case surely he'll play. I'd imagine that's the best finger to dislocate if you had to.

1657~~~
Not for a goalkeeper, you use it to stabilize the ball when you catch it. The best ones are the middle and index fingers.

1658~~~
That's true but surely in terms of shot stopping it becomes an issue in terms of finger tip saves if you dislocated your pinky or index fingers?

1659~~~
You can tape your index finger to your middle finger.

1660~~~
When you stop the ball you try to use your palm to stop and your fingers for the direction, having a strap isn't a big issue.

1661~~~
Ya that's a fair point.

You don't use your palm for finger tip saves. Hence the name. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1662~~~
You don't stop the ball with finger tip saves, you deviate it. You'll lose a finger otherwise, forwards are brutal.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1663~~~
How would you put a glove on though?...

1664~~~

1665~~~
You can get them specially made from the sponsor. IIRC casillas had some like that. I've sprained so many fingers and it really hurts tbh. Once I damaged my funny bone too.

1666~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1667~~~
They'd ask for at least 3 times that.

1668~~~
No fecking about from our Big Dave... He's basically just said he wants to become a legend on the level of the Dane. Plus, he's pale as fook. Probably likes Manc weather...

1669~~~
Just posted this on his twitter, clearly reassuring Casillas that while he will be taking his Spain #1 spot, he's not after his day job. He's also tapping up Isco just in case we have an opening for an outrageously gifted attacker in the summer and Real sell him to make room for a new toy.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s18.postimg.org/djeadkhmh/B2qug_ZYIEAIM4_Ew_png_large.png" src="http://s18.postimg.org/djeadkhmh/B2qug_ZYIEAIM4_Ew_png_large.png"/></a>

1670~~~
There was no intention to play him though. He warmed up with the other keepers but he joined the outfield players when they got onto the shot-stopping exercises.

However he did train today, and according to Marca he did the full normal training session, and is only being left out of Spain's team for the Germany friendly as a "precaution". We shall see.

1671~~~
"Sources in Spain don't think the dislocated finger suffered by David De Gea last week will keep him out of United's game at Arsenal on Saturday." (Andy Mitten)

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2150360/louis-van-gaal-is-frustrated-as-manchester-uniteds-injury-woes-continue" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchest...ed-as-manchester-uniteds-injury-woes-continue</a>

1672~~~
Here's an article with a quote from, presumably, one of the sources he's talking about. The third Spanish keeper, Kiko Casilla.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/kiko-casilla--a-new-start-for-this-spanish-stopper#page1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/kiko-casilla--a-new-start-for-this-spanish-stopper#page1</a>
I know nothing about this guy but Mitten makes a bold claim about him, saying he is regarded as the "best keeper in the air in Spain".

190cm tall. Which must help. Wonder if any PL clubs are looking at him?

1673~~~
Only just caught up with these updates. Seems like the injury isn't too bad anyway if he is a possibility for Arsenal. Good news.

1674~~~
This is by a mile distance our best player, no one comes close, so glad to have him, we could be 3-0 down if it wasnt for him.

1675~~~
Oh Dave how we're going to miss you. You and your beautiful beard.

1676~~~
And his shit haircut too.

1677~~~
Hey, that's a very nice haircut that. Please stop.

But yea, DDG is immense, fingers crossed he keeps it up because he's the only bright thing this season, just like every single season before.

1678~~~
The only reason why we aren't facing a rout right now.

1679~~~
By that comment, I suppose you have something similar. Sorry to say it (to you ) again but it's shit.

1680~~~
How could any keeper be happy being worked so hard constantly? Poor guy would have so many more clean sheets if he signed for another big team...

1681~~~
Immense. Again. 

Getting a new contract for him has to be a priority.

1682~~~
Getting to point where nominating him as the best in the world isn't particularly 'out there' as an opinion. Superb.

1683~~~
He is fantastic, a lot closer to Courtios than most neutrals think.

1684~~~
He deserves better. Best in the world behind Neuer

1685~~~
It looks a lot better on me though <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1686~~~
Best in the world is extreme, although he's been superb again, especially with the caliber of defence he has in front of him.

1687~~~
And he's coming off dislocating a finger? Do I have to break into Woodward's office to write up the contract myself?

1688~~~
That cheeky smile in 68th minute after Cazorla shot <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1689~~~
New 5 year deal for £200k/wk now.

1690~~~
More if he wants...just need to make sure we hang on to him.

1691~~~
Despite the Giroud goal he was excellent today. Even when he played us into trouble in the second half he made up for it with a great stop.

1692~~~
Don't feck it up, Woodward!

1693~~~
Ridiculous performance. We must do everything in our power to keep him.

1694~~~
He's the unluckiest keeper in the world. If it's not a shit defense then it's a worldie.

1695~~~
So unlucky not to keep a clean sheet. But another great performance. 

Make him the highest paid keeper in the world. We can't afford to lose him.

1696~~~
Can't really see much between him and Neuer at the moment.

1697~~~
He was getting some criticism for that in the match thread, but I didn't really think he was at fault.

1698~~~
Shackle him somewhere in our dungeons untill he pens the new deal.

1699~~~
Best ever player? 

Best ever human being?

Best ever beard?

Triple yes!

1700~~~
Give him everything he wants. We have Rooney and Van Persie on more, and likely Di Maria is on 200k region or so. De Gea is better, younger and more important for team than any of them.

1701~~~
2 shit kicks in the first half and should have saved Giroud's goal
<span style="color: #ffffff">But still motm by a country fecking mile!</span>

1702~~~
There's nobody I'd rather have in our goal to stand up to a one v one. Louis sign him up, Louis, Louis sign him up!

1703~~~
He could have easily done that but then FA would charge him (and United) for cheating. It is unfair and contrary to the spirit of the sport to have such an amazing keeper on the pitch.

1704~~~
Sorry Dave you deserve better, i hope United can sort him out a decent CB pairing to play with week in week out.

Please never leave!

1705~~~
Best man to live?

1706~~~
He's alright.

1707~~~
Best player of all time <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1708~~~
Does he have the keys of Manchester, a road named after him, a stand, all of the above yet?

1709~~~
I bet theres a part of him thats loving it tbh, as a goalkeeper he wants to save shots. Whenever I was in goal and had shit defenders in front of me I got to save more shots and I loved it.

1710~~~
Give him what he want, after some average games he is back to his best and is again our best player by a mile. Just insane how many points he saved us already in his career.

1711~~~
Sign him up to the Bret Hart special 20 year contract

1712~~~
He was good. Smalling was probably better.

1713~~~
With the way I'm feeling right now, Big Dave could shave 'Sam from Redcafe is a cnut' into the side of his head and I'd still love the man.

1714~~~
So fecking annoyed we couldn't get the clean sheet. Had a phenomenal game (despite most of the Arsenal shots being right at him).

Get that man a contract QUICK.

1715~~~
I always wanted to defend when I had shit defenders protecting me. Especially if the opposite team has a shit striker who likes to shoot a lot.

Not sure if that goes also for keepers on the highest level though.

1716~~~
Was fantastic apart from the Giroud shot. Would have been my man of the match for sure, but DDG will be dissappointed he didnt do better with it

1717~~~
MOTM.

1718~~~
He could bang my mom and I'd say cheers and thank him. Absolute hero.

1719~~~
No words. Neur is the only keeper better than him in the world right now. And he's 4 years older than him.

1720~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1721~~~
Give him everything he wants. Everything. Pay him in blank cheques every month. Let him decide what he earns.

1722~~~
Forget the last line of defence, sometimes this season he's looked like he was our defence. The amount of clear chances we forced him to deal with was jaw dropping but he still refused to be beaten. Gotta tie him down on a longer contract as soon as we can.

1723~~~
Hands down the man of the match. Unlucky to have conceded. I think everyone had just switched off there and allowed giroud to take the shot.

Might have something to do with Carrick being switched into a centreback position and briefly losing the French cnut.

Saved us from the predictable early barrage which led to us eventually hitting them on the counter twice. Best goal keeper in the prem along with courtouis.

1724~~~
Yup those cnuts from Madrid will be after him

1725~~~
It was a poor shot but the save from Wilshere was sensational.

1726~~~
Great performance today. Some of his kicking in the first half wasn't good but that really is nitpicking because his shot stopping was excellent and he's saved us on more than a few occasions this season.

1727~~~
If he wants 300k per week give it to him.

1728~~~

1729~~~
Not fussed. DDG is definitely in the mould of Ronaldo in the sense he takes criticism on-board and becomes better because of it.

1730~~~
Very weird quote from van Gaal

1731~~~
Errrm, you're doing it wrong LVG <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1732~~~
If LVG cant be satisfied with de Gea, I doubt he can be satisfied with anything, he just won you 3 points and you're still not satisfied, thats ridiculous.

1733~~~
I think we can replace anyone in this squad right now except De Gea. I don't care who we sell or who leaves as long as we can retain De Gea.

1734~~~
Woody is righting up the 10 year deal as we speak. Stature optional.

1735~~~
Odd quote there, but De Geas first season showed he can grow with criticism.

De Gea did make an almost costly mistake, ended up passing it right to an Arsenal player in acres of space.

1736~~~
I think Van Gaal's criticism is to do with his passing which was shocking, but he wasn't really helped out by some of the back passes to him.

1737~~~
This, this, and only this!!

1738~~~
Him writing up means it might take a while. Maybe in a couple years, De Gea will have his contract.

1739~~~
Imagine giving him an actual defense, he's just an immense keeper for me the best in the league. Give him the contract he so richly deserves.

1740~~~
I agree. De Gea was pressed hard. Not many players press higher and harder than Sanchez and Welbeck, and some of the passes from Blackett to De Gea were like shots on target.

I hope LvG is just wanting to fire De Gea up and not make him think he is undisputed #1 so he strives to improve. De Gea's kicking when not under pressure is superb, but he's pretty lousy when pressed. A lot of goalkeepers are, but he needs to improve if he wants to be the best.

Still, I love him. Our best player, and our most irreplaceable player.

1741~~~
He should be paid more than any GK in the world. That's how vital he is for us.

1742~~~
Need to do whatever we can to sign him to a new contract. Pay him whatever he wants, sign more Spanish players and put them on the bench if it makes him more comfortable.

1743~~~
Isn't there a theory of management where you find any minor criticisms you can when something is going great and act supportive and positive when things are going badly? I reckon it is a bit of that going on with the quotes from LVG. De Gea was a hero today but the kicking would be a minor criticism.

1744~~~
His clearances in first half 25 minutes were shocking. Apart from that he was stupidly good again.

1745~~~
Van Gaal just showing why he has a reputation for being weird.

1746~~~
Yup, plenty of those have to do with how our defenders, especially Blackett, backpassed it. So many times those backpasses were on goal / bouncing it was a fecking disaster waiting to happen really.

1747~~~
Just keeps putting in great performance after great performance. Get this man a new contract and a proper defence to work with!

1748~~~
I hope that's another case of LvG's dodgy English coming into play. Not only was De Gea excellent again today, he is becoming a leader back there like our previous two great keepers. I'll be gutted if we lose him.

1749~~~
I'd say LvG is just keeping him on his toes there with them comments. 

There'd be no 3 pts this evening without him though that's for sure, he's turning out to be some keeper.

1750~~~
LVG is right, his kicking today was VERY poor and it does put us under pressure at times, we could have been punished by a better team. I don't see how what LVG said is wrong or weird, of course De Gea has many fantastic attributes but he does need to improve, there's room for massive improvement.

1751~~~
can't see anyone better than him in the world atm.

1752~~~
Honestly, He's the face of united. not rooney/falcao/van persie/mata etc. He's an absolute superstar.

1753~~~
Incredible today. Get the new deal sorted Woodward.

1754~~~
He is in the top 3 in the world this season, and his doing this with an unsettled back line.

1755~~~
Crazy quote from Van Gaal.

1756~~~
He has been on top 3 for some time now. I really think that in the 3 seasons (including this) only Neuer has been better while Courtuis has been on the same level as him.

1757~~~
Great game from Big Dave. With Casillas back in the good books and Barca stuck with the transfer ban and having already bought a couple of keepers, I think he'll stay for a few more years.

1758~~~
Im guessing LVG not happy with some of his clearances / distribution. The Wilshere chance was from his own bad clearance so he redeemed himself. He did well with a lot of the shots where he made it look easy but it certainly was not (the bounce before it reached him and not spilling it).

Imagine him with a solid defence in front of him?

1759~~~
Weird from LvG. Valdes just go away to Barca or whereever until DDG signs a new contract!
Nothing and noone should stand in the way of DDG's contract extention with us!

1760~~~
I agree though last 2 seasons it was debatable this season it's not.

1761~~~
Ed...fella....whatever you do in January...nothing will surpass the signing of De Gea....it's like..well...critical...yeah?

1762~~~
Giving him a new contract is more important than signing a centre half.

1763~~~
Not really. His kicking was ropey at times. He let in a goal he should have saved. I don't think it's unfair to say he has plenty of things he can improve on.

1764~~~
Starting with the Everton game he's been in the best form of his United career these last few weeks

Is he actually Spain's no1 now?

1765~~~
Bloody hell man, although it wouldn't have surprised me to have seen him stop that think it's a bit much to say he <i>should </i>have saved it. That was a bloody good strike. 

Agree on the kicking, though.

1766~~~
Was before he picked up that dislocated finger.

1767~~~
Looked a belter from the first angle and when I saw it from behind Giroud it was obvious - to me at least - that he could and should have gotten a much stronger hand to it. 

But I'm not using this as an excuse to batter him. Simply saying that I think LVG is right to say he has plenty to improve on, though he's obviously an excellent keeper.

For example coming off his line, though he's been better the last few weeks.

1768~~~
He's seems to have an almost telepathic ability to dive the right way from one on ones right now. Whether its guess work, great research or he's mastered the art of reading body language, its been superb.

1769~~~
I will cry if he goes to Madrid. Dodgy kicking today but the guy is absolute class. Absolutely love the guy!

1770~~~
I love him. He is just brilliant. His kicking was poor at times but i'll let him off because he did get a couple of dodgy back passes that put him under pressure. Has to continue to work on it though. He does look better at coming off his line lately, I suspect he has been working on it.

1771~~~
I dunno think you're being a bit harsh on that one. Fair enough, though, opinions 'n all.

1772~~~
I dont see anything wrong with van Gaals quote. Obvioulsy he could have done better for their goal i thought, criticism on a high level though. Some on here go over the top, like best keeper in the world right now. Neuer and Courtois still a bit better for me, De Gea is an excellent keeper and very important for us etc, but still can and hopefully will improve further.

1773~~~
The quote seems a bit harsh after a game where his saves have undeniably won us points, but it's certainly true overall. Distribution used to be one of the strongest aspects to his game, but it was awful today.

1774~~~
I thought he could perhaps have done a few things better, obviously one being his distribution, particuarly that one he kicked low down the middle 1st half which allowed Wilshere a 1on1 seconds later, he was given credit for the save (which is fair enough, kudos) but it was he who put us into trouble,
The second being, he came out for a cross, didn't get much on it, which was immediately played back across the box, only for Welbeck to backheal wide seconds later.
Third.. should he have been beaten on the Giroud goal? perhaps i'm being a bit harsh there.

But overall.. did very well (again)

1775~~~
Looked like he was carrying a knock in the first half. Any news on that? Hope he's okay.

1776~~~
Yeah it was after that save he made coming off his line I think. Not sure what it was, probably a sore muscle from over stretching or something? He didn't seem to be too bothered in the 2nd half.

1777~~~
Sorry, but I'm not having the criticism of De Gea here.  The man put in an epic performance today.  Few keepers on the planet would have even gotten a hand on the Giroud shot and no keeper would have saved it.

His clearances, however, were a bit wayward.

1778~~~
Literally like 2 sentences later. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1779~~~
On it's own the LVG quote seems quite weird and almost bad man management. Still maybe he is meaning to say he can't be all praise as there were mistakes in his kicking game, a few them leading to opportunities in the first half. Think he got nervous himself because Blackett was a bag of nerves himself with some of those passes back which were not ideal. Normally DDG is quite clam - so he'll just to learn to do the same in these not so ideal situations that may come up once in a while.

1780~~~
Not a chance. No keeper would've saved that, and De Gea did well to even get a hand on it.

1781~~~
I want to see Neuer or Courtois with such a young defence and different players in front of them in every match
They're having a easy time with the same world-class players in every match in front of them

De Gea is 100% on the same level like Neuer and Courtois......De Gea has an average defence in front of him now since 4 years and has improved so much

I would never swap him for Neuer or Courtois

GIVE HIM A FECKIN NEW CONTRACT UNITED BOARD!!!! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1782~~~
That's a good point. Let's see how Neuer fares with Blackett and Smalling at the back.

1783~~~
Yeah, because a 24 year old is in his prime and ready to overtake or level one of the greatest keepers ever.
Neuer was one of the best keepers around at Schalke and even won stuff there. Thats harder then playing in every United team of the last years.
I repeat; David is a great keeper and surely in the top 10. But only because he plays at United and is one of your best players doesnt make him the best or a top 3 guy.
He is on a good way, nothing more.

Try Hans Sarpei and Tim Hoogland. And look at the Schalke your United ruled in the CL semis in 2011. Yes, Manu did reach a CL semi with a defense that is a level under everything United had in Davids time, atleast.

1784~~~
He's definitely top 3 and on current form arguably the best. Put Neuer, Courtois, and the other usual suspects in goal in front of our defense and you'd see similar results.

1785~~~
Sorry, you seem to have many posts here and I remember you as a guy who knows his stuff.
But Neuer is a level above everyone.
It COULD be that David has a BIT more talent but in no way or form he could already use that. Manu has so much more experience and is perhaps not even in his prime.
People talk about him as a candidat for world player of the year and he was 2nd! behind Ronaldo in the European player award of last season. He lead Germany to the world cup, was a main man in Bayerns triple.
Davis is a level below him, atleast.
And there is no shame in that. He is still young.
And to call him a sure top 3 is a bit much also.
He did very good since the summer of 2013 but didnt help United to punch above their weight.

1786~~~
Top 10? You've got to be joking here, seriously. Neuer aside (and I agree with you, that he is still №1, his individual performance against us for Schalke in the semis was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>) there is nobody better than him. Courtois maybe on the same level - and I don't know who you can count as his equal, let alone a superior? Handanovic? Bravo? Seriously, no idea.

1787~~~
How can you be sure Neuer would be as good if  he didn't have the luxury of playing in front of Bayern and Germany's defenders ? Look at the quality of defenders Bayern and Germany have and compare it with this year's Man United defense and its quite clear to see how good De Gea really is.

1788~~~
I would not put DDG over Neuer. Level with Courtois and I don't think anyone else comes close.

Am I the only one that thought it was 'crazy' not 'praising'? As in, "you think I am crazy for criticising him, but I am not crazy"?

1789~~~
Because Manu played at a similar age with Schalke. And they had not near your money. Their defense was even worse. And Manu played 5! years for them and got named the best German keeper in his first year.
And his goals to game ratio is pretty damn impressive for a team, that finished 14th! in his last year for example, when he was 24 for most of the season(Davids age)(he won the cup,reached the CL semifinal and was named German footballer of the year that season,before you talk about him being bad in that time).
Manu proved himself in a bad team. Just a fact.
And David, for all his good work, didnt help your team that way last or this season so far.

1790~~~
Hazard. If he wanted to, of course.

1791~~~
And to the top 3 debate; Buffon,Bravo,ter Stegen,Leno,Cech. There are more then 3 great keepers out there, some not so well known and talked about, some a bit talked down and so on.
David isnt a sure top 3 pick. Its close and you can debate. And that is entertaining, isnt it?
I get your fan love and he is great and I dont deny that. So, I leave it there.

1792~~~
Cech isn't even a starter for his club. How can you put him in the top 3 debate.

1793~~~
Anchan1989 is here to once again teach us commoners football and then again proclaim that Germany is greatest thing in the world.

1794~~~
Sure, man. I take part in a debate and you dont like my point. I put out facts and you answer in such a way, just attacking me personal without any arguing with facts.
Educated, I have to say...

Because another guy, who is younger, has more of a future at the club they both playing for and is also in that debate, is put ahead of him.
Not really for perfomance issues either, when you see his last season.
And Cech is in a great keeper age, experience is vital on that position and he has that in tons.

1795~~~
Its blatantly clear Van Gaal is beaming about DDG, but doesn't want to be perceived as such in his interview.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8Pl1mj4l8o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

:50 - "...Arsenal created a lot of chances - fortunately we have a very good goalkeeper".

3:50 - "I'm used to this quality, but he has to improve also...." (ie....he shouldn't sit back and basque in compliments, and keep working on improving his game).

1796~~~
Fan love is my new favourite word of 23 november 2014.

1797~~~
You didn't include Courtois in your list, despite him being increasingly acknowledged as being one of the best in the world at the moment, but instead included a player who sits on the bench. Interesting.

1798~~~
It's increasingly futile to take part in a debate with you. Anyone who doesn't agrees with you is obviously biased and you're unbelieavably arrogant when it comes to matters related to Bayern and German football. Incidentally, that's the opinion shared by even your Bayern supporters.

Neuer is better than DDG, but apart from him I don't see any goalkeeper in the world that is better than him. The fact that you are willing to include Ter-Stegen in this discussion who's nothing more than a backup at Barcelona speaks volumes.

1799~~~
Did I say, that I listed them all? No.
Do I have to mention that he is among the best. No.
Nothing of interest there.

As I said; if you have two great keepers in your team one has to take a step back.
And Andre proved himself for years in Germany, plays in the CL for Barca.
Not so bad.
Some Bayern supporters on here and me dont get along. Happens for everyone with some people.
I would bet to you too.

1800~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1801~~~
Big Dave is a gem. Top keepers are extremely hard to find in this day and age, for me De Gea has some of the best reflexes of any keeper anywhere in the world right now. You cant teach reflexes me thinks but he can work on his distribution and dealing with crosses/corners, once he does that he'll be on a different level. In any case we need to get him to sign a new contract, we wont be able to replace him and will take us a few steps backwards in the rebuilding process.

1802~~~
Some of his clearances were iffy, but to be fair, Blackett in particular was rifling the ball back to him a lot which put him under a lot of pressure.

1803~~~
They say top keepers are worth an extra 12 points. He's helped us get at least half that already so far this year.

1804~~~
Truly becoming the world class keeper we knew he could be and always needed.

United have always struggled with keepers and if he stays at United I believe he will go on to be remembered in the Schmeichel / Van Der Sar category.

It's just slightly worrying this is coinciding with this rough patch United are going through, I believe he will sign another contract but if we don't improve losing him in another 2-3 years is a very real possibility <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1805~~~
I don't think he is better than Neuer (yet anyway) but I'd have him over Courtois. Actually I'd have him over Neuer too just because I like him so much but yeah. A new contract would have to be being discussed. LVG couldn't watch him and not think it is of crucial importance to keep him around.

1806~~~
our best player by far. please get him sign that new contract ASAP !

1807~~~
ter Stegen too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> But yes, better than De Gea

1808~~~
I love DDG and think he's one of the best in the world but I don't think he was anything special today. Mostly just made the saves you would expect a good goalkeeper to make, didn't save their one good shot (I don't expect him to be able to save that) and made some iffy clearances. A solid game but nothing to go over the top about.

1809~~~
I don't know what it is about him but he is creeping up there into the category of one of my favourite United players of all time. If he leaves I'll be devastated.

1810~~~
Agree, his performance today was good but not spectacular. I think the fans are piling on the praise because he's been on a run where he's been absolutely reliable when the rest of the team has been generally a mess. He's the guy we count on for a while now to keep us in the game. Until our team settles and really go on a good run, we'll keep seeing him praised to God's glory for each and every decent-good performance. I love DDG though, so worshipping him for the moment is a pleasure. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1811~~~
I hope Valdes likes the FA Cup and time on the bench.

1812~~~
It was 'Crazy', that's what I heard originally as well.
Edit ya on the clip above about 4:00 in.

1813~~~
This. He made good saves when he had to but his kicking caused some of the problems we encountered, the Wilshere chance for example was a result of his kick being shite.

1814~~~
Probably unpopular opinion but I personally find the reaction to this game funny. Everyone moaned that Neville overly criticised him all the time, I thought yesterday he praised him far to much and no one said owt. He made 1 or 2 good saves (mainly from his mistakes to) and literally every other shot was straight at him. He had a good game but if ANY of them shots went in, except the 1 that did, I'd be very disappointed and it would of been because of a mistake from him rather than a brilliant shot. None of Arsenal's efforts were that good.

Put it this way, the famous comparison everyone loves to make.....if that was Joe Hart would anyone be saying he had a good game on here? I'm gonna say no.

1815~~~
Didn't know he had that in his locker. Look how deep he throws it from as well...

1816~~~
As you said, DDG made the saves that he was expected to make. That's a good game. His kicking though, was pretty bad.

1817~~~
Now we just need someone to find Ed Woodward's contract-signing pen so we can get this wrapped up. My hopes for this season are: Top 4, good run in the FA Cup, plenty more chances given to youth players, and a new contract for DDG. Not too much to ask, surely?

1818~~~
Pace on Di Maria there with the ball. Unreal

1819~~~
I love how good this guy is at making rival fans pissed by just doing he's job well.

1820~~~
He did his job and he had a decent game, I just don't get all the praise like he's just made a string of world class saves, every shot except the 1 that went in was straight at him. I just feel people are going ridiculously over the top with their praise just foe the sake of praising him.

1821~~~
Leno, ter Stegen, Bravo, what the actual feck, you're having a laugh.

1822~~~
Most fans are just glad that we have DDG in goal, especially with the makeshift defence. He had a good game as well, which made it more impressive. No spectacular saves from him though.

1823~~~
He had four or five shots on goal no one would blame him for letting in.

1824~~~
Whose better then? Like you say Neuer is a level above everyone else but I can't think of any other goalkeeper that's better than De Gea.

1825~~~
i would also put Courtois slightly above him, but thats it.

1826~~~
This is brilliant! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Buffon: Past it.
Bravo: Good keeper yes but not an elite goalkeeper like De Gea.
Ter Stegen: Substitute. If he wasn't German you wouldn't give him a mention.
Leno: Talented young goalkeeper but that's all. Daft to even suggest he is top 3 in the world. 
Cech: Great goalkeeper but how can someone who can't get a game at his club be in the top 3 goalkeepers in the world?

1827~~~
Each to their own I suppose. Arsenal had 8 shots on target. I genuinely can't think of 50%+ of them where I'd think I wouldn't blame him for letting them in. Of them 8 shots 4 were straight at him, the best of them lot was probably the Wilshere one where it was a poor effort and de Gea's mistake that led to it. The only save I thought was really impressive was when Oxlade Chamberlain tried going round him and he stayed up the whole time. 

I rate de Gea highly and think he had a decent game by the way, I just think he's had much better. He did his job so shouldn't be criticised for it at all, any mistake he did make he made up for it. 

If I hadn't seen the game and then read this thread and heard Gary Neville's commentary before watching it'd be a bit of an any climax when i actually saw it.

1828~~~
He's got plenty of time, but he really needs to sort out his kicking. It's not just today, or this season that it's looked a bit dodgy. 
I think he could have done better for the goal - I'm sure even he'd admit that. It surprised him, and he needs to be ready for attempts like that.
Some of his saves in the first half were brilliant though.

1829~~~
That shows you are clueless <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1830~~~
I mean fair enough if you want to argue cases for Buffon and Cech (Buffon is passed it though). But he's added in Leno and ter Stegen just because they're German <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1831~~~
His kicking was really bad yesterday, not helped by the state of the back passes but it was way below expectations. It's clear he's worked on coming off his line since Leicester. And the Wilshere save isn't luck when you've did it numerous times before.

Not sure about the Giroud goal or if he could've did better but the defending again is an utter joke, players looking over their shoulder checking for offside while Giroud is lining up a shot ffs.

1832~~~
anchan1989 is the german <a class="username" data-user="5020, @peterstorey" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/5020/">@peterstorey</a> <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Okay i agree Neuer is ahead of De Gea......it's normal i'm a bigger fan of De Gea instead of Neuer as a United fan
But De Gea would get the same praise like Neuer or Courtois with a much better defence......he can get many clean-sheets with a defence like ours

But if someone says "Buffon,Bravo,ter Stegen,Leno,Cech" are on the same level like De Gea then it's really funny

1833~~~
thought that goal was simply the result of us having 'won the game' we let our guard down.

1834~~~
His kicking wasn't spot on yesterday (hasn't been as good as it used to this season) but to be fair, some of the back passes have been terrible to deal with as well

1835~~~
Yes, Buffon, number 1 of Turin and Italy, rated as one the best ever and still in a good keeper age of 36, is clearly behind a 24 year old.
And I never said that people like Leno or Bravo are better.
But they play on the highest level too. Someone like Leno plays CL, in a top league and gets compared to Neuer in Germany.
Why shouldnt he be on de Geas level.
You all just make stupid jokes and dont bring any facts in.
That FACT says it all.
And David wouldnt get the same praise as Neuer with Bayern because he isnt on his level.
Another fact. Hope you see a pattern here.
But hey, have fun with de Gea. As long as United fans see him as a top 3 keeper he surely is one. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1836~~~
When did that happen? Suggesting that Leno is on De Gea's level is laughable.

1837~~~
The German fans on here have become painfully arrogant.

1838~~~
I hope that Perez fecker is listening to Anchan. Win-Win.

1839~~~
You seem to be misunderstanding what the word 'fact' means.

1840~~~
Yes, his kicking was iffy yesterday and he made saves any keeper should be making, but it was they way he made those saves that made the difference. De Gea didn't palm the ball out for corners or push the ball back into play. Nine times out of ten he was catching the ball and a lot of those were hard to catch. That impressed me and it surely made the team more secure in defence.

1841~~~
Its not only the saves though, he looked good catching everything in the box and punching them when needed.

1842~~~
What can you say anymore? Aul Dave in nets. Does the business, as feckin usual. Arsenal can't finish their dinner but still, Dave stood up and dominated most (if not all) of the danger scenarios.

Still thought he could have saved Giroud's smash when I saw the replay. Probably zoned out at that late stage.

1843~~~
His set pieces were pretty off yesterday, it even could have costed us a goal if he wasn't that good on the line. Overall great goalkeeping, definitely hold us in the game.  Would be pretty bad to see him go to Real or something after we polished him into a worldclass gk.

1844~~~
I think he's a better keeper than Neuer now in current form, only thing that wins the race in total for Neuer is he's a decent footballer too.

1845~~~
Right now it's laughable for me that some foreign fans still think he is nothing special. Neuer is better of course and Courtois is on his level too, but that's it. Other keepers are far away from beeing better than Dave.
Leno is good, nothing more. Same for Bravo. Ter Stegen made this season the step Dave already made 4 years ago (and he is only 1,5 years younger), he isn't Barca's number 1 yet and we still have to wait if he can handle the pressure in a big club. His few games for Germany weren't brilliant either, I can see him easily struggle in his first season. Right now he is just a big talent like Dave was at Atletico. Buffon is good, but has declined, nobody can deny that, he is one of the best ever because he was so brilliant in the past and in his career, he is still a good keeper, but not as good anymore. Just because he was great in the past doesn't mean he is better than DDG right now or would someone mention the current Iker Casilias, who should also be considered as one of the best ever GK.

And yeah that's it. Cech is good, but right now he doesn't play, nobody knows how good he is right now. Handanovic is probably the one which I could understand the most (at least more than the other names mentioned), he is a great keeper and way too good for Inter. But De Gea in Top3 is really not a United fantasy and I am happy that most of the foreign fans can see it now too.

1846~~~
Yeah, the difference at the moment is his kicking, which used to be spot on with De Gea. Oddly at times since Moyes took over it's been inconsistent. Definitely one of the top 3 around since he really stepped it up around January 2012, but there isn't much between him, Neuer and Courtois. Don't think it's as claer cut of Neuer being so far ahead as many seem to think.

1847~~~
Neuer was good for Schalke, but not really special (you could see that something special is there, but had to come out), he made quite often a silly mistake. Now obviously he is a TOP goalkeeper.

Now, to say that de Gea didn't really help this team during this and last season is "stupid" (I am not saying that the poster is stupid, just the quote). Our problem last season was the attack, as we didn't score, plus a horrible defense where we never had a constant pairing. But he didn't make mistakes which have cost us points or so and he saved what was possible to save.

This season he looked a bit different. No that he made any mistakes, but didn't look as motivated, but it all changed from the Everton game.

It is very hard to say who are the best goalkeepers as they play in different leagues with different styles. In Spain de Gea would look a lot better then in United, as the crossing isn't much of a point in Spain, so his biggest flaw would not be a problem.

Also, how much is Neuer under pressure in Germany? Not really. And if we are going to say that de Gea didn't really lift the team last season, so didn't Neuer. I didn't see him saving the game against Real, the first real opponent they had. Also against United, what did he save really (only the one on one situation with Welbeck, everything else we put on target from a chance we scored). They won the league because they are the most superior team, they would win it with their second goalkeeper. Don't get me wrong, he is good, but he is not the one who is taking Bayern a level above others, which some people ask of de Gea.

Ter Stegen can't even be in this category until he starts playing regularly on the highest level.

But I don't think that is really important to be TOP 1, or TOP 5, it's still class and good for every team.

And yes, de Gea has to improve some things.

1848~~~
This is funny, I remember praising de Gea for his kicking, what happened to him?

1849~~~
Not much, few terrible passes from your defenders and no one to pass to, 1+1=2

1850~~~
Yeah, used to be one of his strengths but now seems to be a weakness. Probably didn't focus much on his kicking and just general playing with the ball at his feet while Moyes was here.

1851~~~
Hopefully his contract will be sorted in the next month or so, getting a bit nervous now.

1852~~~
He didn't have a good time during the Arsenal game given how high up they were pressing us, especially from Sanchez. I think his generally poor kicking this season is more because of the uncertainty in front of him though. Even from quite a few goal kicks, he's been poor. DDG looks calm and collected reacting to attacks, but who's to say he isn't on the edge mentally. The team has had serious confidence issue from last season til now. He's still a considerably young keeper and he's bound to be affected.

1853~~~
I don't think it's fair to trivialise his performance by saying most of the shots were straight at him. It takes away from the fact that his body positioning was excellent in every one of those saves and it's something that he showed major improvement on last season.

Think I was also wrong on the back passes from our defenders to De Gea. Looks like it's most likely down De Gea's technique after watching this comp:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tE2heXs2qzY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1854~~~
I would say it's always been a weakness. Brilliant kicking the ball out of hand and he's usually fairly accurate off the ground but has been scuffing the odd clearance since he joined United. An obvious example being a CL goal conceded against Basle when he passed it straight to the opposition winger in his debut season.

1855~~~
Good point. At times even his kicking from the ground is fine, it's just he isn't very consistent with it. You could say it's kind of like Rooney's passing, it's not bad, it's not his best aspect, but just inconsistent. One game perfectly fine, the next game a bit dodgy. Prone to the odd clearance like the one yesterday that led to their chance.

1856~~~
He's definitely more inconsistent this season though. I put that down being told to keep the ball on the deck as much as possible. This means that when he does go long it's only after spending a second or two ruling out every other options so can end up a little rushed.

1857~~~
It's something VDS was amazing at, rarely forced into camera saves because of his fantastic positioning and anticipation. DDG is developing that now too.

1858~~~
Agreed. There are quite a few I can visualise, but can't remember which games specifically. He seems to scuff a couple of back passes every game.

His 'under no pressure/lots of time' kicking to the full backs is pretty good. But I wouldn't say it's remarkable, or much better than most other 'keepers around.

1859~~~
Yep. I also think the change of systems and players hasn't helped. Blind has been a good option for De Gea a lot this season, or our wingers when we've played them.. It mustn't help having automatic options to kick to one game and then have that same space void the next.

1860~~~
definitely with you on this one.

1861~~~
If he does go then he surely has to set the world record for a keeper, much as I would hate to lose him if it could be the carrot to get Bale then it would be easier to take, but would rather keep DDG without him we'd be in a terrible state right now.

1862~~~
Can we sign him to a 10 year contract?  I don't want him going anywhere near Florentino Perez.

There is nothing in Spain today, or yesterday, about De Gea rejecting a renewal... only older stuff from last raft of gossip.

Gary Neville with long overdue praise <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1867~~~
Apart from being the greatest keeper ever with the best beard I think he was lacking from his game aerial ability and better positioning but he seems to have really, really improved at those two points which only means that's he's working really hard in training to improve, even his handling had improved, some of the catches he makes from shots are hilarious.. glue gloves!  We've an absolute gem on our hands and I've been saying it since day one.

 I know we can't legally give 10 year contracts but I doubt ANY United fan would have a problem with it if we offered him one tomorrow.

1868~~~
I've never seen an article about a player mention said player so little. 

I like that he's writing about De Gea, but he is not emphatic enough. To be fair, if I wrote the article, it would be a 300 page epic detailing my love for big Dave.

1869~~~
I just looked and it seems that it's possible, only if the national laws aren't against it.

1870~~~
What's with his love affair with Courtois? Player of the year? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1871~~~
That article barely talks about De Gea!

1872~~~
I know! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1873~~~
Because he's been absolutely fantastic all season and the best goalkeeper in the league?

1874~~~
De Gea has had a much more unstable defence in front of him and has been tested a hell of a lot more than Courtois, Dave is just shading it for the better goalkeeper right now.

1875~~~
I'd say the key areas to improve for him now is being braver about when to come out - both to claim crosses and sweep up (doesn't have to go to Lloris levels). While he's becoming more authoritative when he does decide to come and claim a cross, I feel that there are occasions when he could come out but chooses not to. But for his age he's progressing nicely.

Now sign a new goddamn contract.

1876~~~
I'm with TUI on this one. While Courtois has looked good and you could argue is a better keeper than De Gea(think it's so close that it's just a matter of opinion), I think De Gea has probably bailed us out a lot more than Courtois has Chelsea this season. 

In the league this season we've had 14 centre back combinations, Chelsea have had one - that has to help. (feel free to correct me on figures, but I'm pretty sure that's what I read the other day)

1877~~~
I don't get the love Courtois is getting. He's a fantastic keeper, but his performances this season haven't been particularly great. His positioning and dominance in the air have been great, but I haven't watched a single game this season where I could say 'he's won that for Chelsea' in the same way I've said it for de Gea. The majority of the praise has been fuelled by the media. De Gea is easily no. 2 after Neuer imo, with Courtois, Handanovic, and Cech just behind. I can't take suggestions of ter Stegen, Leno, and Bravo seriously. No way are they on that level yet.

Also, people are underrating de Gea's performance against Arsenal. His positioning and anticipation for Wilshere's shot and the one where he closed down the Arsenal attacker were brilliant pieces of goalkeeping. He also did well commanding his area (which is no longer a weakness for him imo and hasn't been since early last season). His kicking was poor, but it always has been. This idea that he was great at kicking is an illusion. Commentators were talking about it when he first came, which is probably the reason people believe it. He can get great power in his kicks, but the accuracy has always been poor. Ultimately, it's not that big of a deal, and I'd rather he be poor at that than any other gk aspect. Ideally, it'd be best if he had no weaknesses of course.

1878~~~
Like <a class="username" data-user="88267, @The United Irishman" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88267/">@The United Irishman</a> said De Gea has been better. Courtois has been good but I can't even remember any amazing saves he has made. He's been solid but fantastic? Not in a million years. He hasn't been tested enough yet. Even I would look good behind that defence.

1879~~~
I agree with the general consensus that Courtois hasn't really deserved as much as praise he's getting for his performances. I mean he's had nothing to do so how could he be player of the season? Fair enough, there's an argument there that he's probably a better keeper than Dave but his season up till now has been solid but not as good as Dave. Maybe that's down to the respective defences in front of them but that's how it's played out so far.

1880~~~
Tbh, considering how good their defence is, the amount of goals they've conceded has been pretty poor. If you were basing it on performances this season, without any prior knowledge of the players or media influence, I'm pretty sure everyone would say de Gea has been the better performer. I'm not criticising Courtois, but those acting like he's been so amazing are idealising his season so far.

1881~~~
Have to agree, he is one of the most hyped players around and I don't understand why. He has potential due to his age and he is good but I've yet to see him have a world class match where he wins it for his team or doing something spectacular week in week out like Neuer or De Gea.  Even that match vs us when RVP had two chances that were kicked directly at him that any keeper would've saved due to the angle the media and Chelsea fans went yabbing on about the great Courtois. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

A lot of his hype last year was from Athletico winning the league and getting to the UCL final which of course you'd have to be some what decent to be on that winning team but as I was cheering for A.Marid towards the end of the season, watched all their big La Liga games and their latter CL games I didn't see one game where he was spectacular, like Costa he was a good player in a great team and not to other way around.

1882~~~
As far as I know, Courtois was amazing last season, and one of the big reasons why Atletico were so good. He hasn't had that much to do in England yet.

1883~~~
Nah, I think he's definitely world class, as is our Dave, but he hasn't really produced any match winning saves or anything like that this season, mainly because he doesn't have to. He's had a solid reliable defence in front of of him throughout the span of his short career, at Atletico and Chelsea.

1884~~~
Agree that the Courtois love is generally media-fuelled. I've had Arsenal fans (who I know barely watch Arsenal, let alone Chelsea) reel off media sound bytes about him.

I don't agree that De Gea is 'easily' better, but Courtois hasn't done <i>that </i>much at Chelsea so far to deserve the level of praise he's received from some for this season. They're pretty much the same level as 'keepers, with different strengths and weaknesses.
I don't see the need to compare players of the exact same level. it's as if Chelsea, Arsenal, United, City fans all need to have the best player.

As for the bit on bold: So true. I never understood when people laughed at Hart's kicking. It's better than De Gea's, in my opinion. At least he's less likely to shank a clearance.
De Gea was praised for his ball-skills, and I <i>also </i>never understood it - as early as his first season here. Glad I'm not the only one.

1885~~~
Courtois has looked pretty standard for Chelsea so far. He was brilliant last season, but De Gea is currently the better keeper, and I personally believe it'll stay that way.

1886~~~
Courtois has been superb. More or less flawless. At a club like Chelsea (and, in theory, United!) the keeper shouldn't be making loads of saves but he's a reassuring presence who gets every decision right, dominates his area, has made a few very good saves and zero errors (that I've seen anyway). That's as good as it gets for a keeper in team competing for the league title.

Dave's made the more eye-catching saves and has been by far the busier keeper but there's no way Courtois has looked in any way inferior to him. Just less busy.

1887~~~
Can we refrain from bumping this thread pre-match please? Makes me feel very uneasy...

1888~~~
And yet there were threads on here after 5 games that were complaining about De Gea's form. He's massively stepped up his game since Everton but Courtois has been absolutely magnificent all season. He dominates everything in the air, his distribution is solid and he's absurdly difficult to beat. 

That's not a criticism of De Gea, it's just the level he's at now is the same level Courtois has been playing at for the last 18 months.

1889~~~
Prior to that 5 game run (which are blown out of proportion anyway) De Gea has been at Courtois' level for about 24 months. Thibaut's performances in 2013/ 2013 were inflated by playing behind a stellar back 4 of Luis, Miranda, Godin, Juanfran and an excellent DM in Gabi further up, all of which was orchestrated by the most tactically astute young manager around in Simeone. 

Meanwhile De Gea was being shielded by a physically jaded Evra who mostly couldn't recover in time from his lung busting forays in attack, Nemanja who's no longer the beast he was pre-Basel and is currently sat on Internazionale's bench, Rio Ferdinand who has struggled for ample playing time at QPR and an oft-injured Rafael. A keeper can only do so much. 

It's far easier for Courtois to be magnificent because similar to last season, he's been playing behind an experienced and settled back 4 guarded by a top DM, and his workload in largely predicated on set pieces and a few direct attempts on goal. De Gea in comparison, has to content with an injury ravaged, inexperienced back-line and comes up with save after save to keep United in matches. We could've been 2-0 or 3-0 down at the Emirates in the first half if not for him. 

I'm not sure Courtois would be that solid behind a back five of Valencia, McNair, Smalling, Young and Blackett.

1890~~~
Could of sat in the Stretty all game and we'd still of won.

1891~~~
Had feck all to do. Finally a performance where De Gea isn't saving our arses!

1892~~~
And Neuer is rubbish because he plays for Germany and Bayern right?

Courtois has been flawless for 18 months, there's a reason the defences he plays in are so strong. Like virtually every great defence they have an unbelievable goalkeeper behind them.

I see the same arguments crop up time and time again, opposition supporters underrate a better team's goalkeeper because he isn't busy constantly. People used to do it with VDS when our defence was impregnable, it's just completely backwards logic. Courtois has been amazing for 18 months, that's not because he's being protected by defenders, it's because he's absolutely magnificent. He's made 1v1 saves like De Gea vs Arsenal on at least 4 occasions this season and anything even remotely near him in the air is sweeped up with ease.

1893~~~
Urgh. *have.

1894~~~
Flawless performance from Dave...

1895~~~
feck off.


*this post has received a warning*

1896~~~
Stayed sharp through the whole match, good to see. I would have been caught bird-watching in a game like that.

1897~~~
Literally had f*ck all to do today which is great. Nice chilled day for Dave.

1898~~~
A VDS esque performance, could have pulled out a deck chair and watched. I wish he gets more of these.

1899~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Opened the thread to say exactly that.

1900~~~
Huh ? Did I say Courtois is rubbish ? Way to speak in hyperbolic terms man. Neuer is an awesome keeper, probably the best since Buffon's regression but he is undoubtedly helped by the presence of some excellent players around him at the top of their game - Alaba, Lahm, Boateng, Benatia for Bayern and Lahm, Hummels, Boateng, Hoewedes, Schmelzer etc for Germany.

Courtois hasn't been flawless for 18 months, his errors are minimized in comparison to De Gea because of the iron curtain in front of him. Even the greatest keepers can concede a high volume of goals if the defense in front of them is flawed. Case in point - Edwin van der Sar at Fulham. But conversely even a good but not great keeper can be made to look excellent by the work-rate and safety provided by his defense and midfield. Case in point - Victor Valdes who set a Barcelona clean sheet record by not conceding for 896 minutes and conceded just 29 goals in the league that season.

It's not backward logic and I normally am pretty neutral when it comes to comparing opposition players. Edwin though an excellent keeper, was definitely helped by the presence of Vidic, Ferdinand and Evra in front of him. Replace a couple of them with error prone defenders like Bramble or Boumsong and even Edwin would've been made to look queezy as a consequence. You can keep harping on his flawlessness but no player is ever flawless for a calender year, let alone 18 months. A few errors here and there are part and parcel of sports.


Like the stats show, De Gea has played 1 more game than Courtois in the league and conceded just 4 more goals. It's almost miraculous that he was slammed by certain sections for his poor form in 5 games, played behind a different consecutive turnstile defensive line in each of the 13 games so far including first team debutants McNair/ Blackett, a defender new to the league in Rojo and 2 wingers. In a goals conceded per game context that's just 1.15 goals conceded per game amid all the brouhaha about our defensive frailties. Today was the first time our defense and midfield looked remotely stable this season and result ? Clean sheet for David.

Courtois by comparison has played behind Ivanovic who started 12 consecutive games, Terry who started 12 consecutive games, Cahill who started 12 consecutive games, Azpelecueta who started 10 games and Matic who started 12 consecutive games. Yet he had conceded just 4 fewer games in 1 less games. So yeah, I struggle to see how Courtois is supposed to be better than David. Could you imagine what David would do in Mourinho's defensively stout teams behind experienced, consistent, healthy defenders like the ones Courtois has this season ? Or had last season in Atletico..

1906~~~
He's flawless in your eyes because you don't watch him every week or focus on him as much so don't see the little mistakes like bad kicks or if he concedes a soft goal or something like that. He's a top keeper, but he's no better then De Gea. It's just people are always more nit picky about their own players but for opposition players just go with the general perception more often then not.

1907~~~
Who on earth are you to say who I watch and don't watch every week? Thanks to the miracle of the internet its actually not that difficult to keep up with the games of Europe's top teams thanks. Atletico were well worth 2 hours of anyone's week last season fwiw.

1908~~~
It's a pretty safe bet to say that United fans don't watch other teams as often as they watch United, no? Not saying you never do, I watched plenty of them myself but nowhere near as consistently. The point still stands because of that. United fans watch De Gea every week so know everything about him really, notice every little thing or mistake he makes. Watching other teams, people tend to just watch the game as a whole rather then focusing on one teams performances. Courtois probably had more mistakes then De Gea last season anyways, remember seeing a few goals where he fecked up on or let them squeeze through. He's a top keeper but he is definitely not flawless.

1909~~~
Bit quiet today. Not sure I like it. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Great post.

1911~~~
In an age where every game broadcast on sky and canal plus is available in HD as a torrent within hours? Safe generalization perhaps, but certainly not on an individual level. 

And if you think Courteous made more mistakes then De Gear last season then maybe you should get involved in despicable piracy more often.

1912~~~
I doubt that many (if any) United fan have watched Courtuis 50 times last season. Which I think it was b_r point. Maybe, you have (though it would be weird) but I doubt we'll find any other.

Courtuis made a few mistakes last season. As did De Gea. Or Neuer.

He isn't flawless, no keeper is. He also has the benefit of having very good defenses, unlike De Gea. I doubt that there is much between these two. In fact, in pure goalkeeping they are in the same level as Neuer - if not better - but the German has that ability of being also Bayern's best central defender, which make him the best GK on the world.

Note : Including all competitions, De Gea made just 1 error leading to goal in the entirety of 2013/ 2014 (vs Sunderland in the league cup).

1915~~~
I didn't, and i have seen two of his mistakes, and some of his soft goals.

1916~~~
Cheers for linking the evidence mate. So much for the <i>Courteous</i> being flawless for 18 months premise.

1917~~~
No, but then I can't honestly say I watched all of Man Utd's games either, I watched in excess of 30 of Real, Barca and Atleti's games last season. I think you're not going to gain much traction with this line of enquiry. Unless you have an eidetic memory sample size more than dwarfs compleness.

1918~~~
Was going to mention this Alderweireld own goal too, if we are talking about his mistakes here, absolutely shocking from Courtois here. He certainly made more mistakes in the last few years. Still, a top, top keeper.

1919~~~
Fair enough, i watched them all plenty of times too but nowhere near United, and when you watch other teams, most of the time you tend to watch the game as a whole, rather then focus on one specific team. You don't notice the little things as much. 

Anyways, my point was that you said he has been flawless for the past 18 months and I need to watch football more if I think De Gea made less mistakes then Courtois last season, when that's actually just the truth (and I watch loads of football outside of the premier league, for what its worth).

1920~~~
Courtois has shown for Atletico that he can both keep his team in matches by making save after save to them win them games they do not deserve too (the Copa final vs Madrid in 2013 is a great example of that). But what he did for Atletico last season required something different and even more difficult. Atletico won some games by a big margin, but a lot of them were by a single goal or two. Because of their defensive excellence last season which was based on hard work, constant closing down and pressing, dogged displays and resilient attitude, they still conceded some chances especially late on in games when they were leading by a single goal and Courtois showed excellent concentration and alertness to make big saves at such vital moments after not being tested or given much to do all game. I am yet to see that type of concentration and ability to make saves at vital moments after having little to do all game from DDG on a consistent basis like I have seen from Courtois.

It is true that Uniteds defence is not as good as Atletico's or Chesea's but in a way that has helped DDG as it has given him plenty to do and has given him plenty of time to show off his excellent shot stopping and his ability to make brilliant save after save and it allows him to stay alert and keep his concentration levels up. He is benefitting from being behind a poor backline just like Casillas used to back in the day as he got to make plenty of saves and was worked all game. You say you struggle to see how Courtois is better than DDG and ask "Could you imagine what David would do in Mourinho's defensively stout teams behind experienced, consistent, healthy defenders like the ones Courtois has this season ?". We cannot really answer that yet but there have been plenty of keepers that have thrived when they were behind a poor defence and have struggled when behind a solid backline and had to maintain concentration for the 90 without being tested much. Courtois has shown that he can excel in both situations while DDG has not yet. It is pretty close and they are both world class goalkeepers but Courtois is still ahead for me and both are behind Neuer.

1921~~~
De Gea has shown he can do this too, the second half of 2012/13 he was behind a settled defence, and that's incidentally when his change in form first happened. Vidic came back from injury, Rafael and Evra were constants, and Rio was having a very good season as well, but whenever we needed De Gea he was there to bail us out. Not a large sample size admittedly, but he's shown he is fine with that and can keep his concentration, even in the individual games like today where he is generally invisible and then required to make a big save now and then. It's not like he only ever performs when we're being pressured a lot.

1922~~~
Yes, I shouldn't have used flawless, it invites people to fine a couple of YouTube videos of questionable definitions of mistakes and pretend that's a valid argument.

Feel free to replace flawless with 'as good as De Gea's form since Everton'.

And again that's not an attack on De Gea, he's the third best goalkeeper in the world. It's just Courtois does all the stuff De Gea does and adds in supreme aerial dominance.

1923~~~
It is a valid argument as De Gea has been world class for almost 2 years now, since January 2012 and his flap against Spurs when Neville criticized him (wasn't even a huge mistake, but there you go). Since then, he's had the feck up vs Sunderland, and that's about it mistakes wise. Every keeper has a few bad kicks here and there so you can't really count those either, unless it's a recurring theme which it isn't with him. You say De Gea's form since Everton is what Courtois has had for 18 months, but De Gea has more or less been in that form for 2 years, not just since Everton. There's a reason he won our players of the season last year, and was one of our top 3 players in Fergie's final year.

1924~~~
Yes, he's the third best goalkeeper in the world, only Courtois and Neuer are superior.

1925~~~
So, you think I hold hold De Gea to be the perfect keeper, incapable of anything less than flawless performances every single match?

Try some reading comprehension classes.

1926~~~
Fair enough Raul. Though, there is quite a lot of data to support the claim that De Gea has evidenced the ability to maintain his concentration and make decisive saves in matches where United were leading by a fine margin. So it's a bit disingenuous to state that David hasn't shown that on a consistent basis whereas Caourtois has. 

Some opposition fans might not agree, but for the purpose of fairness, the performances of every single United player should be voided for the 2013/ 2014 season. The team had little cohesion at times, there was a lot of hidden reported resentment among the group and frankly most of them looked like they weren't arsed so broader picture, it's hard to deduce any key to individual player performances from a collective or titular perspective. If we compare De Gea's form in United's league winning 2012/ 2013 season, it makes for some interesting reading.

2012/ 2013 :

League games won by United by a single goal margin : 11.

2012/ 2013 :

League games won by Atletico by a single goal margin : 8.

2013/ 2014 :

League games won by Atletico by a single goal margin : 12.

2014/ 2015 :

League games won by United by a single goal margin : 5.

2014/ 2015 :

League games won by Chelsea by a single goal margin : 4.



So I really don't get the notion that De Gea is a fine shot stopper but doesn't have the concentration or calm mental ability of Courtois. I do honestly believe that his new-found stature in the game of being the best keeper in the world bar Neuer is largely predicated on the hyper surrounding Atletico's league winning, European Cup final competing 2013/ 2014 season. 

Swap the two and I'm pretty sure De Gea would have done equally well behind the stronghold of Tiago and Gabi and Felipe and Juanfran and Godin and Miranda and Juanfran. Maybe that's the United fan in me siding with our player, but I genuinely feel I'm being impartial here. I'd readily swap Hazard some all of our wingers, or Matic and Cesc for any CM bar Herrera or Costa for RVP, so I'm not exactly conceited wrt the superiority of some of Chelsea's players when compared to their United counterparts. But I really wouldn't swap the two keepers.

EDIT : Updated !

1927~~~
Fair enough, your opinion. Personally don't think there's anything between Courtois and De Gea but it's a matter of personal preference.

1928~~~
Absolutely. I watch a lot of football, but most of the games I see rapidly disappear into my personal highlights reel. I'll maybe remember the feel of the game, the odd highlight or low point, but because I don't really care - I don't recall every error in distribution, every lucky punch or risky rebound. The only time I notice errors by a keeper that don't lead to goals is if the keeper is playing for us.

Even on the errors leading to goals front though, I remember that Atletico's Courtois wasn't perfect. There have been a couple of examples given, and I'm sure there are others. But I bet he wasn't even too pleased with his (much watched) CL final performance though I doubt any United fan would have blamed or even noticed him there either.

1929~~~
Those stats don't tell the full story. Atletico could be leading by one goal late on and then Courtois makes a big save  and then Atletico go up and score at the other end to win by two goals. My view is only from the games I have seen them play and not from stats (I have watched both of them a lot and I have seen them both play a similar amount of games. I do not watch one more than the other.) Casillas was quite good at times at making saves after not having to do much all game and at keeping his concentration although I still thought it was clear that Buffon was better and more consistent in this regard. Courtois has also put in world class performances against better teams than DDG has (Madrid and Barca have been better than any of the Premiership teams that DDG has had to go up against over the last few years). I am not saying DDG could not perform as well against those teams like Courtois has but it is just another argument in his case and something he has over DDG and it shows how close it is that I had to bring that up in Courtois' case. There is not much in it at all and they are both world class but for me Courtois has been more impressive and has proven and done more in his career so far imo. In a few years it will become more clear and easier to say who is the better keeper but like I said before Courtois has been better in his career so far imo.

1930~~~
nice to see him having a very relaxing and comfortable game. he deserves some clean sheet bonus for sure.

1931~~~
Well then we'll have to agree to disagree then really Raul, since the assessment is based on eye-test instead of tangible data and we probably have different scales for rating their performances. I probably watched 20-25+ Atletico games last season (new hipster club of choice after Dortmund in 2012/ 2013) and Thibaut was very good no doubt, but I've seen performances of similar caliber by De Gea (who honestly should seem weaker to me given that I intently scrutinize his every mis-step as a United fan). As for the Casillas and Buffon comparison, I personally feel it's bit unfair since De Gea's skillset resembles Gigi more closely than Iker. Like both of them, he's an excellent instinctive shot-stopper but has also developed controlling ability in the box, expanded his repertoire to defensing set pieces (a major weakness coming into the league) and aerial balls (like the latter). Courtois did indeed put in good performances vs Madrid and Barcelona but De Gea was similarly other-wordly vs Madrid at the Bernabeu where he was easily our MOTM (7 saves including 2 brilliant ones from Coentrao) and held his own pretty well until Nani's red card at Old Trafford (another 7 saves). I personally feel that using the presence of Madrid and Barcelona in the same division as Courtois these past couple of seasons is a bit disingenuous because a player is great irrespective of the opponents, it's just that he hasn't had the chance to face them regularly. Fair enough about the latter part I guess, they are pretty evenly matched indeed. But IMO De Gea edges it with Courtois following him closely. I can however see why some would hold the opposite view, it's totally understandable given Thibaut's part in driving Atletico to success while we finished 7th in the league in the same season with De Gea. That said, I always feel team accomplishments are more closely allied to the system and overall quality of the squad, so it's harder to gauge individual performances in a vacuum. You're correct though, It'll be a pleasure to watch these two battle it out in the same league. Hopefully David De Goat comes out on top !

1932~~~
PFA player of the month for November, well done Dave!

Only place I found it:

1933~~~
But didn't de Gea put great performances for A. Madrid against Barcelona?

1934~~~
Average match score is only 6.5, Thought it would be higher!

1935~~~
The fan vote. It's official:

1936~~~
Getting taken off every week for Lindegaard every week is really affecting his ratings.

1937~~~
That's the score for the Hull game. He didn't really have anything to do. Obviously in current form he'd probably have had a stunner if he'd needed to, but you can't expect people to give him speculative 8s and 9s.

EDIT: Oh I see that's his season average too. Probably just a case of the players who stand out from each game getting the high scores and consistent performers not doing quite so well. Also when we were conceding goals like crazy is would've been hard to rate him highly even though he was so rarely at fault for any of them. And the Dons game.

1938~~~
Nah it's his average for the season. The game against MK Dons affected his rating hugely.

1939~~~
Is it not the average rating throughout the season?

1940~~~
Yeah my bad, edited my post.

1941~~~

1942~~~
Was he poor vs West Ham?

1943~~~
I can't really remember but this is the goal we conceded

1944~~~
Ah yeah I remember that goal haha

1945~~~
Goalkeepers find it more difficult to have a high average score, particularly at a big club where there's going to be little to do in some games and you'll get a casual score of about 6.0 for these sort of games. When you're a forward or a midfielder you can impress pretty much everytime you set your foot on the pitch, when you're a goalkeeper you actually need your defenders to not be able to do the job properly so you can show off your abilities. A keeper like De Gea will probably have about 15-20 games where he does nothing.

1946~~~
I don't think Courtois is superior at all - equal or slightly ahead.

1947~~~
First 5 games hi didn't do anything wrong, but also almost nothing really good.

1948~~~
We all hope so, and even more <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> (but not because of injury, please).

1949~~~
Literally our best player along with Rooney, I'm glad he finally gets the recognition he deserves.

1950~~~
Lets just hope we get that contract sorted now

1951~~~
That's right. SAF was at the game with Eric Steele. He was also amazing against Real Madrid for us in that first leg in 2013. Also I know it was a friendly but he had a blinder against Barcelona when we played them in Sweden back in 2012. Not sure what that posters argument is in that regard as De Gea has played just as well as Courtois against the big two in Spain.

1952~~~
There has to be some recognition of the fact that Courtois has enjoyed steady back line performances all season, whereas De Gea has, to put it mildly, not.

Neuer > De Gea > Courtois.

1953~~~

1954~~~
That's just fantastic to hear champ.

1955~~~
Come again..?

1956~~~
We need to get him nailed to a new 5 year contract.

1957~~~
I'd say we're absolutely shitting ourselves about his contract right about now. Unless we're not as we already know he's off, hence Valdes pitching up.

1958~~~
Up there with the likes of Hazard and Neymar as the best young players in the world.

1959~~~
He is just class. Makes saves that seperate him from the good keepers and puts him in the great category, a must have for a top club.

I have no worries about his contract right now, he loves it here and has Herrera and Mata here. I think he will sign a new contract soon, do we get to the end of the season and he hasn't signed yet we should panic.

1960~~~
I didn't know that there was a PFA fans player of the month.

Who won the actually award for November or has that no been announced yet?

1961~~~
Sissoko won it, if i'm not mistaken, and De Gea is third behind Aguero.

1962~~~

1963~~~
Best keeper in the world! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Well, the EPL anyway.</span>

1964~~~
Sorry, it was just a very odd, irrelevant comment to come at the end of a long exchange that didn't involve you and I couldn't avoid replying in a facetious manner.

1965~~~
Good on him.

1966~~~
So how about we lock this boy down for a good 6 six years eh? He needs a mega a contract andf I wouldn't be shy about giving the lad north of £150,000 a week.

1967~~~
Well deserved.

1968~~~
Very well deserved. Now get him to sign a contract! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1969~~~
Well deserved, our main priority in January should be to get him on a longterm contract that reflects his status within the team.

1970~~~
This guy is so good it makes me cry.

1971~~~
LOUIS SIGN HIM UP, LOUIS, LOUIS SIGN HIM UP!

1972~~~
Fecking incredible.

1973~~~
Otherworldly.

1974~~~
Saved us points again. Make him the highest paid keeper in the world please!

1975~~~
give him all the money, the magnificent bastard.

1976~~~
Once again in added time he saves us, my heart stopped because I honestly thought we'd thrown that win away. 3 points owed once again to Dave! Give this man a contract now PLEASE!

1977~~~
Sweet Jaysus

1978~~~
God.

1979~~~
De God.

1980~~~
He's the best 'keeper in the league, and second only to Neuer in the world. He's better than Courtois too, so don't tell me he isn't. Phenomenal football player.

1981~~~
Surely its reaching the point where we can write poems about him RAWK style.

To think he could be in goal for another 15 years yet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1982~~~
ALL THE FECKING MONEY.

1983~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzS6azfIIAAl2sM.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzS6azfIIAAl2sM.jpg"/>

1984~~~
Get him signed ASAP.

1985~~~
He's keeping us in it.

1986~~~
Best in the fecking world, what a keeper.

1987~~~
My God.

1988~~~
So apt!!<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1989~~~
fecking hell the saves he pulls out of nowhere

1990~~~
No goalkeeper saves points like this guy. The save itself isn't actually that outrageous or anything, but his ability to do it when it matters is simply special.

1991~~~
I'd be interested to know how many of our points he's responsible for.

1992~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1993~~~
If he stays here for his entire career, he'll become a club legend. No doubt about that. Already a hero.

1994~~~
Only the very best goalkeepers can be a spectator for 90 minute and make 2 world class saves in injury time. Give him a 10 year contract, let him just fill in the amount of money he wants to earn during that period.

1995~~~
Chilling mode all night then pulls off one of the saves of the season. Give him 200k a week.

1996~~~
Courtois can suck my hairy balls, De Gea is comfortably the best in the league.

1997~~~
What a man.

1998~~~
By my count he has saved us at least 7 points this season. He is simply the best.

1999~~~
Pay him all the monies!!!! So fecking good, nothing to do all game then pulls two worldies out of the bag to make sure we hold on to the 3 points.

2000~~~
They say a great keeper will get you 12 extra points. He's well on his way.

2001~~~
Sell De Gea, sack <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> !!

2002~~~
How have we not signed him up for life?

2003~~~
200k contract now please. Find him a Manc lass too so he won't want to go back to Spain.

2004~~~
He's unbelievable at times, best reaction stopper in the world.

New contract, now.

2005~~~
So fecking good

2006~~~
His average rating is 6.5?! How is it <i>that</i> low?!

2007~~~
He's already won player of the year.

2008~~~
feck me! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2009~~~
Get that contract sorted out Eddie!

2010~~~
In this form, he is the best keeper in the world, and I hope he maintains this.

2011~~~
Goat. He'll probably save us about 20+ points by the end of the season. 7-9 points at the very least as things stand. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2012~~~
I don't care about his ranking in terms of the league or the world, I'm just glad that we have him. SAF knew what he was doing signing the lad. He's sensational!

2013~~~
Tell me how Courtois is the better keeper?!

2014~~~
Quick question, the 2nd one at the far post before Young cleared it off the line, he did save that didn't he?

2015~~~
Any gifs of his second save??

2016~~~
Said the same thing in the post match thread.

2017~~~
He plays for another team, that's the logic.

2018~~~
Solved.

2019~~~
I love him. I just love him.

2020~~~
Dave. <3

2021~~~
Yes

2022~~~
Some games he's done nothing cos we've had all the ball I guess but still really low.

We have to sign him on a new deal. Be the best piece of business we do in January

2023~~~
He is literally our best player along with Rooney, just unreal.

2024~~~
Unreal

2025~~~
Our best player, truly world class. How many points has he won us this season?

2026~~~
Definitely!

2027~~~
Said it before, but he could pork my mom and I'd say thank you mister Dave, you want a sandwich with that? Saves us once again.

2028~~~
Easy to see from there. Early on we weren't doing great

2029~~~
He is stealing everyone's thunder in almost every match these days.

2030~~~
David 'D' Gea! 
Give him a new contract already.

2031~~~

2032~~~
Jesus how many points has he saved us now?For god's sake give him as much as he wants and tie him down for 6 years+.

2033~~~
He's not, nor has he been. ALthough he is very good he's just the hippsters choice.

2034~~~
The way he stands up on that 2nd save is just outrageous, just like "Go on fecking hit me!"

2035~~~
People love to go on about Neuer and Courtois - but put them behind our defense for much of the year and you'd get comparable results. DDG is one of the world's best.

2036~~~
Has the potential and is on track to go down as our greatest ever keeper. And I don't say that lightly.

2037~~~
He's amazing.

2038~~~
If he isn't given a new deal before Xmas you have to simply think he just doesn't want to sign one, as the club would be making arguably one of the biggest mistakes in recent times if they are just refusing to give him a deal. Brilliant player.

2039~~~
It think it's safe to assume this isn't the case at all.

2040~~~
Whatever the club are offering him in his contract renewal - double it. Now.

2041~~~
He's a better player than Neymar or Bale right now, and yes, I'm being serious. Best young player in the world.

2042~~~
Seriously, he's such an important player for us it's unreal. Give him the contract he deserves already!

2043~~~
Just watched the saves again. Give him anything and everything.

2044~~~
Imagine how many clean sheets we would have this season if we had a decent back four

2045~~~
Just got in from work - does anybody have any gifs of the saves tonight? Much appreciated.

2046~~~
Agreed. They're shit in goal.

2047~~~
Why is his average rating over the season only 6.5? There's some fecking high standards around here! Neuer would probably only be in the mid 7s if the caf were judging!

2048~~~
A god. Simple as that. Neur is the only one in the world better than him right now.

2049~~~
People rage voting when we lose, presumably, and then marking fairly when we win.

Most (all?) players have really low ratings.

2050~~~
Hopefully he will stay. His price just keeps going up with performances like that.

2051~~~

2052~~~
Just noticed Fellaini has 6.3 and de Gea has 6.5 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2053~~~
We can't let them truth get in the way of a good rumour.

2054~~~
6, we would have 6.

2055~~~
At this moment, even Neuer isnt. De Gea is getting points for his team, 2 points today, 3 vs Arsenal, 2 vs Everton, 1 vs Chelsea, he is just unreal at the moment.

2056~~~
He's going to go isn't he...I mean...it's just such a given...

2057~~~
True, although it's hard to say that because Neur is probably getting more help from his defence even though ours was generally pretty good toady too. I would still put him ahead as he is better at commanding his box and he has that sweeper ability too. There really isn't a lot in it though.

2058~~~
Our best and most important player. Although I like a lot of our players, he is the only one I would "cry" for ages if he leaves.

2059~~~
Yeah thats also the other side of the story, they get less opportunity to expose themselves, maybe Courtois could perform similar performances if he didnt play in front of a stable defence, but tbf since Everton, de Gea has also been very good in the box, and has been more than just a line keeper.

2060~~~
Just seen someone on Twitter say he has the ability to save Anderson's career <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Apparently had a 100% pass competition rate tonight, with 17/17.

2061~~~
He was voted 4 for the Leicester and MK Dons games which bring his ratings down.

2062~~~
In this form, he's the best in the world. How people can still try and claim that Courtois is the better goalkeeper is beyond me. Clearly the best in the league. Neuer is his only rival for best in the world right now, and if this form continues for the rest of the season, he'll have a genuine claim for that top spot.

2063~~~
Chelsea players, for whatever reason, receive ridiculous praise from RedCafe. You only have to look at some of the assessments of Hazard to notice this. Anyway, there's no doubting de Gea is the best 'keeper in the Premier League and second only to Neuer in the world. Not right now anyway.

2064~~~
BBC 5Live gave me the impression that his save in injury time was incredible. It wasn't.

He is looking bloody good these days though.

2065~~~
no, the only think given is that we don't buy shy shy given

2066~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXs4aNHpNg0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> </a>In pretend it really was good! <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXs4aNHpNg0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2067~~~
That's actually the Ashley Young clearance.

2068~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> To be fair to him I had no idea what had happened either, until I watched it a second time.

2069~~~
I wonder how many points he's won us already this season? Incredible keeper.

2070~~~
Yeah, I could have sworn I saw the net ripple haha.

2071~~~
There was also a brief period on here where he was (probably rightly) questioned. Started the season slowly but my word he's found form since. The new coach deserves praise as well. Brilliant right now.

2072~~~
Off the top of my head, 2 against Stoke, West Ham and Everton, 1 against Chelsea

2073~~~
Only Neuer is better than him.

Pay him whatever he wants with the addition of all the donuts he can eat.

Keep Dave at this club

2074~~~
Arsenal as well? It's a lot anyway! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2075~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://t.co/6bGq1afFKF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/6bGq1afFKF</a>

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2076~~~
I am seriously beginning to worry he will leave. It's taking way too long for my liking to tie him down with us.

2077~~~
Oh yeah. Think I should replace Arsenal with West Ham. The chance I'm thinking of was that offside Nolan goal.

2078~~~
<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2079~~~
I'm nearly sure that was his reaction to another game, the van Persie equaliser against Chelsea perhaps?

2080~~~
Is that from tonight? There was a very similar video of him celebrating RVP's equaliser against Chelsea.

Edit: <a class="username" data-user="48866, @KiD MoYeS" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48866/">@KiD MoYeS</a> beat me to it.

2081~~~
Just got in from work and seen the set piece last minute save. Any others?

2082~~~
He did make a good save from Sakho in that game though, at 2-1. It wouldn't be a stretch to include that and say he got us a draw. I would give him Arsenal and say he has won us 7 points this season.

2083~~~
Seriously just get the new deal sorted and pay him what he wants. 6 year deal on the same sort of money that Neuer is on should do the trick.

2084~~~
I'm telling you he isn't.

2085~~~
He wasn't great with some of his passing early on in the season. His distribution was poor. Also let in a poor goal against someone (remember the goal, not who scored) and wasn't great against MK Dons. Made up for it though.

2086~~~
Steady.

2087~~~
I can see how people think Courtois is better in general (although I don't) but certainly De Gea has been the better of the two so far this season and it's very difficult argue against that. He has saved us on numerous occasions this season, which Courtois hasn't done for Chelsea. There's no doubt about it that Courtois is overrated. People were hyping him up as one of the best goalkeepers in the world last season when most of them had only seen him playing for Athletico every now and then in Europe. For some reason it has taken until this season for non-United fans to realise how good De Gea is, yet non-Athletico/Chelsea fans have been raving about Courtois for a while now.

2088~~~
There's no way you can say Courtois' performances this season have bettered de Gea's, you'd be lying if you were and you know it.

2089~~~
I was not being serious when I said that. I can see why you lot would take De Gea over Courtois (I wouldn't, but there's not much in it, certainly not enough to argue about). 

De Gea has made more spectacular saves, but that's not a fair way to compare keepers as Courtois has not been put in the same situation as him. Using that standard would lead you to the conclusion that he's better than Neuer too (which he clearly is not).

2090~~~
Stick a strong defence in front of de Gea and I'm sure he wouldn't have to produce spectacular saves as consistently as he does, that's for sure. I've watched a lot of Courtois the past season and a half, and I can see why he's rated as highly as he is, but right now de Gea is the better 'keeper, for a number of reasons. Just an opinion, and one I'm guessing the majority of RedCafe will agree with. Lets see how Courtois deals with being over worked, not that he ever will have to playing under Mourinho...

2091~~~
He's not overrated. He's either the second or third best keeper in the world depending on your perspective. He definitely is one of the best in the world. That's not hyping him up.

I'm not sure if you realise this, but he was voted in the team of the season two years ago which clearly shows that he has hardly been underrated.

2092~~~
Yeah, up until the Everton game some on here were doubting him and said he was doing poor. From that point onwards he's done great apart from one goal which might be same one you're thinking of.

2093~~~
Obviously, which is why it is hard to compare them.

Name them.

Again, obviously. That's hardly a convincing argument though. I'm sure the majority of TheShedEnd would say the opposite.

2094~~~
He's no Mignolet alright.

2095~~~
Shot stopping and reflexes, I think de Gea has produced world class and quite frankly stunning saves the past two and a half seasons. For me, there is no contest, de Gea is better in that regard. 

Command of the area and aerial ability, now this was an area de Gea was weak, but we've seen massive progression. It's a non issue now, is he as good as Courtois? I dunno, but there isn't much between them in that area, if anything.

Communication, I'm not sure either 'keeper is all that vocal, so I wouldn't compare and contrast them there. 

Essentially what I'm saying is that there isn't much between the two 'keepers, but what edges it for de Gea is his ability to produce world class and match winning saves so consistently, even in games he hasn't been called upon 'til the dying seconds. Courtois, in the season and a half I've watched him, has yet to replicate de Gea's match winning performances to that level.

2096~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Mignolet. 

De Ge's distribution was superb. 17/17 passes completed I think. Has worked on that and coming off his line. Constantly improving.

2097~~~
DDG is clearly one of the best but he's had to grow into a more commanding presence as he's bulked up since joining us. Courtois and Neuer are both much bigger naturally so I think they've been able to rely more on their size while DDG had to adjust.

Imo, DDG has the best reflexes, Neuer the best reader of the game, and Courtois in the middle on both. Also, I'd say DDG's got an advantage in that he's playing his 4th PL season, which is surely more physical than La Liga or Bundesliga. That was always supposed to be the big test for him - well, he's passing it spectacularly. Will be interesting to see Courtois dealing with the PL wear and tear. No midwinter break, harsher conditions than Spain - don't expect him to wobble much but it's still to be seen.

2098~~~
Courtois, for me, is a consistent and steadfast 'keeper, so I don't think he'll have any issues over the coming months. de Gea, however, will continue to produce moments of absolute brilliance.

2099~~~
Because he's in a situation where he has to which is a damning indictment on your defence.

2100~~~
I'm not denying he is one of the best in the world. If you ask football fans (outside of United fans) to list the top 5 keepers in the world, the vast, vast majority would go with 1) Neuer and 2) Courtois. Obviously Neuer is the best goalkeeper in the world and that isn't even up for debate. I just don't see why Courtois is considered by most to be the best of the rest. Just yesterday FFT did a list of the Top 100 players in the world. In terms of goalkeepers there were 6 on the list: 6) Lloris, 5) De Gea, 4) Navas, 3) Buffon, 2) Courtois and 1) Neuer. It was an awful list in general but again it had Courtois as comfortably the 2nd best goalkeeper in the world with De Gea stuck behind Navas and Buffon! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I mean if you look at the performances of both De Gea and Courtois over the last few seasons there is clearly very little between the two, so how come Courtois is always considered to be in the top 3 of goalkeepers in the world yet De Gea isn't? The answer? Courtois is overrated. 

Of course I realise this. However, I'm not sure if you realise this but that team was voted for by the footballers of the Premier League. When I said he is underrated I was referring to fans of other clubs and not players. I'm sure his peers realise he is a world class player at this considering he has probably cost most of them a win bonus or two along the way in his short PL career.

2101~~~
He didn't have to lift a finger versus Stoke 'til the dying seconds, and produced brilliant saves. I've yet to see Courtois save points for Chelsea... And I've yet to see Mignolet save anything! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2102~~~
Such wit.

Damning indictment on your 'keeper. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2104~~~
We would be around midtable at this point if it weren't for him. Our best player this season. Just extend his contract FFS.

2105~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Isn't that why football teams have goalkeepers?

2106~~~
it is great to know he is widely known as a top 5 keeper now. only a matter of time before he is a definite top 3.

2107~~~
I couldn't name three better 'keepers right now, could you?

2108~~~
He is definitely top three.

2109~~~
i can't too personally. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2110~~~
Not sure I'd class the save at the end as "brilliant", he'd be absolutely furious (as would any other good goalkeeper) with himself if he hadn't saved it. 

Distribution was much better today though and had absolutely no chance with the goal. Hopefully we can keep giving him these straightforward games with little to do, beats the hell out of him having to play out of his skin.

2111~~~
Best keeper in the league for me and it's down to him being a true match winner.

No other keeper has come close to winning as many points for their side as De Gea has. Sure you might argue they haven't had to, but the fact is De Gea has, and you can't take that away from him.

2112~~~
That's not even an argument. Every goalkeeper makes a save because he has to. If you looked up Schmeichel or VDS' best saves, I'm sure you'd also find a host of defensive errors. It doesn't matter though in terms of what the goalkeeper has produced though, does it?

2113~~~

Every good performance is noted by Real Madrid.....

2115~~~
One of the best GKs in the world right now without doubt. Only Neuer is marginally better.

2116~~~
Why his average rating is only 6.6?

2117~~~
if this is FM then i'm sure he is around 8.00 to 8.50

2118~~~
How many points has he won us by himself this season? It's quite ridiculous how good he's becoming.

2119~~~
Absolute world class goalkeeper.

Needs that new contract ASAP.

2120~~~
Just alluding to the fact that some might argue Courtois is better but hasn't had the same "chances" to prove he's on the same-level so to speak, because he's been playing in front of a very settled organized back 4 (that's protected by 2 holding midfielders). For me, De Gea is simply better because we can only judge what we see eh

2121~~~
He's becoming even better than I thought he would. Please get that contract signed.

2122~~~
He's moved ahead of Courtois this season. Courtois can't even keep clean sheets in that Chelsea back 5. He's been relatively ho-hum this season. De Gea wins points for the team on a weekly basis.

2123~~~
The look on Mame "50 Cent" Birame Diouf said it all, after the save and even after the final whistle. Those two saves were amazing.

2124~~~
Truly amazing. Grown leaps and bounds since last season. We need Woodward to work his magic on De Gea's contract

2125~~~
But we all know who would win any goalkeeper of the season vote.

2126~~~
He has to sign the new contract

2127~~~
Every reply to each of his tweet on his twitter account is either <3 or "sign the life long contract please" or "never leave us" <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2128~~~
No words.

2129~~~
Dunno whether I'm being ridiculously harsh or expecting too high a standard from Dave, but I saw both saves as quite elementary for a 'keeper of his standard. 

I think perceptions of both stops were heightened because they occurred in stoppage time. I'd have been disappointed if he hadn't saved them. I'm not saying they weren't good saves, but for a 'keeper who's good at making reaction saves, I think they we're pretty bog standard.

For me, his best saves this season were the one against Wilshere and the stupendous stop against Everton (Oviedo, if I remember correctly).

2130~~~
I can somehow understand if some call Courtois and Neuer better, (not my opinion atm, but can understand) but how some can say Cech, Lloris, Navas, Casillas, Buffon are better is just ridiculous.

2131~~~
You forgot Ter Stegen!

2132~~~
I think the media had decided before the season started who'd be best keeper come the end of the year.
I think that's a testament to his talent more than anything else. The first one (the cleared header) is especially impressive but doesn't look all that in replays. It was coming in really quick and it was an incredible reflex save, and what makes it better is that he managed to punch quite far away to a good zone, when given the direction of the ball, he could've spilled it into his six yard box (which would've made scoring from the rebound quite easy for Stoke).

I can't really remember the second one though, I'd need to see it again.

2133~~~

2134~~~
Has he feck. The two of them have been excellent this season. Dave has been the busier of the two, which has given him more chance to shine (and more errors) but I don't know how anyone can conclusively say one is better than the other.

2135~~~
Courtois has been more consistent overall, great from the get go, whereas Dave had a really poor start to the season that was heavily criticized on here, as I recall, but since the Everton game he's definitely been a level above anything we've seen from Courtois, but obviously he's had more to do too so it's maybe not a fair comparison.

2136~~~
De Gea and Courtuis debate is getting boring, and doesn't look to ever end.

So, my 2 cents there. I would put them at around the same level, and if one of them is better, then surely it is marginal. 

De Gea is clearly better at shot stopping and producing world class saves. Saying that, Courtuis is excellent at it too. Both seems to be at around the same level when it comes to game on the air. Courtuis is bigger, while De Gea has the advantage of playing on a very physical league for a few years.

At communicating with other players, I think that Courtuis is better. He's generally more vocal, although De Gea isn't anymore as shy as he was when he came here.

On one on one chances, again I think that Courtuis is better than De Gea. De Gea has the tendency of staying on the line, which minimizes his chances to save them. However, recently he has improved on that aspect.

Distribution, I would go with De Gea, but needs to be said that he was better at it 18 months ago than he is now.

And finally, on concentration, I would put them on the same level. Both have terrific concentration.

If you add all the things, you see that they are around the same level. I think that De Gea has been better this season, mainly because he had so much saves to make, something that Courtuis hadn't because he has a great defense. 

And finally, on pure goalkeeping abilities, I would put both of them ahead of Neuer. However, Neuer is still better than them considering that he is also a world class central defender at the same time.

2137~~~
Give him the fecking contract finally.

2138~~~
I agree.

De Gea is saving us almost every week playing in a haphazard back 5. Courtois looks very solid in a very established back 5. 

I do think that if Courtois and De Gea switched teams, De Gea's praise would be through the roof and far beyond what Courtois is getting, and little would be said of Courtois if he was playing for United. I do think Courtois is excellent, but I don't think he's as good at reacting to close range shots as De Gea is. I don't believe Courtois would be saving our blushes like De Gea has been.

De Gea really is a match winner, quite literally. Courtois is incredibly commanding and has a great presence about him. The difference between the two is minimal, but De Gea shades it.

2139~~~
What does that mean? It almost seems like many people forgot what a freakishly brilliant shotstopper Neuer has been all his career and obviously still is. Just because he developed into a goalkeeper that does so much more than basic goalkeeping he isn't absolutely fantastic at the 'pure goalkeeping abilities' as well. He's catching more difficult shots at him instead of punching them away than any other keeper I've seen, he's dominant in the air and picks up the ball most of the time instead of punching it back into play. He's way better at organising a defense than De Gea (I'm not sure how much of the organisation in Courtois' teams was down to Simeone/Mourinho and I haven't seen enough of him for Belgium to judge him). Of course none of that is surprising, because he's significantly older and more experienced than those two. But in his final 3 seasons at Schalke, his defense already was twice the best in the league and that's with some truely average players infront of him. Even the year Schalke finished 14th, only 3 teams conceded less goals than he did and he regularly came up with beyond incredible saves like De Gea does now at United, let alone if you look at some of his performances in the CL. Obviously he gets less chances to show that skill in a team that very rarely comes under pressure at the back, but that doesn't mean he isn't still incredible at it.

2140~~~
He's excellent as a goalkeeper, but I think that both De Gea and Courtuis might be just slightly better. Obviously, Neuer makes excellent saves all the time and has done this for a long time (his performance against us in 2011 might be the best performance from a keeper I have ever seen), but as I said, I think that De Gea and probably Courtuis are sightly better. 

Neuer however is a better organizer (no doubt there) and more importantly has this ability of saving the team while he acts as a defender.

2141~~~
One thing Courtois has had since his time at Atletico/Chelsea is a solid reliable defence infront of him week in week out, and 2 managers who know how to set their sides up to defend. Don't think De Gea has ever had that privilege at United. Very hard to build up a strong understanding with your defence when you don't have a clue who's going to be playing in it. This is his 4th season at United now, and nothing's changed.

2142~~~
Nothing to do for 90 minutes and still making 2 huge saves. That's what I call al world class goalkeeper

2143~~~
Did anyone see Casillas' performance on the weekend? It's insane to think he is still the Spanish #1 over our Dave.

2144~~~
More likely the opposite. They're both very good keepers, so it stands to reason the busier of the two will be more likely to catch the eye.

2145~~~
I think De Gea edges him on pure shotstopping, De Gea is obviously a complete freak when it comes to that, but it's still damn close. But there's more basic stuff like for example positioning or catching instead of giving away second chances and Neuer is (still) ahead of De Gea in all of them. There's nothing Courtois does better than Neuer. I'm not sure if there has ever been a goalkeeper as complete as Neuer, at least I don't remember a sweeper keeper like him who was that brilliant in all the basic goalkeeping stuff as well. All three are already amazing goalkeepers though and easily the top 3 in the world at the moment.

2146~~~
Is he, though? I think De Gea finally took his place a couple of months ago and only his injured helped Casillas returned to the spanish lineup for the recent games a few weeks ago. We'll have to see what happens in a few months.

2147~~~
De Gea is wonderful at catching the ball. Seriously, he is on Buffon-esque level when it comes to it. There are some shoots when I am a bit scared that might end on the net, and De Gea catches them.

I would say that Courtuis might be better than Neuer at shot stopping, but anyway it is close.

Anyway, with pure goalkeeping skills, I meant more shotstopping than anything else. Which isn't correct, considering that organizing, catching crosses etc is definitely the job of a keeper.

Agree with your last point. In fact, we rarely see sweeper keepers, and even in those cases they aren't that great keepers (Valdez for example). Neuer on the other side, shines at everything.

2148~~~
The point I'm making is that I don't believe Courtois would have made some of those saves that De Gea has, so wouldn't be putting in the same match-winning performances. De Gea's reactions from close range are just freakish, really.

But it is still Courtois at Chelsea, who is the much less busier keeper, who seems to be getting all the plaudits currently. David Seaman was on Goals on Sunday the weekend before last, and he was constantly hammering on about Courtois (who didn't really do much in the game against West Brom the day before) as well as Kasper Schmeichel. Barely a mention of De Gea, despite all the saves he made in the first half against Arsenal which kept us in the game, when it could have been 3 or 4 nil at half time.

2149~~~
de Gea is the best shot stopper, Courtois commands his box the best regarding high balls in (crosses/corners etc) and Neuer is the best sweeper and passer. 

All are of course very close, but I think there is no clear "best" out of them yet. 

As others have mentioned I would like to see Courtois tested in a defense not as strong as Chelsea or Atletico.

2150~~~
When he signed for us, his first year, I'd never ever think that he'd be so influential on our points tally, what a player and what a guy.

2151~~~
I'd take Seaman's opinion seriously, to be honest. He was a keeper who was absolutely exceptional at controlling his area. The one aspect where I think Courtois is a level above De Gea. 

We don't know if Courtois could have replicated De Gea's saves this season. I suspect that one or two of them were saves that no other keeper could have made but criticising Courtois for something that hasn't actually happened seems incredibly unfair. Let's not forget he's pulled off some cracking saves himself.

2152~~~
I'm not really criticising Courtois. I'm just predicting that De Gea would be getting all the praise Courtois is currently getting (and more) if their positions were switched, as I believe he is slightly better, purely because he undoubtedly a match-winner. As I said, I think Courtois is excellent, and the difference between them both is minimal, but he excels in different areas, IMO.

2153~~~
Considering Van Gaal and Hoek were the ones to "manufacture" Van der Sar, in terms of taking an above average keeper and transforming him into one of the best in the world - a great vocal organizer and distributor we knew at United, that's one specific area De Gea should continually improve at over the next 2-3 seasons. Courtois is certainly superior right now when it comes to managing the box and commanding his area but De Gea's goalkeeping instincts and reflexes are off the charts, probably the best since Buffon at Parma. Most of the tactical and organisational aspects of goalkeeping can be learnt with time and experience. But conversely I'm not sure Thibaut can ever match De Gea's natural tools and lightning agility.

That's why I won't be surprised to see Courtois stagnate in the not too distant future, he's already close to the polished article at a very young age. There's nothing seemingly deficient in his game and that's the problem become there's not a room left for acquired means of improvement. But De Gea still has a lot of flaws and despite them he's one of the Top 2 keepers in Europe behind only Neuer or one of the Top 3 depending on who you ask. He really is just scratching the surface of what he might become and will improve a lot over the next few years. It's scary how good De Gea might be once he's ironed out the weaknesses and taken up a more vocal leadership role. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2154~~~
This is what separates the two at the moment. Courtois has not had much opportunity to show his shot-stopping ability this season (although he is no mug) thanks to a solid STABLE defence, whereas De Gea has had loads of last-ditch one-on-ones and reflex saves to make.

Courtois has however had plenty of opportunity to show his decisiveness on crosses and corners, where he excels. De Gea has made strides in this area but Courtois has the height advantage, which will always give him more presence.

It's hard to judge one against the other in these circumstances as we don't see the full range of their abilities.

2155~~~
feckin' Courtois <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Only Neuer is ahead of our Dave now!

2157~~~
Just listening to Rene on SSN right now talk about DgG. He's in Manchester and I really think that LvG could benefit by offering him a major coaching position … think he'd bite his hand off and between him and Giggs there's some future-proofing there too!

2158~~~
Obviously United fans will say De Gea is better than Courtois, and Chelsea fans will say the opposite. If you ask neutral fans though, I suspect the majority of them would say Courtois was the better keeper.

2159~~~
Fan-feckin'-tastic! Better than Phil Nevilles "unbiased" comm for US TV too!

2160~~~
I think most United fans don't mind Courtois being held up as better. Provided it's acknowledged De Gea is only a short length behind him.

2161~~~
Definitely in my opinion, Courtois hasn't really been tested or made any stand out saves. So you can't really be speculative and say him, DDG has proved it!

2162~~~
But what stand out performances has Courtois had this season?

2163~~~
Well that's the thing though isn't it? De Gea has looked more impressive because he has had to make stand out saves like the ones against Oviedo and Wilshere whereas Courtois hasn't really been tested in that respect yet this season.

2164~~~
It's time to give the guy a blank cheque with the words "Manchester United: 10 year contract" at the bottom.

2165~~~
That's because your typical neutral has seen Atletico tear up La Liga and UCL with Courtois in the sticks and seen United struggle with De Gea. 

Courtois plays for his national team, Dave (up until the summer) didn't even make the Spain squads. There's a lot of assuming going on with the average neutral plus you have to wonder how many games those neutrals have actually watched of Courtois.

There really isn't that much difference between the two, except that one has had a consistently better defence playing ahead of him and the other has not.

2166~~~
Yep which is why I'd tend to go for De Gea, he has proven how good he is this season, I can fully understand people going for Courtois over De Gea because they're both as good as each other but DDG edges it for me because he's proven! Courtois more than likely would have made most of the saves DDG did but we can only speculate this. I would love to see Courtois tested to see how he does.

2167~~~
Just seen a tweet that he had 100% pass completion last night. Must have been what Van Gaal was referring to when he talked about him improving all the time.

2168~~~
This has to be made into a banner at Old Trafford!

2169~~~
I've noticed in the past few games that his kicks haven't been going that high!

2170~~~
Is this the fella who records every game?

It's nice to watch but also a bit weird at the same time.

2171~~~
I counted at least five to Fellaini's chest alone last night.

2172~~~
17/17 apparently? Heard a stat that in the Arsenal game, he touched the ball 50 times. That was 1 more then Rooney.

2173~~~
Twitter finally came into use! Love that celebration of his as well.

2174~~~
- Neutral fans don't watch enough games to judge them both.
- Bias. Chelsea been walking the league. ( like Atl Madrid last season, Keylor Navas had a better performance but Courtios took all the spotlights because his team won the title)

2175~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/829693/LiveStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015-Manchester-United-Stoke" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WhoScored page</a> for the game, they have him at 34 passes and 94.1% accuracy no?

2176~~~
There was one fantastic well floated pass to Mata that really sticks in the mind.

2177~~~
That's not a stat to proud of now is it!

2178~~~
Just checked this out as it didn't sound like the game I watched … but:

Rooney (according to the go-to stats finder of the Caf whoscored.com) had 47 touches
The same as Paddy McNair
10 more than Carrick (I'm not making this up stats fans)
10 less than Fellaini <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
and a whopping 13 less than St David himself!

2179~~~
First it was Hart now it's Courtois. What's the obsession with comparing de Gea to other keepers in the league? Why not just rate them individually both as very good goalkeepers? It's not even a fair situation to compare really given the defence for both of the teams. It doesn't seem to happen in any other thread as much as this one unless it's comparing what we actually have (i.e. RVP for Falcao etc) so I just don't get why it ALWAYS seems to happen with de Gea.

What he did last night he did well, the saves were very important, albeit I'd be pretty disappointed if he didn't make them, he's definitely one of our better performers this season. I can only imagine the 6.6 rating at the top is judged on some of his earlier games.

I'd be surprised if he left still, think the press are making a bigger deal of this contract stuff than it's worth. I'd imagine signing a contract which is worth millions of pounds isn't a decision that takes a couple of minutes but more months.

2180~~~
And 37 more than Van Persie!!

2181~~~

2182~~~
Huge fan of the Spaniard and all, but that's a shit article and a poor way to account for his importance. He's certainly won us points, but we wouldn't be 11th or whatever 'without him', there would be another keeper playing for us who may or may not have made saves as well. 

I understand the rationale behind the article, but it's a bit stupid.

2183~~~
That's an absurd article. Especially the table where it shows where we'd be without him. If they're going to take away points from United in a parallel universe where they don't have a keeper then what would happen to the other teams in that table if the same was applied to them? (obviously, Liverpool would be slightly better off)

What it does do, though, is put an end to the idea that he is being wilfully overlooked by the xenophobic English press.

2184~~~
Because United players are never praised, right?

2185~~~
We have Falcao, RVP, Rooney, di Maria, Mata, but who is winning us points? De Gea, bit strange.

2186~~~
Yup, shows he was overly busy in that Arsenal game. 50 touches for a keeper can't be the norm. I'm no expert in how many touches keepers take per game, but 50 in a game where we had 300/350 (rough guess) passes is a lot.

2187~~~
I still think Courtois still shows more authority when commanding his box and he is not too shabby at saving his team either as he did against us with Chelsea this season. De Gea on the other hand comes up with more crazy saves and is by far the better shot stopper. Courtois is more like Van der Sar in that sense whereas De Gea is closer to a young Casillas.

2188~~~
Exactly. This guy gets it.

2189~~~
Lol, can they do the same for Aguero at City, Costa at Chelsea and Sanchez at Arsenal?

2190~~~
Courtois, with that back 4 in front of him, has less than 5 clean sheets. Explain how that is excellent. He has been prone to an error here and there.

2191~~~
Our player of the season so far, the best goalkeeper in the Premier League this season too. Although I do rate Lloris higher.

2192~~~
He has won us points, but how the feck did he win us 3 points against Everton or Arsenal? At worse, with an average keeper instead of him, we would have drawn those games, as we were won them so if the other team scored, then logically we would have started attacking again. 

Also I hate how people say we're lucky in games when De Gea makes saves. He's a goalkeeper, his job is to make saves, just like the strikers' job is to score goals. We have him part of our team, so it's like saying we're lucky one of our 11 players had a good game. Just stupid really.

2193~~~
Dunno about that in the Arsenal game. If they had scored a goal or two in the first half the game would have played out much differently and they certainly wouldn't have had to have all of their defenders about 5 meters inside our half as they did. Actually wait a second it's Arsenal I take it all back.

2194~~~
Yeah, it's Arsenal, that's exactly what they would have done still. They can't really defend (or couldn't at the time still), and were beating Swansea before throwing away the game in similar fashion. And like others mentioned before, De Gea had a good game against Arsenal sure, but nothing was particularly amazing, it was just consistently solid saves and not making any mistakes rather then him bailing us out. Arsenal had loads of shots but most were from range, that's why I find it a bit annoying how people said shit like "I have no idea how they lost". They lost because they don't know how to defend and United had 4 or 5 clear cut chances from counters and should have scored more, not because De Gea had a great game.

2195~~~
Happy to see him getting more recognition which he fully deserves. Next step will be getting the Spain job full-time

2196~~~
Still no news regarding his contract extension?

2197~~~
Really? I'm surprised. Lloris has been very suspect for a good while now, even last night he was dodgy as hell against Chelsea.

2198~~~
I guess a more concise argument would be that he can never win us all 3 points on his own unless he's scored all the goals too.

2199~~~
May I ask why is that? Lloris is a sweeper keeper and he does that better than De Gea but DDG is better than Lloris in every other aspect of goalkeeping.

2200~~~
He meant it in terms of Courtois being part of a Chelsea team which is running away at the front. Thus the recognition for him.

2201~~~
Cant believe there are people who rate Lloris higher...

2202~~~

2203~~~
Seventh time he's been voted POTM, more than any other United player since he joined.

2204~~~
Bah. The Caf twitter feed mislead me. Thought it was a picture of David putting pen to paper.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2205~~~
Seriously we should just give him our POTS award right now - our league position would have been much worse if not for his crucial saves.

2206~~~
His saves today have all been those that you'd expect a good keeper to make.

2207~~~
No special saves, but saves you can expect from a great keeper.

2208~~~
Yeah, still made some fairly decent saves when called upon. Another good performance from him overall, even if it wasn't an incredible one or anything.

2209~~~
When you need him, he's there. Having De Gea is like having extra lives on a video game. Its brilliant!

2210~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzS6azfIIAAl2sM.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzS6azfIIAAl2sM.jpg"/>

2211~~~
Pay him whatever he wants!

2212~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2213~~~
We need him signed ASAP. Saved us yet again.

2214~~~
Sure, but it's surprising how often keepers fail to save the shots "you'd expect a good keeper to make".

2215~~~
The save from Pelle was top class. Got down quickly and got a good strong wrist on it and away from goal.

2216~~~
Without him we would be screwed.

2217~~~
If I have one complaint, and this is being nitpicky, I wish he'd made that Pelle save with his left boot. My favourite matchday photos are De Gea foot saves pics. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2218~~~
His wrists <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2219~~~
Brilliant save in the second half

Not even mentioning it on MNF

2220~~~
Neville has eyes only for Courtois.

2221~~~
The best part of his save in the second half was the fact he managed to push it so far out of the danger zone. Could easily (and many would) have parried that straight out to Long.

2222~~~
The number of points he's rescued for us this season has been amazing, we're half the team without him.

Chelsea have Matic, City have Aguero, Arsenal have Sanchez, we have Dave. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2223~~~
Let's try to get on Marca again, fellas. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i911.photobucket.com/albums/ac318/Vato_1979/MadridDeGea.jpg" src="http://i911.photobucket.com/albums/ac318/Vato_1979/MadridDeGea.jpg"/>

2224~~~
What a disgusting picture.

2225~~~
Better get used to it. <img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/>

2226~~~
Stay AWAY

2227~~~
That crest does not suit him.

2228~~~
That should be a bannable offense.

2229~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm so going to get threadbanned.

2230~~~
If Dave goes to Madrid..

We need to come up with something really bad for <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> 

Don't you agree <a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a>

2231~~~
That is absolutely disgusting!

Anyway, just the usual for him. Saved us when we needed him too.

2232~~~
I hate Barcelona but just for that post I hope they win the league.

2233~~~
Another excellent save tonight, low to his left and he not only gets a hand to it but pushes it far enough away as to avoid any potential run in on the rebound.

2234~~~
Anyone noticed that his kicking has improved? He seems to be hitting the ball very flat and finding teammates in space. Maybe it just appears that way because he has Fellaini as a target though.

2235~~~
Holy shit Dave bossed that 1v1.

2236~~~
GOD.

2237~~~
Another superb save.

2238~~~
I love you David.

2239~~~
Incredible. Pay him whatever we're paying Falcao. He is irreplaceable.

2240~~~
Top 3 goalies in the World right now?

2241~~~
feck that.

Best keeper in the world. Ridiculous

2242~~~
He's just ridiculous

2243~~~
Top 10 saves of the season will be all his at the end of May.

2244~~~
This fecker is so fecking likeable.

2245~~~
What a man.

Anyone got a gif of him celebrating?

2246~~~
Running out of superlatives in all honesty. Simply in a class of his own in the league and within touching distance of Neuer for the crown of the best and most decisive keeper in world football.

PS : Loved his celebration. His heart is in Manchester. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2247~~~
At what point do we seriously start mentioning him as the best keeper in the world? there's the courtois debate which is purely down to fanboyism as there both great keepers, but chelsea have a fantastic defence, compared with de gea single handedly keeping us in games.

again, Neuer is surrounded by a brilliant defence shielded by one of the best midfield's on the planet.

2248~~~
DDG is God

2249~~~
I don't think the defences Neuer and Courtois have should take anything away from them, although DDG is certainly up there for discussion among the best right now.

Just made another solid save too.

2250~~~
I don't think I'd swap him for any player in the world. Love him. Him and Smalling are my favourite players.

2251~~~
David De Dea aka God

2252~~~
If he continues like this, he could easily become one of the best keeper in football.

2253~~~
Lock him in a room with a contract and let him out once it's signed.

2254~~~
As I said in the matchday thread, offer him a blank check.

2255~~~
He's fecking amazing. Rename the stadium after him!!

2256~~~
And again.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2257~~~
Our most important player at the moment.

2258~~~
One of the best performances by a United keeper in a long time.

2259~~~
Somebody PLEASE get him photoshopped as Gandalf and "YOU SHALL NOT PASS"

2260~~~
Where's this Bundesliga guy who's listed some absolutely fecking shit keepers, like 5 or 6 of them and claimed that they are all better than DDG? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2261~~~
Is he Spain's number 1 yet?

2262~~~
Shot stopping has always been great but these one on one saves he's been making all season are absolutely fantastic. He is a beast.

2263~~~
Best in the world right now.

2264~~~
Reminds of Peter Schmeichel against Newcastle in '96

2265~~~
He's been excellent today, majority of shots hit directly at him, but the Balotelli save he touched on to the crossbar was brilliant. Liverpool should have scored at least three of the chances they've passed up though, really poor on their behalf.

2266~~~
Could we give his goal reaction the Miguel Herrera treatment please ? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2267~~~
WTF <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2268~~~
Has he scored us 15 points this season? Incredible. Refuse to believe there's a better GK in the world than him right now.

2269~~~
This reminds me of the Tim Howard performance at the World Cup; a lot of the shots were hit close to him, but good positioning and constant concentration saved us the 3 points today. And there a couple really good ones in there.

2270~~~
There can't be a better keeper out there at the moment. If only he didn't need to be this good on such a regular basis.

2271~~~
When De Gea comes into the locker room after the game, Ed better be there saying "shut up and take my money!".

2272~~~
No goalkeeper in the league has to work so hard for a clean sheet.

2273~~~
Wow

2274~~~
Looks like he's been working on his throwing as well. He's made some impressive ones this season all the way up to the halfway line.

2275~~~
You get the feeling that he is making opposition players fear him - like Schmeichel.

2276~~~
He's going into cheat code mode now.

2277~~~
Best part is he is unfazed with the constant changes in defence. Amazing.

2278~~~
Best United player. By a mile.

2279~~~
Words can't really do him justice today.

2280~~~
Give him £200K a week, he's worth it.

2281~~~
That was unreal. Sure some of those shots were soft, but he really earned that clean sheet alone.

What would he do with a decent defence in front?

2282~~~
I would bear his kids for 9 months, happily too.

2283~~~
Godlike. What else can you say?

2284~~~
MOTM by miles and miles. Best shot stopper on the planet.

2285~~~
Brilliant, our best player this season, great stuff.

2286~~~
We're on 31 points, but could easily be on 22 or thereabout if not for De Gea's saves.

2287~~~
I want him to have my babies, I shall name them David, de, and gea. he is in such great form right now I expect him to save everything !!!

Sign him up now

2288~~~
Best compliment you can pay him.

2289~~~
Best keeper in the world. Neuer might be better at sweeping but as a keeper, David is the best. It is becoming impossible to score against him unless you have a perfect shoot and a lot of luck at the same time.

2290~~~
A lot less than he did today?

2291~~~
Was excellent today, fair play to him.

2292~~~
Give him an empty cheque and let him fill out how much salary he wants for his new contract.

2293~~~
His increased ability in one-on-one situations is ridiculous.

2294~~~
He is a beast, going to be our POTY again! MOTM today.

2295~~~
How many MOM's so far this season?

2296~~~
Yeah. It feels like players don't expect to score against him, or they expect a save. There's less conviction in their taking of chances.

Ridiculously good keeper. Could easily make a case for him being player of the season for the league so far. Incredible stuff from De Gea. Wouldn't swap him for anybody.

2297~~~
Another match winning performance.

Glad he kept a clean sheet as well

2298~~~
Fast becoming my favourite player. Absolute Class personified.

2299~~~
Remember the turmoil we went through between the Schmeichel and VdS period? We are really lucky to have DDG.

2300~~~
Give him whatever he wants per week plus bonuses and sign on fees. His own spaceship, hire Paul McCartney to rape a couple of cows, a life time subscription to National Geographic... anything ffs!

2301~~~
Opposing attackers seem to be losing a bit of confidence in terms of how to get the ball past him.

2302~~~
Greatest in the world.

2303~~~
Give him a blank cheque. He's the best goalkeeper in the league and he's only second behind Neuer in becoming the best in the world. That German poster who said that he isn't is fecking mental.

2304~~~
Our most important player at the minute.

2305~~~
Clean sheet. When people start judging our defence its time they take De Gea into account.

2306~~~
I know it's been said and all but we really should pay him whatever he wants and get him tied down here. Make him the most expensive keeper ever if that's what it takes. 

Utterly amazing today.

2307~~~
I know Fergie has been retired for some time now but I really think he deserves some credit for nurturing him when he was here. He was dropped for games due to weak performances but Fergie made sure it didn't wreck his confidence. He has only improved from there. Commanding the box. His positioning. He's always been a good shot stopper but even that has improved.

2308~~~
I can't remember a keeper that was as good with his feet as him. Not on the ball because the likes of Neuer and van der Sar are better than him in that aspect (although he's definitely improved in that aspect under van Gaal and the new coaches), but making saves with his feet.

2309~~~
God Mode

2310~~~
I'm sorry, but he's just taking the piss now. The man is reaching VDS levels of greatness already.

Its insane.

2311~~~
Just rating him a 10 for every match from now on. Deserves it.

2312~~~
If he demands a bumper pay rise and to have his way with a fan after every match I'll be the first to volunteer.

I hope he just wants the money, but he deserves whatever he wants.

2313~~~
Saved and saved and saved and saved. Brilliant performance. With a Johnny Evans in front of him who had no clue what do to with himself and Val and Young that still look shaky defensively he did brilliantly.

2314~~~
If you scroll back to the first few games of the season, people were criticising his one on one ability.

2315~~~
It's after games like this where you wish the likes of kietotheworld were still around. There was a newbie when I was around called KingofKings who used to be of the same ilk where they used to discredit Dave after every game. 

He is just fabulous. My favourite player by a country mile.

2316~~~
Also, I demand that we remove the player rating feature until it's fixed. An average of 6.7 just doesn't do him justice. Make his one go up to 11.

2317~~~
Running out of words for him.

2318~~~
That's my first 10 rating this season. F'kin ridiculous performance.

2319~~~
Unbelieveable. It's worrying he has to make so many saves but he's just phenomenal.

2320~~~
Absolutely laughable, he's ridiculous <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2321~~~
We could have easily lost without him today! Immense.

2322~~~
Carragher saying it's one of the best goalkeeping performances he's seen.

2323~~~
Solskjaer says it's the best ever goalkeeping performance he has seen at Old Trafford. Amazing compliment

2324~~~
Total up the combined wages of all our defenders in the squad, and pay him that per week, because he's doing their job anyway.  Insane player.

2325~~~
10 year contract.

200k a week.

Just do it Woody.

2326~~~
He's so good and fills you with so much confidence that you really don't give a crap how many shots the opposition have. You just know he'll probably save them.

2327~~~
I think he may have superpowers

2328~~~
Give him the world.

2329~~~
I want to marry him.

2330~~~
His presence today reminds me most of Peter Schmeichel 

The way he stood up to everything was just like stuff Pete used to do

2331~~~
Probably the best performance I've ever seen from a goalkeeper. Amazing player.

2332~~~
Yeah people were asking why he isn't saving goals

2333~~~
I love this guy. If he's not here until he's at least 30 I will cry. 

Stay with us Dave!!

2334~~~
Yeah, you'll never get a more perfect performance than that! Just insane!

2335~~~
Simply sensational, just looked unbeatable.

2336~~~
He's reaching VDS/Schmeichel levels of performance already isn't he? Its crazy.

2337~~~
Just brilliant

2338~~~
He's something else and a joy to watch. Fergie was fairly on the ball when he brought him in that's for sure. It would be a mortal sin if we were to ever let him go, just give the man what he wants whenever he wants.

2339~~~
I'm expecting a thread to pop up. Sir Alex's best buy! De Gea!

Of course we all know it's Ronaldo.

2340~~~
Jedi reactions. The game could still be going on now and Liverpool still wouldn't have scored.

2341~~~
Ole says that's the best goal keeping performance his seen at Old Trafford! 

Amazing is all I can think to say, word just don't justify David De Gea today!!!

2342~~~
It's insane that he's only just turned 24.

2343~~~
RvP looking at him like he is god in the post match interview

2344~~~
One of the best goalkeeping performances I've ever seen. It was honestly that fecking good.

2345~~~
He loves it! Fans love it! No one can beat Dave!

Give him a sexy contract Woody.

2346~~~
Just came in to say this. He isn't even close to what is considered the prime age for a goalkeeper. We truly have a gem on our hands, and that £18 million may possibly be regarded as one of Fergie's greatest signings behind Rooney and Ronaldo.

2347~~~
3times from what I remember faced clear 1v1 and won all three challenges. Brilliant apart his composure on the ball and reflexive saves. MOst consistent player this season and so far the best..

2348~~~
I thought it was more a look of love....

2349~~~
and Phil Neville rates Hart over him still :-D

2350~~~
Fergie also managed him perfectly in that dodgy first season and a bit

Many were angry that he dropped him from time to time. But Ferguson knew what he was doing the whole time 

It was great man management

2351~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> DDG is so reassuring to have at the back. Feck the defence, let's just play a 0-5-5 from now on.

2352~~~
Which was fair at the time. I'm sure the same people will say that of late he hasn't put a foot wrong.

2353~~~
We could have played 0-5-5 today and they wouldn't have scored. Best in the league.

2354~~~
Imagine if we had Mignolet in goal. Just think about that.

2355~~~
Better late than never.

2356~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/iboVP2ql4UeEsT.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/iboVP2ql4UeEsT.gif"/>

2357~~~
To be fair, with some more clinical finishing they'd have probably managed a goal, although that doesn't take away from his superb performance obviously.

2358~~~
Was just thinking about that. Would've been 8-3 to pool. 

Just get this lovely man on 200k a week or whatever he wants really

2359~~~
Can we change the thread title to DeGod?

2360~~~
Best in the world at this point in time. Cannot praise him enough. MOTM. Our best player by a long way.

2361~~~
YES!

2362~~~
He looks invincible at the moment.

2363~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2364~~~
By the end of the game I was just laughing as he made yet another save. Balotelli was baffled as to what the feck was happening <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2365~~~
At that point DDG should have took his top off to reveal a shirt saying "Why always me."

2366~~~
A brick wall in front of goal would have done worse.

2367~~~
I was laughing at loud when he made that save from Balotelli at the end <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2368~~~
After he saved that first Liverpool chance, I am somehow convinced that he wouldnt be beaten today. Not even if they managed 5 more 1v1 against him. He just looked unbeatable

2369~~~
It is actually hilarious how a defence can cause so many problems out of so little for a goalkeeper. It got so outrageous that we actually played Sterling through on goal for their easiest chance of the match.

2370~~~
Shades of the Big Dane today.

He makes those that wrote him off 2 weeks into his United career look dumber by the minute.

2371~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I would have laughed my head off if that happened.

2372~~~
Almost seems like back line is letting people go free on purpose because they want to see another great save.

2373~~~

2374~~~
He's being awesome for fun now. What a hero.

2375~~~
Best in the league by a long way this season. Very possibly best in the world. We absolutely have to keep him.

2376~~~
Can someone please dig up that article early on in his first season here where one of the journos was talking about us needing a new keeper already or something like that. Think it was in the mail.

<a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> ?

2377~~~
I remember one saying that there was no point in trying to remember his name, because he won't be here long, but not the author.

2378~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZjbWS1SyxY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2379~~~
Rubbish.

2380~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2381~~~
He is going to be player of the season if he keeps up his current form.

2382~~~
Could easily make a case for him being player of the league so far.

2383~~~
On current form who else is there to challenge him?

2384~~~
If Rooney is on 250k p/w, they have to offer David at least 180k, he's not going to be on the same as our captain and best known player but he needs to be one of the highest paid at the club.

2385~~~
Well, when I saw Sterling run through I thought, please let it be like Torres and he misses. Didn't need to miss, we have De Gea. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2386~~~
I'd put him ahead of Neuer on the basis of that Neuer is no way near as busy as him. If DDG thrives now he's in the Spain squad, a team that dominates possession after proving he can handle the business of being behind our rotating defence forcing into like 8+ saves a game on average. Yeah no competition from here on forward.

I mean he's stepping up big time in big games too. Even under Moyes where there wasn't much he could do sometimes in them, he was brilliant. So glad Fergie kept faith in the big man after the press hounded him. What a talent.

2387~~~
Wow! Carragher actually gave him high praise. Best goal keeper he has seen, Neuer and Courtois hasn't saved goals like that.

2388~~~
Surely the standout candidate for pfa player of the year.

2389~~~
Give him all the fecking money damn it we have to tie him down to a long term contract!

2390~~~
his confidence is amazing.

'no...you're not getting past me"

2391~~~
I bet Courtois was watching the game and praise at the end and wishing he had a shit defence in front of him.

2392~~~
Unbelievable jeff.

2393~~~
It'll probably be quite difficult for him to win since GK's rarely get awards, but if he keeps this up then he's bound to get a nomination.

2394~~~

His English seems to be improving.

2396~~~
Has there been one player at any other club that has had the kind of direct impact on points that DDG has had? Sanchez, maybe?

2397~~~
you are all prasing de gea, but what he did today to Ballotelli and Sterling was just obcene, he fecked them both without even saying "i love you" or complimenting their eyes or legs

that should be illegal

2398~~~
Today was up there with Schmeichel vs Newcastle in '96 as the best big game performance from a Utd keeper that I can remember.

2399~~~
Said in the post match thread, but what a game he had... again. It was actually becoming increasingly unbelievable that he was saving each shot, and yet somehow I shouldn't be surprised.

2400~~~
That save against Sterling when it looked like he was going to be rounded <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2402~~~
The guy is simply the best, I don't care for Neuer or Courtois.

2403~~~
Another great performance from De Gea. We honestly need to give him a new deal as soon as possible. What a player!

2405~~~
One on one was one of his weak areas before this season. Great to see that he has improved immensely in that aspect. I'm struggling to see as to why Neuer should be counted ahead of him without any proper debate. Yes Neuer does all the fancy stuff well but in terms of pure goalkeeping, I don't think there's any difference between the two.

2406~~~
Why the feck do interviewers on TV seldom take into account the limitations of a non English speaker? Blasting questions at him quickly and using big words.

Do him a favour and speak slowly and not overcomplicate sentences.

2407~~~
Aguero for City maybe?

2408~~~
Note; my fanside demands this post. Only want to state my view. No offense here.
Saw the game, David had 2 saves of the highest order. Huge respect. But what smoked the guys in this video? Against United alone Manu had the 2011 game. 
Most of the Davids saves where textbook. Granted; you have to be there, read the game. But not that crazy.

He is one of the best on the level under Neuer. But Manu is the best. When David is voted among the 3 best players in the world and had 4 goals against him in 15 league and 5 CL games(the team crashed on him in the City game) we can talk.
He seems a nice guy and I love me some great goalkeeping but he is not on Manus level.

2409~~~
You can hardly judge a goalkeeper on goals conceded when there is such difference in quality of defenders in front of him. Neuer still conceded two goals in that Schalke v Man Utd game because his team was so poor yet it was a better performance that most of the goalkeepers put when they end up with a clean sheet with little to do.

What more could possible De Gea do this season?

2410~~~
David de God.

2411~~~
Nobody is saying De Gea is better than Neuer, but few weeks back you said that De Gea wasnt't even in top 10 goalkeepers which is ridiculous. The only keeper that's better than De Gea at the moment is Neuer.

2412~~~
Neuer let in a soft goal in that 2011 semi-final....Anyway, direct comparisons are not meaningful since de Gea plays behind an ever-changing and fairly average defence for a team rebuilding while Neuer plays for a team who enjoy a position similar to Celtic in Scotland.

2413~~~
Superb performance (again). What a keeper he is now, so composed, agile, good with his feet, great shot stopper. Best in the league by a country mile.

2414~~~
Uniteds team is in the top 10 of world football. He doesnt play for a pup team either. And he doesnt play like today in every game.
Manu covers almost a third of the pitch sometimes, builts up our play and and saves also like crazy.
Like I said; David is immense these last weeks and overall very good for the season so far. But Manu is 28, in his prime and more experienced.
There cant be a question who is better. Its a level between them.

Pretty sure that I didnt say that. I stand by the fact that there are other great keepers out there. Who is better against who in that pool isnt my debate.
Some called him the best here since the game. That got me a bit as a Bayernfan.

2415~~~
I think only 2 of his saves were outstanding. The Balotelli one and the one on one Vs Sterling. The others were poor finishes or regulation that any top keeper should be saving.

I do think Sky overplayed the De Gea narrative a bit too much and made it seem like we played worse than we actually did. 

That said, he's an outstanding keeper no question. We need to sign him to a new deal ASAP.

2416~~~
Did you just quote your own tweet?

2417~~~
Wasn't he brilliant last season as well vs the scousers? Seem to remember him pulling of a worldies in that game

2418~~~
I think it was the manner of the "should have saveds" that they were hyper-praising, the way he always looked in control and didnt react until the attacker had made his mind up. If it was Courtois who did it they'd have been building him a statue in the sky studios

2419~~~

2420~~~
God.

Hero.

Priceless.

I love you!

2421~~~
What does that mean?

2422~~~
I've always been a fan even in the early parts of his career you could see there was a good keeper there. I can't believe how good he is right now he's up there with our best keepers. Give him a solid back four to play with and we might never concede another goal.

2423~~~
Whatever he's asking for, square it.

2424~~~
shh, no.

2425~~~
Huh? Can someone translate what LvG meant?

2426~~~
Basically shut up and mind your own business.

2427~~~
Whoever is our best paid player should be dethroned by this man. Give him whatever he wants.

2428~~~
This. The media can feck off, Woodward will get the contract done and dusted in due course.

2429~~~
Yeah same. I think the majority of United fans did back him to be fair, and it was more so the media, opposition and a loud minority of United fans who didn't. For his age he was still incredibly talented, and all his lacking areas were ones that you would assume relatively simply to fix with time. 

I think that backing could have a huge say in him sticking with the club. Mata mentioned that when he joined De Gea told him that the fans are unbelievable, even sticking with you when things are tough.

2430~~~
Sick of all the German posters on here who refuse to even entertain a suggestion that there is a goalkeeper on Neuer's level. Neuer is a world class goalkeeper but so is De Gea. Really is getting tiresome coming into this thread and they are all having a Neuer love in. Pathetic really.

2431~~~

Classic Louis. He once gave Uli and Kalle(who won CLs, euros and WCs and built the modern Bayern) copies of his book with autographs and said;
"here, you can learn something about football in there".

2433~~~
"Manu"

2434~~~
Without a doubt the best goalkeeper in the world. Brilliant performance!

2435~~~
It was great that he didn't commit or panic. Neville and Carragher kept saying "De Gea from a few years ago probably would have come charging at Sterling", but I disagree. He did pretty much the same thing against Torres a few years ago, which resulted in the hilarious miss. And that was in his first season.

2436~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the twitter thing

2437~~~
redcafe was gennerally supportive of him. Only kietotheworld - who was actually banned about his anti De Gea agenda - and to a degree Count Orduck were saying that Lindegaard was better than him. 

For all people who have watched him at Atletico, it was knows that it is only a matter of time since he becomes one of the best in the business. He was already the best shot stopper in the world when he arrived at Manchester.

2438~~~
So, how much are Barca/Madrid going to bid for him?

2439~~~
Yep I think the majority of fans who regularly watched United always liked him. He was young and in a position where there were v few hiding places and although talented he was still learning. Every error was under the microscope and I even remember G Nev getting on his back. I think it was the generally the MOTD watchers who that thought he was a genuine liability. 

We now have the finished article though and although we signed him for a fair amount of money it shows that having faith in young players pays off.

2440~~~
As far as I can remember the OT crowd have also always supported him, I don't remember any booing or anything even in his first few months. Happy to be corrected though.

2441~~~
Never seen a GK that plays for a top club that has to earn for his clean sheet more than DDG <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2442~~~
van Gaal wouldn't comment on his contract during the press conference.

2443~~~
I am. Likely not in the general, but on the last 2-3 months, De Gea has been the best keeper in the world.

On matches against Everton, Chelsea, Arsenal, Stoke, Soton and today we have won 16 points. Could have easily been less than 6 if it wasn't for De Gea.

2444~~~
If we don't get him signed up quickly than we're in trouble. Come next summer he'll only have a year left on his contract.

2445~~~
De Gea is better at shot stopping. While Neuer is brilliant on the air, De Gea nowadays catches everything so not a big difference there.

Neuer is better at arganizing the defense and playing the sweeper. He is also more prone to brainfarts which lead to goals.

Probably he still should be considered better, but on the last 2-3 months De Gea has been the best in the world. If he continues like this, then on the next season, I think that people would rate him as much as Neuer.

2446~~~
He's of a world class quality, so I know what you mean, but I actually think he can and will get better. I wouldn't swap him for anybody, and if he stayed at this level unbelievable but I just think he will keep improving. His communicating skills and distribution (already great I know) will both improve I'm sure. Players seem to have less conviction in their taking of chances because it's in their head who they're up against.

He's just turned 24. If he stays, and I'm sure he will, he has a fantastic chance at becoming considered our greatest keeper of all time, which would be a mighty feat.

2447~~~
De Gea should be allowed to go to LVG and demand the defenders he wants in front of him. Give him a proper defence and he will be keeping clean sheet records.

Dave Saves <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2448~~~
His shot stopping talent was clear from day one. His coming up for crosses was suspect but i think he has somewhat mastered it. He just need to have a more commanding influence on our defence such as talking to and organizing them more.

2449~~~
Don't agree with people saying he can't keep this up. He's just a great goalkeeper so of course it's expected for him to make great saves.

2450~~~
We need to give him the contract as soon as possible. Makes me so uneasy to know that he could be off in the Summer.

2451~~~
United's defense is in tatters but De Gea is the one man out here fighting like a beaver to keep his nest clean. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2452~~~
Clutching at straws here maybe, but anyone else think his one-on-one has improved a lot ever since Valdes has started training with us? He is coming out off line way quicker than before.

2453~~~
I don't like the noises coming out about this <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2454~~~
Very true and agree

2455~~~
I'm so happy for de Gea. Once upon a time he was victim of the biggest media witch hunt I've ever seen and now look at him. He's incredible. 

I do get really worried that he'll leave us. It has Real Madrid written all over it. We're lucky to have him, but hopefully he remembers the times when he was costing us goals left right and centre and dropping crosses all day long, because back then, he was lucky to have us.

2456~~~
TBH, a lot of those shots were straight at him. I'd expect a keeper of his quality to deal with them fairly easily. A clear MOTM though. Hope we can sort out his contract situations at the earliest - we're talking about arguable the best keeper for God's sake!

As far as how great he is, I think he's on par with Courtois as the best keeper around (never thought Neuer as the best, so....).

2457~~~
I'm sorry, but this never happened. He was never our weakness.

2458~~~
It happened.

2459~~~
No, it didn't. You've totally made that up.

2460~~~

2461~~~
Never mate. It all started when Jamie Redknap came out with a useless statistic that he had conceded the most goals from outside the box in La Liga. Redknap kept repeating this and even went so far as to suggest that oppositions try shooting from outside the box as much as possible as a valid tactic to test the new keeper. Laughable. He made a mistake in his debut and the media were on his case. The witch hunt had begun.

2462~~~
He reminds me of young Buffon. 
Give him what he wants.

2463~~~
Can there be anyone having doubts about how huge he can be in a game? Just show him the money FFS!

2464~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2465~~~
Second best goalie in the world! He's outstanding and has helped us win so many points this season. I talked to a Liverpool supporter after the match today, and he said that he didn't know he was THAT good. He was quite impressed!

Tie him down to a long term contract!

2466~~~
In the top five best goalkeepers in the world surely. Can't believe the sky pundits rate Courtois higher.

2467~~~
He did make a number of mistakes early. It wasn't until a bit into his 2nd season I began to feel comfortable with him in goal

2468~~~
If there was ever a time where he was "lucky to have us" it was only for a few months after joining. The media absolutely went for him during this period and then completely ignored the fact that he was actually very solid and reliable for the second half of the season. And has been ever since.

2469~~~
His celebrations for our goals bodes well.

van Gaal's cautious reaction to his performance today is obviously related to contract negotiations.

Think we will offer him a bumper increase and tie him down to a long contract.

2470~~~
I've noticed this too, but Frans Hoek probably deserves the credit.

2471~~~
Not only the media were against but also some clueless twats which call themselves fans.

2472~~~
You don't think that the new goalkeeping coach has more to do with that ?

2473~~~
I prefer to think that the shit defense in front of him is allowing us to see what De Gea is truly capable of.

2474~~~
Just watching highlights and noticed Gary Neville saying that 'De Gea is starting to become a great goalkeeper'. What is wrong with him and his brother regarding De Gea? another odd comment IMO.

2475~~~
Uhh what the actual feck? Perfectly valid comment. De Gea is starting to become a great keeper. He was really good the last two years and now he's starting to become great. I'm happy Gary isn't big on hyperbole because some people have overused that word "great" to death!

2476~~~
Fair enough, great might be an overused word, but I honestly think he's been great for a very long time now. The way Gary said it, you'd swear it was still his 2nd season here or something.

2477~~~
No it's not. I have seen every single one of his post-match reactions and in none of them will he single out players. Every time he gets asksed this question he says - "I don't want to talk about individual players." The only time he did say something was that incredible performance against Everton, but that too he prefaced by saying he doesn't like to single out players. It's the just the way he does those post-match interviews. Nothing to do with contract stuff.

2478~~~
That Spurs game at Old Trafford was hilarious when the likes of Van der Vaart were trying stupid shots from 40 yards away.

2479~~~
He's been making that transition over the last year, I'd give you that. But he's not at Neuer's level, yet. He's slowly getting there. He's pretty close to it too. Once he becomes impregnable, by that I mean truly unbeatable from corners and set-pieces (though not all of them, no keeper is, I mean showing power in the air), then he'll become a truly great goalkeeper.

2480~~~
The way he said it was certainly felt a bit more complimentary than that. As in he's becoming one of the greats, not just that he's becoming great.

That's how I read it anyway.

2481~~~
Yeah I probably just took at up wrong, seeing as Gary has always been overly critical of him and Phil's daft tweet yesterday.

2482~~~
If he works hard, in a few years he might get to Hart's level.

2483~~~
Harry was with Spurs iirc. No doubt he got his tactics from expert analyst Redknap junior.

2484~~~
I remember being in Uxbridge for that game. I came in late, asked a guy with a United kit on how de Gea was doing, he said "fecking shit, I hate the cnut".

2485~~~
From nearly 500 ratings on the caf his average rating for today's game is 9.7 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Must be a record.

2486~~~
I guess it is more because of Frans Hoek. New training methods likely need some time to be fully accepted and their rewards to be seen on the pitch.

2487~~~
Just watching a video of him from his first season here, its quite incredible how much he's grown in stature. Both physically and mentally. He really does look like a little boy in his dads baggy t-shirt at times in his early days, not quite knowing where to stand or what to do. You look at him now and he looks calm and assured. He's bulked up and looks in complete control at all times. 

It would be heartbreaking to lose him now, after watching him grow into such a top top keeper. I'd be beyond gutted.

2488~~~
It will be one of the clubs biggest feck ups if they don't get him to renew his contract. And they need to do it fast before Madrid or someone come calling.

2489~~~
De Gea is just a phenomenal keeper, so important we hold on to him. Hopefully van Gaal will get a new contract sorted get rid of any potential buyers.

2490~~~
I think he's become quite good.

2491~~~
Best shot stopper in world football imo, unreal that with the attacking talent you have that this guy is probably the main reason you're in 3rd place.

2492~~~
If we do tie him down long term, which I'm fairly confident we will, he'll go on to be the best in our history quite comfortably.

2493~~~
Well deserved as well. Daily Mail had him down for an 8,5 - wtf?

2494~~~
They also said Rooney put in a 'fantastic performance' then gave him a 7.5. They're idiots.

2495~~~
I almost enjoy our crap defending beause it gives DDG the chance to add to his highlight reel.

From a flappy donut thief to a fecking boss...stay forever please

2496~~~
Very few keepers can genuinely say they're matchwinners at such a high level. De Gea has done it in the biggest games. His distribution is finally getting better and the shot stopping is going up a level. He's made it as a big boy keeper now, and there is so much growth in him still.

2497~~~
Early call for player of the year again?

2498~~~
Rooney was an 8 in my book - very good performance! 8,5 was harsher, in my book that is.

2499~~~
I don't think you'll get rich if you go to the brokers with that bet.

2500~~~
Average rating 6.9 seems a bit low.

2501~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> he's on 9.7

2502~~~
I mean his season rating which shows at the top of this thread.

2503~~~
Ahh, well he had a slow start to the season. Made up for it big time though.

2504~~~
I somehow only have him down at 6.4 <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2505~~~
Biggest coup of 2014, to get DDG to sign a new long lucrative deal

2506~~~
Mine average rating for him is 5.9 and I don't know why it is so low. I remember giving him 10 three times and maybe once lower than 5. We need more detailed history of these ratings.

2507~~~
7.9 here. Basically whoever has given to him less than 7 (as average) is a tit <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2508~~~
I don't think I've ever submitted my own ratings (I can't be arsed rating everyone), so is 6.9 a default score?

2509~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B37FVZPCMAERORM.jpg" src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B37FVZPCMAERORM.jpg"/>

2510~~~
6.9 is actually the highest average rating any of our players have gotten this season. I think its only below 7 because of the first few games of the season, he started to shine against Everton, and there was the MK Dons game before that.

2511~~~
He's got the ability and time to eclipse Schmeichel and Van Der Sar.

2512~~~
I gave him 10.

2513~~~
This may not be very popular, but I think that he already is on Van Der Sar level. Obviously he isn't as good as VDS when it comes to distribution, but is far better at shot stopping.

2514~~~
MK Dons and Leister, probably. Mine is 6,7, still very harsh.

2515~~~
It was a 10 performance.

He didn't do anything wrong at all and saved us outright, what, 6 times?

2516~~~
The question is, will he stay when Real Madrid come calling in summer? Or will he do a Ronaldo?

2517~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> As if he is their best mate!

2518~~~
Why do you think Madrid will call in the summer. They have Navas and Casillas right now and although Casillas is on the vane I'm not sure DDG would go there. We are on the up again and why would he leave us?

2519~~~
Barca? Who knows? They'll hope they dont need him

Real Madrid? Not enough to sell his dignity

I'm at 7.3 on his rating

2520~~~
Indeed <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2521~~~
I'd like to see Neuer play in front of this shower of shite. The people who bang the Neuer drum on twitter only watch him twice a year any way. As for Courtois, he's nowhere near de Gea in terms of shot saved ratio, despite playing in a better team.

2522~~~
Casillas is over, surely that's a fact and not a statement. Navas is a decent backup, but he won't make it to the top 5 keepers in the world. RM need a very-good keeper. 

DDG is from Madrid, he's young and brilliant, proven at the highest level, will be first-choice for Spain at the next major tournament and is playing for a club, who, frankly speaking, do not rank in the top 5  in the world at the moment. 

Connect the dots?

2523~~~
Don't forget about them seeing all his tackles and dribbles... which have nothing to do with a goalkeeper. 

Neuer is class, but as a goalkeeper, there isn't a lot between them. De Gea is a better shot stopper while Neuer is better with the ball at his feet, with one on ones and is better with crosses, though De Gea has really improved in those respects. Give De Gea a few more years and he'll be better then Neuer IMO.

2524~~~
Because we have a feck load of drama queens who give out 1's and 2's after we drop points even if we had certain players who played well.

2525~~~
He played for Atletico so I'm not sure if he would go to Madrid.

As I said now we certainly arent top 5 in the world but we are on the up and he seems to love it here.
So no need to be all negative.

Its time to stop us giving Madrid players time and time again.

And some of our fans regard our club like a stepstone for some players instead of being a pinnacle of some players' career.

HE can be 1st choice for Spain while playing with us.

2526~~~
I agree 100%

There really are not enough superlatives to describe the lads performance today and in recent weeks. Lovely to see RvP hug him in the interview after the match. The players and manager know his worth and I'm sure the fact he has good friends like Mata and Herrera here will be a bonus. With players like RvP, Rooney, Mata, Di Maria and Falcao here, and the likelihood of LvG signing more world class stars should also help.

2527~~~
Won't be long before it goes over 7. Leicester and MK Dons games hammered his rating, so even though he'll have been our MOTM in four games, the low rating he got in those two brings his average down a bit.

Take a look at our semi-final away against Schalke. Neuer was a one-man team that day and those Schalke guys were really below average (I'd say that they were worse than our defensive bunch, but maybe less injury-prone)

2532~~~
I have his rating at 6.9. Think his MK Dons performance hurt him. If you took those ratings out I'm sure it'd be a lot higher. Player of the year so far.

2533~~~

2534~~~
Remember the height debate from like 3 years ago? Well RVP is 6"0.

Great performance again, now get that contract sorted Woody.

2538~~~
By Madrid's standards, going for De Gea would be downright sensible. A waning Casillas and Keylor Navas is hardly an obstacle considering they signed James when they already had Di Maria, Ronaldo, Isco and Bale.

But as long as we get into the CL, I think he'll stay. We can match any wage Real can offer, so they don't have that advantage any more.

2539~~~
His technique dealing with one on one's is amazing.  He doesn't commit too early or simply fall to the ground. Saving with his legs is a great technique.

Watch Harts' reaction for Suarez' goal at the world cup. It was right at his chest but went down way too early like most keepers. Wanker

2540~~~
Or because he actually did start the season quite shaky and therefore the average will be lower than what it would be "expected" to be now??

Don't worry, you're allowed to say if de Gea has had bad games, I doubt he reads it.

2541~~~
Nah, player height posted on even the official site have been proven wrong time and time again. Here is a picture of him standing with 6 feet tall Gerrard:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000TqVjzs29iqE/s/750/750/BPI-LivevMancUnit-gscv.jpg" src="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000TqVjzs29iqE/s/750/750/BPI-LivevMancUnit-gscv.jpg"/>

Carrick was listed as 6 feet for a long time as well, but it's recently been changed to 6'2, which seems more accurate. Jones ain't 5'11 either.

I think it's the camera angle that made RvP, who is 1.86 (6'1 plus change), a little taller than De Gea. But De Gea is definitely not 6'3 or 6'4.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/4/29/1367239090733/Manchester-Uniteds-David--008.jpg" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/4/29/1367239090733/Manchester-Uniteds-David--008.jpg"/>

2542~~~
He's growing at a rate that Ronaldo grew at United. It's beautiful to watch but we all know how that fairy tale ended...

2543~~~
Sir Alex's last gem, a rough one slowly cut into something brilliant. He has shown himself to be mentally strong enough during tough times rather than fading into obscurity and that is in book the biggest reason behind his development.

2544~~~
Get. the. contract. sorted.

2545~~~
He had a couple of below par games sure but his average rating should still be higher then what it is. It's just when people rate players right after games, if we lose, it tends to be like 3's and 4's, or worse, which isn't exactly representative of what actually happens. Skews the results a bit.

2546~~~
Shame kietotheworld has been banned, he would have a thing or two to say about De Gea now.

2547~~~
Why is Anderson still here?, seriously.

2548~~~
Nobody will take him. He'll be gone when his contract expires.

2549~~~
He didn't have any particularly bad games but definitely one or two where it would be very hard to give him a good rating. Games where he conceded and did very little positive of note. The Leicester game being the real low point.

Been a steady and constant improvement since then. If he keeps this up he'll reach that Schmeicel/Neuer level, where strikers start to lose the mental battle before they even get a shot off. Balotelli could have played against him all night and still wouldn't have scored past him.

2550~~~
Fair comment, I'd imagine if people weren't allowed to vote for a couple days the ratings would be a lot different with everyone. 

I thought he should of done a lot better with a lot of the Leicester goals. I wouldn't say he had a mare (like his infamous game vs. Blackburn) but he did concede a lot of soft goals. 

I definitely agree he'll be up there with them 2. Ole made a point of similar in the post match analysis. He makes it hard for a lot of strikers to guess what he's doing. I wouldn't criticise him recently but can see why people were frustrated early on in the season.

Another note about keepers which I found funny which your post reminded me of is how people get so defensive if you'd have the audacity to compare him or any other keeper to Neuer. I'm not suggesting de Gea is better (nor am I suggesting you have said the same!) but people do really get their backs up if you suggest any keeper is even close to Neuer in any term of ability.

2551~~~
If he joins Real in the summer I say we ban <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a>. He is clearly feeding Perez inside info on who our best players are.

2552~~~
I know right?! I mean who had heard of Beckham, RvN or Ronaldo before!

<span style="color: #ffffff">lolz</span>

2553~~~
deserves Rooney's contract.

2554~~~
Fantastic analysis comparing him 2 years ago to now there by Gary Neville. The stats around crosses caught and errors made leading to goals vs shots is mental.

2555~~~
Ay, the best I've seen Neville on Sky for a while now. I didn't realise just how much more grown up and imposing he looks now in comparison to even a couple of years back in relation to his posture when faced with an attacker. He's the most important player at the club right now.

2556~~~
From around the 50% mark in his first 2 seasons, to now being 91.7% is unbelievable. I was shocked. 

Also, we've had 15 errors of which only 1 has been punished. Liverpool have had 21 errors of which 6 have been punished. 

I love you De Gea!

2557~~~
Wasn't he very good two seasons ago anyway? Just shows how good he has become now.

2558~~~
He was good but definitely still had his moments and was dropped for Lindegaard at one point. I believe after he came back into the team he was excellent from then onwards. Masterclass from SAF as usual.

2559~~~
If anyone finds a video of that Neville analysis please put it here.

2560~~~
This please.

2561~~~

So just out of curiosity, how much do you think Madrid would have to bid for us to begin to consider the offer?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/aRDY742.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/aRDY742.png"/>

Wow. 3rd highest errors leading to shots. Lowest number of errors leading to goals. What a goalkeeper we have.

2571~~~
Thought that was an odd stat to read much into. A very small sample size with just 5 goals between 1st and 20th and feck knows how an "error" is defined. 

Would be more interested in goals/shot on target.

2572~~~
Upwards of £40m plus. It's about time we took Madrid to the cleaners like we should have with Ronnie and like they did with Angel.

2573~~~
I think that it's how you are supposed to read it, he added the ranking to show the importance of the saves.

2574~~~
Even £40m wouldn't be worth it to us. We wouldn't be able to get an outfield player for that money who gets us as many points every season as De Gea does and will do.

2575~~~
40m plus Bale

2576~~~
I meant £40m as a minimum, agreed that this guy will command such a high price because like the Ronaldo's and Messi's off this world he wins you points.

2577~~~
With only a year left on his contract, there is no way we'd get anything close to £40 milliomn in the Summer. The fact that goalkeepers never seem to go for much, coupled with his contract situation, we'd do well to get £15 million.

2578~~~
We paid £17m for him. No way he'd be sold for 15m at most, even with his contract situation.

Real love to shell out loads on star signings, so if he were to go I could see us getting 40m or close to.

2579~~~
Exactly. Feck it off and tell him to leave on a free if he wants to. Wouldn't be worth it, we're loaded anyway and we get another year to find a proper replacement. That's worst case scenario though, we'll sign him up.

2580~~~
We will re-sign him and let him go to Madrid.

2581~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> We will get much more than that. We paid £24 million for RVP when he only had a year left on his contract. Yes he is a striker but he was 28 when we signed him whereas De Gea is only 24 and as a goalkeeper has around 15 years left in him. Also Kroos went for a similar fee with a year left on his contract and we paid around £15 million for bloody Ashley Young when he had only a year left on his contract. I would expect us to get at least £25 million for him if we were to sell him in the summer. However, I'm quietly confident we will tie him down to a new contract.

2582~~~
I genuinely do think we'd get that much, even with his contract situation. Maybe more, if it's this summer.

2583~~~
If he's got a year left on his contract, I reckon Madrid might stretch to £20 million. But I doubt they'd go higher then that if they knew they could have him for free just 12 months later. Especially if Casilas or Navas are playing okay. They'll put the ball in our court, take the £20 odd mil or lose him for free 12 months later.

Or, as mentioned above, we go the Ronaldo route and get him to sign a contract on the agreement that we'll sell him for top dollar. 

Either scenario is pretty shit from a United POV.

2584~~~
If you think we're getting £40 million for a player in the last year of his contract, and a goalkeeper at that, then you're going to be very disappointed.

2585~~~
Get his contract sorted, and nothing less then £100M. Screw Madrid and everyone else. He's our Dave.

2586~~~
I don't think so. Nobody's under any illusion about how good he is and will become. It wouldn't surprise me at all. One year remaining or not.
£15-20 million (as you suggest) will be laughed off I'd imagine. The club would basically have made no money back, all the while training him up for Madrid.

Not a chance, in my opinion. And I'm usually pessimistic. Anything under £35 million would shock me.

2587~~~
If Marid know they're going to get him anyway, they're not going to be spending anything like £40 million when they know they could just wait 12 months and get him for free.

2588~~~
Relax, he'll sign another contract before the season is over. The club is not going to let his contract run into its last season.

2589~~~
Don't forget the highest fee for a keeper EVER is just £33 million. Even Neuer went for just £19 million 3 years ago.

Talk of £40 million for a goalkeeper in the last year of his contract just isn't going to happen.

2590~~~
But you think we'll sell him for <i>less</i> than we paid to sign him?

2591~~~
I think I'm right in saying that Neuer was in the last year of his contract then too. Considering De Gea is a superior goalkeeper to Neuer back then, and the inflation in the transfer market, we should be getting at least £24 million for him.

2592~~~
I see that as more likely than £15 million.

I don't think this will be an issue anyway, as I think he'll sign a deal and then leave this summer or next, but I think this would be a huge fee regardless of his contract having a year to go.
He's a big deal in Spain already. Madrid wont want to wait a year if he's their planned marquee signing, and we'd still ask for big money, or tell them to wait.

I understand the whole 'one year to go' logic. But I still think it would be huge money.

2593~~~
I guess that would be up to the club. If the scenario in which he signs a contract to ensure we get a god fee (ala Ronaldo) doesn't play out and Madrid offer £15/20 million this Summer then we'll have to seriously consider it, because its that or get nothing back and lose him for free 12 months later. Obviously all this is if he actually wants to join Madrid.

Either way, if come the Summer he hasn't signed a contract, Madrid will have is over a barrel.

2594~~~
You think they wouldn't organize signing a contract before selling him on, even though I don't think this will happen?

2595~~~
If he states his intent to definitely leave then I'm sure the club will do everything it can to arrange a contract like the one Ronaldo signed, in order to get the best possible price for him.

2596~~~
I swear, some of you guys know how to fecking worry yourselves into the ground. He'll sign a new contract, he looks like one of the happiest players in the squad.

2597~~~
Dont ruin it for them, they enjoy this.

2598~~~
This. I would throw any offer away, without looking at it. We can bloody afford it. Keep him here, win some titles with him, hopefully change his mind, if not - so be it.

2599~~~
Who cares, if we get nothing back? This isn't some small club we are talking about, United is a financial juggernaut that doesn't really need the money. Losing De Gea for measly 20 million isn't going to help us at all, not to mention it's better, if we keep him and just let him go for free. At least the club will have a whole year to plan on who to buy and meanwhile De Gea will keep putting amazing performances.

It seems Ronaldo leaving has left a dent in the soul of so many people here. It's like, if Real comes, then you gotta sell. That's stupid and it has never been that way. Ronaldo is the only person we wanted to keep, but ended up selling.

2600~~~

2601~~~
Thing is I doubt he wants to move to Real Madrid though, being Atletico boyhood fan and Academy product. People talks as if it's a given that he moves there at some point.

2602~~~
Which he hasn't, so for now let's enjoy having one of the best goalies between the post for us whilst there are no major signs of him wanting to leave.

Happy? Then why does he punch his fist in the air after every win as if to say "Yes, Madrid are more likely to be interested in me after this!" ?

2603~~~
Doesn't his girlfriend live in Madrid? Could be his heart telling him where to go tbh.

2604~~~
Not sure where this idea comes from that we signed Ronaldo up on a deal knowing we were about to sell him. As far as I know his last contract for us was a 5 year deal signed in April 2007. He didn't ask to leave until 15 months after that, in the summer of 2008. We refused to sell him, waited til the following summer than flogged him.

2605~~~
I don't think that means anything at all. Raul was also an Atletico academy product.

If Real came knocking and he truly wanted to leave United then he'd go there easily.

2606~~~
Raul moved to Real at 14 or 15. The Atletico academy argument was blown out of proportion there. With De Gea he won trophies with Atletico and started his career there, they developed him as a player to the extent he was worth £17m at 19.

Real won't drop Casillas yet either. Wait 2 or 3 years and they might talk, but it won't be with De Gea.

2607~~~
Has he been given his shiny new contract yet?! If not who's the one to have their effigy burned?!

2608~~~
Ronaldo asked to leave in 2006 I think and it was clear all along he would go and join Real at some point. Mind you we still got some pretty good mileage out of him.

2609~~~
That's the key element people are forgetting. The last guy who went against Casillas got sacked although it wasn't the only reason.

Real should launch their bid for Lloris if they are desperate for a goalkeeper who wants a better fate of his own.

2610~~~

how on earth joe hart is number 4 on the list?

great to see david getting the recognition he deserves though. give him a mega deal and a world class defense and talks about de gea v neuer could be very close like maybe schmeichel v kahn a few years ago.

2611~~~
Incredible. The Frans Hoek effect?

2612~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Funny cuz it's true

Well that's the only logical explanation.

2613~~~
I would say he is already better than VDS, mental though it may sound. He is on his way to becoming someone like Schmeichel, who was the main reason I used to watch Denmark. People will soon be watching international friendlies because DDG is playing

2614~~~
If he keeps this up for the season he may be, the way he's playing now I think is superior to VDS but he's got a long way to go. VDS gave us what 6 seasons of consistent brilliance?

2615~~~
Wow. Amazing stat.

2616~~~
Why do people talk only about Real? Barcelona aren't fecking blind either. DDG is very, very special, give him what he wants. And more.

2617~~~
Probably because they signed 2 'keepers in the summer and are transfer banned for some time.

2618~~~
Too early to say he's better than VDS. VDS was the complete goalkeeper. There are still things DDG needs to work on. I'd still like him to be more commanding in the box both physically and vocally. I'm sure that will come. I will say there is no way Real or Barca will be happy with the best Spanish GK not playing for them. I fully expect a bid of around 40-45m made for him in the summer.

2619~~~
It'd be nice if we can enjoy his performances rather than speculating his return to Spain. For all the comparisons with Ronaldo, I'm yet to see an interview with DDG claiming he wants to move to Spain, with Ronaldo we had to endure three summers of constant flip flopping and hence why most were convinced that he was gonna be sold.

2620~~~
I hope you're right, it would be good for a laugh.

On a serious note, David De Gea right now on course to becoming the biggest star of all goalies out there, along with Neuer. He has a playing style and a carries himself with a certain kind of cool which ensures that as long as we keep competing, and he keeps delivering, he will become a huge commercial pull. With the Glazer's and Woodward's new emphasis on having stars in the team to maintain and increase our commercial appeal there is absolutely no chance they won't do everything in their power to keep him around for as long as possible. Especially knowing that as things stand, there are no viable alternatives who come even close to matching his quality on the pitch, or his potential value off it.

Barca, and to a lesser degree Real (given where he came from) missed a beat when they didn't try to get him from Atletico. It was completely obvious even then that he would go on to become one of the best in the world, and I'm absolutely confident that he will be spending the prime and bulk of his career with us. Which is freakin' awesome.

2621~~~
Holy Hyperbole Batman!

Yes it does sounds mental. Because it is.

2622~~~
When we were scouting for keepers back in 2010 - 2011, I wondered whether we did the right thing signing a 20 year-old. There were so many other names being thrown about, all more experienced ...  Lloris, Adler, Sketelenburg etc.  Am so glad we got this one right.

Now can someone please give him that 150k a week, or whatever it takes to sign him for the next 10 years?  I wasn't worried a couple of months ago, but getting a little bit edgy now. It's gone too quiet at our end, and these performances are just going to attract attention from the biggest clubs.

2623~~~
opinions are, unless you hold on to one. due to the defensive situation, De Gea has had to put up better performances than VDS ever had to. I guess that goes towards explaining why I hold that opinion. If you disagree with that, I would like my memory to be refreshed with regard to a better individual performance by VDS

2624~~~

Journalist....Who Fergie wasn't fond off

2629~~~
The one thing I really enjoy is seeing him celebrate goals or saves. Especially goals, since the focus seems to be elsewhere, but he just looks so satisfied and happy. Same with saves, after he tipped that Ballotelli shot to the Crossbar he jumped up and tapped it a few times. Almost like every save makes him more confident and better in a match.

I'm not gonna go all rawk like and say "OH GOD LOOK AT HOW HAPPY HE IS, WE'LL GIVE HIM DONUTS AND HE WILL STAY WITH US FOREVER AAHH", but I do like the fact that he seems happy playing for us.

2630~~~
Wasn't that during the 2011/12 season? Despite some shaky moment in his initial season (that were largely overstated, imo) I don't remember him having a bad season or even a proper bad spell of games.

2631~~~
He's come on amazingly well from his first season. I haven't seen a better keeper myself this season, it's not Castillas.

2632~~~
Was dropped during '12-13 as well. Returned against City after the horrow show by Lindegaard against Reading. The rest is history

2638~~~
He gave me a thumbs up, I think it was a sign.

He said Guy Ritchie, which I know a lot of people won't be happy about.

He asked me for one but I told him I was in a rush.

In all seriousness the pair of them seemed sound and very approachable. Glad to have him at the club and long may it last.

I disagree though I do like what he's saying. Even if he keeps his consistency, I think the only way he can win the PFA POTY is if our defence continues to leak a load of chances.

Agreed. Did well the few times he was called into action besides that shot.

I would like to see how good Dave is at that

2665~~~
I think he is one of the better kickers in the game, that's the first thing I noticed when he came to Old Trafford, when giving time he's kicking is always on point.  We've been pressured a lot recently with our playing at the back so when he has to boot it fast you can't blame him for missing the target.

2666~~~
I love how he manages to cleanly catch incredibly hard hit strikes, where most keepers would just parry.

2667~~~
One of, if not the best Swedish expert holds him as the best goalkeeper of  the 2013-14 season. Of the ones he caught, he safely gripped 91.7% of all crosses and boxed out just 8.3% in comparison to the first two years after he came when he boxed out around 50% and caught 50%.

Last year he safely gripped 69% so he has done some amazing improvements.

He's also now training with Spain and United, two possession strong teams and for United he actually averages 33% more passes than Cortouis per game and just 5 passes less than Neuer per game, they both have pretty much the same amount of long balls per game too.

So DDG has a brilliant opportunity to improve his passing and in possession qualities for us as well. Neuer has an incredible 87% passing accuracy and DDG just has 64%(compared to Cortouis 58%).

2668~~~
Do you know the passing stats for Van der Sar through his United or Ajax years ? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

As an aside I think David might also have the added benefit of training with Valdes on a regular basis, who regularly notched up 80-85 % accuracy.

2669~~~
I'd rather rate those keepers on the long distance passes than short passes.  We attempt to play in the back, which means De Gea will have a lot more easy passes than Courtois to get a high % and likewise with Neuer considering Bayern are a Pep possession team he'll have much more.

2670~~~
DDG averages more accurate long balls than Courtouis as well. So he has more passes, more accurate long balls, higher passing accuracy. 

The important thing to take from that is like you say the style of football, which means that DDG will have some good chances to develop his in possession game.

2671~~~
I am granting myself a few Nostradamus points:


This was on the famous thread Chris Woods: can we keep him. Hoek was regarded as one of the best in the job, and the likes of Reina, Valdez or VDS were terrific with the ball. De Gea was very good at it (although last year not as good as before) but this year seems to have become better than ever. That and now leaving the goal at times to stop attack in my opinion are very related with the new coach.

2672~~~
Reina was good at pinging the ball forward from his hands but not particularly impressive at all with the ball at his feet. De Gea was the same until this season IMO.

2673~~~
I'd agree with that; De Gea had great distribution, not ball playing skills. Some of his throws, especially.

2674~~~
Isn't it nice that the match day has passed and for once there hasn't been any activity in the DDG thread? Another solid display. 1 on 1 he cuts the angles and makes it impossible for the opponent to score. Also loved how calm and composed he was when he was surrounded by a full gang on the set pieces. He's bulked up and come a long way from where he was in his first couple of seasons. The Neville rant on MNF after White Hart Lane 12/13 seems a distant memory.

Genuinely felt sorry for the guy when Jones lost his head and conceded the penalty. 5 clean sheets in 19 games doesn't do him justice at all.

2675~~~
It's a weird feeling going into a match with 4-5 world class attackers and still get more excited when wondering what kind of miracle stuff the goalkeeper will pull off. I really look forward to see him play, even if he plays in the most boring position on the field. Hope he's here for the rest of his career.

2676~~~
Robbed of a clean sheet again. Our defenders must have a bet that he won't get more than 10 clean sheets...

2677~~~
Glad this thread has been quiet for the last week or so.

2678~~~
He's like a big comfy jumper for poor people or an automated machine gun turret atop your mansion if you're rich.

2679~~~
He uses glue on those gloves of his. He catches shots - with ease - that many goalkeepers parry into open space.

2680~~~
Loved the way he was sweeping up so far  off his line. Haven't seen much of that before. Might be a new facet to his game.

2681~~~
Yeah I noticed that too. Previously like when Townsend went through on goal he would have been glued to his line, but he was already on the edge of the box.

2682~~~
Definitely. He was always reluctant to come off of his line before this season and if it's something the new 'keeper coach has focused on then fair play to him.

2683~~~
Another top display.

2684~~~
He was outclassed by Lloris today.

How dare the French bastard.

2685~~~
Outclassed in the sense that De Gea pretty much had nothing to do or...?

2686~~~
We should aim to have our goalkeeper making 7-8/10 performances every week.

An 8-10 out of 10 suggests that the defence messed up and we needed the keeper to save us in a spectacular way. 

That was a solid 7/10 performance from De Gea, which is a good thing. Lloris had an 8 or 9 out of 10 game because his defence was a shambles and he was forced to make some very good saves.

2687~~~
I think even for a keeper playing 7.8 times a week would be tough...

2688~~~
I thought he had a couple of really important contributions. His sweeping when Chadli (I think) was played through was excellent and he held on to very decent strikes by Townsend and Fazio, particularly the latter could have ended with a very dangerous rebound.

2689~~~
Unsurprisingly he has the highest save percentage in the Premier League this season, for those who care about such things (from this morning's Telegraph).

Top 5:

David De Gea - 75%
Adrian - 73.26%
Joe Hart - 72.23%
Hugo Lloris - 71.76%
Thibaut Courtois - 70.83%


3 of the worst:

Wojciech Szczesny - 67.8%
Simon Mingolet - 66.67%
Tim Howard - 55.56%

2690~~~
And so many people will still say Courtois is better. Funnily enough though I met a friend's brother in the pub the boxing day for the football, he's the most annoying Chelsea fan ever, loves everything about them and everything is biased when it comes to their players but he said De Gea is the best keeper in the world in this current form. He also hates United so..

2691~~~
These stats say little. They dont factor is things like quality, accuarcy, strenght of the shot, other circumastances (3 instinctive saves in your 6 yard box are somehwat different to 3 half arsed shots to the middle of your goal).

2692~~~
Okay then, De Gea the best goalkeeper in the world.

2693~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6DsnQ4CYAAeLHk.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6DsnQ4CYAAeLHk.jpg:large"/>
Neville's player of the season, so far.

2694~~~
Anyone have a video of this analysis? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2695~~~
Was Carragher's best young player also

2696~~~
He said Courtois was his player of the season less then a month ago:

<i>The player of the season so far, for me, is not Sergio Agüero but Chelsea’s new No1, who has brought a smile to my face. And not many goalkeepers make me smile.</i>

2697~~~
I now see why Neville was a little bit extra critical with regards to De Gea. His control of the box and one on one saves have improved to a level where if he does this for a few more years for United it will be on par with the likes of VDS and Schmeichel (two of the best who won United many points with their saves).

I feel sorry for De Gea as well though, give him a Bruce/Pally, Stam/Johnson or Vidic/Rio and he will have many more clean sheets. I notice De Gea is only 1 clean sheet behind Courtois as well.

2698~~~
De Gea's appraisers fail to fully appreciate the shambolic shit sitting in front of him over the last two and a half seasons.

2699~~~
Strange comment as this half season has probably been the worst of all in terms of the defence he's been playing behind, yet he's been playing his best football (and getting the most praise for it)

2700~~~
I agree <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2701~~~
Our defending last season was actually worse.  With the exception of the Leicester City match the back line, makeshift as it has been week to week, has done a better job than generally credited for.  Still poor, to be sure, Carrick has filled in nicely during the injury crisis, McNair has been something of a revelation, Smalling shambolic against City but otherwise more then adequate and Rojo has been ok.  Valencia and Young are widely regarded as having stepped up nicely in the absence of Rafael and Shaw, who while fit looked pretty sharp.

Last season we were just a mess all over the pitch, but nowhere moreso than on the back line.  Opposing forwards were getting through us all the time and beating us to the ball on crosses.  We rarely got completely blown out but we dropped a lot of points by giving up 2 goals.  

But it is true that De Gea has raised the level of his game this season.

2702~~~
Can't believe it's actually been 4 years since he came here. Love the fact he says there is still huge room for improvement. Hope the pale fecker stays here for the rest of his life.

2703~~~
Some surprising names on there.

2704~~~
Save percentage is largely meaningless, if you have an incredible team in front of you, in a league where you are far better than any other team, like Neuer, then the opposition are going to be limited to a paucity of chances and likely more speculative chances that are easier to save. The stats on De Gea conflict with badly with those from The Telegraph so what do you believe anyway?

2705~~~
It's probably because of MK Dons.

Edit: No it's not that, the stat seems wrong.

2706~~~
Probably yes. To illustrate my point though. Looking at Squaka stats, they have De Gea making twenty more saves this season than Neuer while having played only two more games. 47 saves to 27 saves.

I would argue also that the quality of strikers is lesser across the board in Germany too, reflected by the presence of three Germany based goalkeepers on that list. Let's remember that Neuer conceded three against Aguero.

2707~~~
Yeah this was nice to see, I wonder if it is something he has seen in Manuel Neur and looked at it as something he could add to his game to take him to an even higher level of play

2708~~~
In other news, I had a vivid dream that he conceded a penalty in the first minute against Stoke and was sent off for denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity. The Stoke inbreds starting pelting him with coins when he protested. Rafael picked one up and lashed it back at someone in the front row, prompting a massive pitch invasion. 

Make of that what ye will.

2709~~~
That although you like him, you do not trust Rafa as a player.

2710~~~
Rafael was the hero in my dream!

2711~~~
Oh yeah. Lindegaard eventually saved the pen and ran away celebrating but the ball had a vicious spin on it and ended up rolling into the goal. Which was annoying.

2712~~~
Ahh yes, but his actions caused a disaster, no matter how well intended his violent act.

You veer between optimism and pessimism. Perhaps you actively try to think positively but are more naturally more inclined towards pessimism.

2713~~~
Him and Mata just love each other:

2715~~~
Better goalkeeper than Neuer.

Neuer a better footballer, and a better sweeper though.

2716~~~
Neuer's domination of the box makes him the better keeper. He also makes the goal look small regardless of the situation.

2717~~~
It's not a very useful stat. The vast majority of shots Neuer is likely to have faced, for example, will have been speculative long-rage efforts from teams who can't get close to the Bayern goal. Whereas De Gea, as we know, has had to save a silly number of one-on-ones.

2718~~~
Seeing Neuer at the top was no great surprise (whatever the explanation). The other keepers on there were surprising though.

2719~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's the best thing ever.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/find-new/profile-posts">http://www.redcafe.net/find-new/profile-posts</a>

From bottom to top

2721~~~
Had virtually nothing to do today but noticed that his kicking was a bit off under pressure.

2722~~~
I thought his kicking was good. Flawless under the high ball too. It was the sort of game he might have struggled in when he first joined us. Amazing how rarely he punches the ball this season. Catches the ball whenever possible. Really starting to command his area. Great to see.

2723~~~
So when will he get a new contract? Hope it's at least a 5 year deal.

2724~~~
I have to say, I am worried. Bloody Valdes.

2725~~~
A new contract ought to have been offered and signed in the summer, this news about Valdes only increased the uncertainty yet further. 

These years of adapting to the league and developing as a keeper just to sell him [and at his age too]?

2726~~~
Goner

2727~~~
What makes you think that? There are plenty of teams in world football with top class back-up goalkeepers. Cech at Chelsea, Ter Stregen at Barca, Reina at Bayern (not brilliant but a good back-up) and Navas at Real. No idea why people are assuming Valdes has been brought in to replace De Gea, especially when he has signed an 18 month deal (surely it would be longer if he is to be our future 1st choice).

2728~~~
If he's off he 's off. It'll be his own decision and feck all the club can do about it, other than try and get as big a fee as possible.

All very well saying a contract should have been offered and signed but there's only one half of that equation that the club is responsible for.

2729~~~
Think he'll sign a shiny new contract.

2730~~~
Well by reading some posts,think we should make another DDG thread where we can say our thanks for everything he did and our goodbyes...this place can be so insane sometimes.

2731~~~
Agreed. Would Ed Woodward really be so stupid as to have both goalkeepers end their contract at the same time?

Actually....

2732~~~
By some accounts the club have offered him a new contract which he and his agent turned down.    As you say it takes two parties to agree to a contract, it not like the club can force David to sign.  If he goes, it will be down to his own choices.

2733~~~
Well you'd have to assume the more likely (negative) scenario is that they already know he won't sign one and is probably out the door this summer, so they're just covering their asses for when that happens.

(mind you, I don't think that is the case and am still relatively confident we'll get him tied down)

2734~~~
You speak as if the club did its best but ultimately failed to secure his services, perhaps that will be the reality come the summer however i'm not aware of any evidence to support that belief presently. It may be that the club is confident of its ability to get De Gea to sign, or alternatively a policy has been decided upon in which he becomes a saleable asset.

2735~~~
You speak as if they didn't. Where the evidence to support your opinion?

In the absence of any evidence, what's the most likely scenario? 

That the club has beed doing everything possible to retain the services of one of the most highly rated young keepers in Europe. Someone they paid more to sign than any other keeper ever. Someone who was both the Players' Player of the Year and Fans' Player of the Year in the season just gone.

Or they haven't?

I know what seems the most likely to me.

2736~~~
He will end his career at United, I'm sure.

2737~~~
*shrugs* I suppose time will tell, most of this being mere speculation after all. I don't intend to become too absorbed by it myself.

2738~~~
Me neither. I'll be really dissappointed if he leaves but won't be demanding anyone's head. If Madrid come sniffing for a young Spanish international - with a long-term Madrileno girlfriend - then we're fighting an uphill battle from the outset.

2739~~~
lol. wishful thinking!

2740~~~
Also, not sure how wide spread it was, but I remember there being some against signing him using the reasoning that he would most likely want to move back to Spain about the time he was hitting his peak.

2741~~~
If he wants to leave, then he wants to leave. My concern is that whether we sell him for £10million or £100million, it's still just as impossible to replace him. Madrid could give us Bale and Ronaldo in return, but we are still no closer to getting ourselves a goalkeeper who is as good as De Gea. We would get no worthy value from selling him.

Based on very little, I believe he will stay for another few years. He seems to love it here, and he has said himself that he feels loved.

2742~~~
I'd imagine that most if not all on here expected a serious attempt to be made sooner or later, only with the hope that this might be prevented for a further year or two. Which it may yet for all the supporters know at this point. 

Contrary to my earlier post a person might commend the club for its succession planning. How well or swiftly Valdes will take to the league i'm not at all sure, a start in the FA Cup is now one prospect though.

2743~~~
We could buy Scuffet, i heard that he was the next Buffon. If De Gea leaves and Bale or Modric or Varane come to us, i will be able to sleep.

2744~~~
Signing Valdes probably is a signal to DDG, that we will manage without him, to weaken his bargaining position somehow and not to be forced to pay enormous wages. A club like us shouldn't want to be pushed around by players. Ofcourse we need a second gk, but this may be a little overkill, getting a gk that won practically everything there is, multiple times.

I am worried that this may be DDG' last season playing at OT.

2745~~~
I reckon a lot depends on how things pan out at Madrid. I don't watch much Spanish football but I've heard that Casillas is having a bit of a return to form. He's still relatively young and obviously a huge personality at the club. We should all hope his career has an indian summer!

2746~~~
Valdes was a bit too shaky to end his career at Barca for me to have confidence in him as a full time #1 in the English league.

2747~~~
He's 33, so if he is returning to form now than he could have another half decade or so if he keeps that form up. Hopefully he will.

2748~~~
I don't think we have offered him enough yet, I guess we are still nogotiating. In the end we should be able to make an offer to him which he just cannot refuse and Madrid cannot match. Madrid's other young players are nowhere close to 120/140 k we should be offering him at least. And as far as I know even Casillas doesn't earn more than 120 k (but not sure if that is gross or net maybe <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> or <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> know better). 
He could also go back to Atletico but they can't afford to pay him that much either.
Hell if it has to be then we should even offer him 160-180 k to keep him, if anyone deserves it it's him.

2749~~~
I'd be perfectly willing to hit the £200k barrier in order to keep him. A lot, yes, but he's top quality right now, is young, and we're not going to get anyone better.

2750~~~
Absolutely!

2751~~~
It's an important contract for him, maybe he doesn't want to rush it. If he signs, it pretty much means that he will be here until he's 30, because we're never going to sell. 

I doubt it's a money problem, considering how we splash money under Woodward, not to mention that he is one of the best and we generally pay players the money they deserve. I'm guessing only impediment could be that his girlfriend lives in Madrid. It's a very important decision for both of them and they need to think it through.

2752~~~
I think offering him more money is the wrong approach. Woodward should be setting a honey trap for this Edurne Garcia, and making damn sure she gets stuck in it. Trick her into shagging Diego Costa and get some photos of it, or better still, ensure De Gea himself walks in on it. Provide a shoulder to cry on and set him up with a nice Lancashire bird who loves nothing more than freezing wind and driving rain. Hey presto, any incentive to leave the North West of England is removed, he signs a new contract on reasonable wages and everyone is a winner. Plus, he'll always be out to play well against Costa.

2753~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2754~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Costa is too ugly for Edurne!! You have to suggest someone else ...

2755~~~
Anderson should ask her for biquine.

2756~~~
I'll volunteer...

2757~~~
Haha ...

2758~~~
You jest but I remember thinking that when Ronaldo hooked up with that sexy northern lass with the big kahunas (Gemma something?) his United future hinged on the state of their relationship. Sure enough, they split up and next thing you know...

2759~~~
Casillas is believed to be on 6m euros (net) just over 12m gross. About £200k/week in UK terms.

2760~~~
I wonder if the historic lows the euro is hitting might make it the perfect time for the club to be negotiating a sterling contract!

"How many euros per week?!"

2761~~~
Always a bit optimistic to hope he would settle down with one girl but I rather hoped we'd get a few years while he worked his way through the cast of Coronation St. Still, it leaves more fresh meet for Dave.

2762~~~
Thanks!

2763~~~
Why would we replace De Gea with a goalkeeper on an 18 month contract, god some of you need to get over yourselves.

2764~~~
Never rated him that highly but if anything he was in the world class form towards the end of his Barca career.

2765~~~
Probably against the grain here. But I'm not going to lose much sleep if we lose him.

He's obviously a very good goalkeeper, one of the best no doubt, but the only reason he's so important is because the defence in front of him is not performing as it should be. If he went we probably wouldn't be able to replace him with someone as good, but a replacement with a very good goalkeeper and improvements to the defence will cover it up.

If he left and we replaced him with someone like Handanovic, Navas, Lloris etc... and didn't concede something like 10 shots a game we'd be absolutely fine.

2766~~~
People who genuinely think he's not staying need their heads to be checked.

2767~~~
A reminder of some David de Gea quotes from earlier in the season-

"Yes, my contract runs out in 2016. But they didn't sign him for that"

"Victor had a difficult injury, he had a bad time and the boss knows him well and has given him the opportunity to recover there.

"Yes, Victor is training over in Manchester - he's still not 100 percent after his injury. When he is fully fit he will start to train with us. He's still not training in goal with us. From time to time he comes out with the goalkeeping coach, but very little still.

"Van Gaal knows him well because he gave Victor his debut at Barca and has a special affection for him and, whenever possible, we have to help where we can.

"Football is cruel at times, it's difficult. When things go well you're very good and when they go badly... well, it's awful."

"It's not the moment to think of my future. It's the moment to think about Manchester as we are not in a good moment. I'm happy there and feel very loved by the fans. I'm focused on doing well."

"Casillas will be in the national team and at Madrid as long as he wants.

"I'm in England for several years now, and it's true that at the start it was difficult - but now I'm very happy and I feel very loved by the people in Manchester and everything is going well."

2768~~~
Same goes for people who are so sure he's staying. There is no right or wrong; all we can do in this thread is speculate.

2769~~~
Completely baffled at the reaction to Valdes signing. He has clearly been brought in to be a back-up goalkeeper, and a very good one at that, but this place is in mourning because people for some reason think Valdes joining confirms that De Gea is off.

2770~~~
It's because of the rumour started by Red Issue that Valdes was assured he was De Gea's replacement. Probably bollox but they have been known to get big rumours correct in the past.

2771~~~
I'm with you.

I just can't bring myself to care that much about a goalkeeper.
Provided the 'keeper we have isn't costing points, it's the least important position to me.
It's a nice bonus to have a special 'keeper, but that's all I see it as. 

If de Gea goes, he goes. We'll survive.

2772~~~
Yes, we have proved that it's easy to find a good goalkeeper, let's just look at the time between Schmeichel and VDS, that was a joy to watch.

2773~~~
Hence why I said <i>"Provided the 'keeper we have isn't costing points"</i>, which those guys in between Schmeichel and van der Sar were. 
There were options at the time, and there will be options if de Gea leaves.

2774~~~
It depends which way you look at it. In reality if we had an average keeper this season, who made all the routine saves but didn't pull off the wordlies de Gea has, we'd have dropped a fair number of points. Without a doubt. You could make a good argument that we'd be down near Liverpool at the minute.

The thing is that if this hypothetical average keeper hadn't made those world class saves, you wouldn't criticise that keeper. If we were talking about a striker up the other scoring worldies instead, then it's much easier to credit points to them and to more noticeably miss them when they're gone. If we do lose de Gea I guarentee Red Cafe will be full of 'de Gea would have saved that' posts.

2775~~~
I genuinely think he will leave at the end of the season

2776~~~
This because we signed Victor Valdes for 18 months, with most of his wage paid by Monaco...

2777~~~
Valdes or no Valdes, De Gea will be a Real Madrid player this time next year.

2778~~~
Why?

2779~~~
What good will answering that do? I could say "i heard it from blah blah blah" and you will just think I'm some regular, crazy, blagging, attention-seeking internet loser.

Call it a hunch, and quote me in the new season (after the transfer window in the Summer) if I was wrong.

But I'm confident De Gea will sign for Real Madrid in the Summer, unfortunately. (And I think Valdes will be our #1 next season.)

2780~~~
Going nowhere.

2781~~~
Relax people

2782~~~
I've been pretty on board with Van Gaal's decisions so far but the handling of De Gea thus far has been a bit shit. We signed a goalie to challenge him for the number 1 spot when there was absolutely no reason in doing so. LVG has almost refused to praise him despite him being arguably the league's best player and definitely ours, and he has a year and a half left on his contract and nothing has been offered to him. What the feck are we doing here?

2783~~~
This isn't football manager, contracts aren't just whipped out and signed in 5 minutes, its a lengthy process. Also why sign a "replacement" for 18 months when De Gea's also runs out in 18 months, can you not see the faulty logic in that? We aren't in a position to sell, we hold all the cards with De Gea. He has shown no signs of wanting to leave and looks very much at home here, if Moyes was still around maybe he could have. We have an excellent coach, looking like we WILL be back in the champions league next season, and could very well mount a title challenge next year. Casillas doesn't look like he wants to leave, and they already have a top class keeper to replace him in Navas, all they need is a good back up if Casillas does leave.

2784~~~
I'd expect LVG's been giving DDG plenty of praise behind closed doors though, and De Gea will surely know that Valdes is unlikely to get in ahead of him. There's nothing wrong with a bit of small competition: De Gea didn't flip his lid when he was dropped for Lindegaard in his more troubled days when he had just signed, and presuming he continues to perform for us, he won't have to worry about Valdes taking his place either. Nothing wrong with us having an excellent backup option.

2785~~~
And you expect Real Madrid to be sensible about signing players?

Who said contracts take 5 minutes? His contract could have (should have) been under review for 6 months now. If we wanted to sign him again and he wanted to we'd have drawn something agreeable up by now. I don't even play football manager so no point in using that as a stick to beat me with. Have you not considered the potential for Valdes remaining beyond 18 months? Do you think Valdes signed knowing that he'd not play much at all?

2786~~~
You'd expect that but doesn't mean its the case. He's been pretty odd about him in the press.

2787~~~
Bale de gea + cash swap will happen in summer

2788~~~
Ehhhh.....What the hell?!

Krul??!?!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-agree-victor-valdes-4937769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-agree-victor-valdes-4937769</a>

2789~~~
If we don't get Bale in return then we are nothing but a Real Madrid feeder club, with Woody's comments in the summer I can see him telling them too gtfo away from De Gea unless Bale is included in any sort of deal.

I love De Gea and he has probably single handily kept us out of mid table this season, however as someone said earlier, with a better defence we won't need him to make such saves and a keeper like Cech (who is world class as well) would be more than efficient.

I'd be happy to do some exchange of players with Madrid, if they don't like that then I hope we tell them to get fecked, I hate that club so bad and their idiotic president. So yeah, either £50million cash or Cash+De Gea for Bale.

2790~~~
He wasn't even LVG's first choice at the World Cup. A nothing story pulled out of the journalist's ass.

2791~~~
If in doubt, make up a Dutch transfer rumour.

2792~~~
A newbie, <a class="username" data-user="88554, @hbgreg" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88554/">@hbgreg</a> , sent me this to post <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2793~~~
Looks like revenue at the Mirror is down this month and they need to start making up clickbait stories to get some more moneys.

2794~~~
Oh and if De Gea is actually trying to force this through by stalling on his contract then he can feck himself too, he would be a massive traitor in my eyes and moving to the rivals of his boyhood club can't be good, although these things are not unheard of.

2795~~~
I actually.... quite like Krul.<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2796~~~
The thing I don't get is people making out we'll get big money for him. Hypothetically with a year left on his deal and a desire to move to Madrid, we'd be doing really well to get our money back.

2797~~~
De Gea will of course pen a new contract, no matter what, if he really wants to go to Real Madrid and  they want him too, they will pay up and he will get his transfer.

He is too good a guy to just leave in the summer for 20m or smth, he loves Man Utd .. That im personally assured.

2798~~~
Great. Thanks.

2799~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Outstanding

2800~~~
Haha <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Am i not convincing enough?

2801~~~
Jaysus, transfer window's barely open and yer man is back with his gibberish and lies.

2802~~~
Like Nani for Sneijder did?

2803~~~
We're actually a very loving club to be fair to us, which the love applies to most players but De Gea is special <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2804~~~
I'd rather have De Gea in the side than Bale. De Gea has won us so many points this year on his own, and it was the same last year. He's our best player.

2805~~~
If signing valdes was preparation in replacing de gea, then it's a poor signing. Barca would not have let valdes go if they thought he was still one of the best keepers in the world. For me it would be cutting corners, if the club thinks they can get by with valdes being the Number 1, which would would be a pretty worrying road for the club to go down

2806~~~
Valdes chose to leave Barca, they didn;t get rid of him.

2807~~~
If it was between 2009-13 era in terms of how the club would spend the money, I would be worried. But I do think the club are now spending money, but it would be a concern if DDG is sold and valdes is our number 1 next season

2808~~~
De Gea is brilliant, but Valdes has proved he's good enough to be in a team capable of winning everything, so people shouldn't be too worried either way. I know we'd all rather have De Gea, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if he left, surely?

2809~~~
I bet this is a Glazer thing. They feel they can get De Gea to agree a new contract in June and we don't have to pay six months increase in wages now. Which would save costs. 

Pretty sure I read a few years ago that's how they were dealing with new contracts.

2810~~~

2811~~~
And since that article how often have we been in the situation where we've renewed a player's contract with 12 months to go (on someone who is below 28ish)? Never/hardly ever happens. I see it being brought up but there's no evidence that that is the case.

2812~~~
I'm really unsure he'll sign an extension to his contract to be honest, and have been for a while now. I'm not sure money is an issue, it's his girlfriend I'm more concerned about.

2813~~~
How would we sign any Spanish players if Agent Dave leaves? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2814~~~
The reality is that all other clubs are feeder clubs for Real and Barca, because they can have any player they like, with a very few exceptions. If they want De Gea, they'll get him. The rest is noise.

2815~~~
Well it's about time somebody put a stop to it. Barca aren't signing anybody and Real Madrid can feck off. If De Gea is happy to stay, there's no way we should even consider selling. Not for any player.

Part of a Bale deal, some are saying? Aye, do one....because here's the truth, De Gea is a better keeper than Bale is an outfield player. If anyhting they should be offering us Bale and cash for De Gea and I'd still say no.

2816~~~
Hear, hear!

2817~~~
That's one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard. We haven't sold a player to Madrid and Barca that we didn't want to sell except Ronaldo. And back then we were the absolute top club in terms of revenue and exposure, so he wasn't going to Madrid because we were a smaller club in terms of stature (not trophies). What makes you think we will sell our players just because Madrid want them? Who the heck have Madrid brought in recent years (except Ronaldo, again) from a really big club? Modric, Bale, Rodriguez, etc... they all come from smaller clubs and they were all brought with obscene amount of money.

Frankly, the fear and inferiority so many people here are expressing towards Barca and Real is quite amusing and I really can't understand it. Any club can buy whoever he wants, if you throw money around, as we proved in this transfer window. Doesn't matter if its Real, City, PSG, Bayern etc...

2818~~~
Pretty sure van Nistelrooy was eyeing up Madrid before he started pissing everyone off. But yeah, the club didn't want him any more at the point when they sold him, and I guess the general point stands.

2819~~~
I'd have been a lot more worried if Valdes had signed a 3 year contract.

2820~~~
Not fully across the Valdes signing yet but it seems a bit concerning that we have got him. I'm starting to think De Gea might be off sooner than I thought (he is always gong to go though). Hopefully the reports about this contract discussion are true.

2821~~~
Daily Mail claims to have sourced an opinion from someone "close" to his parents, which is positive about him staying.

2822~~~
We can all then just sit and let mighty Marcelona and Real to take whatever player they want. Cause we're a small club compard to them right?

2823~~~
It's not just about playing for the biggest clubs in the world, you have to have a healthy life off the pitch too. If those words are true from his family (as well as DDG saying he is happy), then why are people <i>so</i> sure he is leaving? 

They're right; the scrutiny he would face would be intense. One mistake and the backlash from the media would be more intense than what it was like here

2824~~~
No but the the guy has a point.  Real and FCB have everything going for them great club history, great competition (la liga), great popularity, a lot of money and are great cities to live in. The last point is probably the biggest thing going against us atm and possibly the fact that for a lot of players it is their childhood dream to play at one of those clubs e.g Cristiano 

That being said Ed Woodward and co must do everything humanly possible to try and keep big Dave, he is practically irreplaceable and would be a huge blow if he leaves.

2825~~~
Well said.

2826~~~
For me it is because his girlfriend is living in Spain. I actually think if that was not the case then I'd be at ease with the whole thing.

2827~~~
Plus the weather. I've been brought up in the rainy north west of Europe but if I could do the same job - surrounded by all my old friends and family - somewhere with sunshine guaranteed for 6 months every year I'd bite your hand off. And that's without spending the first couple of decades of my life living in exactly that climate.

That and the food. Manchester's a nice wee city but Madrid is on a whole other level when it comes to places to go eating and drinking of an evening. He might not be into that sort of stuff, though. We should hope he isn't anyway.

2828~~~
The only thing Manchester has over Madrid is the ability to get a chip barm and gravy. And at the end of the day, Dave should be able to sort that out for himself in his own kitchen.

2829~~~
Depends, what is the Donut situation in Madrid?

2830~~~
I agree. Id love to have Bale, I remember back when he was at Spurs and everyone was saying he was shit compared to Nani, being in a minority suggesting that was not the case. He is a great player and while he has improved in recent years, he has been a great player for longer than your average poster on here has admitted it. 

BUT

The idea of a DDG PLUS cash deal for Bale does not look a good one to me. I could countenance a straight swap, just about. Bale would certainly offer us something different and presumably would stay for many years. But DDG offers us just as much. Its easy to be dismissive of keepers but the confidence the whole team gets from having a great keeper at the back is huge - albeit very difficult to quantify. The thought of going through the whole palava we went through after Schmeiks left fills me with dread, there really arent a lot of keepers out there capable of excelling for a club like United. Look at Howard, he has been outstanding for Everton, it shows you cant just assume a good keeper for a club like that will be a good keeper for us. 

We have a fantastic keeper who is young, if he can be convinced to stay we should do everything we can to ensure he does, regardless of what Madrid offer. If he wants to go though, I wouldnt blame him for that, we just have to hope Woodward extracts a good deal out of it for us.

2831~~~
His girlfriend may be in Spain, but his one true love is in England. Dave would never leave Juan.

2832~~~
So Mata is going to Madrid as well?

2833~~~
Big Dave is special to all of us, in many cases our best player and never want him gone but if push came to shove the only way I'd be less upset if he left would be if we got Bale as a direct replacement.

2834~~~
If the love story theory is true (which it is) then they've have to buy the 3 amigos and since they're Madrid I'd want cost price! 

De Gea - £50m
Mata - £38.5m
Herrera - £30m

Your move.. Madrid!

2835~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2836~~~
Yeah, a straight swap for Bale would leave me feeling pretty neutral. Not exactly delighted - as I would be if we kept DDG and signed Bale. But not pissed off either.

2837~~~
All true, but then why did he leave Madrid in the first place? He was young enough back then and just started his relationship with his current gf and still left. He could have easily stayed in Madrid for a few years and moved later if he wanted. That's why I hope he is not that desperate to go back to Spain for the time being.

2838~~~
Valdes won't be around for much longer, he's 32 and doesn't strike me as a goalkeeper that will age particularly well. He might have some fuel left in the tank but it could only last for 3-4 more years at which point we will have to look for a goalkeeper again and of all clubs we have learned best how difficult it is to find a reliable one.

2839~~~
With climate going crazy maybe in the future Manchester will be a sunny capital of the world and Madrid will be rainy as hell. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
For instance this summer I heard Scotland was warm and sunny and here it was rain 90 percent of the time, at the coast too which is the worst.

2840~~~
What better way to weaken DDG's negotiating position than to sign a GK who has won literally everything. Up until now his agent has had us by the balls as he knew we couldn't afford to let him leave. Now, its not quite so much the case.

2841~~~
I'd ask the question the other way around. Which player have we kept that they wanted? There really hasn't been enough of them to form much of a judgement, since we have such imperfect information. But when you look at players we've both been in for, or what's happened elsewhere in the PL, you can see the pattern. Barca and Madrid are the destinations of choice for most players, especially non-English ones.

2842~~~
Strangely, I don't see him knocking about until his 40's either, it's because his strengths like reflexes etc will wane with age, but command of box etc should be growing, and that isn't one of his stronger areas...

2843~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://news.playup.com/articles/3755241-contract-victory-for-valdes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://news.playup.com/articles/3755241-contract-victory-for-valdes</a>
A little bit on Valdes, but if you're only interested in the de Gea part:
This is Andy Mitten by the way.

2844~~~
Taking over from Casillas at Madrid right now is a bit of a poisoned chalice really. Casillas has a lot of friends in the media, he's club captain and he's been a dominant and popular figure in the successes of the Spanish and Madrid teams. He's seen as being on the decline but anyone stepping in will have to prove they're not just better than the current Casillas, he'll even be up against the remembered peak years Casillas.

Then there's the circus aspect. The soap opera around Barcelona and Real Madrid is horrendous (at times strangely, popcorn munchingly compelling though). We may think UK tabloids are bad, but Spain has more football pages to fill, more TV and radio football gossip shows to keep fed. Not every player would want that. Not every 24 year old keeper would want to go through a level of scrutiny far more extreme than DdG has been exposed to, even in his worst moments at United.

Flipside, forget the temperatures, that's not the problem with Manchester. It's the dark, winter's so dark, early nights, grey days. That can get to you. Most other things (even tapas and doughnuts) you can buy. If he wants to live with his girlfriend and she insists on Madrid then that could be a deal breaker/maker.

On the other hand he's 24. If he believes he's got a chance of winning top trophies here, he can get top wages, and stay here and have a calmer life, without the microphones and cameras then that might be what he wants for his career. It's not as if it has to be the final move of his career. 28 is still young for a keeper and by then maybe he will need things like his own home/wife/kids even if that means he also wants to return to Spain.

2845~~~
Don't let that ruin the party.

2846~~~
Good thing is after the Valdes rumours yesterday, today's theme seems to be that we've offered Dave a new contract.

2847~~~
Indeed, I thought the media would jump on the bandwagon and print loads today about Real coming for De Gea.

2848~~~
Er Barcelona tried everything they could to get him to sign, even pleading with him to change his mind but Valdes was adamant he wanted to leave.

2849~~~
If he were to be the subject of a Real bid, we really should do better than we did when they nicked Ronaldo off us. Of course I do not want to sell him, but if the club bulks and decides to do so, they've got a few players there they probably do not want to let go of (who might not want to join us, so maybe moot point) that we should barter for (Bale, Ronnie and Varane come to mind). 

But of course we should tie him up asap to a proper contract that reflects his importance to the team - he is no less important than Rooney (I'd sooner sell Rooney).

2850~~~
RE Mitten's comments, of course no keeper is going to sign for a new club cheerfully accepting he will be number 2. It would be surprising if he did. Id be interested to see if anyone can dig up any comments from any keeper anywhere who has signed for a club acknowledging that this is what he would be. You might get, "of course keeper already there is one of the best in the world" but that is sure to be followed by "but I believe I can fight for my place and establish myself as number 1." 

Professional athletes dont get to play at the top level and earn millions by accepting other people are better than them. This is why you get relatively mediocre players leaving comfprtable situations to sign for top clubs when nobody thinks they will ever make it there. They believe they will make it even if nobody else does. 

So Valdes will fight to be number 1, of course he will. But De Gea should have equal confidence that he can keep his position.

2851~~~
We have to wrap up the contract issue, even if we have to sell him.
We bought him for a lot of money for a young keeper, we have helped him grow and become what he has become. Even if we sell him it has to be for over 35million. I would rather keep him though.

2852~~~
without doubt De gea would be our best signing this window

2853~~~
It's weird though because if Valdes feels he can beat De Gea to the no 1 spot and Van Gaal agrees with that (otherwise he wouldn't have signed him, if Valdes target is becoming a permanent fixture in our first team he must have spoken with the manager about the possibilities) then it doesn't even make sense for De Gea to stay here. Competition is good but bringing a potential number one who has been nothing but main goalkeeper of a top side for the past 10 years to compete with you sends a wrong message IMO. I'm not happy with this transfer at all, sorry.

2854~~~
Which is yet another reason why I doubt Valdes has moved here to be number two. It's very worrying to me.

2855~~~
Not in top 10 goalkeepers according to IFFHS: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.iffhs.de/the-worlds-best-goalkeeper-2014/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.iffhs.de/the-worlds-best-goalkeeper-2014/</a>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2856~~~
They based that on the world cup, only. That is so obvious.

2857~~~
These are the same guys that called Chicharito the best striker in the world.

2858~~~
If I remember correctly, having listened to the Robert Enke audiobook, it was Van Gaal that promoted the unknown youngster Valdes into the Barca team not long after Enke was signed. Van Gaal basically ignored Enke and Valdes never looked back.

2859~~~
If VG thinks on that logic, valdes could replace which I think DDG is one of the 2 best keepers in the world, he needs to had a good look in the mirror. I never saw the appeal with valdes, a good keeper, but I don't see him has a United keeper, a good backup but no way is he a number 1

2860~~~
I think we'l see that shit GKs being rotated nonsense again. Valdes's distribution being the main reason.

2861~~~
Will be absolutely gutted if he leaves. I Think lindegaard will be off though so valdes will get plenty of game time while being número dos

2862~~~
Petr Cech didn't play at World Cup.

2863~~~
They nonetheless based it on the World Cup, Navas, Ochoa or Romero (who was Subasic substitute), even Enyeama he was good in the first half of the season but Lille struggled in the second half.

This top 10 is heavily influenced by the World cup.

2864~~~
Jamie Carragher trolling us big time. Fair play.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2865~~~
Somebody should remind him that they still have two shit goalkeepers.

2866~~~
What a twat.
It was easy to predict over the last couple of years that Madrid would be sniffing around De Gea eventually. Unfortunately I can see him going, as no player seems to be able to resist the lure of Madrid. There aren't many GK talents out there like him.

2867~~~
And that they lost their match winner in the summer to Barca after they'd spent years defending him for being an utter moron.

2868~~~
Ricky Lambert was a good signing for Liverpool. 

Was interesting to see how much Suarez cost Barca, though.

2869~~~
Don't forget about Mario. He was the 'signing of the summer' wasn't he?

2870~~~
Also someone else they fancied has joined Inter.

2871~~~
Just for a laugh:

2872~~~
Last one is overly harsh, although the first two are pretty funny comebacks.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2873~~~
Yeah, the majority of replies were abuse/pisstakes as you'd expect.

2874~~~
To be fair, Liverpool do have two keepers contesting the number 1 spot now Mignolet has deteriorated so much.

2875~~~
Seems allot of these people giving carragher stick forget when they were sniffing around Ronaldo, and that was when we were a much better team than madrid

So they should not be shocked if madrid do sign DDG

2876~~~
Telegraph article by Ogden claiming that Mendes is holding off with De Gea contract talks untill Falcao 's situation is sorted out. plausible?

Sorry if this is already posted and discussed, been working all day.


Edit: wrong De Gea thread I guess.

2877~~~
Well Louis van Gaal apparently stated Valdes is a back up for 18 months with an option to extend for a year, Valdez in his first interview for United said 'De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world', and then asked why he is here he said "I'm here for help everybody, i'm not a problem, i'm just a part of the team, if i play a game then i'm thinking just i play well and to help the other team mates to win the match'.

The way I see it Valdez goes into semi-retirement in the sense he now has the life of a back up keeper, he rates Louis van Gaal and probably thinks United will win a lot moving forward, he gets the bonus of trophies in addition to excellent wages warming the bench and the bonus of helping a fellow Spaniard improve.

The man has won it all, he won't have the hunger to get that number 1 spot, he's ready for the easy life. Louis van Gaal has probably signed him as a coach / player hybrid in the sense he will be able to tutor De Gea and pass on his own personal experience, I think it's a good signing personally.

2878~~~
Yea it makes sense, the club prioritise a striker who has been nothing special this season. It would be a huge mistake signing falcao on a big contract

2879~~~
He's big, he's brave, he's Spanish Dave, He makes great saves, he never shaves, He's flying through the air, come and have a shot if you dare!

Stolen from comments from daily mail, found it funny, thought I`d share

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KRDQcCeKfAE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2881~~~
Class.

2882~~~
We must be absolutely nuts to sell him right now, not until we sort out our defence, midfield and attack

2883~~~
He'll sign a new contract and STAY.

2884~~~
I think the reason De Gea has been playing so well is because Valdes has been training with him. Good to see De Gea doing so well.

2885~~~
Not a bad theory that. His form has improved significantly from about the time Valdes started training with him.

2886~~~
Ogden alert, could be bullsh*t.

2887~~~
Possible.  But frankly this is a classic example of random caf logic based on nothing but an idea that popped into your head.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2888~~~
I wouldn't be too quick to dismiss the theory entirely. The arrival of Valdes would have spurred De Gea on, it's in his nature as a competitive athlete. We saw the impact Ozil's arrival had on Ramsey and co at the start of last season. Raising their game and then with confidence as high as it can be, performances flourish for an extended period.

I'm not saying it's entirely down to <a class="username" data-user="47092, @carlosp" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47092/">@carlosp</a> theory, but it's entirely reasonable that a combination of added motivation, a new manager bringing in competition and the need to raise your game against the fiercest rival helped De Gea to thrive and produce such a dominant performance as the Liverpool game per se.

Other factors of course play a major part too but I don't think we can dismiss the impact entirely.

2889~~~
Maybe was embargoed. Hopefully others run with similar soon

2890~~~
It's a nothing quote from Van Gaal in that Ogden piece.

2891~~~
Odgen has been shit for a while, namely since van Gaal became manager, and that's another pretty nothing article.

2892~~~
Nothing conclusive, but probably the most positive quote we've had from Van Gaal so far regarding the contract. Certainly beats his 'I'm not talking about that' stuff from a few weeks ago.
<i>
“I think so, yes,” Van Gaal said. “I think there is no problem for him to sign. I can only say that David De Gea has developed himself in the six months that I’ve been here very much. I am very pleased with his development.”</i>

2893~~~
Well if you think about it, he has been training with the lads for a while and new competition is always good, especially the high level that Valdes brings. Of course it won't be the only reason De Gea is doing so well but but I think it should be factored in. They both speak Spanish so that would also have helped De Gea a lot being around him, watching, learning etc.

2894~~~
What about giving credit to our GK coach? Maybe it was just a case of his advice and training methods are world class and it just took De Gea time to adjust to them, which he now had and that's the reason for his great form?

2895~~~
The "boys" on Soccer Saturday were talking about how De Gea will definitely definitely honestly proper leave in the summer. Thommo and Pisshead Merson were the two really championing this theory. Full on man in the pub talk. Such arrogant twats. "Yeah, if Real Madrid wants ya, you're fakin' gone mate." All that was missing was Danny Dyer talking about how Joe Cole had the potential to be our Lionel Messi. Pure shite.

2896~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yeah, it was awful.

2897~~~
They're so bitter it makes me laugh.

2898~~~
They're not being bitter in this instance, just absolutely clueless with no awareness of context. Nothing mentioned about things such as his Athletico past or his Spanish girlfriend that could add or remove credence from the rumour. Just arrogant, man on the street bullsh*t. 'This is my opinion (and ergo, fact) based on the fact that Sky are paying me.' If Real comes in for you, those spanish johnny foreigners are obviously going to sign.  

Soccer Saturday obviously want to provoke reactions like this, but in terms of punditry the show is quite clearly complete bilge. I do enjoy the panel when they're ripping the piss out of each other (which is often). I don't exactly watch it for coruscating analysis.

2899~~~
Not concerned, remember Ed Woodward saying in the summer he doesn't want to see the best players to go to Spain.

<b>"I don’t want to see players going to other clubs in Spain, I want us to stand out as the best club in the world."</b>
===

As if £30m would do it too (figure that's being reported), <b>IF</b> United were to sell De Gea, would probably take around £50m+.

2900~~~
With twelve months left on his contract in the summer, if he wishes to leave, we wouldn't be able to get 50m due to the length of time left on his contract.

2901~~~
I'm not dismissing the possibility, but it's just one of those things that we can't really know at all.  Not having a go at you for coming up with either, swapping ideas is what the caf is for.  It's far from the most extreme example, but I am always amused when people come out with stuff like "you can tell by how he's playing that Carrick hates having Phil Neville as an assistant coach" etc.

2902~~~
Quietly brilliant (again) today. Three or four great saves and a few great claims from crosses too.

2903~~~
It amazes me how solid his all round game is now. Forgetting about the saves, he's almost brilliant in every facet of his game. No longer do I worry about the goalkeeper going into the last few minutes of a game.

2904~~~
We take him for granted at times. I know that's a weird thing to say considering how highly we rate him on the 'Caf, but I just see him pull off a magnificent save and I just think "that's a straight forward one for him".

2905~~~
Amazing again, he makes relatively difficult saves look so easy. Again and by some distance, our best and most consistent player.

2906~~~
Must be sick as a chip back there, feck knows where we'd be int he table without him.

2907~~~
Our best player by a mile, we don't have a player anywhere else on the pitch who is in the same class as him.

2908~~~
Would anyone, at this point, actually blame him if he fecked off to Madrid?

2909~~~

2910~~~
Although he had a good game, there was that one moment where he let the ball bounce in his area. I'll have to rewatch to see if he could've caught it, but it's small things like that which are holding him back from Neuer's level IMO.

2911~~~
Had a good game with some decent saves today. Lord knows where we would be without him.

2912~~~
I've got to the point where I see someone striking from 25 yards and think ''do you not realize who is in goals?''. Solid as usual, I actually feel sorry for him playing in the back of such a wank team defensively, he deserves a CL winning team.

2913~~~
The romanticism would be as bad as with Ronaldo, let's put it that way, but with far less bitters.

2914~~~
It's a testament to him that today's performance can probably be considered average by his standards.

World class 'keeper.

2915~~~
No. Unless we swiftly buck our ideas up, it's getting to the point where we're not good enough for him.

2916~~~
If we don't qualify for the Champions League then no I wouldn't.

2917~~~
Think people are going way over the top. The saves he had were all regulation saves that any good goalkeeper would save.

And we already know that he's a good goalkeeper.

2918~~~
I posted a similar comment in the match thread today, being totally honest about how I wouldn't blame him. After the post I was expecting about 10 or more notifications quoting me telling me to feck off but no one replied. It's got to the stage now, how ever hurt we'd be we just wouldn't blame him. 

Dave <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2919~~~
He made 3 good saves and did nothing wrong. Another excellent game from our best player.

2920~~~
His save for the volley was amazing.

2921~~~
I don't care rather he's the best in the league, or the world... I'm just over the moon that he's ours. I honestly think his ability makes him our best player. He's almost too good.

2922~~~
He looks like he's developed that aura all great GKs have, that he will not be beaten. Solid display in a tough fixture.

Getting him to sign a new contract must be the priority before the summer.

2923~~~
I agree, and it feels harsh to be critical on De Gea, as I almost consider him invincible because he is just so incredibly important to us. 

But overall, his judgement of knowing when to come off his line is still a bit poor. A lot of loose balls roll into his penalty area and his defenders scream for him to claim them but he is often rooted to his line.

De Gea has definitely improved when it comes to claiming aerial balls, but I still think there is a lot of improvement to be made when it comes to leaving his line and cleaning up. It's not a major criticism as such, as these things come with experience and confidence. I'm sure it will come to him in time. He stops the opposition from scoring first and foremost, and that's what's most important, but I hope he keeps improving.

2924~~~
Back of the express and star say Madrid to bid £35m in the summer <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2925~~~
Double it, and throw in Varane, and maybe Van Gaal will answer the phone.

I'd be gutted to see him go though. I've said it before, but no matter what Madrid pay, we can't possibly replace him with someone who is as good. Any replacement will be a downgrade because Neuer and Courtois are impossible acquisitions.

2926~~~
When that bid comes through, the club should send them this T-Shirt.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.14952396.4831/figtn,220x294,white,mens,ffffff.u2.jpg" src="http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.14952396.4831/figtn,220x294,white,mens,ffffff.u2.jpg"/>

2927~~~
Hey David.... I think I wanna marry you

2928~~~
Then maybe we'll have a second thought...

2929~~~
Agreed. It's on the same level of criticising a striker who scores 30+ goals a season by complaining that he missed a few sitters here and there. 

Having said that, it really is a case that if he could be more assertive in his area, he would undoubtedly be number 1 in the world IMO. 

Don't get me wrong though, there are literally a handful (if that) of keepers who I'd rather have in goal for us. However, if he is looking for a move to Madrid, I would force him to run down his contract and move on a free. We clearly don't need the cash and it really would show our financial muscle IMO.

2930~~~
He's just great. Please don't leave us Dave, even if we don't deserve you <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2931~~~
If we buy Bale in a £100m swap deal involving Dave going the other way, then it'll only confirm my suspicions that the club is run by idiots.

2932~~~
Selling De Gea makes as much sense as having Phil Jones taking corners, playing Angel di Maria as a striker, Rooney as a central midfielder etc.

2933~~~
I too think Van Gaal wants to do it.

2934~~~
Still mind blown by that.

2935~~~
Graham Hunter on twitter saying he knows 100% Real Madrid want De Gea, and it tempts him.

2936~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://therepublikofmancunia.com/de-gea-insight-i-he-is-very-very-happy-in-manchester-but-atleti-fans-wouldnt-begrudge-real-move/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://therepublikofmancunia.com/de...r-but-atleti-fans-wouldnt-begrudge-real-move/</a>

2937~~~
Letting him go (for that chimp or alone) would be a big mistake on our part. He's become an integral part of the team and, might I say, one of the few responsible players we currently have.

2938~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Replace it with Fergie's face and the words "we'll never sell you a virus"

2939~~~
I'm hoping van Gaal has given him some time off and he is off in Dubai or something.

2940~~~
It'd be a joke if he goes for less than 50 million and it would be a joke if he doesn't sign a new contract to make that a possibility. Oh and it'd be a joke if we don't milk this situation and get Bale/Varane.

2941~~~
As great as he is, I can't see him going for anymore than £50m. Goalkeepers usually don't fetch anywhere near as much as top midfielders/forwards generally do, so £40-50m would technically be a pretty good price from a certain perspective.

2942~~~

2943~~~
He loves metal too, I just love this kid more and more each day.

2944~~~
You think he hums Slipknot songs when waiting for an attack?

2945~~~
I don't think there is any question when it comes to him vs Bale. I would choose De Gea any day of the week. GKs aren't easily replaceable, especially the top notch ones.

2946~~~
It'd be an absolute tragedy if he ends up moving for a flat £30-40m sum. A goalkeeper like him does not come around often. Why is it so different for a goalkeeper in terms of transfer fee? He is one of the best, and potentially THE best goalkeeper in the world. Like any midfield/attacker who is as highly regarded as himself, and has proved himself on the top stage at such a young age (not to mention the amount of years he has left exceeds that of an outfield player), he should be going for no less than £60-80m. This may seem excessive, but in today's market - I don't think so.

All that being said, I would much prefer for him to sign on for another 5 years. There's no-one even close to him to replace him with.

2947~~~
Metro reporting he's agreed terms with Madrid <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2948~~~
I just saw that. I dearly hope it's bollocks.

If it's true and he's agreed terms, does that mean he'll be off <b>this month?</b> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2949~~~

Seen it nowhere else to be fair.

2950~~~
It's fecking Metro. Get a hold of yourself biffa!

2951~~~
The Metro are spoofers.

2952~~~
As long as Bale comes the other way I'm honestly not that bothered. In fact I'd be happy with the deal.

If Bale doesn't come and we lose De Gea for £35m (£5m more than fecking Shaw cost us) I'll be furious.

2953~~~
Why would Real give us Bale for de Gea when de Gea has one year left on his contract come summer.

2954~~~
£35 million for a 'keeper in the final year of his contract is very good, although I wouldn't accept it for de Gea, and I don't think the club would either.

2955~~~
How do we know this? He's just been to a pop concert.

2956~~~
I'm surprised by that mate, would you really swap our long awaited goalkeeping solution for another world class attacker? We've got plenty of those!

World class goalkeepers are so hard to come by. After Schmeichel left, we had years of longing for somebody to tie down the #1 spot, we had so many who tried and failed. Then Van der Sar came along and nailed down the spot, but he was in the twilight of his career. De Gea was a great find, and still so very young. He's going to get better and better, arguably he's already in the world's top 3 keepers, how can you be happy to lose him just to get another great attacker?

Hehe, I know, I just hope it's BS is all.

2957~~~
What reports in Spain is that article referring to I wonder? The last I heard from Marca was that he was happy here and Real would not be moving for him any time soon.

2958~~~
Perhaps I should have said De Gea and cash.

To answer the question, maybe/hopefully just as Spanish players long to return to the shores of home, so too do British players. Bale's not had the greatest season thus far and being booed after scoring in a CL final can't have felt too great.

If he does want to return to England, we can outbid most clubs now due to FFP. And we'd be a great fit for Bale.

Also I'd like to think that Real would like to keep a good relationship with us, and so Bale coming in the other direction would be something of a sweetener - a sweetener which would also relieve their wage bill.

After Schmeichel left we won 3 out of the 4 next Premier Leagues. And with all due respect to DDG, he ain't Peter Schmeichel (despite how some are making out).

Also, DDG is going to be Spain number 1. And, without wanting to sound pessimistic, this means (imo) that he WILL be going back to Spain within the next 2 years. Now, if Bale joined us it's quite likely that he'd stay here for a long while.

And so if given the choice of 2 more seasons of DDG or 6 of Gareth Bale I'd take the latter every time.

Where you refer to Bale 'another great attacker' I'd have to disagree - Bale is nothing like any player we have...

- He knows the PL and is proven to be able to destroy it. For fun.
- He's fast as feck, direct and takes great care of himself.
- He's British, so the likelihood of him fecking off would be very low.
- He plays for Wales so International breaks are minimal (sorry Welsh folk, but it's true).
- He provides guaranteed good service AND goals.

No other player we've got combines even 3 of those qualities.

All the attacking players we've got are either old (RvP, Falcao), slow (RvP, Falcao, Mata), non PL proven and unsure as to whether they can adapt here (Di Maria, Falcao), foreign and will quite likely feck off again (Di Maria, Falcao) or Wilson.

The only one who stands head and shoulders above the rest is Wayne Rooney - and he's being turned into a midfielder!

Bale would be immense here, he's a proper United player. I've always thought so.

2959~~~
Need to get him tied down. That is all. It's that simple.

2960~~~
I think he will sign a contract with us.

But it will be his last, for in 2-3 years Real will come seriously calling, and he will be gone <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2961~~~

2962~~~
Apologies if this was already posted here. Just came across a fantastic compilation of his time with us so far:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujUuG7qkuNg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2963~~~
How many points has he won us this season? Without him we would be behind right now

2964~~~
Good luck at Madrid Dave. 

Who could blame him?

2965~~~
Without him we'd be languishing in mid-table. 

Hope he stays, won't begrudge him if he left.

2966~~~
I think Carragher summed it up at HT. Our good defensive record isn't about our defenders, it's pretty much down to this guy.

2967~~~
Another game, another MOTM performance.

2968~~~
One of only 3 players I feel is essential to building our next title challenging side around.

2969~~~
Who are the other 2 mate ?

2970~~~
Blind and Shaw, I don't consider anyone else essential.

2971~~~
Kept us in the game once again.

2972~~~

2973~~~
He's off to Madrid. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2974~~~
Never leave

2975~~~
Ahh ok. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Bit of a tangent. But is that relative to the current management or an overall assessment of the squad ? I mean hypothetically would your opinion change if the likes of Di Maria, Herrera, Rooney were better utilized and played in their position of strength under someone like say Ancelotti or Simeone. Not that I'm advocating letting Van Gaal go mind. Still think the likes of those 3, Rojo and Mata have a lot to offer, can be integral to chances of future silverware and a couple of them are about to enter their prime years.

Also, potentially some of the younger ones like Wilson perhaps ?

2976~~~
He deserves to play for the best club in the world and that's not us.

2977~~~
Was it just me or did LVG black him when he was walking off the pitch at FT? He was with Jones and LVG have Jones a big pat on the back as he walked by despite the fact he was all over the place for the goal and he didn't seem to acknowledge DDG at all even though he earned us a point (again).

2978~~~
I'll be honest, I actually forgot about Herrera altogether given we haven't seen enough of him in this league to really judge. I worry Di Maria is too soft for the PL and for me Mata is too slow and weak. If I were building an ideal 11 from where we are now I'd struggle to find a way to use Rooney as a starter unless he showed he can operate in a fluid front 3.

If we look at it from the point of view that Blind is the #6 and Rooney the pivot in a front 3, we'd still need two strong, combative box to box CM's with ability on the ball and two wide forwards to really get after it IMO. As for Rojo, I like him but he troubles me at the same time, certainly couldn't say I'd count him as essential, but a good squad player to have.

2979~~~
He looks visibly frustrated each passing week. It is vital that we convince him to stay.

2980~~~
Why would he want to stay? We are awful and don't look like improving

2981~~~
Another good performance, could have been game over before they eventually scored but for him.

2982~~~
Gotcha. Yup I too think a couple of combative central midfielders who could slot in rightaway are a must, as are two direct wide attackers, plus a first choice RB now that Rafael's frozen out and atleast one top quality center half on top of a potentially top quality center half. Also maybe a striker. Blimey that's a massive list - like 3/4ths of the starting XI plus depth. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2983~~~
Our only world class player and regular consistent performer.

2984~~~
Theres no way he's staying. Why would he?

2985~~~
We don't deserve him and that is the damn truth. As someone said above, he is the only player we can truly hands down call world class, well Di Maria is but he isn't showing world class form at this club...

2986~~~
I'll get a lot of stick for it from most but for me I'd like to see us bring in Hummels and Marquinhos for the cB, the latter can also play as a RB and that would allow us room for McNair to develop there as well. Then the midfield would be Blind/Schneiderlin/Koke and the front line would be Depay/Rooney/????. I think we'd have the right balance then with options if Herrera and Mata stayed and Januzaj and Wilson were used as back ups/competition for the front 3 spots.

2987~~~
Bailed us out more times than Angela Merkel.

God knows where we would be without him. Another player of the year award is nailed on.

2988~~~
The guy is class on and off the pitch.
Aye, why should he have any loyalty for a club that paid a lot for him and helped nurture him into the player he is today?
The United forum is worse than Rawk at times.

2989~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>I know there are a lot of negative types on here but why the feck is Dave only averaging around 6 in the match ratings?

2990~~~
As a professional, I fully understand if he prefers Madrid. You have to make the best of your career life.

2991~~~
We don't deserve him? Christ. What is it with the fecking self-flaggelation on here?!! Man up ffs. We are Manchester United. 

Moving swiftly on. Anyone see the way he was absolutely furious with himself for getting a hand on the follow up from Nolan's shot. Which was going about 6 inches wide. Love that sort of perfectionism.

2992~~~
Yeah noticed that. He really demands the best from himself. It's a shame that his teammates are so far off his level at the moment. Anyway, if he does leave it's not like it wouldn't be understandable. I mean yeah we're Manchester United a big club etc etc but he'd be getting what he deserves at Madrid.

2993~~~
Aye that 4-0 spanking v Atletico must have had him licking his lips.

2994~~~
To be honest he made a couple of mistakes today as well as the saves - most of which he would have been expected to make. I gave him a 7 and still had him as MotM for us (although that was more due to how bad our outfield players were) but it wasnt his best performance of the season.

2995~~~
Was talking about his average rating for the season, not just today.

2996~~~
Ah.
I dont think anyone has a particularly good average rating to be honest, the Caf is very fickle and exaggerates most ratings, I find.

2997~~~
Er, yeah. It's not quite the haven of level-headed post-game analysis I once thought it was.

2998~~~
They are still top of LaLiga though. And probably the favourite for the CL. You think DDG is licking his lips at scratching for a point against the likes of West Ham or Burnley or Leicester?

2999~~~
Too right, I remember his saves more than the goals we score.

3000~~~
I wonder if he can get out of his contract on the grounds of playing in front our CB's is dangerous to his health, heart attacks are real people!

3001~~~
He should get his clean sheet bonuses from our CBs wages every week.

3002~~~
Someone on Twitter got it spot on when they said he's like a lawyer who gets you out of a punishment you know you deserve.

3003~~~
He must be so sick of his defence. Another good game from him today.

3004~~~
He's like a fecking Justice League, Avengers and Greenpeace combined this guy, saved our ass again.

3005~~~
Better Call Dave

3006~~~
Our saviour once again, it's becoming a cliché in it's own right.

3007~~~
Not since the glory days of Ronaldo or with Cantona have we had a single player so clearly our best player for such a long time. The last 2 years he's been far and away our best.

3008~~~
He should be sick of LVG and the tactics/players we play. It's not like the midfield helps at all, and then when you have players out of form it just becomes a much bigger problem as they are constantly under attack and often without much support from the midfield. When the midfield picks up, usually after the first half, everything looks much better.

3009~~~
That save at 2-1 from Ings was so important.

3010~~~
Don't shoot the messenger but, according the insiders and sources on the UWS forum, he's off. 

Just reporting it is all. I know nothing

3011~~~
Those miserable twats have been banging that drum for months.

3012~~~
The image of Mitten going around banging a drum with a picture of De Gea on it is amusing to me <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3013~~~
Just like the UWS people said Vidal was a done deal, bla bla bla. OK then.

3016~~~
Maybe he is a bit of a sadist and enjoys being pelted by strikers all day. Having a rock solid defence infront of him might make it a bit boring.

3017~~~
It's probably true. Everybody likes to be involved in the game and he's had more than his fair share of involvement. 

Perhaps our poor form is a deliberate ploy to keep Dave happy until he signs a new contract?

3018~~~
He is into heavy metal, I could see him enjoying it. Bit like being in a mosh pit

3020~~~
He didn't have a lot to do today but I love that warm cozy feeling of security he provides when teams take long range pot shots at our goal.

3021~~~
Glad our defence didn't feck up a clean sheet for him.

3022~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Indeed!

3023~~~
Very good and important save early one.

Didn't think his short distribution was great, I mean it was accurate enough but didn't really help the receiver. But at the end of the day, another good performance.

3024~~~
I always laugh when he saves a long range shot, I just think to myself does the shooter not realize who's in goals?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a feeling of confidence  to have in your own player.

3025~~~
We'd be 13/14th if it wasn't for De Gea. Thanks for saving our arse again.

3026~~~
DDG = GOAT?

3027~~~
Are you saying he's the Greatest Of All Time or making reference to the hairs on his chinny chin chin?

3028~~~
No, his greatness isn't limited by things such as time, he's better than that.

A big handshake and joke with the manager at the end.

Hard to count all the points we've got thanks to him this season, phenomenal.

3033~~~
He is a bit very good

3034~~~
But, but, they haven't spoken for months? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3035~~~
Largely didn't have a lot to do, but excellent as always when he was called upon.

3036~~~
The saves he makes...Looked like a blur of green getting down to that Cisse header. Is David de Gea Barry Allen in disguise? If we don't get his contract situation sorted we'll regret it.

3037~~~
Where the feck would we be without this man? He's so good<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3038~~~
Another day, another collection of great saves.

3039~~~
New contract and 5% of the club. Just do whatever to keep him.

3040~~~
Should be a contender for PFA player of the Year. 

Schemichel season 95/96 like.

3041~~~
Standards for a good save have slipped so low these days. We shouldn´t expect any worse from a man that is paid for goalkeeping. For me, it was a simple save.

3042~~~
He's a really, really sexy man.

Oh and something about being good at keeping that round thing away from those two sticks and a fish net.

3043~~~
Which one? He made many very good saves.

3044~~~
The last one, from the Cissé header.

3045~~~
Best in the world right now IMO.

3046~~~
That Rivier save was great, but the other one they went on about was expected at the near post.

We'd still be down the table without him.

3047~~~
Stupendously good goalkeeper. We absolutely cannot afford to lose him.

3048~~~
Can we just give him a contract already? He's our player of the season again, what a keeper!

3049~~~
Just brilliant again and again. His game is almost faultless

3050~~~
I expect we've been raining contracts and blank cheques down on him for months. I don't think it's going to happen.

3051~~~
POTY for me. Not only United POTY but league POTY.

He's earned us 10-15 points this season.

3052~~~
Nothing to argue about standards, but have you seen some of his team-mates that are paid for playing football? Praising him is our little bit of silver lining now.

3053~~~
His saves are vital. They aren't always amazing saves, but he makes them and wins us points. I love him. Please don't go Dave <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3054~~~
All hail king Dave <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>.

3055~~~
I'd be inclined to agree with this. I don't think I've ever seen a goalkeeper save games the way this guy has this season. He's been good for over ten points and that's no exaggeration. Of course, that's his job, but he does it better than any other. He's tremendous.

3056~~~
If, and it's a big IF from me, he does leave within the next couple of years, it will go down as one of the biggest losses alongside Ronaldo this club has faced. He truly is a player that has won us points on his own, even in a game where he was called upon 3 times in big situations, and pulled up the goods every time. POTY 2 times in a row looks a certainty to me.

3057~~~
Unfortunately that will go to the likes of Sanchez off the top of my head, sure there are others more in contention but too tired to think.

3058~~~
Probably Hazard. Sanchez has been poor (tonight aside) for a while now. Hazard has been much more consistent.

3059~~~
If we do get top 4, I reckon he has a good shout at Premier League POTY. Arguably the biggest reason why we're still fighting for top 4.

3060~~~
What a hero! Wouldn't have surprised me if our other useless players managed to get him injured by being unable to defend when he had to make the earlier safe <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3061~~~
I've lost count of the amount of MOTM performances he's got this season for us.

3062~~~
I agree. I think de Gea is probably the best keeper in the league (comfortably in the Top 2) but people go way over the top with his saves. If any of them last night results in goals I'd be disappointed. The one at the end was decent but you'd expected any premier league keeper to make it. It wasn't particularly a brilliant effort.

3063~~~
Fighting relegatin.

Being more serious, quite a few points behind Spurs (probably fighting with Stoke for the seventh place).

3064~~~
Am I exageratting to say that De Gea's performances this season have been the best I've ever seen on a season in EPL? I don't remember Schmeichel's early years but I would say the De Gea 14-15 has played better than Van Der Sar for us and Cech for Chelsea.

Should get player of the year award (league POTY) if we get top 4.

3065~~~
The save from the Cisser header was fairly routine but I thought the one where he injured himself was excellent. I do agree that people get a bit too giddy about every save he makes. It's actually quite a while since he made a really exceptional save. Which is a good thing, as it shows our defence is getting better.

Michael Owen giving him the MOTM award - in a game where Newcastle had just 2 shots on target - was just retarded. He's such an awful pundit. I'm really starting to despise the bland little turd.

3066~~~
Should, but I doubt he will. With the Players' Player of the Year award, voting is done around about now. A goalkeeper hasn't won it since 1978.

Not sure about when the Premier League Player of the Season award is decided. Schmikes was the last goalkeeper to win it in 1996. 

Costa, Sanchez or maybe Hazard will probably win them.

3067~~~
United fans on here and Twitter also voted him MotM too though.

He was the only United player who did anything remotely outstanding. The save at the nearpost from very close range was very good, and kept us level. Not a patch on the save against Everton, but still a good one.

It was a bloody awful game. Someone had to get it.

3068~~~
LVG seems to agree <a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/30778/9744574/david-de-gea-is-an-unbelievable-goalkeeper-says-louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...n-unbelievable-goalkeeper-says-louis-van-gaal</a>

3069~~~
Seriously?! I'd always thought United fans on twitter were a diabolical bunch but I've lost a bit of faith in this place too now. Absolutely ridiculous to make a keeper MOTM after making just two saves in 90 minutes (one of which was fairly routine) You have to wonder if it might have turned out differently had Mickey Owen not put the idea in people's heads.

Mind you, I'm aware that MOTM awards aren't very scientific...

3070~~~
Yet in the article there's no mention of any quotes from van Gaal about de Gea might want to return to Spain and hopes he can be persuaded to stay. Journalism, urgh. He most likely did say it, but why not include the actual quotes? Wouldn't be much effort by Sky to do so.

3071~~~
Did anyone else catch the celebration of LVG and DDG at full time? Was brilliant to see.

3072~~~
Yep! But according to the 100% accurate media, they hadn't talked to each other for months <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3073~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/O0FuED3X6bn/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

That?

3074~~~
Who should get it though, everybody was rubbish.

3075~~~
Easily our most important player and quite comfortably the most consistent player this season.

The amount of points he has saved us is incredible.

3076~~~
Indeed thanks. I know it doesn't prove anything but perhaps dispels the rumours that they hate each other/haven't spoken for weeks or months.

3077~~~
Not true at all. 

Fellaini, Hererra, Valencia, Rooney, Blind, Rojo and Evans all played well and were <i>considerably</i> more involved than De Gea. Smalling too, apart from that one brainfart when they should have had a pen.

Actually, you'd be closer to the truth to say everybody played well than to say everybody was rubbish!

3078~~~
Yea a bit harsh on my behalf I guess but then again, who'd be your favourite as you can't really split it between 6 or 7 players.

3079~~~
Yeah, I agree there's no really obvious candidate. One of those games where nobody really stood out. With a gun to my head, I'd probably go for Valencia. His usual reliable self defensively, completed 97% of his passes, put in some decent crosses and a couple of great passes forwards (including the lovely dinked pass to Di Maria which he made an awful hash of right before he got subbed) De Gea wouldn't make the top five. Not because he played badly but because he was basically a spectator. For me, MOTM has to be the player who has the most positive influence on a game. By definition, that excludes a keeper who has just two shots to save in 90 minutes.

3080~~~
Still don't think he'll sign a contract with us again <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3081~~~
I hope he signs the contract soon. Main problem is most likely CL qualification, I really hope he stays and I think he will when we get Top4 and otherwise I hope he can see and understand that we are at the beginning of something and will try everything to return to the top.

I don't think there is much truth in all those Real rumours, he is a Atletico and it's just typical Spanish media shit to unsettle him, they have 2 good goalkeepers, so I doubt they need him now. According to AS, Marca and Co. Real should have signed Neymar, Suarez, Aguero, Ribery and Falcao 5 times and those deals didn't happen either. I always had the feeling that he could return to Spain at some point, but hopefully not yet.

3082~~~
Great again last night, made big saves at key moments. I was concerned when he appeared to be injured at one point, but he obviously shook that off. Get this man a new contract!

3083~~~
According to that article LVG conceded that he might be tempted back to Spain? I can't see any quotes where he said that though. Are they just making it up?

3084~~~
We're shit, but he's the best keeper in the world, wouldn't blame him at all if he leaves this summer

3085~~~
Deserves so much better than this shit. 2 incredible saves, amazing player.

3086~~~
If he signs a contract extension then he "really" loves the club otherwise there is no reason for him to stay if Madrid are seriously interested.

3087~~~
Would not blame him in the slightest if he wanted to leave. He has made perhaps one half mistake this entire season, yet gets put on a one-on-one on two occasions, both of which he had the slightest of chances, against one of our biggest rivals in an FA cup QF at home. If he stays long here then he is a godsend.

3088~~~
me neither, best goalkeeper in the world this season.

3089~~~
Did his best to cheer me up. Two unbelievable saves.

3090~~~
Please please give him want he wants. If we lose him we may as well pack up and go home.

3091~~~
I would be surprised if he stayed at this point, and wouldn't blame him at all for wanting to go play for Madrid. He's the shining star in a pile of shit.

3092~~~
Too good for you lot at the moment!

3093~~~
No top 4(Although even then I wouldn't be confident of him staying) and I think he could be off.

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3094~~~
David De God.

3095~~~
Good luck at RM you absolute hero!

3096~~~
That last save was one of the best I've ever seen. fecking heart-breaking that he's off in the summer.

3097~~~
Sell him, its embarrassing to even have him in the side. We are not worthy.

3098~~~
I really do not think we should negotiate any deal with Real Madrid that sees De Gea leaves. He has looked too good to let go of.

3099~~~
Best GK of the world

3100~~~
Same.. absolutely stunning, moments like that are the equal to any goal of the season in my eyes. Utterly magnificent. He reminds me of Gordon Banks.. so agile.

3101~~~
He's a great keeper, don't think there's anyone better in world football.

3102~~~
Give him Old Trafford.

3103~~~
Similar to the one he made against Real Madrid last year.

3104~~~
Too good for this shit.

3105~~~
Can't even fault him if he leaves. Incredible saves again today. Must be so frustrating seeing defenders in front of him that can't control a football any better than yourself.

3106~~~
He'll be great at Madrid next season.

3107~~~
It's a worry how he is consistently our best player, it's embarrassing for the rest of the team that they don't deserve to play with him. I'd hope he did stick around but you probably couldn't blame him if he left, it must be tiresome to play in front of the shite he does every week.

We did stick by him during a period of shakyness but you'd argue he has paid it back now.

3108~~~
Our only class player. Shame really

3109~~~
The save from that volley was delicious as well. Almost held on to the ball with one hand as well.

3110~~~
I'm serious, just give him whatever the feck he wants. If he wants the moon renamed after him then I expect Woodward to sort it out. Just fecking get him to sign

3111~~~
Win or lose after every game the only thread I feel like opening is this one because he is so good. Even this gives me pain because he will leave soon

3112~~~
He's insanely good. If he makes the right choices at club level and manages to rack up the honours then I think he'll make history in one way or another.

3113~~~
Hes too good to play with this lot every week, if I were him Id go.

3114~~~
If we lose him............I don't even want to think about it.

3115~~~
He's far too good for us. Just give him what he wants FFS!

3116~~~
The best player in our team by a worrying distance.

3117~~~

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/9kRVzbp.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/9kRVzbp.gif"/>

3118~~~
One man defense.

3119~~~
The only standout player for us this season I can't even imagine how shit we would have been without him.

3120~~~
That save but also how fast he was back on his feet was incredible. Truly a world class player and I doubt we can keep him for much longer

3121~~~
We don't deserve him. And I fear he knows that too.

3122~~~
MOTM.

3123~~~
It's going to be a long, sad summer when this guy fecks off to Madrid (who can blame him).

3124~~~
Of course we do. We'll be back on top soon enough. 

Another outstanding performance by him though.

3125~~~
He's a one man defence alright, yet some will sight our goal against record as the reason why some of these defenders at the club are of the required quality.

3126~~~
Who was the defender that made the hopeless pass back to De Gea for Welbeck's goal? And how many times have we seen that this season? Our defenders have been rubbish sure but its alarming how LVG has not been able to sort this out, not even a slightest hint of improvement. I think we would have definitely seen some improvement under Mourinho, Guardiola or Simeone by now. Our defense cracks at the slightest amount of pressure.

3127~~~
It has come to the stage when I can't really blame him if he decides to leave. He is too good for us (something that I never said before for a player).

3128~~~
Outstanding performance from him tonight.

The more I think about it though, the more likely I think it is that he'll leave us. Completely dependant on him all season with no chance of any silverware. Personal plaudits are all good an well but doesn't count for much when he's not lifting trophies at the end of the season. He'll head to Madrid and clean up over there. Gutted

3129~~~
He's just amazing. It's sad that we lost because it makes it harder to really enjoy those saves. They were brilliant. Best in the world IMO now. Can't really blame him if he leaves unfortunately.

3130~~~
I think it's the passing van Gaal's philosophy which made us more prone to this. Not saying that I like to hoof the ball at first occasion but certainly if we had more direct approach with good pressing we wouldn't need to be forced to do this kind of mistakes that often. I like when players are constructive but it can be costly.

3131~~~
Should have won motm for that save alone.

3132~~~
A new keeper would cost what, 20/30m? I'd happily give Dave that to stay.

3133~~~
This.

3134~~~
Should he have risked himself more and went in for the diving tackle for their 2nd goal ?

Roy Keane seemed to think so.

He basically never went fully committed to be risk averse.

3135~~~
No, because then Welbeck goes down and he gets sent off. All he could do was make himself big and hope Welbeck fecked the chance up - it was a nailed on goal the moment Valencia played the backpass.

And Keane will stick the boot into any United player to sound controversial. See the Nani / Real Madrid incident.

3136~~~
Awesome performance. I can tell the team really trusts him, and he deserves that trust too.

3137~~~
Best keeper in the world. No doubt about it.

3138~~~
There was a chance he could get a nick of the ball or referee chicken out etc..

Even sacrificing himself with free kick outside box and sure shot goal was tough call at that stage.


I am personally of the belief that if GK comes up that far out then he should go all out if he's last man by a distance. Or maybe he should have stayed little back.

Remember Sterling incident ?

3139~~~
Give him Falcao+rvo's salary, player of the seasom contender for me

3140~~~
Really gonna miss him next season. Honestly wouldn't blame him for going.

3141~~~
Would have gotten himself sent off if he went harder at Welbeck. Made the right decision IMO.

3142~~~
We don't deserve him. And he deserves better than us. If he leaves, I don't think I would blame him. It must be depressing making world class saves game after game for the defenders to regularly put him in the shit or the attack to not contribute. I think I feel sorry for him.

3143~~~
Contender? He is not a contender. He is the only player even close. He is light years ahead of everyone else for that award. If 1 million United fans voted on player of the season I would genuinely think it's a disservice if he didn't unanimously win it. That's how far ahead he is of everyone else.

3144~~~
Yes, we need him in the league, the 3rd place is worth much, MUCH more than a pissy FA trophy!

3145~~~
If we lost DDG for three games we might as well pack our bags.

3146~~~
In fairness it would have been one game. Three games is for violent conduct.

3147~~~
he is simply irreplaceable.

3148~~~
Talking about the whole PL, not United, that one is obvious, but Lloris is better ; p,

3149~~~
No - straight red is 3? Or am I wrong. I'm probably wrong.

Edit: I am wrong. Ignore me.

3150~~~
You just have to hope that he doesn't see this for what it is...a sinking ship...

3151~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> .... .... .... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3152~~~
Unfortunately he isn't an idiot so ...

3153~~~
Him and Rooney only ones to show up.

3154~~~
When we first signed the boy, I remember Ronaldo describing him as 'extraordinary, even if he does look like a sausage'.

And he is extraordinary. Just hope he stays and enjoys many more years of success with us.

3155~~~
I've always felt "we'll survive. He's just one player!" but tonight I'm starting to feel it.
Even just looking at how much he's changed physically in the few years he's been here... He's become a monster here.

Sir Alex got it right with this one.. and more than likely he'll be gone before we can truly benefit from him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> At least if he leaves, he'll have won a title. He deserves it.

3156~~~
He's excellent. A monster of a keeper. So afraid he'll leave.

3157~~~
If the lad is happy to be winning the Sir Matt Busby POTY award then we'll be fine.  If he wants to win leagues and in europe then we'll probably lose him well before we're even close to contending for them.

3158~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i58.tinypic.com/ig908k.jpg" src="http://i58.tinypic.com/ig908k.jpg"/>

3159~~~
Jonny Evans has accounted for at least half of those!

3160~~~
Far too good for us. That second save at the end from Sanchez is unreal.

3161~~~
Looking back at the game I thought he could've done better on the first goal, shouldn't have been beaten at his near post imo

3162~~~
That's a bit harsh. Ozil was looking for Monreal to square the ball in. De Gea was at a positional disadvantage. Monreal had two very good options, either square the ball to an on rushing Ozil or just go alone. In the end it was a very good finish from literally 3 yards out. Hard to stop those.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i61.tinypic.com/se668p.jpg" src="http://i61.tinypic.com/se668p.jpg"/>

3163~~~
Better on the ball than any of our defenders <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Between him, Sanchez and a couple of the Chelsea boys for player of the year.

3164~~~
His passing under pressure is fantastic. We need an outfield version of him.

Or just put him outfield and put Valdes in goal.

3165~~~
Every great performance by him and shit performance by the rest of the team makes me more convinced he won't be here next season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> feck Falcao off and give his wages to De Gea, Woody.

3166~~~
He'll sign a new contract and be here next season. 100% certain of it.

3167~~~
I usually feel getting beaten at the first post is usually the keeper's fault, but for the reasons you've listed, this was one of the rare cases where there was really no fault on his part. He really couldn't do much else. That pic annoys me watching our defence all over the place running, they have the tactical awareness of headless chickens.

3168~~~
This picture illustrates one thing, and that is the absurd positioning from Valencia. Not even on the screen...

3169~~~
De Gea will be playing in the CL next season...I'm 100% certain of that!

I'm just not sure what team he will be playing for!

3170~~~
You know the fullback isn't supposed to track his opposite number, right? Valencia's man was Sanchez. Also not on the screen.

3171~~~
We'd be better off keeping him another year to get us back into the CL if we miss out again this season. Even if that means that he'll leave for nothing.

3172~~~
Track to a certain extent, though. Valencia was charging at Sanchez towards the middle of the pitch, just before they scored.

3173~~~
That was his job, though. Apart from the usual requirement of a fullback to mark his winger, he seemed to have a brief yesterday to man mark Sanchez wherever he went. Was following him all over the pitch.

3174~~~
I don't want to make this into a huge debate about Valencia, for obvious reasons. However, you should re-watch the goal. His persistent, and needless, tracking of Sanchez takes him out of position and he doesn't bother getting back.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gRllgnHoXs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3175~~~
So 7 Man of the Match awards it is then.

3176~~~
Dunno about "needless" but that goal certainly wouldn't have happened if the rest of our team had been as peristent in their tracking of the players they were supposed to mark.

But yeah, David De gea.

EDIT: although looking at that vid he had actually picked up Ozil right before he got drawn into making a tackle. Don't think he had any choice but to make the tackle from there either. The ox was about to get clean through on goal.

3177~~~
I do think De Gea could have done better for the first goal. He didn't have an ideal starting position when the pass was played but if you watch the clip he seems to appeal for offside for a split second before moving to close Monreal down. He's clearly seen the pass and reacted to it, or else he'd not be appealing to the linesman, so for me he has to play to the whistle and get straight out. He may have had no chance of saving it either way but you never know.

He was exemplary the rest of the game though. I don't blame him for losing to Welbeck in a footrace for the second, with hindsight you'd say that taking into account Welbeck's pace and his poor finishing it'd have been best to take your chances with a one-on-one, but in a game situation you don't have time to rationalise things like that.

3178~~~
I guess, with the standards he's set himself, he, maybe, should have saved it. It's that type of save, in that 1v1 situation, he's become renowned for.

3179~~~
I just think it was an excellent finish. De Gea will have assumed it would go across him but Monreal tucked it quite high up on the near post instead. Actually very hard to save.

3180~~~
Think it actually glanced in off the post. He cheated a bit expecting the finish across his body but of course doing that is also what helped him stop the Sanchez shot in ET

3181~~~
Casillas having a shocker can't be good news for us wanting to hold onto DDG

3182~~~
If he wins player of the year twice in a row, our outfield players should hang their heads in shame. Has that ever happened, in any club ever, that a goalie wins player of the year back to back?

3183~~~
He deserves to win it again to be honest.

3184~~~
Good shout for the league's POTY if he single-handedly gets us in the top 4.

3185~~~
My POTY anyway. I think Hazard will win the PL POTY though.

3186~~~
He's a dead cert to win our player of the year again. It's even more clear cut than last year IMO as I think he's gone to another level this season.

3187~~~
Why would Hazard? De Gea is one of the few who have had better seasons than Hazard.

3188~~~
I just think he'll get it. De Gea is my choice, but I think Hazard will win it.

3189~~~
He should win our player of the season, but as pointed out above by <a class="username" data-user="17877, @Jacob" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/17877/">@Jacob</a> it will be an embarrassment to our other players.

3190~~~
As much as he deserves it, this is absolutely true.  For none of our attacking players to be even close to being considered ahead of him speaks volumes for their performances.

3191~~~
It was di Maria who fecked up not tracking Monreal there.

3192~~~
Almost feel like the stars are lining up for him to go to Madrid <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3193~~~
Eh? Strange post considering how good Casillas was tonight.

3194~~~
I assume you're being ironic? I was expecting white text!

3195~~~
We're going nowhere right now, I wouldn't blame him at all if he left (He'd still be considered a Judas though).

3196~~~
Nope, very serious!  <span style="color: #ffffff">Only kidding! </span>

3197~~~
The reality is that if our form continues as it has we will find it difficult to retain players as talented as de Gea.

3198~~~
It is imperative that we keep him. If we make top 4 then I think he'll stay if we don't then we will have to persuade him that we are going to have to sign some quality to show him we want to get back to the top.

3199~~~
Every time Iker has a poor game for Madrid I get a little more worried.

3200~~~
Watch the second goal, Smalling and Valencia share far more of the blame than di Maria. Valencia, who started off by tracking Sanchez, completely forgets he's the right back and starts playing as a third center back. Smalling, who should realise that he, as the defender, should cover Valencia, doesn't bother and also joins in with Valencia and Rojo. Ridiculous defending, intelligence, team work and concentration from the two.

3201~~~
Yea I agree that defending against Ox was simple clowning but in the end it was ADM's man who was completly uncovered by him, he didn't bother tracking back.

3202~~~
Heh same here, I think he will leave in the summer as I'm not sure we will finish in the top 4, for a fee no one will be happy about but he only has one year left on his contract.

3203~~~
It would be better to keep for that last year even if he ends up leaving for free as he wouldn't command a high fee. If we fail to get CL next season then having the best keeper in the world would boost our chances for 2016.

3204~~~
Possibly I would lean that way too, but De Gea will still go for around £20m I'd imagine and I can imagine the club finding it difficult to say no to that especially with no CL income again.

3205~~~
I'd imagine that they would sell too, but even with no CL we are still flush with cash and don't have to sell.

3206~~~
Why can't Real go for Cech? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Can't say I'm confident even if we get CL football that he'll stay.

3207~~~
Oh "simple clowning" is far too friendly, non-existent is more suitable. The defending for that goal was worse than what you'll see in a school game. Blaming di Maria is quite harsh as he should never have been required to chase down Monreal, as there shouldn't have been so much time and space afforded for their left back. Avoid situations, avoid excuses.

3208~~~
We don't even know if Real is going for anyone. They have Navas on the bench, who is a very good keeper and Iker is such a legend there, that they play him despite having a superior keeper on bench, so we don't know if they want or need a goalkeeper right now anyone. And we also don't know if he wants to join them as Atletico, so sit and relax till we know something concrete, CL qualification is key and there were also a lot of rumours that it's not unlikely that he could stay, but people always ignore that and make the Real rumours a fact <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Btw, why does he have an average rating of 6.9? That's way too low, my personal rating is on 7.8, which is far better imo. He is one of the best players in the PL and the main reason why we are still in the Top4.

3209~~~
He had a 'slow' start to the season where people were critical of him (myself included). Without the MK Dons match and probably the Leicester match I would think his rating would be much higher.

3210~~~
Yeah true, but even then he wasn't really bad or did mistakes. He just didn't do anything special, but did people really give him a 2 or 3? Because some 5 or 6s should already be outdone by all the great votes in the last few weeks. There were not many games in the last few weeks where I would give him something under 7 to be honest.

3211~~~

3212~~~
If he's named POTY again this year he'll be up there alongside Keane ('98-'00), van Nistelrooy ('01-'03) and Ronaldo ('06-'08) as one of just 4 players to win it in consecutive years which is quite incredible for a goalkeeper.

3213~~~
He has been incredible these past two seasons, I think this season is better than last season.

3214~~~
Kind of highlights how bad the rest of the team has been as well though.

3215~~~
Will need another big one from him tonight.

3216~~~
Have total faith that he can derail the 'Kane-train'

3217~~~
Same here... However i dont have that amount of faith in the players infront of him.

3218~~~
It is nice to finally have a match where he did not have a lot to do.

3219~~~
He saved a goal with his butt at the end.

3220~~~
Ronaldo scores with his cock, and Dave saves with his ass.

3221~~~
So confident and Edurne made a nice tweet about the win, good one lass.

3222~~~
She's trying to appease us after her comment the other day.

3223~~~
Third clean sheet in a row in the league.

3224~~~
How is he faring in the golden glove race?

3225~~~
Joint 3rd with Mignolet and Fabianski with 10 clean sheets. Could change tomorrow. Ben Foster is 2nd on 11 and Fraser Forster is 1st with 13.

Ahead of Courtois (8) and Hart (9).

3226~~~
What the?

3227~~~
The Pulis effect.

3228~~~
Got a very much deserved clean sheet.

3229~~~
Don't forget Jones misplaced backpass as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3230~~~
I'll giver her the benefit of the doubt if she follows up a selfie in a Manchester United bikini

3231~~~

3232~~~
No need to appease us if he's leaving!! *Clutching at straws*

3233~~~
What a video, seriously, that's just f..... brilliant. We need to keep him and no way would I swap him for Bale

3234~~~
Swapping him for Bale would be rank idiocy.

3235~~~
At the end of his career, if someone has the courage of putting together a highlight reel of his best saves, it's going to be outrageous! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3236~~~
Not if we sort our defence out it won't.l..

3237~~~
Yeah fat chance for that! 

But even if he didn't have to make a save for the rest of his career, the amount of jaw dropping saves he's pulled off for Atlético and us in a few years is crazy!

3238~~~
You'd need to book a week off work just to watch it.

3239~~~
Anyone else feel like the main reason he could be leaning (reportedly) towards a transfer to Madrid is to cement his place as Spanish national team's #1 ? Might be wrong but Premier League based Spanish players (Silva for example) have alluded to a preference for La Liga based players (specifically Real Madrid and Barcelona) by the selection committee/ decision making body. If De Gea joins Madrid as a guaranteed starter ahead of Casillas, surely that's curtains for Iker which combined with Valdes' decline and Reina's lack of minutes propels De Gea to the forefront.

3240~~~
Del Bosque is planning on making him #1 regardless. He has already started one of the last international games. Altough I don't remember if it was just a friendly or not.

3241~~~
He'll be a starter soon enough, but there is a chance that Del Bosque will start with Casillas on the next EURO (which would be an even dafter decision than starting with him on WC). By going to Madrid, and so automatically displacing Casillas, he would pretty much ensure that will be Spain's main keeper on next EURO.

Still, I don't think that point will affect De Gea's decision for his eventual transfer to Madrid.

3242~~~
Yeah, Casillas is still captain. de Gea moving to Spain could be the difference between waiting one year, and effectively becoming number one in a few months. He may well be willing to wait, but I'd imagine that's what those in Spain will pitch to him. He's nearly 25.

3243~~~
If he goes in the summer, how do we rank him up against our other two top keepers in the premier league years? (Edwin and Schmikes). 

For me he's the worst of the three, just wondered what everyone else thought?

3244~~~
Worst of the three. He'd have to win more at this club to be on the level of VDS and Schmeichel.

3245~~~
Yup, he's #3 as of now and by a decent margin to be fair. 

But that's to be expected, both Schmeichel and Van der Sar are among the all time greats so the bar is set extremely high on top of their peak years as goalkeepers coinciding with their United careers. Peter is one of the Top 5 of all time at his position, was 28 years old, a full international for Denmark with almost 20 caps while Edwin was approaching 35 with almost a 100 international caps and almost 500+ club appearances for Ajax, Juventus and Fulham.

By comparison, De Gea was only 20 when he joined us, has been here for less than 4 seasons and far removed from his peak so any comparisons are a bit unfair. That said, I reckon if he sticks around for 4-5 seasons he has a good chance to maybe match both and if (hopefully) he stays at United for the rest of his career and keeps the current trajectory, then he might even go down as the greatest keeper in Premier League history, eclipsing their records by a fair margin and maybe even better than Banks and Shilton for cumulative body of work.

3246~~~
Schmeichel is the greatest ever.

As for De Gea, he's made big leaps since 2013 and has also made PFA team of the season appearance and is very likely to get another one if we make the CL spots.

3247~~~
No, not really. I'd put Yashin, Zoff, Banks and Buffon above him. And maybe Meier at level. He's definitely on the fringe of the Top 5 though, ahead of Kahn and Zamora and Dasaev and Fillol. Pretty sure most neutral and objective United fans would largely agree with that.

3248~~~
I would say he has a way to go too. There are two main reasons why: he moved when he was 20 compared to a 28 year old schmeichel and a 35 year old VdS, as well as playing in a vastly inferior team compared to these two. Pete and Ed were in the main two periods of Fergie's dominance, where he had his teams nailed on, perfectly, whereas De Gea has never had a settled back 4 since he has arrived. He spent the first two years trying to fight off the critics, and the other two has been spent being our best player. If we were in such a dominant way like we were in the past and had won more silverware, it would be hard to say he isn't close to, or on level with the other two. 

If he stays for another season, he would have been here as long as VDS and only 3 years off Schmeichel, and you can't deny that 3 seasons of top level play like his won't put him near them. He's only been lacking the silverware to back his hard work.

3249~~~
Schemiechel was better than every goalkeeper you mentioned expect maybe Buffon.

3250~~~
Err...

3251~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3252~~~
If Silva can start for Spain without playing for the big two, how come Dave has to leave? Especially as Casillias is getting phased out regardless. Its the dumbest reason to move I've heard yet.

3253~~~
Most of us are thinking about Yashin, Zoff, Schmeichel et al in their prime.  

My friends, David De Gea is still 4-5 years away from being in his prime.

3254~~~
Exactly. Has more to do with politics and the status around Casillas. If Spain's manager is smart enough, he goes with some of the younger players and brings new faces. If he sticks to the old school group, he will play Casillas whether DDG is at Madrid or United

3255~~~
I've had a nightmare tonight that David was sent off in some match prior to dippers one and I was mad as hell that we've lost a guy who'd have saved us the points.

3256~~~
He should at least sign a new contract so we can obtain an obscene fee for him, you owe us that Dave! Otherwise there has to be Gareth Bale coming the other way at a nice discount.

3257~~~
i dont get why we should pay at all for bale... we're getting a good winger and they're getting the Worlds best goalkeeper, they should pay us!

3258~~~
He one deserves that kind of raise that will keep him here for the rest of career. If not, we really have no ambition to build a strong European side.

To be or not to be... Louie.

3259~~~
It's not going to be about money if he leaves, the club will offer him top dollar. Remember the interview with Woodward during last summers pre-season where he spoke of how sick he was of seeing the best players in Spain.

3260~~~
Great point but we can't just assume that everyone of our top players will end up in Spain.

I remember that interview. His confidence sounded quite solid then and what a way to keep his word by keeping David here who by the way is unquestionably most valued player in United by pretty much everyone.

3261~~~
Indeed. The possibility of De Gea leaving has nothing to do with money. I think the terms on offer as of now, if there are any, will be greater than any goalkeeper has ever seen. We'll pay greater than Madrid, too. 

Sadly, or not sadly, from a moral standpoint, this looks like nothing to do with money and everything to do with personal and football reasons.

3262~~~
Think he's in with a good shout to win POTY this year, no real stand out candidates for outfield players but he's been so consistent all season long. Also, I'm starting to get a bit of hope that he might stay long term too. If we get top 4 and next season are challenging for trophies again, then I can't see him leaving. Ronaldo is going to be declining soonish at Madrid and so they'll inevitably get a lot worse when that happens, and with us spending big, it could be that we will be at their level quality wise relatively soon. All things to consider for De Gea, with him being an Atleti fan as well. Wishful thinking perhaps, and if we miss out on top 4 then he'll probably leave, but there's definitely hope for us I think.
Yeah... De Gea has it in him to be up there with the best goalkeepers ever IMO.

3263~~~
I'm starting to see De Gea at United for the long term too.

Calling these things early in one's career is always tricky business, but I really do believe De Gea can not only be up there with best of all time, but to be eventually regarded as the best of all time.  De Gea's shot-stopping technique and footwork is simply unbelievable, unequaled in the game today.  The save on Mata's free kick.  The foot save on Coentrao.  The countless saves we pretty much take for granted now.  

What De Gea does not have have yet is big game experience -- no cup finals, no CL semifinals, obviously no World Cup finals yet -- but when we get there and Spain comes back with a strong performance in the World Cup De Gea will get his unforgettable moments viewed by hundreds of millions of viewers around the world and then we'll start to read comparisons to Yashin, Zoff and Schmikes.  Only time will tell whether he'll put in those incredible performances in those massive cup finals, but I actually have no doubt that he will.

Brilliant buy by Ferguson.

3264~~~
Such a huge influence behind the back 4, I thought he was unlucky on the goal.

3265~~~
Bit disappointed with the goal, but he was good otherwise. Calm and composed, Madrid can feck off <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3266~~~
Should have saved it, no doubt.

Still our poty mind.

3267~~~
Would have forgiven him for battering Skrtl... cnut deserved it.

3268~~~
He said the shot deviated so he couldn't save it. 

He barely did anything in the first half.

3269~~~
Poor for the goal but its alright after what he's done for us all season. Hope he's not hurt.

3270~~~
One of the commentators seemed to reckon that there was a slight deflection on Sterling's goal. Is this true?

3271~~~
Came off Jones's studs according to Neville.

3272~~~
Should have saved the goal but his kicking was insane today, almost every single kick was perfect

3273~~~
Should have done better with their goal.  Possibly the first time I've thought that with DDG though.
I can handle that <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3274~~~
I was about to go ballistic about de Gea but then I heard the commentator mention that it was a slight deflection - so fair enough. 

Otherwise he was bloody brilliant again, such a calm outlet whenever passing it back was needed and he was also quickly of his line which is something he has greatly improved at.

3275~~~
Please stay David!

3276~~~
There was no deflection on Sterling's goal.

3277~~~
He did well not to retaliate to that muppet Skrtel.

3278~~~
Poor with the goal. The deflection was minimal (if at all, I couldn't really see much of one), so he ought to have gotten a hand to it at least. Kicking was brilliant though, at one point he charged out of goal to sweep up and hita first time ball about 60 yards to Fellaini's chest. If that was deliberate, it was one of the best passes of the game.

3279~~~
Ok now im convinced there was a deflection. Not a good angle but its easy to make out from De Gea's body language. Also if you import it to an editing tool like photoshop you can see trace the trajectory by marking a point on the ball every frame and then joining them. Keep in mind the camera is also moving every frame so put that into your calculations. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i57.tinypic.com/11jyond.jpg" src="http://i57.tinypic.com/11jyond.jpg"/>

3280~~~
Deflection or no deflection, DDG is untouchable after all of those stellar performances he's put in for us this season. Any goalkeeper will make an error or two in the course of a season.

3281~~~
It was an obvious deflection.

3282~~~
Deflection or not, we should have handled that period much better. We were far too complacent, and should have looked to completely kill the game and any confidence Liverpool had of a recovery.

3283~~~
Still a bit of a mistake for his standards though, even though it did have a deflection. You'd still expect him to save it. 

Courtois and Neuer though... Awful

3284~~~
Definitely - he's entitled to a mistake or two for the season he's had though! 

<span style="color: #ffffff">Just sign the bloody contract</span>

3285~~~
All great keepers make mistakes every now and then. De Gea's distribution in particular today however, was top class.

3286~~~
apart that front post weaker effort, his distribution was fantastic, you know he will find the chest of Fellaini and we can start the attack from there, and also his sweeping got better. Hope he stays here forever. Give him 300k per week ffs.

3287~~~
I don't think it was a 'mistake'. It was a deflection from such close range, which pushed it away from De Gea, and not towards him. Not completely unsaveable but very difficult. he'd have to have been anticipating the deflection, which he clearly wasn't. If he's saving that, then it's miraculous, as many of his saves has been. Perhaps our expectations of him are so high that we're expecting him to save everything.

He's improved at coming off his line, which was one of the weakest parts of his game. His starting position and his alertness to danger were on point today. And his passing and clearances were all superb, even when pressed. 

Recently we had a stat (which appeared to be used as criticism) that said we go back to the keeper more than anyone. But if your goalkeeper is such a great distributor of the ball and comfortable being involved in the buildup from the back, then why wouldn't you utilise that? 

We've had some bizarre criticism this year. De Gea making too many saves, and now De Gea making too many passes. Next it will be Mata scoring too many goals. Too reliant on Herrera making passes. Alternative league table if all teams had no Spaniards etc.

3288~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Schweinsteiger's facepalm in the bottom left corner.

3289~~~
Wasn't great for their goal but considering what he has done I think it can slide. How good was his distribution though?

3290~~~
I'm hoping the reason behind the delay on his contract is to wait and see if we get in the top four.

3291~~~
He plays with such a swagger and authority these days. It's amazing how much he has grown in terms of stature. He is so calm and confident. Knows when to hold onto the ball to take the sting out of the game for a bit when Liverpool were having one of their rare better moments. He calmed things down. At one point, under pressure he looked like he was making a rushed clearance but it was actually a precise accurate pass to Fellaini's feet. It's impossible to ruffle his feathers atm. 

People were criticising him earlier in the season for not being quick enough off his line but yesterday he did it perfectly 4 or 5 times. He was always there to snuff out any danger.

I'm still hopeful of that contract although I do wonder what he is waiting for.

3292~~~
Those massive flags behind the goal would drive me mad. They don't even stop when the goal goes in.

3293~~~
His shirt it's the 4th most sold shirt this season! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> When was the last time a GK was in top 10 or anywhere close?

3294~~~
I'd never bothered getting a goalkeeper jersey before but last season I got the green goalkeeper jersey with his name on the back. He's my favourite current United player by some distance. I'm still surprised to see him ahead of the likes of Falcao and Rooney though.

3295~~~
And Neuer trying to salvage it at the end hoping no one would notice <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Hasn't changed at all from 5 years ago.

3296~~~
Why? Rooney is the most iconic player at the club and Falcao was a former world class striker who may not (probably not now) have another season with us. Love how 5 of the top 10 are United players though, prestige.

3297~~~
That's as good a reason as any to pay him whatever he wants. Those sales will rise even higher if he signs a new contract.

3298~~~
He will no doubt sell even more next season, with the Adidas GK kits being generally more "wearable"(is that even a word?) than the Nike ones. Also, if we don't sign some Adidas superstar before the new kit will be announced he will almost certainly be the one to take Rooney's place as the clubs poster boy.

3299~~~
Isn't that more reason to get his name on the back of your jersey? It's only really become apparent since Christmas that Falcao is unlikely to stay. I would have thought before then that plenty of jerseys would be sold with his name on them. Even now you constantly hear his name being sung at games so he is still really popular with the fans.

3300~~~
The song is more popular than the player, IMHO.

3301~~~
That's exactly what it is, I misread your post haha.

3302~~~
Ya that could be the case.

You had me confused there for a while! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3304~~~
Completely agree regarding the CL qualification!

3305~~~
Going through this thread, I had to laugh at this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

A lot of people were very critical of him early in the season when a lot of goals were flying past him.

3306~~~
hopefully he concedes 4 or 5 soft goals tonight an accidentally wees on a real madrid flag.

3307~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Does Perez have a wife, who might be carrying a handbag, by any chance?

3308~~~
I heard both goals where totally his fault and Marca are having a field day... Yup that's exactly what's happening <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3309~~~
His ability to catch the ball, rather then palm it away, is quite something. See his first save tonight...Most, even top keepers, would be pushing that away. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DrSBF1uDso?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3310~~~
Did you expect people to praise him when he wasn't playing very well?

3311~~~
People were criticising him for not saving pens, for not stopping shots in the top corner and wanted him dropped. 

You need to read back the thread, mate. Was a fecking joke.

3312~~~
That sort of criticism is unfair, fair enough if you are talking about that.

3313~~~
Is he 6'4? That surprises me. He doesn't look that tall but maybe my perception is skewed for some reason.

3314~~~
He looked a shade taller than Skrtel when they squared up, so 6'4" is about right.

3315~~~
He was barely 5'9'' when we first signed him!

3316~~~
Considering the shooter and the keeper, this might as well be a United training session video 2015-16

3317~~~
2 cheap goals in 2 games, come on Dave.

3318~~~
Seems to be having a dip in form ATM.

3319~~~
De Gea would've saved that

3320~~~
All part of the master plan to make Madrid look elsewhere.

3321~~~
Get your shit together..  Just terrible

3322~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3323~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3324~~~
he's minds clearly in madrid. 

sell him now

3325~~~
Uncharacteristic mistake, obviously should have saved it.

3326~~~
Seemed like he couldn't make up his mind about how to stop it with his legs. Just a bad technique.

3327~~~
Just what I thought! Well played Dave!

3328~~~
Long due an error, about time we bailed him out after what he's done this season.

3329~~~
He is doing the Taibi in the last two games

I think it's a lack of concentration when he is not involved in many saves during the game

3330~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3331~~~
Wasn't set for it at all. But given the points he's saved by himself this season, I couldn't give a monkeys.

Still a beautiful man.

3332~~~
He is always like this Mr. Perez, honest.

3333~~~
Conceded 2 cheap goals in his past 2 games. We've won both so not an issue, but hoping he picks up his form for City and Chelsea.

3334~~~
Agent Dave! <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

At Liverpool it was a deflection though. No arguments for the Benteke goal, it was crap.

3335~~~
Meh, it was a howler but whatever. He's more than earned the right to have one overlooked.

3336~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


Nah the one against 'pool was a deflection right in front of him, nothing he could have done there.

3337~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'll reluctantly allow him one poor game per season. As long as it's always against shite opposition that we beat anyway.

3338~~~
Uncharacteristic mistake by De Gea. No doubt he'll be back on it against Citeh.

3339~~~
A deflection but not a huge one. For a keeper of his class, I expect him to do better. I would call today's a howler and the Liverpool one a goal where he could do more.

3340~~~
Don't really blame him. He has saved our asses on multiple counts that he can be allowed to make such mistakes, especially when we are winning the matches. He is human, after all.

3341~~~
It's good that we can joke about this, could have ended up looking far worse.

Sort it out David, we need you in top form for City and Chelsea!

3342~~~
Happens when you barely have to do anything in a game. He'll be alright.

3343~~~
De Gea: I wonder what the weather in Madrid is like...... corner.....

I wonder what my girlfriend is doi... SHIT.

3344~~~
well, if anything, it takes him down a peg or two which isn't a bad thing. The self belief  and therefore worth has been fuelled no doubt by his agent. He's in a team that I believe is going to be very very good, it seems daft to me to consider leaving at the moment, especially considering the mess Real are in. Unless of course..his gf wants to get out of Manchester....now that is another story.

3345~~~
Much rather the error happen then compared to it costing us in a game.

3346~~~
True on all accounts there.  
He'd be silly to not at least give us another season given whats happening at Madrid.  I mean, they're not gonna stop being a force but theres a huge risk he won't be very happy there.

3347~~~
Not De Gea's fault. Er... It took a deflec... The defender blocked his vis.... The sun was in his eyes!

3348~~~
Actually made a mistake.  He has earned that right...

3349~~~
Way past his best, gloves and reflexes have gone, Real Madrid need to go after Courtois.....

3350~~~
He's done a Neuer. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3351~~~
Genuine mistake, didnt cost us. Nothing like the Liverpool goal which he had until the deflection took it past him. Time for him to move on and be relatively quiet next week as we just attack City <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3352~~~
Clearly a level below Courtious after today!

<span style="color: #ffffff">Now you know how it feels!</span>

3353~~~
He's bloody useless why would Real Madrid sign him <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>.

3354~~~
Must have fallen asleep with the lack of action he saw today! 

Uncharacteristic of him, but that stuff will happen every once in a blue moon. Was good otherwise.

3355~~~
Clearly caught it off Casillas during the international break

3356~~~
Two games in a row.  Dont know whats funny..  Easy shot terrible blunder.

3357~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3358~~~
I feel like I have nerve after what he's done for us but this is two games now.  I think he should've done much better for Sturridge's goal and this one today...well...

3359~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You're cursed.

3360~~~
To be fair my post was a joke. Not exactly a  courtious error though he had nothing to do.. noone would've expected that.

3361~~~
He's rubbish. Madrid should stay well clear.

3362~~~
Wonder why he didn't use his feet? It's one of his main strengths.

3363~~~
Nice to see he's still human afterall.

3364~~~
Awful today...any team looking for a new keeper would be wise to look else where.

3365~~~
2 mistakes in 2 games. Just got confused it seems. Hope Madrid are watching. They should go for a better keeper than our Dave.

3366~~~
either way he didn't get lobbed from the halfway line.

3367~~~
He was a bit average (not poor, but not particularly good) for the first month or so of the season, but he's been amazing since then. Just a couple of signs he may have come off the boil a little in his last two or three games though, so hopefully that doesn't cost us.

3368~~~
I think he was caught in two minds there - whether to use his hand or feet. Hence the mistake and him completely missing the ball.

3369~~~
What was the other mistake?

3370~~~
Sturridge's goal was definitely his fault. Mind you I heard he had a poor game against Holland too.

3371~~~
It was a deflection. All keepers (just look at VDS) look like fools when the ball gets deflected near him. It wasn't a mistake at all.

The game Spain-Holland:

Not his fault that Spain's defenders are donkeys.

3372~~~
Mistake for their goal today, but he's allowed one by now! Also, didn't cost us.

Real: Look, he's shite. You should stay well clear.

3373~~~
I didn't see the Spain game, but the Sturridge goal is hard to blame on anyone, barring perhaps Carrick, who gave the ball away which led to the goal. It was deflected, and from such close range as well. Our expectations of De Gea are probably a little inflated considering some of the impossible saves he has made in the last few years, but deflections make goalkeepers look daft all the time, against their control. Goalkeepers read the striker from the way he looks at the ball, the way he opens his foot up to strike the ball, and you set yourself based on that, especially if the striker is only 8 yards out. A deflection completely ruins that. Harsh to blame De Gea for it.

Today was definitely his fault though. Perhaps lack of concentration, or perhaps expected Benteke to go high and belt it towards the top corner so he's gone over the ball. Poor either way.

3374~~~
He has set such a high bar for himself that when he makes some debatable 'mistakes' some are calling him out for it. We've seen over the past few weeks that Courtois has made just as many mistakes, if not more. Similarly, Neuer is also prone to the odd gaff. It happens.

De Gea is no less world class than he was earlier in the season.

3375~~~
No one should be immune to criticism when they make clear mistakes even if they are world class.

3376~~~
Definitely his mistake. That's two games in a row now where he has made an error (yes I know, deflection for the Sturridge one but he could have done better). It's not as bad because we are winning matches comfortably, but with City and Chelsea coming up it would be good to see him at his best again.

3377~~~
A "Not really a mistake but he should have saved Sturridge's shot", Casillas clean-sheet against Ukraine, De Gea has conceded two goals against the Netherlands and his mistake today is hopefully enough that Perez thinks not anymore about to sign him.

3378~~~
Do not want.

3379~~~
I hope Real feel the same way as you.

3380~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s2.postimg.org/89g7v7thl/Capture.png" src="http://s2.postimg.org/89g7v7thl/Capture.png"/></a>

FW to <a href="mailto:fiorentinop@realmadrid.org">fiorentinop@realmadrid.org</a> from a disgruntled fan.

3381~~~
His first mistake of the season in the league.

3382~~~
Not true, had some mistakes at the start of the season. Some very poor kicks and throws and coming off your line poorly are mistakes too.

3383~~~
Meant mistakes on goal.

3384~~~
In his last 3 games against Tottenham, Liverpool and Villa he has faced a a total of 16 shots, with only 4 being on target. For contrast, in the reverse fixtures around Christmas he faced 38 shots and 17 required saves.

Our general improvement has seen him with less to do and i think his concentration is probably suffering. Hopefully enough for Madrid to think theyre better off without him.

3385~~~
But that's somewhat surprising. Up until now, he's been a keeper that was able to maintain very high concentration levels, even in a game where he wouldn't be called into action til the 85th minute. That was another impressive trait of his.

Don't think the Liverpool one was a mistake at all, given how close it was and the speed on it, but yesterday was really bad. If that's his mistake of the season, then I'll take it.

3386~~~
Made a mistake. It happens.

3387~~~
How can anyone in their right minds can blame DDG for these goals? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3388~~~
Not a player in Prem that doesn't make mistakes every game, and all the high profile goal keepers have made mistakes over the last few weeks. I think it's a long season and he probably could have done with a break but didn't get one. Still best keeper in the world and hopefully will still be here next season. I get the feeling that he won't.

3389~~~
Can't see how the goal against Liverpool can be called an error. It took a deflection which obviously threw him off. Maybe he could have done better but it certainly wasn't a mistake.

3390~~~
Very much how I saw it. Naturally used to use his feet a lot. Generally looks to have been working on catching/retaining rather than parrying away. On this occasion the change from feet to hands was too great and that slight change from his old instinct made him less effective.
In LVG's terms he has made it to unconscious-correct for all hand-directed balls. Still maybe on the route from conscious-correct in that situation.

3391~~~
Was due a Blunder. It was also an awkward shot and didnt cost us. Not as good as VDS when it comes to kicking though.

Still the best around.

3392~~~
I saw him shielding his eyes from the sun a few times in that second half so that could have contributed to the goal, he should have saved it though. The Sterling one was deflected but he gave up too much space at the nearpost regardless. They haven't cost us though so it doesn't matter, he could make a mistake in all our remaining games and still be the player of the year by a mile.

3393~~~
Just curious but given that hes a Atletico fan (and ex-player) do you think a move to Real would interest him? Also doesnt his girlfriend live in Barcelona?

3394~~~
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">EDIT: Jesus christ I don't know how to reduce the size of the text, can a mod fix for me?</span></b>

Just thought I would remind every one of this gem:


<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>New boy David De Gea will keep making mistakes</b>

<b><span style="font-size: 15px"><b>IF anyone has ordered a replica Manchester United goalkeeper’s shirt with David De Gea ’s name on the back, I’d advise ringing up and cancelling it.</b></span></b></span>
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>By <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/search/Mick+Dennis?s=Mick+Dennis&amp;b=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MICK DENNIS</a></b>
</span>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>If the shirt was going to have David De Gea's full name on, the shop staff probably haven’t finished sticking the letters on yet anyway.</b>

<b>He’s called David de Gea Quintana. But don’t bother learning all those names. There will be another chap along soon. There has to be.</b>

<b>Sir Alex Ferguson tried 10 goalkeepers between the time Peter Schmeichel left Manchester United in 1999 and Edvin van der Sar’s arrival in 2005.</b>

<b>Now, with Van der Sar retired, it seems inevitable another long search for a reliable replacement will take place.</b>

<b>De Gea, 20, cost more than £18million from Atletico Madrid and was obviously supposed to be van der Sar’s successor, but the young Spaniard’s two appearances so far have been calamitous.</b>

<b>In the Community Shield at Wembley he was culpable for one Manchester City goal and not without blame for the other. Fergie promised: “He won’t do that sort of thing again.”</b>

<b>But he did. Yesterday. Now Fergie is reminding us all that Schmeichel had a dodgy start to his United career, but privately he must be worried silly about De Gea.</b>

<b>The kid’s lack of authority in the six-yard box is even less convincing than his beard and every watching Premier League manager will have noted how easily he was put under pressure.</b>

<b>All game he flapped gormlessly at balls he should have caught. And he had already been nudged away from the ball at a corner far too easily by West Brom’s Jonas Olsson and had also over-dramatised a save from Paul Scharner when he produced his miss of the day.</b>

<b>That was after 37 minutes when he made a complete mess of what should have been the routine matter of dealing with Shane Long’s ordinary shot from the left.</b>

<b>There is an old football expression about slow goalkeepers going down in instalments. De Gea went down in one movement, but it was funereally slow and the ball scooted under his arms as he let down United by letting himself down on to the pitch so leadenly.</b>

<b>At the other end, Ben Foster knew exactly how De Gea felt. Once United’s great young goalkeeping hope, Foster thrived on a variety of loans, but had only 12 games at United before being discarded permanently. Now 28, he has downgraded his ambitions so much he announced in May he no longer wishes to be considered for England.</b>

<b>His season-long loan at Albion from relegated Birmingham will surely not pitch him against anyone better than Wayne Rooney, who was imperious yesterday.</b>

<b>So, assuming the injury suffered by Rio Ferdinand does not prevent England qualifying for Euro 2012, we face another 10 months of hoping Rooney can maintain his form and fitness until his country needs him in a major tournament.</b>

<b>Much of Rooney’s ability resides in his expensively re-thatched bonce. He computes probabilities and possibilities so much more rapidly than those around him. De Gea, meanwhile, looks as if his nerves have been shredded by his blunders.</b>


</span>

3395~~~
You should also post that Mick Dennis piece in the Luke Shaw thread.

3396~~~
Have they opened the voting for the Matt Busby Player of the Season yet?
De Gea must be a shoe-in for this.

3397~~~
If De Gea manage to again work miracles in keeping out both city and Chelsea then he has to be EPL player of the year. I don't think anyone in the league has put on that many Godlike performance this season, where close contenders of Sanchez and Costa have been injury-blighted and some dip in form.

The clip of De Gea saves here shows why, not even debatable:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2015/Mar/Video-David-De-Gea-best-saves-from-2014-15-season.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...id-De-Gea-best-saves-from-2014-15-season.aspx</a>

3398~~~
Neuer-esque first-half. Such an asset to have a positionally sound keeper.

3399~~~
Still can't my head around this DDG plus cash for Bale. Really?

3400~~~
His ball control is quite outrageous for a GK.

3401~~~
Plenty to do so far!  Mostly with his feet.


Had some ridiculous overhit balls to contend with too.

3402~~~
He's done well so far considering how many dodgy back passes he's been forced to deal with.

3403~~~
Playing a brilliant match so far.

Irreplaceable if he goes

3404~~~
Thought he actually did quite well today despite the 2 goals.

3405~~~
Still almost managed to save that 2nd one.

3406~~~
Would've been an outrageous save. 

Good game overall in the sweeper role he's getting very good at. Enables us to play a higher defensive line and press better.

3407~~~
True. His defence weren't helping him, but he coped very well. He's so much more composed in general than he was when he first came here.

3408~~~
As RAWK would say. Great assist of the assist from Big Dave

3409~~~
His sweeping has gone from being a bit poor tbh to fantastic. He's adding new facets to his game all the time.

3410~~~
I dunno if he should've kept Agueros second out. But Souness has a point, he flew under the radar today. I really should've rated him higher in the post game.

3411~~~
Come to the conclusion that we just cannot replace him... Only Courtois and Neuer can compete with this guy

3412~~~
His anticipation and timing to come out off his box is Neuer-esque. Prevented some dangerous 'ball behind defence'. As other said, where can you get another Gk like him (that realistically available)?

3413~~~
It would have been a disgustingly good save if he'd kept that out, right up there with that Torres one that was behind him and he got a full hand on.

3414~~~
Boss at the back, Real can keep their offerings of Welsh Wingers and French CB's.

3415~~~
Surely that was Fellaini though. Shouldered it to Herrera who got the real assist.

De Gea got the assist of the assist of the assist.

Assistception.

3416~~~
He would be a fool to leave this team now, with the re-building in the summer. A total fool.

3417~~~
If securing top 4 results in him signing a 5 year deal it'll be just as big a result as being in the CL.

3418~~~
Those backpasses are killing my nerves, but Tall Dave never lets us down. I went from "What the shit is that pass" to "Holy shit we scored" in 30 seconds. He's so good in positioning lately, shame he could not save the second goal, but I won't hold it against him.

3419~~~
Yeah him signing will arguably be the biggest transfer coup we'll make this summer.

3420~~~
Agreed. And I'm still hoping that's the only reason for his hesitation in signing (which would've been fair enough).

I also think we're not far off being able to fend off Real Madrid, the way the two leagues are going financially.

3421~~~
can't see him going he loves it here, we are finally winning the toughest games, why he should go to Madrid where everyone will boo at him.. We are going for the title next season.. and champions league possibly if we manage to add right players. I am sure De Gea will be up to the challenge and he will be better paid here I guess

3422~~~
Yes I'm hoping that's the main reason why he hasn't signed a new deal, it's just that he wants to playing Champions League football next season.

3423~~~
He needs to ditch that Spanish bird and hook up with a local lass.

3424~~~
He's staying. The passion he showed at the end was of someone who loves where he is. Sign him up ed!

3425~~~
There's no one on the Earth i would swap DDG for let alone Gareth fecking Bale. I just hope securing CL football will result in a contract extension. That would be massive.

3426~~~
He loves us!

3427~~~
David de Rojo

3428~~~
Please stay David.

3429~~~
Should have saved the second goal, not good enough for Madrid......


Anyway, love him. Was always confident he would save Navas one on one attempt (total opposite to Mata).

3430~~~
His kicking has improved leaps and bounds, he's quick off the line and his starting position is much better!

I feel like he's doing well with the Hoek and learning from Valdes also.

3431~~~
He's ice cold and so composed when coming off the line to clear or collect the ball.

3432~~~
Surely, he's staying?

3433~~~
He was sweeping today really well, more than I ever remember him doing. It's something I've always been a bit unsure about as he usually likes to stick on his line, but credit to him he saved 2 possible goals by being alert. If he can get Neuer style sweeping to his game he will be unbreakable!

3434~~~
If he stays here for a long time he could not only become the clubs best ever goalkeeper but also a genuine United legend.

3435~~~
The way he celebrated those goals was fantastic <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>
He obviously loves us but has a decision to make in regards to moving to Madrid. Hope he stays a few more seasons with us.

3436~~~
Ronaldo loved us when he left though. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3437~~~
I thought he had saved that second goal! Would have been absolutely outrageous if he had. Was very good I thought. Don't care about this Bale and cash deal or whatever, Madrid can stick Bale. I wouldn't give up Dave for anything.

3438~~~
I hope Casillas plays a blinder from now until the end of the season.

3439~~~
Clearly the best keeper in the world. He's developed from this agile little guy with good reflexes to this monumental figure at the back for us. His passing stats must be in a league of it's own for a keeper. His decision making with rushing out combined with his athletic ability to actually pull it off is also a class of it's own. The fact that he almost saved Aguero's goal today blew my mind. I'm really trying hard to figure a flaw to his game at this point in time and I have nothing. I can't say that about any player in their respective positions except for Messi.

3440~~~
Please stay David <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3441~~~
Yes, it always annoyed me that he stayed so far back and never came out of the area for long balls. I thought about posting about it on here a lot of times, but I don't think I ever actually did it. Great to see that he's added that to his game now. I was a bit sceptic at the start of the season with him getting <i>another</i> GK coach, but Hoek is a genius.

3442~~~
We played well yesterday but I think the game would have ended very differently without de Gea. Huge difference to the jumping jack in the other end.

3443~~~
We need to get him tied down to a long term new deal ASAP.

3444~~~
Yeah, agreed. So many facets of his game have dramatically improved this season. Huge credit to the coaching team. I also wonder if Valdes can take some props for what we saw yesterday. He's always been an excellent sweeper keeper and must be giving De Gea a lot of advice/support too.

3445~~~
Showed some great awareness off the line yesterday.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/ddg9wsxw.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/ddg9wsxw.gif"/>

3446~~~
Easily one of my favorite players here now. I just hope he realizes that if he stays he can rack up almost 1000 appearances and enter the pantheon of Manchester United legends. For God sake, someone bring up the subject of breaking Giggs' record during an interview with him!

3447~~~
Need to keep him. Goalkeeper is a hard position to nail down especially long term, with somebody as talented as him. Going forward, its really imperative we do everything we can to keep him and keep him happy whilst doing that.

3448~~~
Exactly the same as me. I never criticised him for it because he made up for it in other areas, but he's beginning to become a 100% complete goalkeeper; does he actually have any weaknesses nowadays?

3449~~~
I think you're right regarding Valdes. I'm sure he's taught DDG a thing or two in training and from the outside they seem to have a good relationship.
He can still improve on crosses, but it's not really an issue any longer and not everyone can be like Schmeichel. Even VDS had issues with crosses now and then. So no, I don't think DDG has any real weaknesses these days.

3450~~~
The most worrying weakness is his fondness for his Spanish missus!

3451~~~
Why can't he be like Herrera and only have eyes for Mata?

3452~~~
A pretty cool De Gea video I found from just looking around on YouTube. Apologies if this has been posted already. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujUuG7qkuNg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3453~~~
Against City was the first time I have seen him be dominant of the line. We needed to be like a sweeper keeper last week and he did exactly that. I think his judgement to come out of his line is his biggest weakness.

3454~~~
Keeping De Gea for next season would be amazing. I can only see him leaving for Madrid though.

3455~~~
Hopefully Ancelotti's comments about Casillas are genuine and he is looking to stay on at RM. That can only be good for us.

3456~~~
Could be that they've recieved word that David isn't intersted in moving any more and they need to keep Iker sweet now.

3457~~~
Nominated for PFA players' player of the year and PFA young player of the year. Well deserved.

3458~~~
That's fantastic news and thoroughly deserved too. I'd have him in my top three for player of the year for sure.

3459~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3460~~~
Special mention to Jonny Evans surely?

3461~~~
Assuming we continue to play this well next season, or hopefully even better, it'll be interesting to see if he receives the same accolades. He obviously won't be anything like as busy between the sticks, so I doubt it.

3462~~~
I would feel both happy for him and uneasy if he were to win both awards given where a couple of those double-winners ended up.

3463~~~
That really was a great video and makes me want us to sign him a bit now. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3464~~~
Because once you've had twat, you just can't go knob.

<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3465~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> no! You stay away!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> brilliant.

3466~~~
I have always felt that De Gea would stay however with Falcao staying on tonight, I have to wonder if Jorge Mendes is pulling some strings with regards to De Gea's contract and kind of forcing LvG to play Falcao even though Falcao isn't really our best striker.

I would like to think De Gea will be here next season but if Falcao doesn't play the rest of the seasons games then I will start to believe that De Gea will not be here next season.

*inappropriate content removed by modmin*

3467~~~
With RvP not coming on I think it's just a case of him not being fit enough yet so LvG wasn't going to risk him unless he was forced to.

3468~~~
I understand RvP not starting the game due to fitness but I don't know, even for just 15 minutes, I am sure RvP would have lasted 15 minutes. I just see it as Mendes forcing LvG to play Falcao so that his player looks good for his next club(if he gets sold). I hope LvG doesn't play him though but have to wonder if Mendes might try force the Real sale then.

As I said, I would like to believe De Gea will stay, what ever happens.

3469~~~
Meh. I want conspiracy. Mendez forced Van Gaal to force Falcao, otherwise he would sell De Gea to Madrid.

3470~~~
Anyway, I thought De Gea did good. Pity about the goal but he played well and cleared at some stage in the first half with a fist while having about 5 players around him. His handball just outside the area was a bit shocking though, but he got away with it.

3471~~~
Yeah, I can totally see LVG being forced to play Falcao after being hit with 4 injuries during the week. Just look at how undroppable Falcao has been all season. 

Mendes represents McNair, Shaw and Blackett, too, right?

3472~~~
Can anyone post the full article?

3473~~~

3474~~~
Today's performance only makes me even more certain the reports from AS have some substance to it. Piss poor from Dave today although he wasn't the only one.

3475~~~
He's been awful for a few weeks going back to Liverpool away.

3476~~~
One through the legs (again) and the third goal may as well have been an empty fecking net.

3477~~~
The space he left for the 3rd goal was huge. He's still one of our best players this season, but he still makes silly mistakes.

3478~~~
Away with the fairies...

3479~~~
Head is in Madrid.

3480~~~
You're all nuts

3481~~~
Yeah it seems like he's gone back to the form right at the start where you can't blame him directly but it's not taking much to beat him.

3482~~~
He really, really, has not been awful.

3483~~~
I think it's a bit unfair to blame him for the 3rd goal (or any goal from today really) he was hardly going to predict the whole defence to stop moving. He was slow off his line twice other than that he did nothing wrong. Seems odd to criticise him today really.

3484~~~
Aye which makes comments like it would only take a Neuer or a Courtois to be able to replace him a bit of a mockery.

3485~~~
Hard to lay a lot of blame on him, but no doubt he could have done better. Obviously you wonder how focused he is at the moment.

3486~~~
Head's in Madrid. Didn't look too bothered today. Great save at the end against Mirallas though.

3487~~~
Completely static today, bad game from him

3488~~~
Shit today, was not being decisive and should have done better for at least the third goal.

3489~~~
De Gea wasn't the cause of our result today, but has to be the worst performance I have seen from him in a long time. Just looked like he didn't care - terrible positioning for their third goal, and didn't come for the ball a couple of times.

3490~~~
Really unprofessional performance

3491~~~
Sooner he fecks off the better, it's becoming a soap opera now and it's starting to effect he's performances.

3492~~~
I think he forgot that he's allowed out the box...

3493~~~
Send him to Madrid today if he's not arsed. Can't be bothered with that kind of attitude - the season's not over yet.

3494~~~
And if we look at the rest of the team, 7 or 8 of the players also looked like they didn't care and have their heads in madrid as well.... jesus

The whole team had a bad day out, simple as that for me.

3495~~~
Probably sat at the back today mentally perusing Madrid real-estate when he was supposed to be coming to collect the ball.

3496~~~
Who cares if he's in team of the year really. I'm getting fed up with this contract nonsense now, where's the loyalty? Us fans backed him to come good when he struggled initially and now he's come good he wants to bugger off. He was so indecisive today putting his team mates under pressure I think the speculation could be affecting him.

3497~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3498~~~
Are we really going to give him shit now after that AS article?

3499~~~
He was poor today, no two ways about it.

3500~~~
On a more positive note, De Gea was named to the PFA team of the year for the second time in his career (first one in 2012/ 2013).

Van der Sar was named to the team thrice and Petr Cech twice in over a decade at Chelsea, so it's kind of big accomplishment for David considering the fact that he's still just 24 years old. Hopefully he pisses on the Madrid talk, stays put for the long haul, and is further selected for a bunch of these. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3501~~~
Very insightful post. 

Care to tell me where I'm wrong? The guy in recent weeks haa conceded poor goals, is making half hearted decisions and still hasn't revealed what he's plans are.

3502~~~
What do you expect him to do? Tell everyone what he's thinking?

3503~~~
That is called considering his options, and (perhaps) getting distracted. He does not come out and say LVG is shite, RM is the best, etc. Hardly soap opera.

3504~~~
Knee-jerk overreaction right there. He has been our best player this season FFS!

3505~~~
He's been very poor at coming off his line for a long time. In recent weeks, it looked like he had sharpened up that side of his game as his starting positions have been great in the games against Spurs, City and Liverpool when the ball has gone in behind the defence, but he was glued to his line on a number of occasions, with defenders screaming at him to claim the ball, which has been common in his time here. He needs to keep working on that.

I still don't want us to lose him. Pulled off a typical DDG save from Mirallas in the 2nd half, but we were torn apart on the counter. Not a great day for him, but he's still on another level to all but 2 other goalkeepers in the world.

3506~~~
In  perfect world yes. The club want to keep him, the manager has confirmed we've offered him a large contract whilst we hear reports he has rejected it and wants to leave. If he wanted to stay he'd have quashed these rumors by now but he hasn't. Today was the first time it looked like he's head was in a different place.

3507~~~
So we should just be cool with him playing like he'd rather be somewhere else?

3508~~~
I don't know what people expect him to do when they are 1vs1 against him or in the case of the last goal 2vs1. 

Maybe people should blame the defenders.

3509~~~
Shit positioning for the third goal, but other than that there was nothing he could have done better. 

Looks like some feckers here are going overboard over some shit article from AS...

3510~~~
Since when do players clue everyone in on what they're thinking?

3511~~~
No, of course not. But we don't know that that is the reason he was poor. To say the sooner he leaves the better is just short sighted I think.

3512~~~
Seems a bit off, though I wouldnt really blame him for any of the goals. Seemed more undecisive then in recent games, failing to come out to sweep up the throughballs and generally didnt seem to trust McNair for some reason.

3513~~~
He's been ok-ish of late. Poor positioning today

3514~~~
You've decided that the keeper that's won us countless games this season should feck off based on overreacting to a performance in which 11 players were dogshit.

Interpretation of goalkeeping performances has a lot to do with hindsight. During a goal in which the defence has left Everton basically 2 on 1 with the keeper, I find it difficult to fault him there, his approach to that isn't majorly different from the way he went about saving one on ones versus Hazard and Wilshere, and in this one Mirallas had the Lukaku square ball on. The first goal is just a case of you win some, you lose some - absolutely no fault there.

So his head being in Madrid comes down to not coming off his line one or two times, something which he's been guilty of long before Madrid came into the equation.

3515~~~
They generally don't but when a saga like this starts to effect performances when we still have plenty to do to get a top four place it doesn't bode well.

Same as above, we need all our players fully focused on the task at hand otherwise we could shot ourselves in the foot in regards to top four. Today it looked as if he's mind was elsewhere.

3516~~~
Was he awful against Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Chelsea? 

This is nonsense. People need to be a bit more rational. Today's performance was similar to his performances at the start of the season. One good save, but his performance was filled with tentative steps. He's obviously worked on his positioning (his sweeping has significantly improved), but people need to accept that these performances happen.

3517~~~
Quality post.

3518~~~
I've decided that he should feck off because it's rather obvious it's what he wants and I have no time for player who don't want to play for this club.

In recent weeks he has conceded goals that he wouldn't have earlier in the season. He's decision making has been half hearted at times as well recently.

He of course wasn't the sole reason we lost today, we were pathetic all over the field. The first goal as you mentioned was one of those where you either save it or you don't, the margins are that tight. He's starting position for the second goal was poor and as for the third, whilst again it was a definsive howler, it looked as if he just gave up and offered the guy the whole of he's near post.

3519~~~
Thanks.

3520~~~
Nah, it was fecking terrible and really quite thick.

3521~~~
This simply isn't true. He was making the same mistakes earlier on in the season.

3522~~~
Again, thanks boss.

3523~~~
The body language experts are out in full force again it seems. I do think he was poor, but its ridiculous to say he played poor because he's off to Madrid or vice versa, when in fact we don't know anything about the situation.

3524~~~
Sound. What I find particularly stupid is that his effort is half-hearted. The implication that as De Gea stands between the sticks, and players like Daniel Sturridge and Kevin Mirallas are bearing down on his goal, he isn't fully intent on saving their shots; instead semi-focused on his potential new life in Madrid. It's a rather impressive mental achievement considering the build up to a shot on goal takes no more than ten seconds of time.

Of course, we could be rational and just accept that he's let in a couple soft goals because that is what goalkeepers tend to do from time to time. Or maybe I'm off my rocker.

3525~~~
Half-hearted:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/ddg9wsxw.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/ddg9wsxw.gif"/>

3526~~~
Oh the drama here!

3527~~~
Agree with this.

Although I think the Liverpool goal was poor from him and he was definitely at fault for the Villa goal a few weeks ago.

3528~~~
It's not unfathomable that the whole saga could be affecting his form. It's quite close to decision making time and LvG put the heat on him in the last press conference by making everyone aware that he's been offered a lot of money and now it's up to him.

3529~~~
I didn't understand why he did come out on 2 occasions. McNair was right to be upset on the last one. Things like these undermine confidence between the defense and keeper.

3530~~~
I think he struggled with the sun today as he seemed even more nervous with his kicking too, not like him. He did have that eye problem a while ago so maybe he can't see that well, I know Smalling was having to use his hand to block the sun out while trying to win the headers.

3531~~~
You can't blame him for the first or second. If he stops McCarthy's shot in particular, everyone eulogises over what a great save it was. It speaks volumes about his level this season that people on here are giving him a hard time for it. Stones's he couldn't have done anything about.

But as a keeper myself, his positioning for the third was poor. He should have narrowed the angle down quicker and if he's going to show Mirallas a side of the goal, it should be across him, not towards the near post where the ball ended up.

3532~~~
He's shit, couldn't made two one on one saves and also conceded from a perfect header. Clearly his head isn't here.

3533~~~
Since the caf has decreed he's shit I'm suddenly a lot happier about losing him this summer.

Wise up.

3534~~~
It's got to be very difficult playing with different defenders in front of him on so many occasions. That has to impact his decision making (when it comes to charging out or not).

3535~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> nicely put.

3536~~~
There was nothing wrong on his decision making today. He probably would have made a save (on first or third goal) but you can't expect a keeper to compensate for an awful defense every match. Even on third goal it wasn't a bad defending, he had to ade the save but also not be very far from the other post where Lukaku was going.

It is knee-jerkism at its best on the Caf.

3537~~~
Back to the every decent shot from close range is goal form, heads in Madrid I guess. Could have done better for Sturridge, Hazard, Mirallas goals, with his form.earlier in the season, he'd even have Mccarthy's one.

3538~~~
All he needed after all, was some superhuman ability to save all those shots. Or some competent defenders.

3539~~~
Not neccesary saying he should have stopped those, but he looked beaten before the ball was even hit. He didnt need superhumam ability, he stopped these earlier in the season.

3540~~~
The usual debate when trying to analyse a GK's form. It's either "every shot is going in" or "how can you expect him to stop perfect finishes?". 

I think his form has definitely dropped. But that was to be expected considering his level earlier in the season was ridiculously high; you can't expect him to make match winning saves every week when he's only 24 with an uncertain summer ahead of him.

3541~~~
Same form as before.  Some shots just can't be saved.

3542~~~
He also conceded similar goals earlier in this season. You can't expect him to make one on one saves every time our defenders have brainfarts (which usually happens each match). He might have saved them, but you need a certain amount of luck to save those.

He was saving everything on some point of the season, but that wasn't going to last forever. No keeper can make perfect saves for his entire career.

I really don't see the point of blaming a keeper for not saving one on ones. The defense has to be blamed for failing two times against the mighty Everton (and once getting beaten from a corner, but those things happen).

3543~~~
His attempt to 'save' the Mirallies goal was pretty pathetic. I mean, it wouldn't have changed much anyway, but he just stood there with the whole right side of the goal to pass it into. He didn't get 'done with the eyes', he just gave Mirrales an open net.

3544~~~
Now that caf doesn't like him as a person we can all say he is shit GK too.

No, seriously, his positioning for Mirallas' goal was really poor for his standards, I don't think he should save it but he definitely left him too much space which made it an easy finish. The replay from behind the goal showed it really well.

3545~~~
Congrats on coming 3rd Dave! Time to sign.

3546~~~
Nothing he could do to save the goal but smiling? Really?

3547~~~
People smile at stuff like that all the time in sports, it was a ridiculously lucky goal and he's probably smiling at the frustration of it more than anything.

3548~~~
Get a hold of yourself.

3549~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3550~~~
Overreaction much? Wouldn't be the first person to have a sardonic smile at a situation like that.

3551~~~
Going a goal down in a must-win game at the business end of the season? At best, it's an unusual response.

3552~~~
Not that unusual if his thought was something "Shit we've had all this possesion and these buggers have scored a jammy goal". I doubt his smile had any glee involved.

3553~~~
Don't think he was gleeful at all. He's obviously not fecking pleased they scored! Just think he didn't look particularly bothered.

3554~~~
If he wasn't particularly bothered, I'd imagine there would be no reaction at all. I can definitely see an argument that his head has dropped and he's become distracted with the contract negotiations/Madrid link of late but don't think his reaction to the West Brom goal has anything to do with it.

3555~~~
I dunno. I probably am reading too much  into it. Was the sort of reaction you see in a game of park football, with nothing at stake. Which jarred somewhat. Can you imagine Shmikes reacting like that in the same situation?

3556~~~
I couldn't see Schmeichel having that reaction but I could see Van Der Sar, like I said it was a sarcastic smile. Seriously not even sure it's worth discussing further as it's a player smiling after facing a bit of bad luck. Some people laugh at bad news, maybe De Gea is one of those people.

3557~~~
Oh my God.

3558~~~
He hasn't been right in the last few weeks, his head has most certainly been turned by the speculation.

3559~~~
Come on <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3560~~~
I can't believe he was actually smiling when picking the goal out of the net.

3561~~~
a true world class keeper would have saved it with his smile. head been turned

3562~~~
He was clearly giving a sarcastic smile. A 'I can't believe we are 1-0 down' kind of smile. No issue with it.

3563~~~
That was a "thank feck i'm getting out of this shit hole in a few months" sort of smile.

3564~~~
Won us the 3 points with that save today.

3565~~~
He isn't human.

3566~~~

3567~~~
Give him the keys to Old Trafford.

3568~~~
Two ridiculously world class saves that probably propelled us into the CL.

3569~~~
I think if we get past the cl qualifier, we should consider the cl money as part of the transfer fees we get for him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3570~~~
Been a while since he saved us, as we have been much improved the past few months. What a player he's been this season, hope he stays.

3571~~~
David Godea.

3572~~~
Single handedly got us into the Champions League. Literally.

3573~~~
2 incredible saves.

3574~~~
Is that you Jamie Redknapp?

3575~~~
Dave is back! Some magnificent saves towards the end. I thought Murray was going to score but he kept us in it.

3576~~~
Still can't believe he saved that close lob with his right hand. He's unreal.

3577~~~
Thought that was a guaranteed goal when the ball broke to him, unbelievable save

3578~~~
I'm going to miss this bastard.

3579~~~
Which is impressive for a goalkeeper...

3580~~~
De Gea, sign that contract. I can't even get excited anymore after those 2 brilliant saves.

3581~~~
Superman..

3582~~~
He won us the match and is easily our best player.

3583~~~
De Goat.

3584~~~
Came to the rescue again.

3585~~~
Yet more points we owe him. However I'm withholding my MOTM awards for him until he signs a new contract, so Young it is! I'm sure this will devastate you Dave, but you know how to stop it.

3586~~~
Some fantastic saves from him again today. Especially that one with his right hand when he was already coming out and quite low, I was convinced that was a goal.

3587~~~
Will be pretty sad if he leaves. Our best player for sure.

3588~~~
One small criticism... Did anyone else think his positioning was too far to the opposite post for the Puncheon's free kick? The free kick wasn't exactly in the top corner. Obviously Blind is also to blame for not wanting to risk getting any dirt in his locks. It must have been agreed beforehand that the wall wasn't going to jump, so he should have known there was more danger to that corner. He almost set up like he was expecting a cross.

3590~~~
Bit shaky in recent games but looked back to his best today, absolutely world class.

3591~~~
Give him what he wants and make him stay.

3592~~~
He's the best keeper on the planet. Give him 400k a week, just keep this guy at the club.

3593~~~
Madrid can feck off...

3594~~~

3595~~~
Twat ex own goalscoring defender

3596~~~
He retweeted this too

3597~~~
I think our crap defending brings the best out of him. He's now always expecting to make a save every time the opposition attack.

3598~~~
They say practice makes perfect maybe this is why he's become so good. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3599~~~
He even managed to sneak his two best friends in that picture!

3600~~~
It's like when the love of your life is escaping your grasp and there's nothing you can do about it.

Or something.

3601~~~
Time to get him a world class defense. Just like schmeichel had with bruce-pallister and stam-johnson , van der sar with rio-vidic-evra. Hope he just signs that fecking contract sooner.

3602~~~
Some amazing saves, by some ridiculous distance, our best player this season.

3603~~~
His positioning on the free kick was poor in my opinion but once he had got us into trouble he more than made up for it.

3604~~~
How a story is formed.. Balague has just said De Gea has probably agreed to join Madrid because Iker ran down the tunnel at full time without clapping the fans.
#ballbaglogic
If he stayed applauding the fans it would be spun as an emotional goodbye

3605~~~
What can I say? He saved his teammates' arses so many times again.

Yeah, they should just sort out the Ds now through deals ASAP. At least, it would allow DDG to breathe a little easier when thinking of the prospect of playing at United next year.

3606~~~
He's just ridiculous, so many big saves this season alone. Blank cheque woody, keep the bromance threesome together<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3607~~~
Reducing shot angle almost to zero in hopeless situation. Some of our defenders should think of giving him half of their salaries. Sometimes he literally saves them from being sold to a championship side.

3608~~~
I can't believe there are people in here who actually said they wouldn't mind if DDG left if that meant we got Bale in return. Do you have any idea how many points he's won(or saved) us this season?

3609~~~
His poor positioning on the free kick was probably more Madrid-bound body language. One step closer to home.

<span style="color: #ffffff">lol. Nothing wrong his positioning. Shit wall, and a clever free kick.</span>

3610~~~
How much is a Champions League place worth?

That is the worth of Big Dave to us

3611~~~
So many that it has become hard to count. I said it earlier but I would love it if somebody put the work in to count how many matches he won us points in. Becomes a completely personal opinion to decide which saves qualifies as "supposed to be goals" but would still be amazing to see such statistics. 

The feeling is that he's one of the best match winners in the league.

3612~~~
£60 million I think?

Either way, unfortunately most of us have come to accept that he is on his way out.

We'll be lucky to get over £25 million for him I think.

3613~~~
That save, just wow! Can't remember the last time I saw such a magnificent save like that before but that surely has to be up there as one of the best!

3614~~~
David, if you see this, I will do anything...anything...for you to re-sign.

3615~~~
We should have a save of the season poll.

3616~~~
That save...that save <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

3617~~~
Anyone got a gif of THE save?

3618~~~
That save was just incredible.

He makes loads of good saves but what truly sets him apart are ones like today. Those ones where you're already resigned to it being a goal and it's a shock it doesn't go in. He's made about 7 or 8 wonder saves this season, he's just so good.

What the feck are we going to do when he goes?

3619~~~
It was like the save against Hazard at Old Trafford as when the chance fell, I just dropped my head and shut my eyes not wanting to see the goal only to hear he pulled off the impossible.

I need to start believing in him more I think but then they will start slotting them home if I start watching. Best stay the same.

3620~~~
That save was outstanding but his cross collecting will be what he is most happy with. Caught everything!

3621~~~
I think he was positioned well,  that free kick was too close to get it over the wall and down into goals without hitting the wall so the only realistic chance of scoring was crossing it to/or shoot at the back post where De Gea was.

99/100  free kicks from there shooting near post will hit the wall or go over, completely Blinds fault.

3622~~~
Been a theme of this season. The change from previous seasons is amazing. Used to punch everything but genuinely can't remember the last time he punched anything.

3623~~~
Id love to know how our defense compares to other teams in terms of defensive errors.

3624~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/football-team-rankings#defensive-errors#team-stats#english-barclays-premier-league|season-2014/2015#0#90#any#any#season#1#all-matches#total#desc#total" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/football-tea...any#any#season#1#all-matches#total#desc#total</a>

3625~~~
Only Burnley has a better ratio in terms of defensive errors to goals conceded.

3626~~~
Far and away our player of the season, which if we are being honest means we suck as a team and depended on our keeper to bail us out.  And he has.  Single handedly got us top 4.  Bravo.  Now don't go to Madrid.

3627~~~
That save though. They slowed it down on MOTD and pointed it out, he doesn't take his eye off the ball.

3628~~~
Is he the player of the season in the league? If we finished higher than third maybe he could be.. proly hazard will take it

3629~~~
Cheers mate.

Not surprised that only Everton have made more defensive errors than us. The fact that we've only conceded from 3 of those we have one man to thank for mostly. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i57.tinypic.com/wm09ip.jpg" src="http://i57.tinypic.com/wm09ip.jpg"/>

3630~~~
Player of the Season has already been announced and Hazard has won it. Over the course of the season I'd have given it to de Gea though.

3631~~~
I had already basically accepted that palace were 2-1 up and we had blown it AGAIN, and then somehow the beautiful bastard saved it?!?! I mean nobody should be giving the keeper a chance from that close, but thank god DDG got a hand to that, he really has been the reason we got 4th this year. 

We have to keep him at whatever cost.

3632~~~
Should have been YPOTY to be honest.

3633~~~
He's incredible. I actually thought he would save it. I have no idea why I thought that, because he is just so good I guess. If we get top four then he should have won POTY. Please stay Dave! feck Bale and however much money we would get.

3634~~~
That save was one of the best I've ever seen. I just wish he was from stretford so he could spend the rest of his career here.

3635~~~
De Gea must get 100% of the votes for POTY!!!

3636~~~
Has he sign the contract yet??

3637~~~
The scary thing is that he is just 24 and (in general) nowhere near the typical peak of a goalie.

3638~~~
Iker was terrible last night and got lots of abuse from the Real fans. There is no doubt at all that Real will try hard for him this summer, I just hope he realises that if the Madrid crowd can do that to one of their biggest legends then he with his Atletico connections would have a hard time as soon as he has a dip. Also as a team we are below Real right now but in terms of defending we are no worse, they are absolutely terrible at the back as well and he will be making a zillion saves a match there too.

3639~~~
Thing is if DDG goes this summer would he get a starting place at Real? Iker is a big presence in the Madrid dressing room and you feel DDG would be a cup keeper playing understudy to him in the league. I see it that way unless Iker leaves - Would DDG risk a place at the Euros in 2016 when he knows he'd be a starter here?

3640~~~
Well there is an opposite side to that which is that it's really hard for him to take over the Spain role unless he goes to Madrid. DDG has been sensational for more than 2 years now and yet still Spain keep picking Iker over him so playing at United isn't really helping him on that front

3641~~~
If anything that just shows the presence of Iker in the Spanish dressing room too. Right now DDG is forcing his way into Del Bosque's thinking by performing brilliantly week in week out, i'm not sure it would be the same if hes playing every other week for a game here and there.

3642~~~
Does he really want to leave? He was grinning and looking happy enough yesterday after the win, and exchanged congratulations especially with his two Spanish mates

3643~~~
Clutching at straws? Why would a professional not be happy after a top performance and a win? IMO, he does not want to leave United, maybe he just prefers to play for Madrid.

3644~~~
Why does being in Madrid matter for the Spanish #1 spot? It's ridiculous that DDG can't be Spain's number one unless he plays for Real or Barca. His form is significantly better than any other Spanish 'keeper.

3645~~~
Don't think it matters really these days. So many spanish players and internationals play outside of Spain.

Us - DDG, Mata, Herrera
Chelsea - Azpilicueta, Fabregas, Costa
Bayern - Alonso, Bernat, Alcantarra, Martinez
Arsenal - Cazorla, Monreal, Arteta, Bellerin
Juventus - Moratta, Llorente
City - Silva, Navas

Actually it seems like every top team in Europe has a Spaniard.

3646~~~
If he goes to Madrid, then Iker will be exiled. De Gea won't be a cup keeper there, but will immediately start and likely become the Spanish No.1 keeper too.

3647~~~
Matter of opinion but i just dont see Iker being exiled, the closest anyone came was Jose who was sacked shortly after. Ancelotti continued it last season, only used him in cup games, and was absolutely battered by their press and directors. To the point where this season hes had to start him every game.

3648~~~
He was fantastic last year too, but this year he improved a lot. Under Moyes' team he improved his strength and his cross catching ability, but this year he's taken all parts of his game to another level, his GK technique and positioning is world class, I don't think he would have made yesterday's save last year. 

I think a lot of credit goes to Hoek and the other coaches for his fantastic improvements, at this time he is as good as anyone out there and he's only 24, if he keeps this up he will go down as one of the best GK ever.

Also he is the player that made the difference this year, take him out of the team and I don't think we would finish in the top 4. Look at his save yesterday, it's not much about the 3 points, but about the situation, without it we would almost certainly lose our 4th in a row, the effect on our team's morale would have been disastrous.

He's our best and our most important player and nobody even comes close, it's a shame that he will most likely leave in the summer. Will be gutted when that happens.

3649~~~
It's something that shouldn't matter, and based on their performances this season de Gea should have been a starter for the international games earlier this year but del Bosque is a dinosaur.

3650~~~
Well, it is something else replacaing him with Diego Lopez, and something else with the best Spanish keeper and likely second best keeper in the world. If De Gea goes, I think it is almost certain that Casillas will leave. Keeping him in the bench will just make the atmosphere in the dressing room very poisoned.

3651~~~

3652~~~
Voted for him.

3653~~~
<a class="username" data-user="83951, @ZDwyr" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83951/">@ZDwyr</a> is specifically talking about the GK position for the Spanish NT which is monopolized by Barca and Real

3654~~~
This is getting silly now! 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3077357/Real-Madrid-target-David-Gea-heads-home-Spain-given-time-Manchester-United-boss-Louis-van-Gaal.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...490&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed</a>

I'm sure it can be easily explained as just a few days off to visit his bird who's based there but he really needs to do something to dispel the rumours. 

He's been offered a ton of cash and if his heart is not set at United then he should just do us all a favour and go!

As brilliant as he is (and don't get me wrong I'd love it if he stayed, even for big cash) there is no point keeping someone who simply does not want to be here or is using our facilities and name to help drive his price up as he runs his contract down. 

Have some fecking balls and tell us what YOU want David!

3655~~~

3656~~~
No goodbye, no transfer.

3657~~~
Hes not waving bye like Falcao did...

3658~~~
So eager to leave he just walked off during the game <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3659~~~
his hamstring is off in madrid already.

3660~~~
Goodbye de Gea <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/><img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/><img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/><img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/><img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

3661~~~
Arsenal at home - the last time we will ever see DDG in the United shirt. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3662~~~
He won't get the same support in Madrid as he does here.

3663~~~
He just wanted to get a good leaving reception before all the subs were used, another thing Gerrard didn't get. De gea 1 Gerrard 0

3664~~~
Any word on how long he's out for? 

If it's more than a week - and he leaves, he's played his last game for us.

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Come on Dave, you won't be as loved anywhere else as you are here.

3665~~~
at least he wasn't waving like falcao did. imagine him waving. that would be madrid full stop.

maybe a slim chance of him staying? hope so..although 9/10 of me saying he is leaving..<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3666~~~
Wasn't there someone on MUTV saying he went and waved to each side of the stadium or something though? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3667~~~
Expectations and hope kills, he's gone in my head, anything else is a wonderful bonus.

3668~~~
bale perhaps?

3669~~~
Bale + Varane :P 

Although it'll be even humiliating if Varane snubbed us

3670~~~
haha.

Gaz thinks we should ask for bale as part of the deal. if we are unable to stop de gea leaving, then i kind of agree with him.

just like back in 2009 when we sold ronaldo. could have easily asked for robben or sneijder back then...

3671~~~
In every match De Gea makes that special save....you would not expect another keeper to do that....but we expect him to do it...its become normal.

worth a goal start? yes...

that is why I will be gutted should he leave.

3672~~~

I keep telling myself we'll get over it, that better defending will mean we won't miss him as much. But then I watch this and think...how many times have his saves inspired the rest of the team? He's been so good, in so many ways, and so consistent - truly deserving of his accolades.

3673~~~
is he going to play tomorrow?

3674~~~
That report is 12 days old. He couldn't have been gone for long as he played for us last Sunday.

3675~~~
Some of those slow motion clips they show, its like everything is moving in slow-mo except De Gea. Insane reactions.

3676~~~
I keep telling myself that he's staying. Even if he does go, we'll be alright. I don't think LVG will start the season without a very solid keeper.

3677~~~
This is absolutely ridiculous. He is just too good and it hurts so much to know that he will leave. Our only true world class player right now...

3678~~~
I would be gutted if he leaves. He is at least worth a goal start each match.

But I feel we still have a decent chance of keeping him.

3679~~~
Forgot about that save against Arsenal in the F.A Cup <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3680~~~
Real Madrid play a wide open game and will always have a lot of goal attempts against them. Today Casillas let in 3. De Gea would easily have made the difference in them winning the league and he would have saved Morata's equaliser. They would be nuts to not pursue him.

3681~~~
Valdes starting, de Gea doesn't make bench. Goodbye de Gea maybe <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

That punch may have been his last contribution <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3682~~~
He's injured.

3683~~~
Still injured I guess. LVG said he'd start him regardless of his decision as he's part of our strongest 11.

3684~~~
How did he get injured again?

3685~~~
Farewell.

3686~~~
He came out to block a shot, then looked like he'd pulled a muscle in his lower back.

It wasn't a contact injury, so maybe it's a ruse.

3687~~~

3688~~~
That better be a Man Utd contract, Dave.

3689~~~
