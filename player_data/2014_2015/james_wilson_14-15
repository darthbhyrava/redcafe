Who is he?

2~~~
Wrong forum.

3~~~
He's in the first team. It's the right forum.

4~~~
A mechanic at my local autoshop.

5~~~
It's the right forum now <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

6~~~
<img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

7~~~
You started the thread in the football forum, instead of the United forum. No worries, it's been fixed.

He's a footballer.

8~~~
Don't be a Macheda. For the love of god don't be a Macheda. *Prays*.

9~~~
Thanks. My mistake. Got a bit excited.

10~~~
There's a chance he's in the squad next season, though I'd expect that would mean Hernandez leaving. Wouldn't bother me too much if Wilson takes his place.

11~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

12~~~
Good stuff, I'd never heard of him until tonight. Pretty ignorant I suppose! I agree I won't be gutted to see Hernandez go, I like him but it's time for him to move on.

13~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

14~~~
ten goals in 16 appearences at birmingham last I checked... not bad for a player of his age actually

15~~~
Ha! Hes got much more to his game than a decent finish thankfully.

16~~~
Might Wilson be better off with a loan move, all dependent on what forwards Van Gaal goes with next season?

17~~~
From what I've read about him he seems to have a bit of cop on. Macheda is a cocky lazy player who has not worked hard enough after making his breakthrough.

18~~~
is he the new Macheda?

19~~~

20~~~
Closer to Januzaj

21~~~
perfect debut.

22~~~
RVP is the old Wilson <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

23~~~
Well there is a lot that has been said in the Wilson thread from the reserve forum, clips, gifs and compilations as well. I'd recommend it.

24~~~
Let's not overhype him. Would have to judge him over the next season to even know whether he's good enough for the first team.

25~~~
No way he'll be a Macheda, the paranoid lot have come out it seems. He seems to have more about him and looks like someone to be a star for the future. If Hernandez were to leave, I would not be worried. He can just slot right in!

26~~~
He's only 18 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

27~~~
Who knows how good he will be. Pure guess work at this point. Lets just enjoy his moment.

28~~~
This.

29~~~
He's good enough, if you've seen him for the under 21s. He always scores and often its a bit of magic to make the opening for himself and a really good strike with either foot.

The only question is whether he can develop enough with cameos as a backup or does he need a loan. The best part is that now he got 2 on his debut all but about 4 premier league clubs would love to take him on that loan. So he'd have a good selection to choose the right one for himself

30~~~
I imagine that'll depend on the future of the other forwards. If Hernandez leaves it's good to have a 4th striker and it appears that van Gaal is a big believer of giving young players chances..so you'd hope there is a place for him.

For some reason I'm personally quite skeptical about loans when it comes to strikers. I don't know why.

31~~~
Gravy.

32~~~
Yeah, just working my through it. If it gets moved here I can delete this thread if needs be?

33~~~
I don't think they'll move it, that's not usually how it's done.

34~~~
The future is bright

35~~~
One of the championship teams coming up could do with him. I'd rather he had half a season in the championship like Welbeck though.

36~~~
Needs to bulk up though.

37~~~
The future is oranje.

38~~~
Not going to get carried away. Obviously delighted for the lad to get two goals on his debut, but neither were fantastic finishes.

39~~~
First one was decent.

40~~~
Hopefully he can get into a premiership team where he can get regular starts. Not sure if he's up to that level yet, but he definitely has time on his side. Sometimes you need luck too, to get the right loan and not get injured <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

41~~~
I wonder what odds you could get on him becoming United's all time top goalscorer in the future <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

2 down, a couple hundred or so to go...

42~~~
Does he also have a <i>higher ceiling</i> than Sterling?

43~~~
Part of the new Era with Januzaj.

44~~~
Oh come on mate, to score two on a debut is an achievement for the kid.

45~~~
Dont get me wrong, it was good reactions to get to the ball first and he made good contact, but he was a tad fortunate that it went between the keepers legs, im sure he didnt intend that part.

<a class="username" data-user="66352, @The Mitcher" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66352/">@The Mitcher</a>
As I said, very pleased for him to have gotten two goals. Definitely an achievement regardless of the manner of them (which isnt to say they were particularly bad mind you)

46~~~
Definitely. He's about 6 feet while Sterling is 1 ft 1

47~~~
Stop being bitter about yesterday's result. Life moves on.

48~~~
The same was being said of Januzaj last summer. Wilson is in the Januzaj bracket of players rather than Macheda IMO. Special player with special potential, and if the new manager puts faith in youth then I see him playing a decent part next season provided he has a good tour akin to Adnan last summer.

49~~~
Have a look at some of his reserve goals, the boy is a natural finisher, quick too. Obviously he's still a fair way away from starting for us consistently but this is a terrific start. I think Van Gaal will take to him too.

50~~~
There had to be one!

51~~~
Crazy debut for him, got an eye for the goal definitely. Can develop into fantastic striker with older team mates he's got here.

52~~~
He's a bit special this lad. Nice to see him transferring his goalscoring form for the U21s to the first team. I have high hopes for him next season. 

Front three of Lawrence - Wilson - Januzaj was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

53~~~
I have said it in other post. Remove the deadwood, bring 4-5 quality players and use these kids as squad players. We need hunger and talent more then experience and stability

54~~~
Would like to see him paired with another mobile striker upfront(unlike Fella), he didn't have any space to show what he can offer in his all around game, but still grabbed two goals which is more than enough.

55~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/2LPqjd6.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/2LPqjd6.png"/>

56~~~
Best 2 goal debut/first start since Januzaj

57~~~
Add pereira, janko and varela

58~~~
Easy lads. Let's be cool. In reality he still has a long way to go, but today will be a massive massive confidence boost.

59~~~
Pearson in midfield too, looks solid. 

Reece James too, though not sure where exactly he'd go in. 

We have some talents, now to really get them along.

60~~~
With the right coaching, aka Van Gaal who has quite the track record with developing players. Hopefully we can see United youngsters like Wilson and Januzaj reaching their potential. That would just be amazing, especially with them being from United's academy <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

61~~~
That was meant to be a pun, but okay!

62~~~
Love him already. What a debut!

63~~~
He's our joint 7th highest goalscorer in the premier league this season with Valencia and Young

64~~~
Bitter?

65~~~
Always knew he had it in him. Whatever I have seen of him this season, I always thought he is going to be a star for us. Hope he progresses very well. He does things in a simple way but he is very intelligent.

66~~~
Biggest stage in the world and he's ready for it..
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

67~~~
Zero nerves, he plays with joy, a real gem attitude wise.

68~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

69~~~
He seems to have that nack of knowing where to be inside the box. Very predatory. In an ideal world, he'd have that Hernandez-like inclination for goals but a better all round game. Here's hoping.

70~~~
Out of context, this looks incredibly pervy. Just saying.

71~~~
I know, I realised that after posting but was hoping no one picked up on it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

72~~~
He should play against Southampton.

73~~~
Is this Januzaj vs. Sterling thing?

And if it is, have you even watched the game today? Januzaj showed his incredible potential yet again.

74~~~
Please no, he has a final next midweek. Much more important than the Soton game.

75~~~
It seems that you underestimated the perverseness of my own mind. Mhwahahaha.

76~~~
Well done to the guy, deserves to at least be on the bench for Southampton.

There's so many strikers now that need more chances, looks like Hernandez might be off if we decide to stick with Wilson <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Edit: Don't play him for Southampton, forgot about the U21 final!

77~~~
I almost forgot about that.

78~~~
Except for the goals, I thought he held up the ball really well too.

79~~~
Great for him to get 2 debut goals. That's about as good as you could hope for really. Not sure if he will play the next game though. Probably deserves to, but they may want to keep him for the U-21 league final just because he's had a big part to play in that squad.

80~~~
Have watched as much as possible this season. Not surprised at all that he scored two goals, he really has what it takes to make a great striker. Hopefully we see him get a full pre-season with the first team and with the World Cup on, I think he will get some good game time.

81~~~
What a dream debut.

82~~~
<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

83~~~
The awkward moment when James Wilson has more PL goals this season than Fellaini, Kagawa and Cleverley combined...

84~~~
Good to see another James potentially making it in the prem. There's not nearly enough of us, for such a popular name it's underrepresented in footy.

85~~~
Delighted for the lad, must be a dream come true for him to score two goals on his first senior appearance at United. 

He seems like a really good prospect, very composed and a lethal finisher. I thought his movement for both his goals was very impressive, he got himself in the perfect position and then took full advantage. 

Based on his performances throughout the season, as well as his performance today, Wilson seems to have a really promising future ahead of him. I hope we get to see a lot more of him next season.

86~~~
Better minutes per goal ratio than Suarez, Ronaldo, Aguero, Zlatan. 

The stats don't lie lads! Best forward in Europe on current form.

87~~~
First things first. A loan move to a prem club.
Leicester maybe?

He will have such a limited amount of playing time for us next season that being loaned out in the prem is the ideal situation.
His debut was very good, but he is still low in the pecking order

Excited though

88~~~
Thought it was a tricky type of game for him to come into though, Hull were always going to sit a little deep and limit the space in behind that his pace could exploit as he does in the youth team. Seemed to deal with it though.

89~~~
<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

I think a move to a prem team would be good for him. Hopefully Wigan come up, Powell can stay there for longer and they can take Wilson off us for a season too.

90~~~
Looked good tonight. Worked hard and got in great positions - key to a decent forward player.

One for the future by the looks of it.

91~~~
my thoughts too, great buzz seeing him score two, but lets not get carried away and over hype the kid like we have done with so many youngsters over the years!

but still was great too see tonight! was an emotional night all round!

92~~~
Great game from him, showed a real strikers instinct, always got in good positions. Easy enough finishes but he had to be there to take them so well done to him. Hopefully he plays a role next season and we don't just send him on loan.

93~~~
Didn't seem to let making his first team debut affect him, and reacted quickly to take both his goals

94~~~
Don't wanna get carried away. But does anyone else think Wilson + Januzaj can push each other's performance to a higher level like we had with Rooney + Ronaldo in the early years ? Should be extremely healthy competition if they're up for it. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

95~~~
Its a disgrace that a lot of "supporters" dont keep up to date with the young players at the club

96~~~
He has goals in him. He's scored goals at every level he's played at.

The question now is if he can keep developing and improving.

97~~~
Chuck in Lingard as well.

98~~~
Dream debut for the lad. Made up for him. Hopefully he avoids any injuries so he can develop fully.

99~~~
I had never heard of him before tonight, but it's fair to say he's undeniably the greatest young talent in world football today.

100~~~
While I agree, it does take some effort to watch and find out about the younger players and not everyone can. I do my best to watch as much as I can but living in Sydney makes it difficult. But yes, I agree that it's disappointing when you see comments from some people who don't know who these players are.

At a club like United, it's about the future.

101~~~
Goal gifs please!

Fellaini in the 2nd gif <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

105~~~
His movement in the box was excellent tonight, and he didn't show the slightest sign of nerves. That celebration looked like he feels he was born to play for us <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I can't wait to see more of him in the first team. People have raved about his pace and I'm looking forward to seeing that against teams that don't sit as deep as Hull did.

106~~~
What a debut.

107~~~
Wilson has definitely shown us why he's one to look out for in the future. He looked like a proper predator against Premier League opposition, and he certainly didn't let this occasion faze him. Even with Fellaini supporting him, he did fairly well. He got more tired in the second half, but he convinced me that he'll be a great forward in the future if he keeps going at this rate.

His movement, finishing, dribbling, and hold-up play was demonstrated well against Hull. He deserved the brace, and I hope that he gets more involved in the first team, in the future.

108~~~
Didn't see the match tonight and I've only seen the highlights, but how was his general performance. Haven't seen much of him before, but seems a very instinctive striker and his first was a decent finish and reaction to the ball in a dangerous area. Seems like he might be slightly reminiscent of Hernandez as far as predatory finishing goes. In fact, I'd be inclined to see Hernandez, purely to allow Wilson more first team opportunities. That would be a great sign of faith from van Gaal and Hernandez himself is going to find regular first team football more difficult to come by with the team playing less matches and with van Gaal's system.

109~~~
He did what he always does: put the ball in the net. It wasn't actually a game that suited him, since his pace his runs behind defenders and his ability to always beat the keeper when put clean through are his biggest assets. As such the best games for him are against opponents that set out to attack us. Whereas Hull produced probably the least ambitious performance I've seen from the away side at Old Trafford all season.

And yet he still got a brace. And that pretty much sums up what we know about him from his academy and reserve career with us. Whatever the situation in the match, if you give him chances he'll take them.

110~~~
I wish he had come to the ball a bit more, dropped deeper at times to give an extra passing option. But then someone has to stay in the box, he may well have been instructed to stay on the last man.

111~~~
he has been developing nicely from the youth setup and into the u-21s this season and for those who watched him regularly i'm sure aren't surprise with his impact today. not that i have been watching the u-21 a lot but some of his goals for the u-21 are simply breathtaking. and the good thing about wilson is that he is just not about goals.  his game is much more than that.

if van gaal came in, maybe, just maybe he can work things with wilson just like he did with tomas muller. i can even sense some similarities in their game. who knows..

112~~~
You could see him as Januzaj broke free, "I might get a chance here", has a look around "No defenders, it could happen", has another look "Shit! I'm free lets do this" then he accelerates, as the ball comes in "Goal....don't miss it...actually just make sure I hit the target".

He was drained physically and emotionally by the end of it.

113~~~
Yeah, he's a broken man on that grass. Oh well, sell and move on.

114~~~

going to be some player for us and England.

very messi like for that goal v arsenal u 18

117~~~
Promising signs, but tuck those cocks in gents. He has a long way to go yet.

118~~~
It was the Newcastle or Villa game U18 game where he scored 5 goals that he really impressed me. He was devastating in that game. He made a mockery of the defenders.

Found a video.. And it was Newcastle.

Nice little article about Wilson's parents being proud of him during the match tonight.

120~~~
I used to but it's not exactly easy without MUFC, which also requires an extortionate Sky subscription. Not only that, but in recent years, I'd have spent many hours and the only players to have come through would have been Cleverley and Welbeck?

121~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Good lord.

122~~~
thought Best....but ok..

obviously very different players.

van Gaal..Woody...tie the lad up to a 10 year contract please.

123~~~
What a player. We've been struggling to find a use for Fellaini all season and Wilson comes in and gives him his first assist of the season <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

124~~~
Daehli did some really great stuff in that game. It is such a shame that he left.

125~~~
He'll be back.

126~~~
He was very good. Though I felt he needs to make more off the ball runs. But you could tell his instincts as a striker is very good.

127~~~
Good lord, the amount of time and space Fellaini gets and still he finds the keeper with a pretty tame shot...

128~~~
First 4 goals all layed on by Daehli, 3 almost identically. A through ball masterclass. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

James Wilson’s parents captured the moment (Picture: Twitter/@TurningCruyff)
James Wilson’s mum and dad will have been among the proudest parents in the country tonight after their son netted a brace on his Manchester United debut at Old Trafford.
And they ensured they captured the moment in all its glory – filming a replay of his strikes via a television screen from the stands.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2014/05/06/james-wilsons-parents-film-manchester-united-debut-brace-from-old-trafford-tv-screen-4720011/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2014/05/06/james...ut-brace-from-old-trafford-tv-screen-4720011/</a>

130~~~
Did you notice he's often quite lazy? After he fell down it took ages he got back up. Not United quality

131~~~
I'm all for Fellaini bashing but come on..He say it was going to Wilson, he didn't really have much need to get up as fast as you're suggesting.

132~~~
Oh I meant he normally did that. Took forever to get back up.

133~~~
He's right though, he's been conspicuously lazy all season. It's made his incompetence all the harder to swallow. All those times he's lost the ball in midfield over the past couple of months, he throws his hands up as if it's someone else's fault and makes zero effort to get back and make up for his error. Poor form is forgivable, poor attitude is not, not when you're being paid what these guys are.

134~~~
His movement and ability to make space for himself reminded me of watching Michael Owen newly promoted into the Liverpool first team. 

Hopefully he will go on to have a similar impact for us.

135~~~
Just like Januzaj last season, i felt Wilson was good enough to get some games in the first team. Really happy that he took his chances and the occasion did not get the better of him. He would be a perfect backup if one of our strikers were to leave in the summer. If he can avoid injuries, he's going to become a special player for us for a long time.

136~~~
Missed the game, but great to see the kid given a chance with the first team. Nice to see him get a brace as well, even if both goals were not particularly great.

Other than the goals, how did he actually play? Did people get the impression that he could potentially have an impact next season, or should get a loan move?

137~~~
Don't want to say anything negative as the kid deserves this day so I will just post statistics and you can make your mind up.

22 touches in 64 minutes which is basically one touch every third minute. 18 passes with 61% accuracy, no through-balls/long-balls/crosses/key passes, Won 0 aerial duels, no interceptions/tackles, no dribbles, never dispossessed(very good thing). 

He did get 4 shots off though and 2 of them on target(2 goals). 

So all in all, his performance were the goals, remove them and he'd have an okay game but of course any striker scoring 2 goals is having a great game no matter the rest of the performance.

138~~~
Aparently first player to score for the under 18s, 19s, 21s and first team in one season

139~~~
Thanks, so average performance with a couple of goals. Something for him to build on at least.

140~~~
Sounds so negative and wrong, but yeah. Showed his talent as a goal-scorer/poacher possibly sounds less harsh.

141~~~
madness to me people have the audacity on here to say his goals "weren't very good". an 18 year old came on for his debut, in the top flight of English football, and put two away. i'm all for tempering excitement, but...my goodness! 

note - what about "he did well to get into that position", or his second to acknowledge he strikes the ball into the ground, knowing it'll be saved otherwise?

juuust saying.

but yes, let's keep our hats on here please!

142~~~
In 3 years time potentially?

------------------------DE GEA---------------------

RAFAEL-------SMALLING-----------JONES------SHAW

---------------KROOS-------CARVALHO/POWELL-----

LINGARD/ZAHA----------JANUZAJ----------LAWRENCE

------------------------WILSON---------------------

And then there's the likes of:
Mata
Kagawa
Welbeck
Rooney
Keane's
Pereira

143~~~
Might as well put Pearson and Rothwell in midfield if you're gonna go full muppet.

144~~~
Nothing wrong with dreaming mate, lol.

145~~~
Henriquez and Varela too. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

146~~~
The object of a striker is to score goals.  2 goals scored is a very good night by any measure and 2 goals on your debut is sensational.

147~~~
What's worse is how long it takes him to realize he needs to make the run.

148~~~
Yes, we'll be dropping a 29 year old Juan Mata for Tom Lawrence and one of Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney or Shinji Kagawa for Jesse Lingard or a lad that couldn't get in our team and went on to fail at relegated Cardiff. Christ. I am all about bringing through youngsters, but the likelihood of that being our first choice 11 is about the same as us being relegated by then.

149~~~
I don't know about disgrace but aye I only started watching the reserves over the last 3 years because I didn't know you could before that. If you are aware of it and are able to access it I don't know why you wouldn't be watching it. Absolutely love it myself.

I felt great for Wilson there but so bad for Fellaini. He gets so much stick and I'm sure he is a great guy but his time here has to be taking its toll on him and he must be feeling like shit. A goal would relax him so much. 


As for Wilson a great debut. We didn't get to see it today but with space in behind he is so good at getting on the shoulder and using his pace. The way he strides in behind and onto goal reminds me so much of Michael Owen, a big fan of Wilson. One of the commentators was having a go saying he should have scored the first chance he had that got blocked. I agree with Michael Owen though when he said he'll take a missed chance any day. The instinct to get into those positions is untrainable, you're either born with it or you're not. And James Wilson was born with it. He has a great all-around game to like a Van Persie. Big future ahead of him and great to see the emotion in his parents. Great day for the lad, well happy for him.

150~~~
Really good finish on the first goal. Getting power and hitting it into the ground from the height he had to deal with isn't easy. Pretty much all of our players not named Van Persie struggle at it.

He gave the ball away a ton, but then again he's 18. Not sure if he'll go on loan next season. He's got the pace to help certain teams, but probably not ready to lead the line alone, so might have trouble unless he can play in a 4-4-2 where the team sits off a bit and looks to counter. Has to be a Champo team that fits that bill.

151~~~
You know what.. After the excitement of last night has worn off, I just hope the media doesn't hype him up too much. He's just a kid, fame and money can do awful things to even the best of them. His parents seem like good people so it's now their and the clubs' responsibility to cocoon James and keep him focussed on football. There will be growing pains as he gets used to first team football. But given is record in the youth teams , Wilson can be a star in 3-4 years. So right now it's important for him to keep his head down and concentrate on his progression. Too often we've seen young talents flame out with the burden of unrealistic expectations from the outside. He should be given the Januzaj treatment to keep him out of the spotlight as much as possible. Once he's matured he can do whatever he wants.

152~~~
Don't think he played that well if I'm honest. He scored two nice goals, but I thought he had a fairly average game aside from that and you had a few better players last night.

153~~~
Didn't catch the game last night but very pleased to see a youth player get a chance. Even more pleased obviously that he took it with two goals. Very impressive.

Heard about him before this but I must be honest, didn't have a clue if he worth the attention or not. Looks like we have something to keep an eye on here.

154~~~
He didn't have a good game by his standards.

155~~~
Yeah, but remember it was Wilson's debut match for first team so there must've been some nerves. You should see him for the U-21 teams where he pulls out all the tricks. His linkup play, close control, balance and pace while dribbling are all exceptional. Once he gets used to the level and gets more confident I'm sure he'll show what he's capable of. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

156~~~
He's 18, of course he won't have a perfect game on his PL debut - few players have. He was good enough to score two goals and the first one wasn't easy at all (second one was a rebound but he still had to find himself in position to score it). 

Truth is no one knows where he's going to go from here. We've been through this before and we know well that an 18-year old scoring on his debut might not develop into anything more in the future. He's better positioned to become a useful players for us now with the confidence it's bound to give him than before the game though and let's hope he builds on that. Don't put unnecessary presure on the boy though - he doesn't have to be perfect, he doesn't even have to make it here, just enjoy his football and have a good career.

157~~~
MACHE-WILSONNNNNN

158~~~
I am slightly surprised some had not heard of him. I don't have mutv but it's fairly easy to have a glance at the youth section to keep up to date on here. Whenever there's a chance to watch the youngsters on sky or whatever I always try to watch like the u21s were on BT the other day. 

I think he's had a great debut. He's shown off one of his best attributes which is his finishing (from the small amount of him I have seen). I agree with the idea that him and Junuzaj could bring out the best in each other.

159~~~
He was 18, leading the line for a team that has been playing below par all season against a team who for the first half were parking the bus. He had 2 chances and took them, I'd call that having a good game. He didn't get to show his range of footballing quality but the game wasn't open enough for him to be able to do that.

160~~~
Words like "disgrace" have lost their weight in this country eh?

161~~~
Didn't see the game, but people saying he didn't have a good game?

He scored twice on his debut at 18 years old. What more can you ask for?

162~~~
Which is the most promising part of it - he didn't play anywhere near his top level and didn't get a chance to show his full range of skills but he still managed to influence the result in a big way. 

You can't criticise a striker for not playing well when the build-up play, creativity and confidence in the team is so poor. Van Persie has been struggling to do anything besides score goals all season for that very reason.

163~~~
Too true. The primary job of a striker is to score goals, everything else is secondary. Making great runs and having a passing accuracy of 100% means nothing if you don't put the ball in the net. He has the natural striker's instinct of being in the right positions to take advantage of anything that falls his way. You can't teach that or coach it into a player, it's instinctive and that's what gives players like him those vital few milliseconds in a crowded box.

164~~~
Scored 2 goals as an 18 year old debutante and is capable of playing better.

He did his job tonight and hopefully he can keep going and get some more game time next year.

165~~~
I thought he had a good game and really as good a debut as you could individually want. 

Obviously he's got plenty of developing to do but his movement seemed really good, a couple times he picked it up in good areas and turned well and generally held up the ball well.

It was probably an easier debut than others given how hull sat back but he looked good.

166~~~
He lacks pace and power.

167~~~
Don't necessarily think sending him to a premier league club will be best for him.  You have to weigh up the standard of league (which will improve his game) and the relative standard of the team. 

If he went on loan to a premier league club its likely to be a small  just promoted club (I.e leicester). As a striker with a tan like that I wonder if he'll get frustrated with how little he will probably see of the ball,  which won't help his development.  He needs confidence and chances to prove his scoring ability.  Best chance would be a mid table club I.e newcastle/Soton but that just won't happen.  Purgatory best to play for a good championship side where he will have good supply to prove himself

168~~~
hope we'll see him starting next season as our 4th choice striker, would not bet against him climbing the ladder towards the end of the season though.

with van gaal likely coming, van persie is definitely a happy man again and to stay, rooney just signed a new deal and i don't see why van gaal doesn't want a player like rooney is his team. that left us with welbeck and hernandez. welbeck got the advantage of being able to play as a wing forward as well, and hernandez might just not be versatile enough to get enough games under van gaal. 

van gaal loves wing forward and maybe he will bring in someone like reus, thus paving the door open for hernandez. that would automatically promotes wilson into the first team. van gaal got a decent record of giving young players opportunities and turn them into top class players, maybe wilson will turn out to be one next.

169~~~
Noo pls don't sent him out on loan. Has a loan deal ever worked well for our young players recently ? Keane, Lingard, Powell, Henriquez are no closer closer to first team action now as they were when going out on loan. Keep him at Old Trafford. 

Hernandez is off by the looks of it. So play this dude in some Cup matches and lesser PL fixtures. There were murmurs of Januzaj joining Blackburn last season but he's better off declining the move. We've seen how much progress the likes of him and Sterling for Liverpool have made just being around the first squad and getting gametime.

170~~~
Wilson looked to be as another Hernandez, typical goal poacher. Always there at the right time and is confident to put it in the net. Other than that still not alot seen much of him though so im not gonna jump the gun but he composed himself well against Hull with a packed Old Trafford so atleast he's got a taste of it now and has 2 goals on his debut. So hope to see more of him and see what else he can do and improve.

171~~~
The goals were hardly great strikes though, and really I would expect most players to put them away from those positions. It takes nothing away from the fact that he manage to get in the right place at the time.

172~~~
I don't condone the idea of a Premier League loan because it'd likely end up with him going to a club who prefer to play their own forward instead and only use him sparignly. We've had too many disappointing loans recently, especially when it comes to forwards, IMO. If we can find a team that will play him week in week out because they don't have anyone better then fine, if it's going to be another Rossi to Newcastle or Henriquez to Wigan then we may as well not bother.

We still have young Henriquez who will compete for a squad place as well. He's gone off the radar at Zaragoza though after a great start from what I see.

173~~~
I thought he put in a real good performance last night. Yeah he scored twice on his debut which was great but he also held the ball up well and linked up with the others. Has a bright future ahead.

174~~~
Just what I was thinking. Could this see Hernandez on his way out this summer.

175~~~
I'm not reading the whole thread back but are people actually debating whether or not that was a good debut? Just when you think the insanity levels around here must surely have peaked..

176~~~
If Hernandez is off this year then Wilson takes his place as 4th choice striker.

Even if one of Rooney or RvP left I wouldn't want to sign a striker, as we have Wilson, Powell and Januzaj who can all play through the middle also.

177~~~
Hehe. Someone posting stats to justify that it wasn't a good performance was really the height of if.

178~~~
I'd love to see him on loan at Everton if Lukaku doesn't stay.

179~~~
Calm down.

180~~~
Was a decent debut. Hull really didn't allow us any space in behind. We passed it well, but not enough balls looking to cut through their defence for Wilson to get on the end of. The first goal was quality because it shows good composure. It would be quite easy to sky that. The second was a tap in but good instinct and pace to make it his. He could have switched off thinking Fellaini would score but he didn't. He shouldn't be loaned out. We have cup competitions and various games at Old Trafford that he feature in. Experience outside the club isn't experience inside the club. Why take the risk?

181~~~
Wilson + Rooney, potentially a Maradona + Pele style combination.

Surely now with Wilson its just a matter of how many points we win the league by...

182~~~
OMG you're so witty. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">......

Nope</span>

183~~~
This

184~~~
He seems much more talented than Macheda who has been only lucky for 2 games

185~~~
This.

186~~~
I wouldn't hold up too much hope for Will Keane. Saw him playing for QPR against Brighton a couple of months back. Completely anonymous bar one shot from 20 yards out with time and space. It went for a Brighton throw.

187~~~
He's not.

188~~~
Its ao annoying, not here but commentators last night saying this even though they know nothint about him.

189~~~
Its crazy to think that this could have been Will Keane we're all raving about had he not had that horrible injury.

190~~~
It was always going to take time to recover. I don't think he'll get anything back to where he was until next season - injuries permitting. I knew the daft sod should have picked the Republic.

191~~~
I wish commentators would just admit they know nothing about any team's academy, their efforts to make things appear otherwise are nearly always cringe worthy.

Or bring in someone who actually does and get their opinion, they'd probably appear for free just to get on tv.

Watching Hargreaves pretend to know something about our U21 team on the BT broadcast before the semi final was so very, very sad.

192~~~
His overall game wasn't that great, tbh, but he's young, and will learn. What impressed me about him was his sharpness in the area, the speed with which he reacted to both his chances to score. I don't think he's quite ready to lead the line yet, but I think he could work superbly as a super sub, maybe taking over from Hernandez?

193~~~
People are obviously entitled to follow the club whichever way they like. But it is slightly annoying when people who watch a youngster for the first time speak with ostensible authority on what kind of player we're dealing with, both in terms of style and level of talent, and it happens in the wake of most first team debuts.

194~~~
So chuffed for him. Imagine what he can do when he's at 100% fitness! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

195~~~
And how many first team games has Wilson been involved in?

196~~~
I always find these 'future XI' team predictions silly in all honesty. From your team prediction, we literally won't have one player over 27 in our first eleven and when you look at any club, whether they are an elite one, or lower league, you will seldom find such a young first team. I also don't want to sound like a cynic, but I very much doubt we will have a front four made solely from our academy and add on top of that, we won't sign any players beyond this summer - from your logic - it makes the team very ridiculous.

197~~~
Well thats what i saw last night, i dont have the privilege to have MUTV to watch the reserve games so i dont know much of him other than he's done well this season and is abit of skillful player. So like i said, from what i viewed from last nights game he was getting in the right positions and knocking in them balls in the net. So i hope to see more of him in pre season and maybe in next season games against tougher opponents and see what kind of striker he'll turn out to be.

Wilson aged 8

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/who-james-wilson-profile-manchester-7083684?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.../who-james-wilson-profile-manchester-7083684?</a>

But his early success nearly ended in ruin, when he fractured his ankle in 2011 during a United youth game.

Battling through his injury, he finally signed professionally for United on his 17th birthday in December 2012 and has played for their under-18s squad.

Describing the tough regime at Carrington, he told the Stoke Sentinel: “If you’re not constantly improving at United they will let you go.”

Earlier this season, he was placed on United’s substitutes bench by David Moyes but did not play in a 4-0 win over Newcastle.

He helped United’s under-21 side reach the Premier League final – where they are due to Chelsea - and has already scored 19 goals.

Last night, he became United’s fourth youngest scorer in the Premier League with the opener in the 31st minute, which was quickly followed by a second. United went on to romp home, with van Persie adding the third, beating the visitors 3-1.

Describing the influenced of United legend Rooney’s attacking style, the teenage player revealed in an interview: “I like Rooney because he plays in the same position as me.

“He has had his ups and downs like everyone, but I think he can be my role model.”

Chris Holt, who coached James at Biddulph Town Strikers, told the M.E.N: "I was James' first manager. His dad Tony was the club secretary.

"We set up the team with James, my son Alan who is a year, older and some other lads. Even back then you could see James was talented. He just took the ball past people and scored.

"Tony used to joke that he never played for a club, so he didn't know where James got it from.

"He was scouted by United when he played for us and they formally signed him for the academy when he was nine."

"As a community we are all so hugely proud of him. Since last night I've had lots of texts and messages from people who are celebrating what he's done."

And describing the James' family, Mr Holt added: "They're a really nice family. No-one would have a bad word to say about them.

"It's been a big commitment for them with James being in the academy. Tony has had to drive him everywhere. We're so pleased it's paid off."

202~~~
10 months younger than Adnan Januzaj
7 months after Adnan's double on his first start, Wilson gets his own double

Fairly good stuff

203~~~
we have some future stars coming through. 

Janzaj
Wilson
Lawrence
Pearson
Peraira

204~~~
Anyone who's watched him for the academy and then this last season or two with the step up isn't really surprised that he made a goal scoring start! I swear I was expecting it even!, this kid is just a confident natural finisher, it doesn't matter if the chance is in the reserves or champions league final, he'll just put it away.
Hopefully he can kick on from here, I really like a few in our youth coming through.

205~~~
Good to hear.

206~~~
A new Kiko Macheda ? Don't forget that Macheda was also a bright prospect when he scored his WONDERFUL goal (what a joy !!!) and the week later at Sunderland. Then he struggled to make impact on first team.

The same for Giusepp Rossi few years ago, higly regarded but in competition with Van Nistelrooy and Rooney. 

So I hope he's a bright as people says but don't put him too high for now... We'll see next season

207~~~
I didn't see anything special about Wilson in last night's performance. He took his first goal well and was lucky to be in the right spot for the 2nd. He also missed a good chance early on. Good debut, but nothing to get ridiculously excited about. Let's see how he performs over time.

208~~~
Macheda wasnt even considered our best Italian youngster when he scored his great debut goal. Really what he showed was good finishing and everything else was a bit spotty. James Wilson is an all rounder, has pace, dribbling and can score screamers from outside the box with either foot. Doesnt sound like Macheda does it?

Rossi didnt get enough chances and has shown elsewhere he was more than good enough to make it. Sir Alex said in a few years he'd be in the same category as Rooney and Ronaldo, if he didnt get injured again this season he'd have shown for Italy in the world cup that he's in the same category as one of them.

209~~~
I would put Rowell in there as well. That's just from the academy there's still Lingarrd and the Keane brothers as well(Michael was on the bench yesterday as well)

I know the odds are pretty slim that all the players mention will it here at United but I do think this group have a great chance and maybe more importantly I think under Van Gaal they will get chances.

210~~~
thanks for the info. had not heard of Rowell. heard van Gaal gives kids a chance. I hope most of them will make it. How is Will Keane btw?

211~~~
The bastard lovechild of Nick Powell and Joe Rothwell?

212~~~
He got into very good position for both goals and missed another opportunity. He has excellent control, speed, power and awareness. 

Very exciting performance.

213~~~
These predictions never work out, otherwise our team would currently look something like this:


-----------------Foster-------------
-Rafael----Pique-----Evans---Fabio
-------Anderson----Cleverley------
--Nani----------Rooney----------Ronaldo
-----------------Campbell----------

214~~~
Who predicted we'd have 2 Nanis in our first team twelve?

215~~~
Dammit, I was too slow to edit that out, knew someone would make that inevitable point.

216~~~
I wouldn't get too excited yet.

217~~~
Scoring two goals in his debut last night was just an icing on the cake, the excitement mostly comes from the potential and more importantly the rate of progress he has shown over the last couple of years. 

He is not the type of talent that will make you go "wow" often like Adnan or Daehli but I always saw him as an intelligent player in mould of Ole or Muller only with much more pace to burn. He regularly finds a way to get on the score sheets and it's also the variety of goals he scores that's impressive.

218~~~
Was close. I agree though, when we make these fantasy 11s or say that "in 2 or 3 years time..." and follow it with something that sounds brilliant, they're rarely ever proven to be correct.

We don't know whats going to happen next week in football let alone in a year or 3

219~~~
For those who've already seen him 'perform over time', it suggests that all the things that he's shown over his academy and reserves career are valid in predicting how he might do as a first-teamer. In terms of a player who is 'special', above all, because he's such a consistent and lethal goalscorer, a 60-minute brace in your first-team debut is pretty much as good as it gets. If you wanted him to dribble three or four players at a time to show that he's special, you're looking for Januzaj, not Wilson.

Either way, both players have now, as far as the opportunities that they've been given, performed exactly as those who've watched them through the academy ranks would have predicted. The tiresome 'you can't tell anything about a player's chances until they get first-team game-time' attitude so prevalent on here isn't looking very convincing at the moment.

220~~~
He may or may not make it. It will depend on the new manager, his philosophy, and whether Wilson like any number of talented youth players in recent years, will get squeezed out to another club for lack of first team opportunities because they are playing behind top first team players. As i see it now, Januzaj and Powell are the only two who i see as having a realistic chance of making it.

221~~~
Great to see him get two goals on his début. What a feeling that must've been. Hope he can continue to progress. Get him on loan to a Championship side and see how he gets on. Looks to have a bright future ahead of him.

222~~~
Powell? Wilson has a better chance of making it here and it could definitely be at Powell's expense, given nobody wants to play him anywhere but striker at the moment

223~~~
Spot on. Not sure what some were expecting from an 18 year old striker making his debut.

224~~~
Just curious, why do you think Powell has a better chance ? He probably has the toughest task with Rooney, Mata, Kagawa & Adnan all competing for that one position that Powell thrives in. I think the only way he could get time in first team is if we decide to play him as a central midfielder but there is not much reason to play him there expect for those two quotes from Gradi and Sir Alex. I don't even think he was convincing when we played him in deeper role during our reserve games sometime last season.

225~~~
Yes, obviously. But you claim you didn't see anything special from Wilson, whereas in fact what he's done is continue the trend which is what makes him special - scoring feckloads of goals with incredible consistency.

Having watched a lot of both now, I rate Wilson's chances significantly higher than Powell's. Putting my opinion about their actual ability aside (because I really don't want to get into an argument about Powell), momentum is really important, and where Wilson has continued to progress rapidly this season, Powell has gone backwards. You can see that he knows it, too - on the pitch for Wigan in the latter half of the season he's looked consistently demotivated and frustrated. To what extent that's because he's had to play so often as a forward is debatable, but the reason doesn't really matter - the fact is that the quality and effectiveness of the football we've seen from him this season has gone badly downhill.

226~~~
Fair enough. I hope he makes it, but won't be surprised if he spends a few years knocking in goals in the reserves before moving on to another club for lack of first team chances.

227~~~
Exactly. Not only is a debut brace a ridiculously rare achievement, but he also didn't put a foot wrong - never lost the ball, showed his composure on it in tight spaces, and pretty much always did the right thing with it.

If that's not a special debut, then Rooney's debut is probably the only one in the recent history of this club that qualifies!

228~~~
Strange one that. He did play there or behind the striker for Crewe, but SAF said he feels Powell has the attributes to play as a centre midfielder. He even said he could go onto replace Scholes. 

I just hope he's not wasted because from the few performances I've seen in centre midfielder for us, he looked decent.

229~~~
I agree that's a possibility - always is at a top club - but it won't be down to him if it goes like that.

230~~~
Out of interest, why do you think Powell has a better chance of making it than Wilson? 

It's obvously a mugs game making predictions about academy players but all you can do is look at players who stand out for their age group and compare them with past players who showed the same gulf in ability between them and their peers. Wilson would be comparable with Rossi, Pogba, Pique, Macheda, Welbeck and Januzaj in this regard. Nothing is guaranteed but those are pretty good odds he'll be a quality player.

231~~~
Yeah impossible to predict these things and I've seen more of Powell than Wilson, so it may not have been the best comparison. I see Powell as player who with the right manager, has the natural skills to make it. He seems like a natural goal scorer with a deeper intuition and footballing brain than most youngsters I've seen.

232~~~
you see...I don't see Powell as a striker at all.

233~~~
Wilson is English and has been at the club since he was nine. There will be a massive desire within the club for him to make it here. He also has that magic Manchester United ingredient that Rossi and Macheda lacked - pace! 

Wilson often scores spectacular goals. I was encouraged to see such sharp poacher instincts from him last night. If he was good in the air he would be a complete striker. 

Rossi is a fantastic player BTW. He nearly got a transfer to Barcelona a few years back but sadly his career has been blighted by serious injury. Nonetheless, he has still managed 16 goals in 20 games for Fiorentina this season and will probably be seen at the World Cup with a leading nation.

234~~~
Didn't the poor little fecker pick up another ACL knack quite recently?

He's a terrific player though. Goal-scoring record speaks for itself. So unlucky with injuries. Could have gone on to become one of the best strikers in the world IMO.

235~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Yep he'll grow up to be quite the looker

236~~~
I thought he was injured again?

237~~~
I actually agree that despite his goals he wasn't particularly impressive yesterday, certainly when compared to his form for the youth teams. But that can only be a compliment when you've scored 2 goals on your debut - there is certainly more to come from this lad.

238~~~
It wasn't really a game where a pacy direct striker was ever going to get a chance to do much more than poach. Hull played with very little ambition, and sat incredibly deep. His best performances for the youth sides have come against teams who leave space in behind the defence for him to run into.

That said, it's not as if he did anything <i>wrong</i> on the ball. Showed his composure, his nice touch and some neat link-up passing.

239~~~
Yep I would Rothwell higher than Pearson at the moment(Rothwell was put on the CL squad by Moyes) but that's really just my personal view. As for Will Keane the injury he got in last year(I think) really put him back and then the loan move this season was pointless why anyone at United thought sending him to QPR would be ever be a good idea. 

Overall it's hard to know what's next for him but I do hope United stick with him.

240~~~

Rossi is on the comeback trail and is in the frame for the World Cup. I agree also that he could have been a top 5 striker in the world if he had been more fortunate with injury.

241~~~
This guy reminds me of Alan Shearer. Proper CF, poacher, can strike with both feet, physical. Could be special.

242~~~
That's great news. Balotelli's been acting the maggot (again) so if Guiseppe can get fit he's got a good chance of featuring. Would love to see him playing for Italy in a World Cup.

243~~~
Might turn out to be crap. Maybe world class. Or maybe another Rooney. Who knows?

244~~~
Hard to say quite what his top level could have been, but he's definitely plentyu good enough to have remained and carved out a career at United if things had gone differently.  It's crazy when you see people listing him alongside Macheda as a player who was "overhyped" as a kid.

245~~~
You're right about Hull. With experience will come more of an idea of how to tailor his game to different opposition. 

I did feel though, especially early on, he looked nervy, was struggling with his touch and had a couple of stray passes. Also missed a decent chance. He grew into the game but rarely got too involved with the build up play after that, which probably benefitted his game as I've not seen him drop deep too often for the 21s or 18s. 

As I say though, it's hardly a criticism - he scored 2 goals. It was a decent but unspectacular performance, but given most of us have seen that he's capable of the latter, we have much more to look forward to.

246~~~
Well, that's not exactly what I meant. I mean, he <i>did</i> tailor his game to this opposition, didn't he? He scored two goals!

It was never going to <i>look</i> as good a performance as the ones where he's on the ball all the time, beating the offside trap and rounding the keeper, scoring long-range stunners etc etc. But that was because of the way Hull set up, to prevent that sort of thing. His performance was just as effective as ever. I didn't see much wrong with it.

Also, the pedant in me can't help pointing out that despite what the commentators said, he didn't <i>miss</i> that early chance. He looked to have struck it perfectly cleanly, but was denied by an excellent last-ditch block from the defender. The commentator on my stream (and on the hour-long sky highlights) got it into his head that Wilson mishit the ball, but I saw him catch it cleanly.

247~~~
Sorry to keep banging on about Rossi in a thread about Wilson but just been googling for an update on his injury and turns out he actually made his comeback last night, coming on as a sub. He scored a goal an' all. Great stuff.

248~~~
He has only made two sub appearances and there are only two games left but there was a report on Skysports saying that he is in consideration. He was top scorer in Italy before his injury and could be the best Italian striker at this point in time.

It is bizarre. I think it was a mistake by Fergie to let him go, perhaps he was seen as being too Spanish in style and not pacey enough.

249~~~
The writing was on the wall from the moment he signer that no-neck troll, Tevez. 

What really bothers me, though, is the thought that if we could have found a way to hold on to Rossi he could have had Michael Owen's place in the squad.

250~~~
A young Micheal Owen.

251~~~
You mean place on the injury table?

252~~~
Fair enough on the first point - no complaints, I just don't feel he'd get those sort of chances on a regular basis against opposition set up like that. They were right place, right time finishes - obviously still a massive part of any striker's game - but we didn't see anything particularly eye catching like we know he's capable of. As much as they were both good finishes, they were a direct result of Hull mistakes. The first was poor marking and failing to deal with Fellaini and once it was knocked back in it could have been one of several that tucked it away. The second was just over commitment against us on the counter and the ball only fell to him because of a poor finish/good save/bit of both. I'm not sure most Premier League sides would make those sort of errors with any sort of regularity and Hull probably wouldn't have had they had more to play for.

I'm not really sure where I'm going with all that, as I say you really can't complain, I was just pointing out that he's capable of a lot more, even against opposition that sit back. The sky commentators (who were shite) seemed to suggest he was a poacher above anything else, and while his performance last night might seem to support that, it's not really an accurate representation of his game at all. I had the sky commentators on a sketchy stream from somewhere last night and rewatched parts of it properly on sky this morning, at neither time did I notice the block but I take that back if that's the case.

253~~~
currently on pace for 76 goals in a season

254~~~
Brilliant. Such a talent and a real shame we didn't see more of him at United. Shame that his career has been full of so many injuries.

255~~~
I thought the same a few weeks ago!

256~~~
Just quoting this one, but I'm struggling to understand a few of your comments today. For me Wilson has every chance of making it at this club as Januzaj did last summer which he took. Wilson for me goes in the Pogba/Januzaj bracket of talent who don't need to go through the loan system to be able to break into the first team. He may do of course if he finds opportunities scarce, but I can srongly see him being our fourth striker next season.

From what I can understand from your posts, you haven't actually seen that much of Wilson, is that right?

257~~~
Disappointed we might not get into Europa competition next season. It would have been great experience for the likes of Wilson, Lawrence, etc. 

On his debut, he did well and showed he is an intelligent footballer in the box. He still has a way to go and I can see him becoming one of United most prolific goalscorer if his development does not hit a stumbling block.

258~~~
Also I wonder how many more times people are going to come into this thread telling us to calm down and then remind us of Macheda, just as they were doing last summer with Januzaj.

Do you people think Wilsons career started yesterday or something?

259~~~
Looks like he's been getting posing lessons from RVP.

260~~~
Obviously he needs to be playing now at a higher level. If he does go on loan I hope it doesn't end up like Rossi's or macheda's loans spells which didn't work out for them at all.

261~~~
Perhaps giggs will take a job where he can take a few lads on loan!
Develop them a bit and in two or three years they can all come back home

262~~~
I haven't no, so I'm only going on what little I've seen. Although part of my logic is also based on my view that the prospects of youth talent breaking through to the first team are quite bleak, because we now have to deal with competing with the sugar daddy clubs who are capable of buying their way to the op through expensive transfers. I'm quite sure that we will be forced to take similar measures to keep up with them, which will make first team spots fiercely difficult for youth players to attain. Januzaj is a special talent and will obviously make it, and Powell has a decent chance as well. Beyond that, its going to be very difficult.

263~~~
rossi was a fantastic young player and was scoring goals for fun for the youth and reserve team circa 2004-2006. no doubt he was always going to be a top player but unfortunately for him we got van nistelrooy, rooney, saha, ole, ronaldo and then tevez came in and i didn;t include alan smith there because he is not good enough. and then of course the newcastle loan move didn;t work so well for him. but he got a second chance when he move to spain, not surprised he is doing ever so well now, just like he did at villareal before because he was so good as a young player. love to see him staring in the world cup this summer.

wilson seems to has the knack of scoring goals just like rossi did before. and he is not only about goals, but he got the ability to actually dribble and his movement off the ball is also good. hope the club will not consider loaning him out, there have been little success with our youngsters going out on loan these days.

264~~~
I mean this with no disrespect, but you're not really able to give a decent account as to who's likely to break through and who are the clear stand out talents etc in youth if you don't watch much of it. The same way I can't really give a decent account as to whether or not I think Powell has a decent chance of carving a career here.

For example, Januzaj was head and shoulders above all other players from the academy, it was clear to those who watched him regularly as to how special he was and that if he could translate his performances to first team level then he was bound to make it. Even after he broke through, those people who hadn't watched anything of him was trying to heed caution to us getting excited and tried to remind us about Macheda even though they knew nothing of Adnan.

The same trend seems to be happening here. For me, Wilson is the standout player at reserve level and the one player I would personally put into the special category of young talent. For me, he's about as nailed on as you can get from an academy player to make it at this club. He's no Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar level wonderkid talent. But he sure is a talent and I'm very confident that he will make it here. Not that I class myself as the leading authority of youth players to make it here but I'm almost as certain that he will make it as I was with Januzaj last year and I'd be very happy if Hernandez left to pave way for Wilson to take his place. Not that I think Wilson is currently a better player than Hernandez, but their circumstances are different and Hernandez is too good to just be rotting on the bench, whereas for Wilson it would be a fantastic opportunity. 

Yes, I agree on the whole it's hard to judge whether or not a youth player can make it, especially at a club like ours. But there will always be those special players like Pogba, Januzaj, Morrison etc who you just know that they have "it" and for me Wilson falls into that category and I think he's good enough to not need a loan just like the others mentioned.

You didn't see Wilson at his best last night, of course not, by the time we actually started to play football he was subbed off. But what you did see was him take 2 chances, for a seasoned pro it might seem like the easiest chances in the world, but for an 18 year old who was only playing u18s at the beginning of the season to now take those chances in front of 75,000 people under that kind of pressure is immense. He's not a poacher by any stretch of the imagination, unlike Hernandez he can actually create chances from nothing, he can take players on, he can shoot from anywhere really and has great accuracy. He's going to be a star, that I'm certain of.

265~~~
If he makes it he makes it. If he doesn't, he doesn't. We'll see over the next few years.

Hopefully for him and United that he does and becomes a top player for the club.

266~~~
Guilty as charged your honour. I used to be, but my love for football has seriously waned over the last 10 years and with it all the smaller parts of it. I used to take great delight in being able to reel off every player for every club that was in europe, and I wanted to know everything about United- not any more though. I couldn't even reel off all the english clubs players anymore. So even though I am guilty, I do agree with you. But to be honest, I just can't be arsed with knowing every little thing anymore.

267~~~
My thoughts too. The commentator when it happened was having a go at him saying he has to be putting those away but from what I saw he connected well and it was going in the bottom corner if not for the great block.

268~~~
There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. He's being cnutish with the "supporters" bit.

269~~~
Agreed. I'm a big follower of our youth team, but I wouldn't expect everyone else to be as passionate about the youngsters as me. 

Maybe if people realised just how talented some of the kids were, they might take more interest but it's certainly no disgrace for people to not be aware. Although I would advise people to take a trip to the youth forum from time to time, they can learn a lot and watch some good videos.

270~~~
Excellent post. 
Agree with everything.

271~~~
I think this lad is for real. Could be our best homegrown attacker since Scholesy.

272~~~
Insightful post and some good perspective

273~~~
Yep. Januzaj and Wilson were the two standout young players in the last few years. Not much doubt Wilson will make it imo.

274~~~
Here ya go.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5dFgez6nGo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

275~~~
Good post, but to be honest i'm not basing my view on how much or little I've seen him play, but more so on the dynamics of United competing with City, Chelsea, (and Arse/Pool) in the sugar daddy era. Whether or not certain youth players are given a chance is going to be based less on how good they are and more so on what our squad priorities to win trophies. Wilson could end up being a very good player who never makes it at United (by making it I mean being a consistent starting XI player), if our new manager buys most of his players from the outside in order to get a squad capable of competing with City, Chelsea, Madrid, PSG, etc.

276~~~
From the video above and the many times I have see him,  have come to the conclusion that he plays like the Brazilian Ronaldo. He is like no other striker that I can compare to.

He has pace, power, elegance with the ball, has a goal poacher characteristic, he gets involved in the making of play, he has the inelegance that is seen in very few strikers. He breezes past players.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8bZhNBQktQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

277~~~
Ronaldo the best finisher ever, a lot to live up to.

278~~~
Please take 10 mins out of your day to compare the two videos and you will see a lot of things similar that you really see in other strikers. Of course there are things different, they are different players. But there is a striking resemblance.

279~~~
Great video I thought Id seen most of Ronaldos goals but theres actually quite a few on that Id never seen before

280~~~
I really think Wilson has a future, have been watching him for over a year. But it's scary the way this thread has gone, can we let him make his 2nd appearance.

281~~~
He scored 2 goals, so it's obviously a fine performance.  Now we need to see how good the rest of his game is.

282~~~
May as well just give him the #9 shirt and be done with it.

Ronaldo <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

283~~~
He reminds me of Fernando Torres, back when Torres still played football.

284~~~
So in the last few pages he has been compared to the likes Ronaldo and Fernando Torres. Nice to see that we are not going over the top with the hype.

285~~~
There is a difference between comparing styles of play with their level of ability.

286~~~
Rooney reminds me of Shrek. That doesn't mean I think he lives under a fecking tree.

287~~~
I think a player comparison only works if level of ability is considered. I think most strikers would want to play in the style Brazilian Ronaldo did.

288~~~
Good point.

289~~~
This.

You're just wrong though. I can say 'Joe Bloggs plays like Van Persie' without meaning that he's as good as Van Persie.

But there's nothing so sure as the fact that if you try to do that on the Caf, the 'calm down calm down, he's barely even played for us yet!' crowd will materialise faster than you can say 'in the mould of'. Every caftard more desperate than the next to be 'the balanced, objective one'.

290~~~
I am just saying it is a meaningless comparison to make if you do not factor in level of ability. Every striker would want to play like Van Persie it only matters if they are capable of playing in that fashion.

291~~~
That is wrong though. There are numerous of different way to play a position. Every striker would not want to play like Van Persie because some would rather use a style based off pace or others style their game off strength like Drogba or as a target man either best in the air or holding up the ball on the ground. Plenty of styles to play every position. My mate plays a similar style to Carrick, he is in no way a similar level of ability to Carrick.

292~~~
The whole point, the whole point, of comparing a young players to one who has already come into his own is to give others an idea of what his style is like. 

It would be extremely unhelpful to compare him to someone else young of similar ability instead.

293~~~
To be fair, saying he will be somewhere between Ronaldo and Fernando Torres applies to many many many many footballers.

294~~~
Like Gradi and Ferguson. Unfortunately we loan him out and he gets no experience whatsoever as a central midfielder, just as a forward. He's not going to make it as a central midfielder if he's not playing there week in week out and correcting his issues. He's certainly not ready as a cm, but he's scored goals at a good rate on loan as a striker. If we give him a chance next season its very likely to be continuing as a striker. Sir Alex nor Gradi will be our manager, the ones who wanted to use him as a central midfielder

295~~~
If we are serious about him and see him as a central midfielder than we should get him back instead of loaning him out again. At lower clubs his goal scoring ability will always entice managers to use him in more forward positions. It is better that he trains here with the first team and gets played in central midfield in cup games or against bottom table PL opposition.

296~~~
He has been blown out beyond all proportion that on his 2nd appearance, even if he isn't bad, if he isn't faultless he will probably get canned by a certain number of "Fans" and people will change their opinion of him.

297~~~
One of the best goal:game ratios in top European leagues this season.

298~~~
My brother said something about Aston Villa fans rating him so we know Wilson's quality...

299~~~
Both goal process and how he finished them, reminds me of Kevin Phillips when partnered with that big pole Niall Quinn.

300~~~
I just personally think that some players have that little bit extra, and Januzaj has proved that if you're good enough then you'll Get a chance. Take Lawrence for example, he's a very good player and very talented on the ball, but I couldn't tell you if I think he has that edge to be able to be given proper chances here although he certainly wasn't lacking in confidence when he played the other night. 

Of course I wouldn't expect Wilson to become our first choice striker, but I think there's definitely a place for him and I hope he continues to get chances so that he can show the rest of his qualities.

301~~~
This guy has a really remarkable attitude, he plays with real joy in his game. He never yells or looks all intense and angry after a goal, it's always a little comfortable smile. He plays with the sort of joy I associate with Brazilians, like he's out on the dance floor having fun. 

Haven't seen this posted:


<span style="font-size: 22px"><b> Wilson intends to kick on</b></span>
<b>James Wilson aims to take his Manchester United career to the next level following his two-goal debut at a packed Old Trafford.</b>

The 18-year-old’s pair of strikes went a long way to helping the Reds to a 3-1 win over Hull City, but it was a far cry from his last outing at the stadium, an Under-21 game against Norwich last month.

Wilson showed no nerves in front of a packed Theatre of Dreams, putting United two ahead with a pair of clinical finishes, each following up on set-up work from Marouane Fellaini.

“It was a great feeling, you can’t compare it to anything else,” Wilson told MUTV. ”The first goal was just sheer euphoria and then the second was just a great experience. The ground is a lot different without 75,000 people, but just to play here even in front of a small crowd for the Under-21s is still a great experience to play on such a ground. With all the fans here tonight it was even better.”

Wilson came close to an appearance a month ago, having been <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/fanzone/news-and-blogs/2014/apr/blog-james-wilson-gives-hope-for-the-future.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the bench for the win over Newcastle,</a> but having now made his bow, is convinced he can cope with the demands of top-flight football after representing the Under-18s, Under-19s and Under-21s this term.

“I feel like I can deal with the physicality and pace of the game. I just need to try to get as many games as possible under my belt for the experience. If you’re getting on in the club, you have to be progressing so obviously scoring for every age group is a good sign. I’ve got where I am now but I have to kick on.”

303~~~
2 goals in a meaningless game= the new Neymar.


In all seriousness, my favourite part of the game these days is when we get to see new young players for the first time.

An already established player making a debut for his new club and doing well is good, but when any club brings a youngster on and they have a blinder it's brilliant.

304~~~
2 down, 248 more to beat Sir Bobby.

305~~~
Excellent posts. I remember the exact discussions in the januzaj thread last summer too. I agree Wilson is definitely special. People who haven't seen much of him will realise it soon enough .

306~~~
Aye, its absolutely fine to not be heavily involved about the kids at the club, not everyone has the time or even the interest. I personally am somewhere in the middle. Not even close to being as involved as the likes of you, brightonian and KM but I certainly keep some sort of a track of the progress of the likes of Pearson, Periera, Wilson obviously, Rothwell etc. 

Anyways, coming to Wilson, I totally agree with you. Has a lot of tools to become an absolutely top player. Great speed, technique, beats players and a good finish in him. I'l be amazed if he doesnt make it here.

307~~~
He's about as similar to Pele as Rooney is!

Someone mentioned Lewandowski as someone with a similar skill set. 

Of course all this comparison to other players is a bit daft. For anyone who hasn't seen Wilson it's not really all that useful to associate him with Van Persie or whoever, but I guess it's a start. 

Let's you know he's not the Heskey sort at least.

308~~~
Anyone know what his contract situation is?

309~~~
He is the white Lewandowski then...settled.

310~~~
Nor is he as handsome.

311~~~
Owen had blistering pace, but doesn't seem as physical. He's got the Shearer look about him which is a good thing clearly.

312~~~
He's been compared to a ridiculous number of people <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ronaldo, Torres, Owen, RvP, Kevin Phillips, Lewandowski, I've even seen Podolski somewhere <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

326~~~
Can we stop with the comparisons please?

327~~~
Serious question; why is there always hassle with our young players and contracts? Is there a rule for contrast length etc with youth players?

328~~~
Yes it's the same with every english club. You can sign professionally at 16 but can only offer a small length contract.

329~~~
But at 18 you can sign for as long as you like, no?

330~~~
That's what I thought alright.

331~~~
Yep.

332~~~
It's basically this.

At 16- they can sign a pro contract but for maximum of 3 years.
At 18- Whatever the feck they feel like.

333~~~
Really hope Wilson signs a new deal as soon as possible. I'd like to see him get more chances here next season or go out on loan at least. 

It's a shame we're unlikely to qualify for the Europa League as we could've given the likes of Wilson game time there, at least in the group stage, whilst saving the senior players for the league.

334~~~
Yes the rules are more relaxed, it's to stop young players signing up for 6 years and then never playing in the first teams, by 22 their chace
Pretty sure he will be going nowhere. 

You can tell from him talking last night that he seem's very happy and proud, and wants to kick on and get even more first team football. 

Next year I would not be surprised if he's our 4th choice or has a year or loan at another prem club.

335~~~
I'd definitely prefer it if he stayed here. It'd probably be the best for his development, as long as he got the game time he needs.

If Hernandez leaves, which I think he will, then I reckon Wilson will stay put here and make a good few first team appearances next season. I'd love to see him kick on like Januzaj has this year.

336~~~
I only saw the highlights but he showed great box instincts and scored one with either foot, great start and he has a confident air about him.

337~~~
It's good to see another young talent emerge from the youths. He's done very well against Hull and showed great a great strikers instinct. It'll be great to see him get a long term contract at this club and get plenty of chances. The most important thing though is for him to take it one game at a time, keep working hard in training, listen to those who have been there before him and most of all, ignore the media hype. There's plenty to work on but he's making a great start.

338~~~
No it's not…

At 15/16 they are offered a scholarship. The club usually uses a range of offers depending on how well they thing the player will progress. As most players don't make the grade many clubs are pretty conservative unless someone is clearly outstanding. This is sometimes hard to tell or the player is having trouble with injuries or other factors.

Here are a few examples:

One year Scholarship (1+0)
Two year Scholarship (2+0)
Three year Scholarship (3+0)
One year Scholarship plus one year Pro deal (1+1)
One year Scholarship plus two year Pro deal (1+2)

And so on…

When we sign a young talent from another club at 15 yo we might offer a 2+2 in a bid to attract the player, guarantee them a Pro deal to ward off competition from other clubs.

So as a further example, one player might be offered a one-year Scholarship and does OK in his first year. He might then be offered further one-year deal. He does OK and has now turned 17. We might still not offer a Pro contract because we are not certain he will make it. So he is offered a further one-year Scholarship. Other players are released after the first or second year because the club decides they won't make it.

Someone like Andreas Pereira might have been offered a 2+2 so he is on a Scholarship for two years, then signs a two-year Pro deal when he turns 17…the legal age. Which means he is out of contract when he turns 19. 

Many agents suggest that young players sign short-term deals to start with. The club also prefers this, again to see how the players progress. The club also takes risks that the name of Manchester United, playing with great players, the youth history etc will entice youngsters to stay without committing to long contracts.

To be fair to the club, I wouldn't want everyone on five year deals…the backlog of players would be horrendous and most would need to go on loan to get games.

I understand that 90% of this seasons U/18's have been offered one-year Pro deals and most will probably sign it. However, on occasions, for a range of reasons, some players turn down the deal and move on. 

It also comes down to the club finances and how much budget they have for youth contracts. 

I don't know the specifics with James Wilson, but he signed as a Pro when he was 17 which suggests it was a two-year deal.

339~~~
Cheers man. Didn't had any idea of this 2+2 stuff.

340~~~
Appears he and Powell are injured because they're both not on the tour and weren't on the roster for the Reserves' first preseason game. 

I think Wilson should be loaned to a top Championship side or even a lower-side in the PL if van Gaal decides to hold on to Chich. If not, I would love to see him as the fourth striker for the first team and get some game-time here and there throughout the season.

341~~~
Personally I think Wilson has a chance with us this season, sending players out on loan can have both negative and positive effect, with Wilson being close to the first team I see no reason to send him out on loan.
He has the ability to become a regular this season, most likely as a sub, he's an exciting prospect, I believe/hope Van gaal will keep him at the club this season.

342~~~
I think we should allow Chicharito to leave and give his spot to Wilson because Hernandez deserves better than being a fourth choice striker and I think Wilson will benefit more from training alongside, playing with and learning from world class strikers like Van Persie and Rooney under Van Gaal's watch than he would from playing alongside average players in the Championship and a manager who is likely to deny him games should he fail to hit the ground running.

343~~~
I think it all comes down to Hernandez's future. I would rather he gets some experience on loan in the championship and get used to the physical nature of the English game, he looks a bit frail tbh. We aren't in Europe as well meaning less games to rotate players. Let's see what LVG makes of Welbeck and Hernandez first. I would prefer it if we keep Hernandez due to his reliable goalscoring record and the impact he can have on certain games. Whatever his limitations, his goalscoring record ain't one(as long as he is given minutes of course).

344~~~
He ended last season injured and he starts this one in similar fashion. I doubt he's physically ready for the rigor of a Championship loan. We should keep him here, manage his fitness and physical development properly, let him train with the first team and give him whatever game time we can.

345~~~
I am sure Giggs must have spoken highly about likes of Wilson, Lawrence, Lingard etc to LvG so pretty sure Van Gaal will have a good look at them. Particularly for Wilson, his next season involvement depends on Chicharito's future. If Chicharito somehow ends up staying then both Wilson and Keane should go on loan and to clubs who will utilize them properly. If Hernandez leaves then I hope we keep one of Keane ad Wilson with the squad and send other on loan.

346~~~
I think he'll stay at least until January so that the club can properly manage his injury problems and so he can get used to Van Gaals training methods and philosophy

347~~~
Sounds like the best idea really. Hope it's just little niggles and nothing too serious.

348~~~
It should be. It all seems to be the result of his being horribly overused last season because of the lack of strikers in the youth setup at the moment. He was playing through injury in the latter stages. Which is always a truly daft thing to do with a youngster.

349~~~
Hopefully Fletcher can share his duty this season - although I still think Fletcher's best position is second striker.

350~~~
He's been a bit injury-prone since he first arrived on the MUTV scene at 15 and his ankle still seems a bit dodgy after he fractured it a couple of years ago, so I don't think last season's woes were all down to overuse.

351~~~
Wilson is not injured, he played for the reserves against Bray Wonderers. I think he was left out of the tour because we are well covered in that area and Van Gaal wanted to give the experienced/older players a go.

352~~~
He has been injured. I was at the match yesterday and he didn't look anywhere close to fitness

353~~~
If he could back to full fitness on time I can see him involved in the last pre-season match vs. Valencia.

354~~~
That close to the season, I would think van Gaal would be going with who he thinks will be involved the following week against Swansea. Could feature on the bench though I guess but I would doubt it.

355~~~
Yeah I mean on the bench I think we'll likely bring quite a big squad since it's not a best idea to let key players play 80-90 min just a few days before our first match.

356~~~
As others have pointed out - Wilson was injured and is nowehere near match fitness.

357~~~
This lad might be the reason we let Hernandez and/or Zaha go.

James Wilson for the reserves tonight.

358~~~
Fantastic goal. Said it before and I'll say it again, he should be the new fourth striker for the first team. Especially if Hernandez is let go, because I think this kid should be getting some game time for the first team or loaned out to a PL or top Championship side.

359~~~
And another one from tonight. He can definitely finish.

360~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Hopefully he gets more first team chances this season.

361~~~
I think we should let Hernandez go so we can give Wilson some game time he is way to good for U21 football

362~~~
Really hope he gets a chance against Valencia.

363~~~
Hattrick for Wilson!

364~~~
Normally I'm all in favour of young players getting some experience out on loan but I think we should keep this one with us for the time being. He might get first team chances at some point soon.

365~~~
He looks very confident and quick, who plays him in for his second?

366~~~
This kid - I have no doubts, he's the real deal. International player within 2 seasons...

367~~~
Josh Harrop.

368~~~
She mustn't know he was injured.

369~~~
Thanks.

370~~~
He's trending.

371~~~
Really hope we keep him as fourth/fifth choice striker.

372~~~
Reminds me of a young alan shearer

373~~~
Just read on twitter he's got 27 goals in his last 31 appearances at all levels for United. Impressive.

374~~~
4th goal now

375~~~
His & United's 4th of the game.

376~~~
Wow. We got a gem on our hands.

377~~~
Quat-trick 

What a prospect this guy

378~~~
TBF he seems more akin to a young Feyenoord/ Arsenal - Van Persie. Great acceleration, elegant gait, quick decision making and a brilliant left peg. Should be ready to take over full time when the Dutchman retires.

379~~~
Pure class.

380~~~
Or third.

381~~~
This kid is born to score. How the feck did he not make the US squad?

382~~~
He had injured his finger in some way
Edit <a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/2014/07/23/manchester-united-starlet-james-wilson-suffers-finger-injury-49088/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thepeoplesperson.com/2014/07...let-james-wilson-suffers-finger-injury-49088/</a>

383~~~
Injured.

384~~~
He scored with Van Gaal's daughter, according to twitter. Legit.

385~~~
He's better than Cavani.

386~~~
I compared him with a Owen but yeah I was really really wrong. Wilson's has the look of a Van Persie, he's all round game is really class(I'm always surprised how good is passing is).

387~~~
He played in 2 friendlies during the tour....

388~~~
Pretty clear he can't spend another season in the reserves. If Hernandez does go he has to be in the first team squad, I'd be loathed to see him go on loan at this stage.

The 4th goal could have been Thierry Henry at his best.

389~~~
I hope Van Gaal is watching <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Video of his third and fourth? Or were they not that special compared to #1 and #2?

390~~~
I'm 100% sure he played a friendly 2 or 3 days after the team left for Us. Definitely not injured.

391~~~
It sure is. We have some great young talents between him, Adnan, Pearson, Blackett, Pereira and company. Van Gaal must be chuffed. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

392~~~
Josh Harrop was aslo brilliant tonight when he came on in the second half

393~~~
Yes he played with a broken finger.

394~~~
Although we need a signing in midfield I'm not too worried in the long term with the talents we've got coming through. And add Van Gaal's record with youth players the next few years(hopefully)could be really special.

395~~~
Yes him too. I'd rather we promote from within and give them a try if the chance to sign absolute top quality players doesn't materialize.

100 % agreed. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

396~~~
Get this man in the first team.

397~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/MVKUx30M7Tb/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>
His first.

398~~~
If this guy isnt our next top striker then we are doing something wrong.

399~~~
BTW where can one see the 3rd goal ? Not on youtube.. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

400~~~
LVG will be well aware of this kid and he won't be afraid to put him in the first team either.

401~~~
I reckon this guy will be better than Welbeck in a few years.

402~~~
He's just born to score.

403~~~
Definitely a better natural goal scorer already.

404~~~
She works for the MEN, I'd be surprised if she knew how to piss into a toilet.

405~~~
His pace and acceleration, as well as his ball control is just sublime. That's not even mentioning his clinicality (IT'S A WORD RIGHT?) in front of goal.

If we bring him up right, he can be the complete striker in no time.

406~~~
Get him on the end of Herrera and Mata through balls.

407~~~
The 4th was almost as good as the 1st, amazing touch to control the ball and then fantastic balance and speed to get in front of the defender and then touch the ball past the keeper with a feather touch.

408~~~
No he didn't. He didn't even go to America. He did take part in a few reserve friendlies but according to those who saw them he didn't look match fit.

409~~~
He's perfect for this 3-4-1-2.

410~~~
Don't want him to go on loan to some club who'll injure/bench him. Keep him at United and give him games, he's ready.

411~~~
Yup. Should definitely be apart of the first team in my opinion. He's good enough.

412~~~
See my post above. A broken finger was considered an injury last time I checked! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> I might be wrong here but I think he also picked up a separate injury towards the end of last season so that may have been another reason for him not going on the tour.

413~~~
People did say he didn't look match fit in those reserve matches.

414~~~
Broken finger and they wanted to keep him at Carrington with no-contact training. People at the first match vs. Bray said he looked uncomfortable.

I'd imagine he meant the reserve tour.

415~~~
Ya in hindsight that must have been what he meant. I thought when he said "the tour" he was talking about the first team's tour.

416~~~
I did indeed.

417~~~
Goals (click them if necessary, it renders the thumbnails crappily for me):

418~~~
Is it the camera angle or does he look a lot taller than at the end of last season? I expect he'd be 6' but that video makes him look taller (or the City defenders short).

419~~~
all his goals in a Vine thanx to BusbyMUFC:

<a class="externalLink" href="https://vine.co/u/956370727169413120" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vine.co/u/956370727169413120</a>

420~~~
Recycling the Zaha story

421~~~
Anyone think he is similar to Hernandez? Both goal poachers who like to play on the last man, both clinical infront of goal although Hernandez less so last season and both good in the air.

Wilson's all round game seems slightly better in that he can dribble past his man. A loan move should be arranged for him to test himself week in, week out against top sides as he's outgrown the reserves now and he won't get much game time this season. RvP is 31 now, so we should be developing Wilson to take his place when that day comes.

422~~~
Did Pereira give that pass at the 2nd goal?

423~~~
I think he needs to replace Hernandez, we already have two of the best strikers in the world that will score more than enough for us.. Going from his recent performances he would really benefit from playing with the first team, a loan isn't an option in my opinion because he needs to get used to the system we're currently playing.

424~~~
Any relation to that Ryan Wilson kid we had on trial back in the late 80s early 90s ?

425~~~
Josh Harrop

426~~~
I love his fourth, the way he just shrugs the defender off is brilliant.

427~~~
He has the movement and finishing of Hernandez but has a much more rounded game. Can score from anywhere,  take players on effortlessly and has strength as well as pace. He has the potential to be a complete striker.

428~~~
Not at all imo. Wilson has great long shots and generally has a great shot which I don't think Hernandez has. Hernandez is a good finisher but I'd liken Wilson's shooting more to RvP than Hernandz. Calling Wilson a goal poacher is a great disservice too as I think he is quite good at link-up play and as you point to he has fantastic at dribbling past defenders.

Chicha should be sold and Wilson take the fourth spot. For the first half of the season give him cup games, sub appearances and the odd start against weaker opposition. In January assess how much playing time he is getting and maybe send him on loan for the remainder of the season. By then he'll have build up a strong reputation throughout the league and clubs will be begging for him with promises of game time.

429~~~
"The ball has its own energy or life force, if you will. Its natural environment is in the hole. Why don’t you send him home? His bags are packed. He has his plane ticket. Bring him to the airport. Send him home. Send him home."

- from Happy Gilmore.

He most certainly knows how to send that ball home.

430~~~
It was Harrop winning the ball and dribbling past a player getting fouled before passing to Pereira and Pereira to Wilson i think.


So Pereira made the pass to Wilson.

431~~~
Just to eliminate extra clicking. Thanks for them.

432~~~
He looks like a man taking the piss in a under 14's match. He's got to be in our squad this season, if Kagawa and Chicha are sold there will be plenty of game time for him.

433~~~
LvG is completely aware of Wilson, he included his name in one of his recent interviews when reeling off the strikers he has at the club.

434~~~
He did ? 

Included Will Keane IIRC.  And mentioned Powell along with Januzaj, Fellaini and RVP in his last interview in terms of those not on tour.

He'll be aware of him for sure anyway, as will his staff but not seen him fully yet.

435~~~
Just like Raham Sterling, who was exceptional at this level, I believe James Wilson can also make the same transition and be amongst the brightest up and coming talent in football. I love having Hernandez in the team just because of his attitude and poacher trait, but we need to start implementing Wilson in the first team, as such I would not mind if Hernandez leaves and Wilson becomes our 4th or 5th striker in this 1-3-5-2 system.

436~~~
Oh shit so it was.

437~~~
What is hell in this? Why do people put a 1 for the keeper? It's not like we're going to play 2 keepers are we?

438~~~
Definitely mentioned Wilson as a player he is aware of and and will be looking at.

439~~~
It is because their are eleven players on the pitch, not 10 or 12. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

440~~~
van Gaal says it (often says 1-4-3-3 in his interviews) so now it's cool to do so.

441~~~
He has that great ability to run at pace with the ball, I would say hard to find amongst our players. I guess Januzaj does that the best. Very good trait for a striker.
And I don’t mean running at straight line (Valencia-esque) of course.

442~~~
He really does look exciting. You don't want to get ahead of yourself, but I really hope he makes it.

443~~~
Van Gaal copied me.

444~~~
Oh, never noticed him say it. Still a weird and stupid thing to say imo.

445~~~
Are there <i>still</i> people around who think he's a poacher? Bloody hell, catch up. For me, the best comparison is still to Lewandowski. A true all rounder, good at all aspects of the game and capable of any type of goal you can imagine; with pace, ball control and the mental strength to be a really clinical finisher as his particular strengths.

446~~~
He was better of playing full games back home than the odd few minutes here and there up front in America. LVG had about 10 payers vying for front three spots in the first team squad and his priority was deciding the futures of the likes of Chic and Kagawa.

447~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqXm9kykJxg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

448~~~
I think if we don't promote the ad and give him a chance it will be criminal. He's dominating at the reserve level like Januzaj did. Well Januzaj wasn't this prolific but they both possess the air of class at that level that just looks a notch above anyone else. We don't need to buy a striker. We only need to nurture this talent and let him play second fiddle to Rooney, RVP and Welbeck. RVP has a couple years of greatness left in him and Rooney looks to be showing some real prowess under Van Gaal, so that's a few more years of him being our star man. Welbeck may yet still bloom into a wonderful talent. 

The difference with Wilson is he's showing maturity that Welbeck didn't have at that age. Welbeck was phenomenal at that level as well but the difference is he had a great physique to help him with that which Wilson doesn't exactly have. Wilson is par for the norm for an English player at that age, yet he has the brains and nous which make him a formidable talent.

449~~~
I read his contract is up this Summer? I heard the club are not worried about him renewing, is this true?

450~~~
Imagine a home grown front three of Welbeck, Wilson and Januzaj for League Cup games next season.

451~~~
Quiet confidence. I like it. 

He doesn't have the silky dribbling skills of most modern strikers, but he is a classic English striker from yesteryear. He's got pace, knows how to use his body and has lethal finishing skills. Intelligent players who is two-footed as well. Only good things can come for this lad. Haven't been this excited for a prospect since Pogba. Of course, Januzaj was always a class above, but he has that talent perfect for being moulded by the likes of LVG.

His debut at first-team level cannot be underestimated. That was a level above him, but the way he coped is what gives me encouragement.

452~~~
Wow... that would mean a resurgence in our academy since the early 90's. Let's credit Warren Joyce and Nicky Butt shall we? They've put in tremendous work to make our academy relevant again. By relevant, I mean a valid option to buying from buying outside the club.

Blackett and Michael Keane are other talents who look the part.

453~~~
And Reece Hamez <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

454~~~
Of course. His rise has been nothing short of meteoric.

455~~~
The credit has to go a bit further back than that. Butt came in in 2012. The overhaul that has led to these generations coming through at the moment (and since Pogba and Morrison et al in 2011, really) started in 2007.

456~~~
Fair point. I mean that the two coaches have worked together in assessing how to nurture talents over the past two years and that's really helped speed things along.

457~~~
Yep. Joyce does deserve particular praise because there were plenty of people who simply didn't think he was a capable enough coach when it came to the small technical players, given the preference for a more athletic style which he had shown at times earlier in his career with us. But he's proven that he's always just been about playing the style of football best suited to the abilities of the players at his disposal, and with more and more technically gifted generations coming through, we've been playing more and more technical football. He got plenty of criticism, so he definitely now deserves the corresponding kudos.

458~~~
I could see him ending up as a winger under LVG, as his biggest strength seems to be his ability to run with the ball, and we're much weaker there than elsewhere:

Wilson---RVP/Rooney---Januzaj
-------------Mata---------
-----Herrera----NewCM---

Maybe by the end of next season even?

459~~~
Is the first touch for his fourth off his heel? I thought it was a slightly dodgy touch at first, looping up like that, but if it was behind him and he scooped it into his stride then it's very impressive.

Nah, his biggest strength is his goalscoring, of all types. Should never be played anywhere but as a #9, for me. Ok, wide striker maybe, but not a winger.

460~~~
I do like left-footed strikers; something about them gives them an edge sometimes over right footers.

461~~~
I agree. I always thought that perhaps defenders and keepers are use to playing against right footers more often that a left-footer has an advantage by default. 

Obviously teams do their homework and the defenders may be made aware that a striker is left footed, but it's still going likely to be instinctual to put someone onto their left foot. Keepers the same when they come to greet and try to read their body shape and guess how they're going to hit a ball and where. That one flash moment of trying to remind yourself the player is left footed, or the fact that you're automatically going to favour how a right footer would likely hit it could make all the difference.

It's probably bollocks and most professionals play against enough left footers in training that it really means shit all to them.

462~~~
Yeah its his heel it reminded me a bit of his touch for this goal at 2:10:20
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kGdmlv-iGE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

463~~~
Yep, almost an identical touch!

464~~~
Possibly an inverted winger who has a licence to cut inside and play in the middle - as well as take players on down the flanks like <a class="username" data-user="84160, @NoPace" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84160/">@NoPace</a> suggested.

He would obviously be best playing right up top, though. He has a great natural goalscoring talent that will only get better with age!

465~~~
It was the right decision that he wasn't on the tour
If he isn't injury-free and works very hard then he'll have a massive future <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

We've just the League Cup and the Premier League in 2014.....Van Persie makes maybe his comeback in the 2nd Round of the League Cup.......i doubt we'll see many youngsters in the League Cup this season

466~~~
Being a poacher doesn't mean you can do nothing but put the ball in the net. Van Persie is our poacher, despite being technically excellent and often getting involved in the build up of moves. Wilson reminds me more of a young Michael Owen tbh because of his pace. dribbling ability and clinical finishing. Owen was a poacher, but hardly useless at anything else. Wilson would suit Van Persie's role far more than Rooney's imo. Massive potential regardless.

467~~~
Fantastic goals. Has everything to make a great number 9 for us.

468~~~
The kid's brilliant. Unbelievable talent. I'm usually skeptical about young players making the step up even when they have an abundance of talent but there's seemingly no way Wilson won't be a great player. He's been taking the piss in the youths and reserves for years (well kinda) and he's already got 2 premier league goals to his name

469~~~
the best and most talented forward from our youth system for quite sometime for sure. great talent he is, got everything needed as a striker in his locker. the last time we got a youth striker who was too good at youth level and reserves(back then) was giuseppe rossi, although he was not from our academy as we signed him as a 16 year old from parma years back.

unluckily for rossi though, combination of injuries, poor loan moves and of course a huge lists of top class forwards in the team  back then, it was tough for him to become a regular at united.

hope whatever moves van gaal make for wilson, it is going to benefit the lad. i guess he is ready to be our 4th forward already.

470~~~
If Chicharito is sold, then this guy should be the 4th forward. No Champions League anyway.

The best move for the club might be to force Chicharito to stay one more season to give Wilson another year of development before he makes the step up.

No reason for the club to sell Hernandez and then have to buy a short term solution.

471~~~
All of us are proud of the class of 92 and yet we fail to acknowledge that for those players to make it, others had to leave. We allowed estabilished internationals like Sharpe, Parker, Kanchelskis and Ince to leave to give more playing time to Giggs, Gary Nev, Beckham and Scholes. 

I believe that there's no better season to do the leap of faith then this season. We're out of the CL which would mean that there will be less games were experience is crucial. I'd say we should sell the likes of Kagawa, Fellaini, Anderson and Hernandez. We should promote Jesse Lingaard (ideal cover for Mata), Wilson and Powell and the money generated should be spent on bringing a quality DM and CB.

472~~~
Also the FA Cup.

The LC was more fun when the kids played, but with competition so fierce  in the EPL, and the pressure to win any cup so high, that teams are taking the LC seriously these days

Hasn't helped that we've drawn EPL opposition for half our games in the LC recently either.

473~~~
Agree with most of this except Lingard being Backup to Mata. Januzaj would be ahead of him for that and Powell as well, i'd guess. If we are sticking to 3-5-2 he needs a loan probably.

Selling Cheech and pushing Wilson into the squad seems bit of a simple decision to me at this point, as much as i love Cheech. LVG has not seem him though, so not sure he'd be in a position already to make that call though.

It would be best for both Cheech and Wilson though.

474~~~
difficult one this....

Hernandez is obviously a great option from the bench but he's not overly happy with this arrangement and if you believe rumours he could be on his way.

Is Wilson ready for that role if we move Chicharito on - I'd expect him to get a fair chunk of football depending on RVPs fitness but he could get 20 minutes here and there when we are winning/chasing games.

I suppose Van Gaal also has the option of Rooney or Welbeck at 9 if RVP is out and Wilson could still perform that role.

I haven't watched him closely but he certainly seems to have more to his game than Macheda did who was prolific.

475~~~
I absolutely love this kid and I really want him to get a proper shot in the first team. I really don't want him to lose hope and go anywhere else. If chica goes he should definitely replace him in the first team!

476~~~
If Shiji and Pea are sold those three are our back up forwards.

477~~~
I'd say you're describing what most people would call a #9, not a poacher. Owen is arguably a poacher but RVP is not. A poacher is someone who doesn't contribute that much to the build-up, and mostly just hangs around in the box, and can always be relied upon to score if the ball falls to them.

Wilson has excellent build-up play, can score wonderful individual goals (both after long runs with the ball and with curlers and rockets from range), and lays on plenty of goals for other players too. He's definitely a #9, but not a 'poacher' for me.

478~~~
If he's still with us now, it didn't expire this summer.  Same for Lawrence.  Contracts expire at the end of June if I recall correctly, and last I checked, it's August now.

I was just asking because I never heard about his contract being renewed. By the sound of it either have you. I don't want to hear your amazing skills of using a calender. Don't quote my post unless you know details<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

480~~~
Wow, first goal in particular is eye-catching, but his composure and finishing are excellent.

481~~~
He's answered your question. Contracts expired in June, so if Wilson's was expiring and he's still with us then he got a new one. No need to be a dick just because you couldn't work that out.

482~~~
A little bit, the Shearer at Blackburn was an absolute goal machine, his goal record there was unbelievable.

483~~~
Absolutely love this player, becoming a real hero from the youth team, what better way to say to LVG LOOK AT ME by scoring 4 against our rivals who have a supposedly "amazing academy". I agree with others that he looks most like Lewandowski, I wonder if he has modeled his game on anybody, in a United shirt his style is mostly similar to RVP.

England fans should get excited too, hes showing the touch and approach of a genuine no.9 that England havent had for years.

484~~~
I'm not being a dick, I was asking a question that's all. Contracts expire in June? What does that mean<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Has he signed a new contract and if he has for how long? Is he on similar money to Januzaj now ect. I was wondering if anybody had details instead of vague assumptions. I though people might know in here because I can't seem to find out online, that's all. Work that out? I'm trying to, thanks.

485~~~
I would certainly agree that Wilson's ability to poach a goal is very high, something invaluable in a striker. Think of how many more goals Welbeck would have with those skills.

For the sake of clarity I wouldn't call his a poacher though.

486~~~
try transfermarkt if you haven't.

487~~~
Cheers man, unfortunately it just says it expired 30th June. Thanks for the website though.

488~~~
For our U21s player there is usually no public announce for new contract signed.The only way you can figure out is to see whether he's still playing for us or not, and in this case it's obviously a yes.

489~~~
It goes further back than that, Welbeck, Wilson and Blackett have all been with the academy since 8 years old,  proves the academy system is alive and well from the grassroots youth scouts  identifying the talent upwards.

490~~~
"Contracts expired in June" = Any contracts that expired this summer will have expired in June, meaning that if Wilson's contract was due to expire this summer, it would have expired in June.  Now, I don't know the length of Wilson's contract which he signed in 2014, but if it was just a two year contract then we will have renewed it, otherwise he wouldn't be playing for us.  Another likely possibility is that there has been some misreporting and Wilson's contract was never due to expire this season, because the first contract we had with him could have been for longer than a mere two years.

I doubt we will find out of he is on similar money to Januzaj as these kind of details are, to my knowledge, not released to the public.

491~~~
Easily our most exciting striking prospect and the club most not stagnate his progress for the sake of Zaha, Henriquez or Will Keane.

492~~~
Given the manager's history, I wonder if Wilson will be the first youngster at United Van Gaal will give free reign to?

493~~~
give him the #9

494~~~
I would certainly keep henriquez in the mix. I like the look of him.

495~~~
I get the feeling we fans (and management) have underrated our youth system.

496~~~
Let's make a list. 

Points for:
Pogba - Looked very classy and played very well but didn't look heads and shoulders above his best teammates while here
Januzaj - Similar to Pogba, if a bit more impressive for playing out of position a fair amount
Drinkwater - Seems to have properly established himself, being Player of the Season on a promoted team (Leicester)
Welbeck - Good overall player, unlucky to have the competition he does. A player of his production level at CM or LW would be starting for us.
Cleverley - Decent Prem footballer, albeit seemingly regressing. Wasn't a real academy star, beaten out by the immortal future TFC star Richard Eckersley for the Denzil Haroun.
Gibson- Was a star here in the reserves (too long ago?) and while he isn't very good, he can really pass. If he wasn't lazy and callow he'd be a good Prem player. 

Points against:
Larnell Cole - Starred here, but not going so well for him
Tunnicliffe - Was one of the better midfielders here, hasn't impressed anywhere else, really
McShane - It was a long time ago, but some scars never go away. We have created him, and must bear the moral responsibility.  

Ravel gets his own category?

497~~~
Januzaj stood out every match. That's part of the reason why everyone was hyping him up before pre season.

498~~~
Yeah, Januzaj certainly looked head and shoulders above the rest for me.

499~~~
I think we'll see him play against Valencia.

I'd have absolutely no worries if our striking force next season is RVP, Rooney, Welbeck and Wilson. I think he's ready to be a member of first team squad. Cracking talent.

500~~~
Do you ever watch youth football??

501~~~
Gibson was in the same batch as Evans,Pique and Rossi.Why did you count the likes of Cole and Tunnicliffe who aren't any more established than Lingard,M.Keane,Lawrence,Daehli,Eikrem,M.James,Josh King or even Fornasier?

502~~~
There were loads of spanners on here convinced Tunnicliffe would be the next Roy Keane and who would viciously attempt to put down anyone who suggested otherwise.

503~~~
Happens a lot when people are desperate for a new midfielder(Tunnicliffe was around United at the time when it seemed Fergie was refusing to sign one)but any who watched more than 10 mins of Tunnicliffe knew he was never going to be close to a player like Keane.

It was more hope than anything eles.

504~~~
I see a lot of people calling for Wilson to be loaned out.

I think he'd learn more bring coached every day by LVG tbh.

505~~~
I agree

506~~~
I agree. I think he's good enough to warrant some first team action also.

507~~~
Wilson is good enough to be in the squad and should get games...crazy to loan him out.

508~~~
A ready made replacement for RVP!

509~~~
Agreed

510~~~
No shit. Actually rating our youngsters and youth set-up is like fighting the tide on here sometimes. But the criticism and scepticism almost always comes from people who don't actually watch these kids play, and is best just ignored.

511~~~
Definitely.

Selling Hernandez will be a blessing for Wilson. There's a good chance that Wilson could be on the bench for the first game of the season if Welbeck and Rooney starts, with RVP being injured.

512~~~
I would certainly approve this. As much as i'd hate to see Chicharito go, he deserves to be a regular at a top club. I think both the club and Chicharito will be better off with Chicharito leaving and Wilson being in the squad as a 4th striker

513~~~
He also needs game time every week, which he aint going to get here this season without Europe. He needs to be challenged more. Thats why loaning him to a Championship side could suit him.

514~~~
I'd only consider loaning him to a Prem team with a reliable manager who can be trusted.

Championship won't help him that much tbh, plus he has had injury issues in the past and needs to be protected.


Not sure why we'd want to loan him anyway tbh. We need a 4th striker if Cheech leaves and right now it should be enough game time for him with Carling Cup and Early  FA cup starts and Sub appearances.

515~~~
No He'll get kicked around without protection. A Pl side or he stays and learns as the 4th striker. When we had Cole, Yorke, Sheringham and Ole they all got enough playing time.
I would love to see him some to Ajax or a good Dutch side. Ajax could do with a good center forward. They are talking to Eto'o at the moment

516~~~
I've said plenty of times I'd keep him until January then maybe send him to a PL club depending on how much time we're giving him.

Seen some daily mail articles on him and they're mentioning about sending him on loan to the Championship or League 1. Why would he go to league 1 when we've already turned down offers from a PL club in Burnley?

517~~~
Yeah that's right. Let's loan him to a league that'll kick ten bells out of him, to play for a team that'll present him with limited touches and unlimited aerial battles with oafish centre backs.

That'll be good preparation for playing in a technical based side..... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

518~~~
We have Rooney, RVP, Welbeck and Hernandez. Thats four already. Its going to be hard unless we sell someone. On top of that we have to fit in Januzaj as well. He aint going to be playing wing back. So we will play 4-3-3 from time to time which means only one striker on the pitch and that means even less playing time.

519~~~
We're playing with 3 up front at the moment. It's a slightly different situation to 1999.

520~~~
Sell Hernandez. Don't think he wants to stay and be a bench option either given his comments recently.

Give the extra game time to Januzaj up front(Along with being 10 back up) and Wilson depending on situation.

If he isn't still getting game time by January then loan him out. Even playing U21 European league if it takes off right now will only help him along with the training regularly with the first team.

521~~~
I don't think Hernandez will stay.

522~~~
I'm one of those people you're talking about, but I don't think it's a case of over or under-rating our youth players. It's more to do with being sceptical about their chances of making it. Considering some of the highly-rated youth players we've seen leave the club after years of being hyped as the next big thing, I don't think that's a unnatural position to take. 

Actually, bringing through young players is one of the things I'm looking forward to under LvG. I can't help but feel that Fergie let himself down a bit with this in his last few seasons.

523~~~
So we're talking about Pogba here? How has he not 'made it'? He's a starter at Juve and considered the best young CM in the world. Anyone who didn't rate him has been proven completely wrong.

Note I've never made claims about whether we'd actually bring these players through. Because ultimately that's not about the ability of the players, it's about the manager's decisions. Pogba being a case in point. But it's frustrating to be told again and again that these players simply aren't good enough, and be proven right every time. First Pogba, then Januzaj, and now Wilson. And there are more to come after them.

524~~~
I think he's at an age where he doesn't <i>have</i> to play 30-40 games a season.  As long as he gets enough games for both the Reserves and first-team, he should be fine.

I think it's worth keeping him here until January, then considering a loan if he hasn't had enough games and that situation doesn't look like improving for the rest of the season.

525~~~
If van Gaal likes developing young players as much as some have told, i would think he'd be (figuratively) drooling over Wilson and will want him here, to mold as he sees fit.

526~~~
When LvG was at Ajax he inherited a very young Patrick Kluivert. It would be interesting to know how he rates James at the same age as Patrick. The competition in Holland is not as intesive as the EPL. However Patrick was good enough to play in a CL final at 18
Is James ready for this, admitedly that was 20 years ago

527~~~
Indeed. He also gave Seedorf his debut at 16. If Wilson goes off on loan its only because the team has too many forwards as it is. A decision on Wilson's season hinges on whatever transfer business we conduct before the window shuts. If we get the reinforcements we need, I can see LVG getting rid of a few players, possibly Zaha and/or Chicharito, which could open up a spot for the young man.

528~~~
Certainly, I think when he mentioned 5 number 9s, he had Wilson in mind(or Will Keane but highly unlikely). If Chicharito does leave, I can see Wilson getting a few games in the first team.

529~~~
Is Wilson ready to breakthrough the first team? Since its likely we'll offload Chicha I could see Wilson take the 4th striker spot and come in the team when one RvP/Rooney are not playing for whatever reason.

530~~~
Januzaj is likely to be 4th striker if we stick with the 352. I still think it's best for Wilson to go out on loan for at least half the season, whether that be now or from January I don't know.

Too many people on here seem to have this idea that going out on loan = not yet good enough. That's not the case at all. The loan system is a great way of developing players and we need to use it to our advantage.

531~~~
You think Adnan would play as 9 and not 10? I dont know if his finishing is clinical enough for him to be a 9 but at the same time I dont know if 10 would suit him either. He has the skills to play on the wing even though hes not crazy fast. Sending Wilson on loan could be a good move for him but even playing as a backup striker is good, I like your idea of loaning him for half a season he has to play in some capacity to keep on developing.

532~~~
How are you defining a 9 in a 352? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Anyway, this has been done to death over and over in numerous threads recently. Januzaj could easily operate in a similar role to which Robben played in the WC. Whether you call that a 9 or 10 I don't know or care.

533~~~
Sadly, I think that is a question that will remain entirely hypothetical for some time

534~~~
Ay thats true he could be played in the Robben role possibly though he has nowhere near the same pace. By 9 I mean a striker we're gonna play with two upfront Rvp and Rooney with the latter dropping a bit more probably.

535~~~
Yeah. It would certainly be interesting to see Januzaj there - although he wouldn't be a major goalscorer. Wilson would be a goalscorer, but it'd be good for him to get a loan and get himself a load of goals and make a real case for our first team.

536~~~
Fair point about them being good enough. But I don't think it's just questioning their talent, I think it's case of fans not getting too hyped up about youngsters because we've seen so many fail to make it at United - and not just Pogba. Fans got just as excited for the Morrisons, Pogbas and Machedas and were ultimately disappointed. I don't watch a lot of youth matches, but if you told me we had the next Messi in the U19s I would struggle to get excited purely because of recent history. I'm not under-rating their abilities, I'm just not believing the hype or getting my hopes up until they give me a reason to.

537~~~
That's the problem with the 3-5-2 and no Europe this season. It makes it harder to give game time to both Wilson and Januzaj. Januzaj potentially has one of Mata, Rooney, and RVP in front of him. Wilson has Rooney and RVP in front of him. And that's without bringing Welbeck into the discussion.

538~~~
And to make it as this club you can not just be good you have to be exceptional. You have to have the quality to compete against the best in the World. Very few from our academy are going to be able to reach that level. Just look at James Wilson's situation. He has to compete with the likes of Van Persie and Rooney two of the best strikers in the World.

539~~~
Pogba is even better than we thought. Morrison has the talent, but not the mentality, and for me that can't be over emphasized.

So many have the raw talent. Very few have the drive and determination to made the most of their talent.

Macheda became famous for a single goal, he never showed the sort of form of a top talent over any period of time.

540~~~
But I think that's the point. If we're over or under-rating players at United, we're basing our judgement on our own club. If I was to say our academy is shit, that doesn't mean I think they completely useless and have no right to call themselves footballers. It means I believe they have no right to be a United. I don't care if we're producing players good enough for other teams, I only care on producing future United players and I base my judgement of their ability on the likelihood of that happening. I don't think that's unfair.

541~~~
With Wilson potentially behind Rooney, RVP, Welbeck for one position, let alone bringing Kagawa, Mata, Januzaj into the equation. 

Is he too young for a loan, Southampton for example could do with a striker? He's in position to Rodriquez so maybe not. I think it's harder for teams to place their hopes on a youngster loanee, especially in the prem. 

I'd just really like to see him play some games at a good level to see if he can cut it and watch him develop. I'm not sure he'd get any more than 5 appearances for us this season.

542~~~
I think there's still a few teams (Palace, West Brom, Burnley) that he'd get a decent amount of playing time at but more likely it would have to be a top Championship team.
Southampton have Gallagher that played a few times last year. You'd think they'd want to play him instead and the sell him to a big club for loads of money.

543~~~
People said the same about Januzaj last season...

We're playing with 2 strikers so there'll be games for him.It's not like Welbeck,RVP,Kagawa are that injury-free either.

544~~~
Seconded. Maybe he can take part in the Reserves games also.
He should definietely be a part of the first team though. Sacrifice Hernandez.

545~~~
It's tricky I just want to see him at a high level. I wouldnt say he would get picked ahead of any of our 4 main strikers. So that's a fair way down the pecking order.

Although I do think LVG will reward things such as 4 goals the other night, and with his rep for development he'll definitely make sure Wilson knows that wasnt unnoticed.

546~~~
Some crazy expectations being placed on this lad, I think he looks fantastic but give him time. If the choice is to loan him out this season Sunderland would be a good shout as he'd only have Wickham(if he stays) and Altidore as competition.

547~~~
There's no rush with him. Keep hIm as back up give him the benefit of LVG's top class coaching. If he really performs outstandingly for the reserves and LVG feels he's ready he'd have no problem playing him ahead of established stars anyway.

548~~~
And Fletcher.

549~~~
Can I ask what people mean when they say 'give him time' on here? We're fans, talking on a forum. If I say 'I expect James Wilson to become a success with the first team within the next few seasons' (for example), it has absolutely no impact on him. Nor am I saying it's a sure thing. It's just my expectation, and I don't see what on earth the response 'give him time' means?

550~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.soccerbible.com/interviews/2014/08/soccerbible-interview-juan-mata/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.soccerbible.com/interviews/2014/08/soccerbible-interview-juan-mata/</a>

Mata said he was impressed by Wilson in training.Scored a lot of goals apparently.

551~~~
From what's been mentioned by van Gaal or Manchester United, only Johnston, Carrick, Shaw, Valencia, Welbeck, Evans and Anderson are injured and Rafael is back. Wilson could be on the bench today with both van Persie and Welbeck not being available. Wilson's injury that kept him out of preseason training with the first team earlier in the summer was a broken finger.

552~~~
Apparently, he picked up another injury training with the first team ahead of the Valencia game.

553~~~
Interesting quote that. Hadn't seen it till now.

Cannot wait for him to feature in the first team more.

554~~~
No word on when he'll be back?

555~~~
Better him than Hernandez

556~~~
I think he'll be involved a lot this season. His pace and finishing ability make him very different from the other strikers we have in the club. He will be a useful option

557~~~
I think he will be involved against MK Dons next week. Hoping he starts actually.

558~~~
So not much competition then.

559~~~
He is usually injured for half a season. How about Hull? Have they bought anyone to replace Long?

560~~~
Looks like Hull might go 1 up top with Ince and Snodgrass as wingers. 

We've already turned down an offer from Burnley a month back and he'd likely get a lot of time there with Vokes out injured. They look quite poor though and might not be the best club for Wilson to break through at. Hope he is fit for the MK Dons match anyway.

561~~~

In training today

562~~~
That's nice to see him in first team training.

Will be interesting if he plays on Friday or is kept for Sunday.


Got a link for the full set ?

563~~~
Sure <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/antonio-valencia-marcos-rojo-and-shinji-kagawa-of-news-photo/453899380" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail...ojo-and-shinji-kagawa-of-news-photo/453899380</a>

If he's fit I can't imagine him missing Liverpool at Anfield on Friday.

564~~~
It looks like somebody has just told Shinji his dog has to be put down.

565~~~
Thanks.

Can't spot Powell in those which is bit of a shame. feck knows what is up with him.

566~~~
A lot of players couldn't be spotted in that gallery.Smalling,M.Keane,Chicharito,etc

567~~~
If Welbecks not fit, i'd honestly want to see him start in favour of Hernandez just to see what he offers.

568~~~
Smalling's there. With Rojo in a few

569~~~
Spotted Smalling in this set on the official website but yeah you're right.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/NewSignings201415/NewSignings201415News/2014/Aug/gallery-marcos-rojo-first-manchester-united-training-session.aspx#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/NewSigning...irst-manchester-united-training-session.aspx#</a>

570~~~
I'd think Januzaj will start along with Rooney in that scenario.

RVP is gonna be on the bench probably so that limits the opening a bit but hope he makes the bench.

571~~~
He's been like that ever since Anderson nominated him for the ice bucket challenge.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u-p2WcGFlJE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Just look at the poor bugger's face when he gets nominated.

572~~~
I think he is the one in the background behind Cleverley in this picture : <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/wayne-rooney-of-manchester-united-in-action-during-a-first-news-photo/453899354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail...in-action-during-a-first-news-photo/453899354</a>

You can't see his face but his head/hair looks similar.

573~~~
Hmm could be. Can't figure clearly out in that but he is Sporting a beard these days and longer hair.


<a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/2014/08/14/nick-powell-james-wilson-join-first-team-squad-old-trafford-valencia-match-50936/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thepeoplesperson.com/2014/08...team-squad-old-trafford-valencia-match-50936/</a>

Might have cut it since then dunno.

574~~~
Yeah well, I guess we will have to wait for tomorrow's under 21 game against Liverpool to see if we get some info on what he is up to. If not, let's hope he replaces Fellaini on Sunday.

575~~~
It was another knock to his right ankle that put him out of last week's game. Hopefully he's involved in the first team in the next couple of games

576~~~
Think he has as good a chance as anyone to play against MK Dons. Definitely should play in that game.

577~~~
Want to see wilson and rvp starting in the league cup game.

578~~~
Powell was there from the video.Zaha,W.Keane,Petrucci are the lost boys now.

579~~~
Id love Wilson to play on sunday and make the same impact that Januzaj did vs Sunderpoznan

580~~~
Agree! Been watching him a while now would love him to become a regular first team member.

581~~~
I would like to see Wilson + Lawrence or Wilson + Pereira as the front 2.I mean come on it's a League 1 team.3-4 first team players are enough.

582~~~
It would certainly make a lot of sense.

583~~~
Wilson 9, thats the shirt i would get.

584~~~
Zaha has been spotted by a few people and even pictured in London. 

Will Keane maybe with the U21s now. Petrucci as well though he is finding a new club.

585~~~
What's that contraption Valencia is wearing? I've seen it on other players too.

586~~~
tracks heart rate and such things. needs a redesign, its a wonder bra basically.

587~~~
That's what I was thinking, but I thought you need to wear it under the clothes - touching your skin.

588~~~
Good lad, James. Thoroughly deserved.

589~~~
On the bench for the Sun'lun match and start against the Dons I'd say. Hopefully stakes a claim to be regularly involved in the matchday squad.

590~~~
Few of the fans demanded our academy to produce at least 1 first team players each year.Guess what?
1990-1991 crop: Welbeck
1992-1992 crop:
1992-1993 crop: Lingard/M.Keane (+Johnstone?)
1993-1994 crop: Blackett/James (+Lawrence?)
1994-1995 crop: Januzaj (+Pearson/Rothwell?)
1995-1996 crop: Wilson

Hmm...

591~~~
Fingers crossed for him to get his chance. Preferably when we're winning comfortably ( ekhm... ) and there's no pressure on him.

592~~~
Januzaj last year at the Stadium of Light, Wilson this year?

593~~~
I think he will play midweek. Hopefully Rooney and RVP can get us a lead and we don't need a kid to save us this season.

594~~~
Didn't he already do that on his debut?

595~~~
I don't know what you're on about, last season never happened <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>.

596~~~
Have a very good feeling about Wilson.

597~~~
Which means your, 'Januzaj last year at the Stadium of Light, Wilson this year?' statement is void. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

598~~~
Christ, Welbeck is as old as Giggs!

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

599~~~
Lawrence too. Haven't heard much about him of late though.

600~~~
True <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, only remember 2 things from last year. Januzaj's debut goals and Evra vs. Bayern. What a dire year.

601~~~
James didn't come from the academy, came to united when he was 18/19.

602~~~
Yep, signed after he was released by Preston NE

603~~~
Does this mean that one of Hernandez/Welbeck is headed for the exit? I'd be sad to see either go, but Wilson seems to be the real deal.

604~~~
I remember Mr. MUJAC saying that he was with us as a 14 yearold before going to PNE later. Could be wrong though.

605~~~
No idea really, just saw on wikipedia that he joined 2 years ago.

606~~~
Any word on him? Hopefully recovered but perhaps needed a week for fitness, as he was spotted training.

607~~~
He has left the team bus today (Powell too)

608~~~
right on, thanks, a bit surprised he didn't make the bench over Hernandez considering how poor the latter has looked in the 352.

609~~~
James's case is a bit odd but he had a spell with us when he's 14-15, also played a few U18s match at the end of season 2011-2012 and never played professional football for PNE so he's qualified as youth product.

If we don't count James then still fine,Blackett is there anyway with Lawrence emerging (hilariously that's the only two of that crop that are still here with Charni went to Zulte).

610~~~
Wilson was even in my starting XI <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
But we (fans) don't know who fit Wilson is after his injury.
I really hope he starts now on Tuesday.

611~~~
he was in mine too <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

612~~~
He should be a shoe in to start tomorrow ?

But then Hernandez and Welbeck need to as well. Really need to sell Cheech as much as i love him.

613~~~
He's looking good, isn't he.

614~~~
Should've started instead of Hernandez. Always best to play with 11 players.

615~~~
Brilliant since he came on. Instantly more deserving of a place in the squad ahead of Hernandez and Welbeck.

616~~~
We didn't even look half threatening till he came on. Thought he did brilliantly. Definitely deserves to start before Hernandez or Welbeck in the initial rounds of the FA cup.

617~~~
Hernandez was -1 today.

618~~~
He would have scored if we had another midfielder out there to create instead of Hernandez.He needs to be the upfront striker not the wide one.Hope he's on the bench on Sunday.

619~~~
Wilson should have started over Chicha and those two shouldn't have been on at the same time. It's easy to see he's just a flat out better player right now. The team needed an extra midfielder to help create or keep possession. The attack suffered from having Chicha having to do some of the creating and linking up the play.

620~~~
Screw Hernandez and give him game time.

621~~~
Welbeck and Hernandez can go off to wherever they want. If they cannot put in a performance against the likes of MK Dons, I'd rather not have them in my team.

What was most telling is how a player like Wilson can come off the bench and immediately look better than the two. The curling left foot and an intelligent run to get on to a header. This lad is ready for the step up.

622~~~
He's already better than Hernandez.

I think i may be also...

623~~~
Good cameo in bad circumstances. I'd be tempted to have him on the bench against burnley

624~~~
3rd best striker at the club.

625~~~
Gutted that strike from the edge of the box didn't go in. Was a good save, but he deserved it for his effort. The header was unlucky too.

Amazing how in 20 minutes he made more chances for himself than Hernandez and Welbeck combined.

626~~~
Considering what he's shown already, and at his age, I'm not feeling worried if we don't replace a departing Welbeck/Hernandez.  Although I'd prefer it if it wasn't the former.

627~~~
He might just be. welbeck as good as he is, is definitely not a striker.. he's more of an attacking mid, no goal nous but great at keeping possession and giving us some drive.

628~~~
Impresses me whenever he plays. Has a ferocious strike on him.

629~~~
This lad did more in the game than both the two strikers that started.

630~~~

631~~~
And he had the first shot on target in the 72nd minute. So in the 20 minutes he was on, he had 3 shots and all were on target.

632~~~
Good to see him look lively when he came on. Was extremely disappointed with Welbeck's attitude, so I'm with a few that this week, he is next in line behind RVP and Rooney.

633~~~
Think he's got a huge future here at united. At the perfect age to develop as a squad player and come in to be our main striker once Rooney/rvp are done. Great talent. I hope Hernandez leaves so that he gets more chances on the bench. He should still be in the u21's this season, but a mix of that and first team squad. Definitely has the talent though.

634~~~
I agree that Wilson looks tremendous but why the asinine comment about Hernandez? Hernandez should leave for the good of his own career but you could equally hope that Welbeck leaves too?

635~~~
I've always loved Hernandez but it's just time for him to go I think. He's really regressed the last year and a bit, and IMO him being here restricts Wilson, a better talent for me, from making appearances. I just want him to leave for both his own good and ours. He needs to be starting somewhere because on the form he showed under fergie, he can start at plenty of top clubs. As it is, he even lost his spot for Mexico. It's just helping nobody keeping it as is.

It's a bit different with welbeck as he's a few years younger then Hernandez, and offers something our other 2 don't. Wilson though is a poacher like Hernandez, just with more talent to his game so won't be as ineffective.

636~~~
You know how Ronaldo had great technique when striking the ball? Wilson has that trait too. It looks like he doesn't follow through and a rocket of a shot follows.

637~~~
There's a real air of quality about him, easily our most dangerous player tonight and I love the way he runs at the defense, the multiple attributes to his game make him ideal for a fluid front 3 in the Barca mold.

638~~~
Very impressed by him. Looks like he has all the tools to be a great striker for the club and also looks like he could play on the right hand side of a front three. Time to let Welbeck and Hernandez sail into the sunset and watch this young lad develop, they are just gonna be taking some of his game time.

639~~~
I'd go as far to say let Hernandez go and have RvP, Rooney, Welbeck and Wilson as our front four.

Looks a real talent.

640~~~
Him and Pereira did themselves some big favours last night. Think they'll get more first team football on the back of it.

641~~~
Pereira looks promising but don't feel he is ready for the step up just yet whilst I feel Wilson wouldn't look out of place leading the line in a PL affair.

642~~~
This lad is a great reason to sell either Hernandez or Welbeck.  He would easily be able to step in, should we have a striker nightmare.  LVG has a great track record with youth and this lad could benefit.

643~~~
He will replace RVP within the next two years. That's my prediction. Him and Rooney will do well together in my eyes.

644~~~
He's the reason we are selling Welbeck in my opinion.  He's going to be a star.

645~~~
I've been saying for a while now, Wilson has already reached the stage in his career where he should be starting ahead of Welbeck AND Hernandez, IMO.
Every time I see him he oozes class and he's just a goalscoring machine.  I honestly feel last night may well have turned out differently if he had started, purely because we were 'ok' in the first 20 minutes and I think he may have taken a chance - and once the PL team takes the lead it becomes much more difficult for the lower league opposition.
He has the potential to be the first name on the England teamsheet in as little as 3-4 years.

646~~~
Thought he was our best player last night which admittedly isn't the highest praise but still.

He already looks a more complete player than Hernandez.

647~~~
Either sell hernandez or welbeck to ensure he gets some games this season or loan him out

With no European group games and now no league cup to give him opportunities we have got 36 league games and potentially a handful of FA cup games so being realistic if RVP, Rooney, Welbeck and Hernandez stay and are fit he will struggle to get more than a few mins here and there. 

If say hernandez goes then hopefully wilson can find himself on the bench pretty regularly and getting playing time - otherwise get him out in the championship or even a lower level PL team as long as he is likely to feature most weeks

648~~~
We should play him against Burnley. Can't think of a single reason not too. Loaning him out would be a mistake. Wilson is good enough now. He didn't come on worried about how we were playing. He wasn't in two minds when chances arose and he didn't pass the buck. His play is similar to what he does at under 21. It doesn't seem to phase him and to be frank, if he had have featured in the first two premiership games we'd probably have more then a point to show for it.

649~~~
He needs to be given some games, else loan him out to a good club

650~~~
The fact he can actually dribble without looking like he is about to collapse is a bonus. I liked the way he turned and ran at the defense last night, he was constantly moving and was always on the end of things. He just has that natural instinct all top scorers have.

651~~~
Aye, haven't seen too much of him at all (the only game I missed last season was the 1 he started <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>)- and judging by some (previous) comments, I was expecting a slow, good finisher/poacher type player, but last night's cameo was anything but.

Did more in his cameo then all the other attackers combined last night.

Plus he's not exactly slow, is he? Such a bonus.

652~~~
Nope, he is quick. Not absolutely rapid, but fast enough that defenders won't catch him when he is clean through. His main attribute though is his composure infront of goal. I have seen him a few times and whenever he is 1 on 1 he seems to finish his chance. Really do think we should cash in on Hernandez now and give this guy his playing time.

653~~~
Absolutely. Either that or send him on loan and keep Welbeck. (I don't think there's space for both him and Welbeck tbh).

654~~~
Sell Hernandez now, let him play some games this season and in the next years could replace van Persie or Welbeck if we sell him too. Fantastic young player.

655~~~
It would be a mistake to loan him out guys. What I like about him is that his first touch is never negative. If he thinks he can beat his man, he won't take the long way around and he has the ability at speed to make angles so that it's difficult to tackle him without fouling him.

His striking is as good as Beckhams crossing was. He doesn't scuff shots and he WANTS to score. Loaning him out while we're struggling, for someone else to benefit? What's the point. Only if we thought he wasn't good enough now. Welbecks a great player not a top striker and Hernandez hearts there but not his head. For me he should be our third choice and after last night? I think he deserves to start against Burnley.

If he got say 10 games during the season and various sub appearences, I think we'd all benefit. Him getting games for someone else means very little. He seems ready

656~~~
He scored a few superb goals for the U18s/U21s when he basically ran through the whole defence with his pace.So, absolutely not slow.

657~~~
He is absolutely rapid, though. 

I thought Wilson was terrific last night. A really big positive from the night. Surely to feck this now means he is ahead of Hernandez in the pecking order?

658~~~
That's something we're seriously lacking in our squad - someone who can run in behind and offer a threat, whilst being a composed finisher and involved in the buildup play.

ATM, non of our strikers have all those elements to their game. Excited.

I'd be keen for him to get some minutes in the team this season, but there's going to be little minutes available as we're essentially involved in 2 competitions only.

659~~~
I can think of two.

You always get carried away with youngsters. He shouldn't be starting our next PL game. He's not ready. Be great to see him get some minutes from the bench though.

660~~~
He was good last night. I think he's ready to step up and be a first team squad member. If we do sell Hernandez and Welbeck and revert to 4-3-3 he can be our third choice striker.

661~~~
I really surprise when all the rumours I've heard are Welbeck allowed to leave and not Hernandez.

662~~~
He's been better than Hernandez for many moons now, imho.

663~~~
if we stick to 3-5-2 It should be RVP/Rooney with Welbeck/Wilson. Id personally play Welbeck-Wilson at some stage. The speed and flair would rip the teams apart. It would mean we could press higher and with sense unlike we play with RVP and Rooney who are incredibly slow and lazy to put foot on defending/closing down. Hernandez would be still a good option but we have Rooney and RVp ahead of him in his position. I think Wilson is better centrally but is still young and can develop his game to play the second striker or wide striker as welbeck did to gain some play time..

664~~~
If he turns into an absolute class player, my opening post in this thread is going to come back to haunt me. I might edit it.

665~~~
I'd happily sell Welbeck and Hernandez and give the extra game time to Wilson and Januzaj.

666~~~
I'll be disappointed if he's not on the bench on Saturday, looks a much better option than Hernandez at this point.

667~~~
In the first team!

668~~~
What do you mean?

669~~~
Maybe people can learn from me. For everyone one I get wrong, there's a Rossi or a Pogba. You say he's not ready. You know , you would have said the same about Blackett up until recently. That's a fact. Some people would have been scared to play Messi at 18 or Giggs. I'm not talking about 90 minutes week in week out but I would start him. I think it's vital we get off to a quick start and our forwards aren't exactly doing much to convince me he shouldn't. It's just my opinion of course.

670~~~
He's been officially promoted to the first team squad.

671~~~
Ya I just came across that article now. Not sure what they mean by it though. Surely he will still play the odd under 21 game every now and then as he is unlikely to be involved in every first team game.

672~~~
You watch his matches often?

673~~~
If Hernandez and Welbeck are leaving, then he's our only striker after Rooney and RVP.

No more under 21s for this lad.

674~~~
I've seen plenty of him. I know teams can mark him out of games, but give him a chance and 9/10 he'll take it. That's the whole point. Last game we had RVP and Rooney and they barely had a shot. Granted they're working on fitness, but the boys sharp.

675~~~
Jumping from U21s to the first team is a huge leap though. But yeah, I would like to see him succeed, it's always nice to see academy players playing for our club.

676~~~
Being a first team player means that you'll train with the rest of first team everyday and only play U21s game if any for fitness reason.

677~~~
Links?

678~~~
I would like to see him loaned out to another premier league side! See how he gets on playing week in week out. I don't like to see young potential like him on the bench,  especially a striker, they need the momentum of playing every week. Being in and out of the team is hard and he's not good enough yet to get games ahead of Rooney and RVP..the last thing we want is for him to suffer from lack of confidence, some players struggle to come back from that, cleverly for example

679~~~

680~~~
But at the same time, Cleverley had loan spells with Bolton and Wigan, looked quality for both of them, regarded as the future upon his return blah blah blah blah annnnnnnnnnnd.....

was, and still currently is, very shit. 

I think Wilson will learn more training week in, week out with RVP, Rooney et. al. Immediate integration will allow him to understand what his competition is and aim for the very best right from the beginning. 

Also, as a smaller point, aren't all Premier League clubs our potential rivals now? Can't afford to strengthen anybody. <span style="color: #ffffff">Slightly joking slightly very not joking. </span>

681~~~
I was sure that it would happen before the end of the window, he is the one pushing Hernandez and Welbeck on the way out.

682~~~
To be fair Cleverley was never a CM, he looked much better on the wing cutting in on his right on those loans.

683~~~
LVG has seen the light! God willing Wilson will be a star.

684~~~
That left footed effort was so RVPish.

685~~~
With some players, special talents like Januzaj and Wilson, I wouldn't want them to be loaned out. Let them develop in our team and fight their way into the squad like Januzaj has done. He'll get his chances but he'll learn more training with Rooney and RvP and with our staff then him going on loan anywhere else.

686~~~
This is the key part for me too, I think a loan playing week in, week out is important for strikers especially at top clubs. Welbeck really should have gone on loan again. I wouldn't send Wilson out this season or not until January anyway. For now just breaking through he is better off here with our training and getting used to first team football our way. Then next season or January when he is in the swing of things as a senior player and needs the match time that he just won't be offered with Rooney and RvP he should be sent on loan to bag his 15+ goals and come back here as a starter. It is another reason why we really should keep hold of Welbeck so we can send Wilo out on loan.

687~~~
Loans were Leicester, Watford and Wigan <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

But i agree 100% with you that he must stay with us because he looks ready, can learn a lot from Rooney & Van Persie and loans don't tell us everything like with Cleverley

688~~~
give him the no.9 Shirt, his class is obvious. The next big thing!

689~~~
I thought the same, cracking effort! Shame he didn't score from it or the header which looked like a sitter. Not long time ago he mentioned he wiould be working on headed goals. It would be great if he added it to his game. His running with the ball was also great, so direct..

690~~~
Tbf, they were terrific textbook efforts and sadly the keeper was equally up to them. Don't think he could have done much better there. 

That would be great, he doesn't have the strength to challenge for headers just yet but he can circumvent that with intelligent movement of the ball. I remember Rooney struggled with the headed goals aspect and had only scored 1 goal or something along those lines before he started to train on that aspect vigorously. In the 09/10 season he scored plenty of headed goals and even had a run of 5 games or so when he scored consecutive headed goals. Memory is a bit cloudy on those stats above but he came leaps and bounds with his heading and it was a genuine surprise for me. Showed that you don't just need to be a Drogba/CR7 type of player to be prolific in the air and you can do so with intelligent movement coupled with good heading technique.

691~~~
Yeah, both his efforts on goal were really good and the keeper made fantastic saves unfortunately. As for his heading, I don't know much about it, but I'm sure Nicky Butt said in that Giggs biography program that Wilson had the best standing jump he'd ever seen

692~~~
I wonder if LVG has noted his pace and therefore might use him up top a bit more. He could certainly have an effect unlike our other strikers.

693~~~
Welbeck offers that too

694~~~
Ya but feck all goals. Wilson on the other hand seems like a natural born goalscorer.

695~~~
His standing jump is unreal, very natural like Ronaldo's.

696~~~
Wilson will put the ball in the back of the net.

697~~~
Wilson's instinct inside the box and finishing already look better than Welbeck's with no real first team experience. Welbeck is a very difficult player because as a striker he doesn't score enough goals and out wide he doesn't create enough chances. If only he had the composure and natural ability to finish he would be so much better. I don't know what's wrong with him, he beats 3 players with a run from midfield than his composure totally breaks as he gets closer to the box and trips over his feet or slips before he even gets the chance to shoot.

If Welbeck goes I think it's because van Gaal has chosen that the effort is better spent on Wilson if we want a young player to become a starter at this club.

698~~~
Should be careful not to get carried away with this one though as he looks far from as mature physically as for example Rooney did at that age. Is he ready to play senior football at top level, PL or in the Championship? Wouldn't want him to start picking up injuries early on, training too hard or by being bullied by defenders pretty much twice his size. I Think it's better to keep him around and ease him into the first team once he's ready like we did with Januzaj, problem is we're so stocked in attack. Even if both Welbeck and Hernandez moved there'd still be Rooney, Van Persie, Di maria, Januzaj etc.

699~~~
I think physically he's fine. Very lean certainly, but he's tall and doesn't seem weak. Rooney doesn't and didn't have a typical build, he was always a weirdly built and powerful kid and strikers don't need to be like that to succeed. Hernandez was smaller than Wilson when we first got him and he did fine

700~~~
Not sure why so many people willing to sacrifice Welbeck for Wilson.We can certainly do with both in the near future especially considering Hernandez isn't better than both of them and RVP is 31.I see Welbeck as a type of supporting striker who will combine well with Wilson like Ashley Fletcher did in the U18s (irrelevant but I would love if we can get the latter to the first team as well if he develops well)

701~~~
So a Dembele, kind of. The Spurs one.

702~~~
Gonna be pretty fecking awesome for the lad to be learning off of Falcao, RVP and Rooney now.

703~~~
4th striker at the club now.

Should atleast get on the bench.

704~~~
sad with the departures of welbeck and hernandez but signing falcao and promoting wilson is a very good move indeed.

705~~~
Great for young James.  Should see more first team action now.

706~~~
You'd hope that but i'm far from convinced that he will. 2 of Rooney, RvP and Falcao will still have to be out pretty much for Wilson to get any game time. His chances To start in the FA cup may have improved a bit though.

707~~~
If RVP is really having an op which will keep him out for 3-4 months then his chances of playing time skyrocket. Especially given Rooney can play wide left or even drop back to midfield, which I think is actually going to happen sooner or later despite my personal scepticism of his aptitude in the role.

708~~~
Yes, that is true but what if he doesn't? And once Robin comes back will Falcao stay permanently? Unless we unload one of RvP Rooney or Falcao after this season he'll be pretty much cemented as 3rd choice striker wether or not Rooney moves into a new position. It's not too unlikely that this could lead to Wilson taking the same route as Welbeck after a few years if he's playing only sporadically. 

And on Rooney, playing him as a CAM or wide striker will not benefit him or the team IMO as he's not better than Mata or perhaps even Welbeck in those roles so we'd just be shoehorning once again.

709~~~
Last week he had Chicharito and Welbeck to compete to.Now he has Radamel freaking Falcao.Congrats Ed to make life much harder for one of our most promising youngster came through in recent years.

710~~~
It was always going to be hard for him to start many games without Europe and now without the capital one cup. He can get minutes off the bench. One of RVP, Rooney, Mata, and Falcao will always be on the bench. So that makes it Lindegaard, Januzaj, star player, CM sub, def sub, and another defender on the bench. That leaves a spot open for Wilson as the 7th player on the bench. He'll be competing with Young and Valencia for that final spot on the bench.

711~~~
Last week he was 5th choice striker competing against two younger lads... now he is 4th choice competing with 3 players pushing 30. Yes, well done Ed...

If we want to moan let moan about Hernandez and Welbeck getting a start aead of him against MK Dons only for them to leave a week later.

712~~~
Actually thought WIlson should have started ahead of Hernandez against MK Dons tbh.

713~~~
Rooney, Falcao, RVP all of them have injury issues.

His chances to get on the bench and get sub minutes increased. As a starter dunno. Depends on how he does, i guess.

714~~~
If I was Wilson i'd have pushed for a loan move. Unless he's the next Shearer I don't see him getting his chances here. History is very much against him as a home grown forward at United. There's better odds on Pogba re-signing than Wilson making it at OT and thats the very harsh reality of his position. And don't get me wrong, I rate the kid, I really hope he breaks the cycle, delivers on his potential and becomes a lifer at OT.

715~~~
Great news for him moving upto 4th choice. Seems a natural, scores all types of goals, can go past people, pacey... just what we need really.

Excited to watch him develop.

716~~~
If he has half as many chances as Welbeck got then he will undoubtedly make it here.

717~~~
1 striker is on loan, 1 is injury prone and having an operation, the other is inconsistent. Wilson will get games, maybe not this year but he could always go on loan in January if necessary.

718~~~
He's gone from 5th choice to 4th choice which is an improvement for him but I reckon for this season all it means is that he will get included in more squads. LVG is going to have to rotate between RVP, Rooney and Falcao to keep them all happy and whoever doesn't make the starting line up is guaranteed to come on as an impact sub at some stage.

719~~~
He just has to impress off the bench and get used to the speed of the PL. Try to work on every little thing. He has no pressure to score as Falcao, Rooney, and RVP are expected to produce, not him.

720~~~
Lack of fixture congestion doesn't help on the game time front for the likes of Wilson.

721~~~
He isn't really ready to be a starter yet. So more bench minutes is good for him right now.

Actually given our terribly reduced fixture list he was going too find it tough to start anyway.

Also, Pretty sure atleast one of RVP, Falcao, Rooney won't be there next season.

722~~~
I think he's in a great position, he'll get to learn from 3 very dynamic strikers.

723~~~
Promising youngster or not, a club that wants to have any chance to be top 4 does not have an untested 19 year old striker leading their line. Is he up there in terms of Ronaldo type talent? No, I don't think so. And we didn't ask Ronaldo to be our main man at his age.

Players need time to develop. Wilson will get that. With Welbeck and Chich gone, it's actually easier for him to get into the squad now.

724~~~
He'd be better off on loan even to a championship team than get 5 mins here and there. His game time is mostly dependent on other players being injured, much like a second choice keeper. He needs to be playing regularly.

725~~~
I think he should soak up as many minutes and learn from the star strikers in the first half of the season and then possibly go out on loan in January. Let him get used to the first team life at United first.

726~~~
Well hopefully the Falcao signing is with this lad in mind. We know that in 3 seasons time our top 3 strikers will probably be over the hill, but as Wilson is an out and out number 9 there's not necessarily a need to search for a promising young forward, as we could still field a front four of Wilson, Mata, Januzaj, Di Maria. All lefties.

727~~~
Have to say, for all my negativity about the Welbeck thing I am quite excited about young Wilson training with Radamel fecking Falcao on a daily basis.

728~~~
100% the decision to sell Welbeck is with this lad in my mind. 

He's going to be top quality and LVG will give him opportunities.  As much as i like Welbeck, Wilson is going to be a better finisher.

729~~~
This is IMO the saving grace, yes. 

Wilson will get chances this season. Which excites me.

730~~~
Hmmm... Not sure about that. I really hope to feck we have a decent FA Cup run because it's going to be a crappy season for fringe players if we don't....

731~~~
It will likely take just one injury to see him on the bench. He will get games.

732~~~
I think we should be wary of pinning all our future hopes on him. He might only be 18 but we need to bear in mind how good Welbeck was at that age and for me the latter was just as impressive, if not more so.

733~~~
He's not ready to be a starter IMO, and if he gets loaned out he wont start there either.

I think now it's important for him to train hard and improve his game by learning from RVP, Falcao & Rooney whilst playing in the FA Cup & getting bench minutes.

734~~~
Good point. If he can't learn from three of the most lethal strikers of their generation, he'll never learn.

735~~~
Aye, that's true. With Hernandez and Welbeck both gone he'll be our new super-sub striker. Which is exciting.

736~~~
He is perhaps the winner of the transfer window in forwards department. Welbeck gone, Chicharito will be unlikely to return next season and the 3 big name strikers currently are all 28+. It shows the faith LvG and Giggs have in him to make it big here in future. 
I also think that he will perhaps develop better by training with likes of Di Maria, Mata and the 3 forwards than at loan somewhere where there is lesser quality in squad. He too could have easily landed a premiership club loan deal, seeing Powell, M. Keane et al landed loan deals despite making lesser impact. LvG must have told him that he will develop better by staying with the squad even if game time will be limited.

737~~~
This transfer market has worked in his favour, with RVP in his early thirties Wilson will get his chance in the next few years, he just needs to keep his head down and learn off Falcao and RVP, i'm sure he will get some game time. Unlike Welbeck this guy can actually score goals, LVG made the right decision to discard Welbeck and promote Wilson.

738~~~
Yeah, I mean his debut was pretty awful <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

He has not played enough times yet to show me he isn't ready. All I have seen so far is positives.

739~~~
Perfect opportunity here for wilson, two of the big three strikers are not the same players anymore.. and the one we've brought in is an unknown quantity in terms of fitness. I think the lad will see some game-time this season and will hopefully make a name for himself.

740~~~
He'll likely to get his chances.. No way RVP and rooney will go through the season uninjured. Falcao had just returned from a 7 months lay off as well..

741~~~
We'll replace Rooney and RVP with other established forwards and Wilson will force a move for regular game time. My advice, don't get too close.

742~~~
Bench RVP and Rooney start Wilson alongside Falcao with Mata behind. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

743~~~
I don't agree with that. Was Welbeck as prolific as Wilson for the youth set up? I'm pretty sure Wilson has something like 27 goals in 33 appearances. He's also very, very strong in his all around play. If he's given chances and stays fit, this lad could be a super star.

744~~~
He had an amazing debut. 
Doesn't mean he's ready, especially when the team are getting hung in the media left and right for every move they make - it's not up to him to burden that kind of responsibility. 
He'll get chances and he'll be nurtured properly under LVG, but it's important to be patient and not expect him to be a regular starter at an unrealistic rate.

745~~~
I feel sorry for this kid.

He's being ridiculously over-rated on here.

The inevitable back lash will come soon, too.

746~~~
He wasn't, but he looked every bit a potential superstar. We should also bear in mind that Welbeck was a regular at every England youth level and Wilson got one appearance at schoolboy level but was completely overlooked until u19s. He might just be a late bloomer and could well end up the better player, but Welbeck was an absolute gem of a youngster.

747~~~
Can I borrow your crystal ball?

748~~~
Nothing to do with getting close. If Wilson comes good, club will not unnecessarily spend on strikers from outside. It is matter of making most of the chances when offered. Let's see if Wilson does that.

749~~~
The team last year got backlashed and if anything Januzaj was even better for it. Some people have the right mentality no matter the situation, and Wilson seems that type to me. If you hear him talking about the future, he doesn't say "Oh we will see what happens I need more experience". He says he feels ready and just wants to play for the first team. It's no surprise to me that while the rest of the muppets struggled against MK Dons, in 20 minutes he made 3 goalscoring opportunity. I think give the lad a chance, if he struggles then fine take him out and loan.

750~~~
You only need to look at the past to predict the future. Can either one of you tell me the last time a home grown youth forward besides Welbeck broke into the first team? Bet you'll have to google for an answer.

751~~~
Well that's not true.

Something that's been made absolutely clear in this particular transfer window!

752~~~
If it happens, it happens. I'm sure he'll be given adequate opportunity to prove otherwise. LVG isn't type of player to get rid of youngsters without giving them a chance to prove themselves.

753~~~
Never as clinical. That's the difference and the reason ultimately Welbeck couldn't play in his position enough

754~~~
RVP is going for surgery which makes Wilson 3rd choice, Falcao is injury prone and he becomes 2nd... He will get a few games..

755~~~
Might be wrong here but one of the reasons Welbeck felt he had to leave was because Wilson was declared to be ahead of him in the pecking order. That's not too bad of a sign in all honesty.

756~~~
Januzaj is also a good option up front.

757~~~
List me all the top clubs who have home grown forwards breaking into first team, year after year. Bet you'll have to google for an answer.

758~~~
That's all well and good but even Januzaj wasn't a guaranteed starter last season and towards the end of last season the quality in his performances dropped. And this season he hasn't started brightly either.
I'm not denying his abilities but these are facts of the matter, it looks as though he needs to slowly regain his match sharpness.

Wilson would be under much more pressure than Januzaj ever has been - nobody expected goals from Januzaj but it was a great bonus. Being a guaranteed starting striker means you have to score, and be trusted to score consistently.

Coming on as a sub against Hull and MK Dons and performing well is completely different to starting a game against Chelsea or City & being expected to score past Kompany/Hart & Terry/Courtois. 

He's not ready for that, and it's not worth risking his growth and our league position at this point.

Sure, he can make appearances against lower league clubs, but as Burnley & MK Dons have proven every single team will be playing us knowing that they can win or frustrate us into a draw. That's why it's better to introduce him when the game is won.

759~~~
True, things do change, but we learn our history to try and shape our future and predict or prevent negative repeating patterns/cycles.

LVG does like youth players, but he only has three years to build a successful team and go out with a bang. Don't expect a contract extension, this is his final hurrah. Youth won't be as big a priority as it was at earlier clubs he managed.

760~~~
Is he a bigger talent than Welbeck?

I'd be delighted if he makes similar progress to Welbeck by the time he is 21.

761~~~
That is the thing though I don't think LVG believes in promoting youth players for the sake of it, he has a genuine belief that the promotion of quality youth products lead to successful football. Hence why if he thinks using James is going to benefit the team as a whole, he'll do it. He's not Mourinho... his use of Blackett, proves he isn't afraid of taking risks. If he feels wilson is showing more in training than the others and then the lad scores when he is given game time, he'll promote him sharpish. Names mean feck all to him.

762~~~
I don't care about other clubs in all honesty. United's youth academy has always been revered as an institution of excellence, yet Welbeck is the only forward that made the first team in about 30 years since Whiteside and Hughes. Fergie was big on strikers, being one himself in his playing days and he failed to produce one for the first team bar Welbeck.

763~~~
Haven't you been following this thread?

Yes, because we kept him and sold Welbeck. Therefore Wilson is already better because he's never missed a chance. Or something like that.

764~~~
Im rooting for Wilson. I just know the odds are stacked against him. He'll get his chances and I hope he impresses, because we're definitely going to dip in the transfer market big time to replace Rooney and RVP, and those replacements will get automatic game time.

765~~~
They're directly relevant to this discussion because, as we can see, it's bloody difficult to bring through a homegrown striker.

Welbeck's blazed a trail for Wilson, though, and consider himself unlucky to fall at the final hurdle. If Wilson's a bigger talent, there's no reason he can't go that one step further.

766~~~
A club academy is not a customized machine from where you churn out a striker one season, midfielder next, defender later and so on...We have got all types of players from our academy, depends on the players we scout and how they develop. 
Second, what happens in past hardly matters. If you have a talented striker like Wilson coming through, you do everything possible to give him chance to prove himself at top level and LvG is as good a manager we can have for that. It doesn't matter if we got a striker from academy previously or not.

767~~~
Who did we ahve except Rossi anyway that was even on the verge or did anything outside of the club ?

768~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3E0PuV9S1Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He is a talent though, seems so direct.

769~~~
Januzaj wasn't a guaranteed starter because Moyes didn't want to burn him out. Rooney, RVP, and Mata were starters. The 4th attacker in the lineup was not better than Januzaj. Kagawa, Young, Valencia, etc... weren't better. Furthermore, he rarely played after the Sunderland semi final (january) despite being player of the month in January. It wasn't until a month later that he finally saw minutes on the pitch. That suggests that his performances were not the reason why he stopped playing.

As for this season, he's only really played in two games as he got 5 min in one game and played 20 minutes in cm, a position he's never played before. That's without a pre season in a team where all the attackers are underperforming.

770~~~
Can easily see him ending up the same way as Welbeck.
But then if the rumours about him being placed ahead of Welbeck aren't fabricated bull, the maybe there's hope.

771~~~
One difference between Welbeck and Wilson - Wilson is by far the better finisher. If you can score goal, you will stay at this club.

772~~~
Okay, but he wasn't a starter. Like I said I wasn't doubting his abilities it's simply a fact.

Youngsters have a greater probability to burn out, just like Sterling did towards the end of his first season in the PL for example, or become susceptible to injury like Wilshere.

I'm excited by the prospect of both Januzaj and Wilson but expecting them to start every game whilst we need to win the majority of our games to get us back to where we need to be just isn't the right move for them or for us.
They'll get games but they wont be starters unless they suddenly become world beaters before the end of the season, which by all means would be incredible - but highly unlikely.

edit - Januzaj is much more likely to be a starter because he simply has to play consistently better than Young & Valencia.

773~~~
What gives you that impression? James Wilson is already comfortably better at doing what a striker should do than Danny Welbeck. He has a big future at this club which is why I believe LVG wasn't to fussed in seeing both Hernandez and Welbeck depart.

774~~~
Why "easily"?

Completely different player and completely different manager in charge. Those are massive variables, therefore, the environment for success and failure differ from one another.

775~~~
You realise that Keane and Powell have had loans before and got plenty of games and impressed? They've had far more impact than Wilson. No way is he getting a Premier League loan

776~~~
Dyche went to a couple of reserve matches last season to watch Wilson and was rumored to be keen on a loan deal for Wilson.

777~~~
They were at loan to championship clubs. Big difference. Wilson has moved up the ranks fast. Clubs' scouts track u21 games too to search for talent. Even Demtri Mitchell was mentioned to be having a chance of loan to Southampton. Wilson could have got a premier league loan had we made him available.

778~~~
Quite confident he would have gotten a PL loan if we wanted.

779~~~
Looks like 4th choice and not a bad 3 infront of him to learn from. Rvp will be injured at some point and knowing us Rooney/Falcao will so there is an oppertunity to get some bench time and maybe minutes of the bench. Thats a big chance for him at 18. By the time he is 20, The three infront will be in their 30's and could be perfect timing for him, if he continues to develop.

780~~~
I put Wilson up there with Januzaj as special talents who would gain more staying with United(Being involved with the first team daily)than going out on loan.

781~~~
I think he's perfectly positioned now. The thing to remember is that he's still physically frail. He obviously picks up more than his fair share of injuries and even when fit he rarely gets through 90 minutes of football without some sort of trouble. A lot of it seems down to the ankle he fractured a couple of years back. Hopefully he'll grow out of it but for the time being he needs to be managed properly. Cameos and the odd start for the first team - combined with games for the u21s - seems about right for him at this stage.

782~~~
How do people compare him as a talent to welbeck? I always thought the latter was good but not a top drawer talent, like say, Januzaj.

783~~~
In the little that we ve seen so far of Wilson, I think he is a much bigger prospect than Welbeck. He is a much more natural goalscorer than Danny ever was for us. And what luck for Wilson to be playing alongside RVP, Rooney and Falcao. Wow! Envy that kid. He can learn from the world's best.

784~~~
Wilson is a big, big talent but he isn't as versatile and tactically astute as Welbeck was. The good thing about the latter was that he could be played anywhere across the final third of the pitch and put in a performance. In a fluid system which allows any of the attacking quartet to roam freely across the pitch, Welbeck will thrive. In the last few years at Utd, he never had that, and he will now at Arsenal. 
Wilson is as pure a 9, as you can get. Done a job on the left a few times, but being a striker is his bread and butter. I can never imagine him doing a man-marking job on Alonso like Welbeck did, for example. Losing Welbeck means we lose the tactical flexibility associated with him, and the variety he provided to our attack.

785~~~
Good post.

786~~~
In the latest UWS, it says that while Wilson is extremely eager to impress LVG and get into the first team, Giggs and Warren Joyce are doing all they can to keep the lad's feet on the ground

787~~~
I disagree that we lose out tactically, at Wilson's age Welbeck wasn't man marking anybody

Wilson has the oppertunity and capacity to learn everything Welbeck did, whether he works as hard for the team remains to be seen. What I do suspect though is that Wilson's much better nose for goal will keep him playing closer to it than Welbeck did. But as we've seen from players like Ronaldo and Messi, you can be a goalscorer that starts out from wide and there's no reason Wilson cant provide that option too.

788~~~
We can find tactically astute and hard working players. They're much easier to come by. It's the ones with genuine top drawer quality that tend to be hard to find.

789~~~
Especially in Manchester

790~~~
The answer is probably Mark Hughes. Who, erm, we sold. At (guess what?) 23. Before buying him back under a new manager.

791~~~
And FWIW, LvG is a good enough coach to educate a talented player into a tactically astute one.

792~~~
Bit of an understatement there. He's our most prolific talent in years!

793~~~
While in principle I agree with you, I'd like to ask why should we have a striker that marks another player? Look at all the dominating forces in football today. Do you see their strikers man-marking midfielders? Aguero, Costa, Sturridge, Suarez, Benzema, Muller, Falcao before... the list goes on. Top strikers at top clubs no longer mark players. It is an old tactic that has since been outdated at the very highest level. So what is the highest level? A style of football where the strikers are there to score goals, creating chances and not much else, as they rightly should be. If you play possession football, which is king today, you won't need the strikers to man-mark anyone. Focus on attack.

Here in England we have this fetish of strikers who can 'put in a good shift' or who can 'do a job'. Those days are long gone and worldwide domination of the likes of Barcelona and Bayern prove that. WE can rave all about how Danny marked midfielders out of the game, but the cold hard fact is he couldn't score too well. He's a striker, the position is meant to score goals. If you can't score goals you can't win - sounds trivial doesn't it? Why should we sacrifice an attacking position to play defensive duties? Sure he can position himself as part of the system, but man-marking? It's absurd.

Louis Van Gaal is creating a system where the strikers capitalise on the system and the midfield and defence do the bulk of the defending. This is modern day football, it's about time we ditched the idea of strikers who do everything and let them focus on scoring goals. James Wilson will be a proud exponent of this new culture that's taken over world football. We should move with the times.

794~~~
Heard that he's pulled out of the England U-19 squad injured again. Lets hope that its all just growing pains...

795~~~
Ducker from The Times reporting Welbeck left after being told he was 5th choice striker behind Wilson. Delighted if true, means he's obviously made a big impression with LVG......

796~~~
Where can I find stats comparing Wilson's & Welbeck's time in the youth/reserve setup? I know stats don't tell the whole story but it would be interesting to see.

797~~~
Yes. Hughes and Whiteside. The last actual manc was Andy Ritchie who broke into the team at 17 but left at 20 after 42 apps in 1980. So the odds are stacked up against youth forwards historically.

798~~~
Sadly, there is no such place, except the stats room at Carrington.

799~~~
That story has been circulating a lot, many people saying they got the inside information but no one is revealing their 'sources'. It sounds like some made up shit to me. It doesn't make sense, how can a player without a full first team appearance be above a more experienced and still young player in the perking order? Is it based on training and reserve team games? Its bullocks and truly worrying if true.

800~~~
Completely different types of players, like comparing Berbatov to Owen!

801~~~
I've read that somewhere after the MK Dons game, but i can't find where. LVG promoted Wilson and he was supposed to be 4th choice.

802~~~
The info didn't said that he was above Welbeck just that he was 4th choice, i personnally assumed that Hernandez was gone.

803~~~
That van Gaal for ya, he did the same thing at Ajax to build that amazing young team, he's done it his whole career.

IMHO it's the right move, Wilson is bottled lightning.

804~~~
I have hopes for Wilson but lofty expectations and too much praise must be kept in check. He's not the first impressive young forward to come out of the ranks. So many just like him ended up being shipped off.

805~~~
5th or 4th? It keeps changing. I've seen many accounts where its specifically mentioned that Wilson and Januzaj were ahead of him

806~~~
Januzaj ? Never heard that one.

I heard that Januzaj was going to play centrally and i assumed will compete with Mata, which explains the sell of Kagawa.
But for Wilson it was 4th, RVP, Rooney, Welbeck and Wilson. At the time there was no Falcao.

807~~~
Yep. I saw him for the first time when he was sixteen, and was immediately convinced he was destined for the first team. He scored four times that day, but  the quality of his game was more impressive than the goal tally. Everything you could want in a striker.

Before we signed Falcao, I thought he might challenge Rooney or RvP for a regular spot. Now, I don't know what LvG has in mind. Wilson is going to be big though.

808~~~
You never know, even a world class player needs the right sort of team to get the best out of them, they also need a bit of luck and few injuries.

I'm probably a touch over-excited, but he's by far the most impressive youth player I've seen in my time following them (about 5 years).

He's not mental like Morrison, one of my favorite things about Wilson is that he plays with joy, always a smile on his face. And when he scores it's just a bigger smile and high fives, no biggie.

You can't teach the finishing touch he has, you can't teach that agility.

How many youth strikers can drive through half a defense from the midline and then calmly go around the striker and tap it in?

Not saying he'll do that regularly against the top teams, but he ha so much to his game.

As much as I like Januzaj I think he didn't look that dominant in the reserves.

809~~~
Turning a youth team player into a first team regular is rare in a title winning team.

Wilson is suddenly under added pressure now with the sale of Welbeck.

The best thing United, LVG and the first team players could do is start winning again and take almost all the pressure of the likes of Wilson and Januzaj.

810~~~
I heard it here on the Welbeck thread and the poster said it was from 'inside sources'.

811~~~
The clips I saw of him for the U18s (and occasional game that was televised) blew me away. And he went to then through the U21 team like butter.

I'm almost a touch disappointed he's got to contend with Falcao now, but of course he's not really ready to compete with that quality of striker against top teams, he has much to learn.

I thoroughly trust van Gaal to get him enough games.

812~~~
I think that the fact that Falcao is here now, Wilson is given time to develop, smoothly. He is given at least two years, when he is already a great finisher.

813~~~
Im impressed by Wilson's finishing. All I can say is I hope for the best, because if he finally breaks the 'curse' he might save us millions on a single transfer (because I expect us to be in the market for forwards when RVP retires soon, Rooney as well is almost in his thirties)

814~~~
I think he's an ideal replacement for van Persie, similar games imho.

815~~~
Yeah, the rumor has been that Van Gaal told Welbeck and Cheech that they would be possibly behind Januzaj in this system and Wilson soon. That's when they decided to both leave as Welbeck was as it is causing commotion from last season not happy being played left but wanting a starting striker role. Cheech too was unhappy though he may have settled for being third choice with 2 up top. Maybe Welbeck too.

Falcao was just a bonus/panic/Oppurtunity signing made at the end as he became available at lesser price after the first few games. Dunno how he fits into the plan now.

816~~~
Tbh if I was Welbeck or Hernandez i'd leave too. Its enough trying to break in when you're behind undroppable players like RVP and Rooney only to be told you're behind two teenagers as well, one with only one season under his belt and the other who hasn't even started and played a full single competitive game in his career. I'd be straight pissed

817~~~
That's football, Welbeck and Hernandez put Berbatov in the stands too, even after his best season for us.

818~~~
I get that, but that particular situation is more understandable because Berbatov was 31, and Fergie told him he wanted to play a faster counter attacking style which didn't suit the player.

819~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4195400.ece" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/football/article4195400.ece</a>

820~~~
I don't find this surprising. After the MSC final against City last month where he scored four, in the post match interview Warren Joyce was very keen to keep a lid on the excitement and simply said: 
"He's got a lot of things he has still got to work on. There are things; technically and tactically, he's naive on. He is still a young boy with a lot of natural talent. There are a lot of things he can still improve on but he wants to do that and he can do it this year."

He obviously doesn't want him to get carried away in the inevitable hype, understandably.

821~~~
And people keep saying were came out badly on this deal, and are ruining what the club stands for by selling him.

Facts are unless Welbeck re invented himself in another position he never stood a chance of playing this season.

Wilson's promotion is well deserved, he could flop, he could be fantastic, but we have to give him his chance in the first team, like we did Welbeck.

822~~~
It's not worrying at all. Van Gaal talks all the time about players using their heads more than just their feet, Van Gaal philosophy is not just how to play on the pitch but how to think on the pitch.

When players talk about the great Barca team a few years(sadly it's mainly United talking about it)they say the hardest part of playing them is the mental tiredness,the fact that you have always to keep alert all the time,there's no rest inside your head because they always have the ball. That will hurt your legs more than the running.

Experience is at times just a build up of past information(I understand by now this is all starting to sound a bit silly). So while a player who has 250 appearances will know more possibilities of could happen on the pitch that doesn't mean he know the best way to effect the game in his favour. Also it completely natural that with experience come routine and we've seen at times players get stuck in routines and are just unable to get out of them(I think that it's one of the biggest problems at United at the moment)

Last season Welbeck's chance against Bayren where he tired to chip Neuer was a example of not be able to think on the pitch.No amount of experience would of helped because there was no thinking process just sheer panic(Although I can't blame) 

Now that's not to if it had anyone else they would of scored(Neuer was and still is the best keeper in the world)but it would pretty certain that only a low percentage of players would've gone for the chip.It's being mention before with Danny(As well with other players at United)that he's his at best when it's instinct and that's he's a worst when he's got time.

Experience is still a vital part of building a player but to use it you still need the simply foundations and simply being able to think on the pitch is one of them.

823~~~
Out of curiosity, does anyone remember what Welbeck's finishing was like when he was in the youth teams? I know Wilson's finishing is one of his strongest assets and Welbeck is consistently criticised for his ability to put the ball in the net, would be interested to hear what Welbeck was like in this respect when he was a youngster

824~~~
This is not a great  example. Top players have missed chances like that. He made the wrong decision, you're putting way more into it, like he lacks football intelligence. I get the point you're making about instinct and time, but Welbeck has shown before that he can score in both situations (instinctive and with time). In my opinion the only remedy to that is more game time (it worked for Sturridge), and im sure we'll see a different Welbeck at Arsenal.

825~~~
Welbeck was a decent enough finisher in his youth team days. It was never his defining quality; he'd miss a few sitters but he scored some absolute stunners as well.

826~~~
The example was more the fact he tried to chip Neuer,the attempt was from sheer panic.Your right lots of great players miss chance it how Danny miss it that was my point it was the approach that was the problem not the fact he missed. .

As football 'intelligence'(I think there's a difference between thinking a certain way on the pitch and football 'intelligence'  it's clear Danny has that.

But as you said we will have to wait and see.

827~~~
No one thought world class Torres would have so many comedy misses, some worse than Welbecks miss. Are you suggesting by use of that example , that LVG might have looked at something like that to help make his mind up about the player's position of importance to the team?

828~~~
No I'don't think LVG would of have looked at it at all. It was just an example of a player in pressure situation not thinking football. The only reason I picked Welbeck was because it was the first one I could think of.

Anyway it's starting to go way of topic.

829~~~
Joyce in right too.

 There will be a big learning curve stepping up to the big show, but he's ready for the trial by fire.

830~~~
What a strike force to learn from. Seriously. This kid has got some talent and he has got such an opportunity! Hopefully he takes a page out of Ronnie's book and works his are off. Danny's problem has always been composure. I think that's the difference between the two really and that has to be the reason Danny has been moved on IMO.

831~~~
Scoring / finishing is a habit, the more you do it, thé eaaier it becomes to score. Long spells or welbecks match time  seen him out wide not as often getting into this habit proving very difficult to get back. Wilson however, has been scoring for fun in recent times, he has a variety of good assets which put him in good stead to lead our line eventually. One thing I hope doesn't happen is management messing around with his position. Play him Striker or don't. But in terms of learning off his team mates, I Darby thinnk of the product combining roon Persie and falcao

832~~~
Always felt we could do with him going to Spain/Portugal and get some serious game time. If he progresses well, a spot in the first team is there for him when he is 21/22. Can he wait that long?

Great Video of him from last season. His dribbling and close control is excellent.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5dFgez6nGo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

833~~~
Januzaj did look that dominant in the reserves. Januzaj was consistently looking like the best player on the pitch every match. It didn't matter if he didn't score, his touch, intelligence, and creativity was on display all the time. Wilson didn't have that effect because as a striker he needs service at times. Sometimes he would have a quiet game because he was isolated up front and the rest of the team wasn't offering anything. Januzaj on the other hand always looked for the ball as he's an attacking midfielder and so always looked to influence the match. Januzaj only looked like a scorer in the blue stars and dallas cup youth tournaments.

Wilson had by far the better end product, naturally as a striker, and also had some magical goals.

That's what makes me excited about Wilson. It's not only the rate at which he scores, it's the type of goals he scores. He had some unbelievable solo runs that finished in a goal, and he had some great strikes from distance. He's a natural when it comes to striking the ball.

834~~~
Doesn't change my opinion, and not a knock on Januzaj I thought he was very good in the reserves.

835~~~
I was gona say something similar. Campbell was more accomplished at finishing as was Kiko at the time.

I think Wilson (injuries permitting) will go on to eclipse all of them.

Whats the story with him at the moment, fit or not?

836~~~
So now almost all paper carrying presumably a brief that he was one of the major reasons to let Welbeck go or why he left. 

Been promoted to the first team squad and LVG rates him highly.

837~~~
Supposedly he was injured right before Burnley.

838~~~
Again ? Thought he had withdrawn for the England u20 squad anyway. His knack of picking up so many injuries is most worrying aspect.

839~~~
He'll be okay when hes older, hopefully. Kids get loads of injuries.

840~~~
The main thing with these injuries is not to push him and rush him back. There were a few of the U21 matches at the end of last year where he looked visibly uncomfortable at times and I was a bit disappointed we had him out there tbh. I know Michael Owen has talked about if he was allowed to rest more as a young player he would have been able to last at a high level for much longer. However he was such a vital player he was forced to play through the injuries and it fecked him up before he even hit his prime. With how many knocks Wilson seems to pick up we should be wrapping him in cotton wool and making sure he fully gets over them. He has got loads of time and there is no point risking serious damage in the long-term. Hopefully we have the best staff to handle him in the best way possible.

841~~~
Is there a recurring theme with his injuries? Muscle strains/tears or bumps and bruises?

842~~~
This kid is amazing. I am happy his our 4th striker now.

843~~~
I read yesterday (sorry not sure where – maybe here) that Utd had done their research on Neuer for that match and identified that he likes to spread himself Schmeichel-style in one-on-ones. Apparently they briefed Welbeck on this, saying that in a one on one with Neuer he should keep it on the ground rather than chip or loft it. He got in the one on one and tried a chip....

844~~~
The lad will learn a great amount of RvP, Rooney and now Falcao. When you consider the age of them strikers, it's probably ideal for Wilson to break through in 1-2 years. He will most likely be coming of the bench in the next year and a half, so maybe a loan move is needed for him.

If we do loan him out, we need to weigh up who to and insert some clauses. A loan move can make or break a player and with a kid this talented, we need to do everything to help him fulfill his potential. Macheda was thought of as a massive talent but a few bad loan moves i.e. QPR and Sampdoria and he didn't look as good and his career stagnated. Maybe it was a case of he was never going to be good enough but I very much doubt them loan moves helped him.

In contrast, Welbeck went to PNE played frequently and looked impressive, he then went to Sunderland where he agreed with Bruce that if he was fit, he had to play and this is when they had quite a strong forward line. He played a whole season for them, improved, scored some goals and came back to United being able to challenge for a first team spot.

845~~~
If that's true, then wow, very interesting. Also the chip he tried was awful. 

Very true on that. We wasted Rossi's loan opportunity by sending him to Newcastle who barely played him. Also, the style of play of the team we send him to should be important too.

846~~~
It's true. I think Andy Mitten has said that after Moyes was sacked....that Moyes was furious with Welbeck at half-time.

Welbeck has shown against Bayern Munich in both games that he isn't good enough as starting striker for us.

I really like Wilson and rate him higher than Welbeck after his debut against Stoke.

847~~~
The only thing the Bayern game has showed is that Rooney should have been playing at all for us. Second game horrible, horrible, missing a big chance and then blaming Welbeck for the pass and so on.....

848~~~
Rooney should have never played....Moyes must make the decision.

But in Munich.....Welbeck must score the 2-1 for us and not pass to Rooney.....if he shoots on goal then the ball is in the net!!!!!!!

849~~~
IMO we have the perfect window of opportunity under the current manager to consider loaning some of the kids to Eredivisie teams - specifically the trio of Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV. Smaller league so some of our more gifted ones will get plenty of time, European experience plus the chance to further their education at some wonderful schools of football. I'd really like to see Wilson at Ajax. They don't have an abundance of strikers so he may get some game time and then gradually establish himself as a first team starter. A couple of years there would do him real good and be less strenuous on his body than being thrown to the wolves in the Premier League at age 18. He's still a bit wiry and has a history of getting injured. Learning from Falcao, Robin, Wayne is great but it can't compensate to relatively less playing time. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

850~~~
Eeehh we can't loan Wilson or someone else to Eredivisie clubs now

Plus i think this clubs (Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord) have their own kids
Twente, Vitesse or Heerenveen is more possible i reckon

851~~~
Roger that, I think thats a good suggestion especially with the track record that Dutch clubs have of developing youngsters.

852~~~
Ajax best striker is 17-year old Dutchman and their second best is 20-years old Pole loaned from Leverkusen. He would be automatic starter for them. Also Feyenoord sold Pelle so they have big hole in attack. Only PSV is definitely not for Wilson.

Of course Ajax still has that Iceland guy - Kolbeinn Sigsomething, but he's constantly injured anyway...

853~~~
What kind of eejit would try and chip Neuer anyway?

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OuAjWztn5AF/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

854~~~
That's Weidenfeller.

855~~~
Umm I was thinking Ajax more because of the Van Gaal connection and his close friendship with De Boer plus Edwin being a director helps. They do take in kids from other clubs from time to time - Barcelona more so than others. We could have a similar working relationship with them. Send some of our promising ones out, help with the talent drain that Ajax suffer from each window (right now they have a deficiency of strikers hence Wilson would benefit) while only asking for progression of the players in return. Not entirely convinced with the benefits of sending our youngsters to some place like Vitesse TBH. I dunno what their core beliefs wrt education are because none of Chelsea's loanees have managed to benefit in the long term. Yeah now is a bit late but it could be done in say December. Anyway just something I'd like to see, not sure if it's even plausible..

856~~~
You sure? Was Neuer subbed off? He was definitely in goal when Lamela scored?

857~~~
Lamela scored in 1st half and this is 2nd half. Weidenfeller it is.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/819236/Live" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/819236/Live</a>

858~~~
Weidenfellers first two touches were to pick it out of the net.

859~~~
Feck. Neuer's such an unbeatable cnut, I liked the idea of him shipping four.

860~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_UEFA_Champions_League_knockout_phase#Manchester_United_v_Schalke_04" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010–11_UEFA_Champions_League_knockout_phase#Manchester_United_v_Schalke_04</a>

Been there Done that.

861~~~
Re people talking about loaning Wilson out, that's clearly not on the agenda. Van Gaal regards him as 4th choice striker, which is why Welbeck was allowed to go. Wilson will get some games - probably FA Cup and maybe the odd league game against weak opposition.

862~~~
Burn

863~~~
He will definately get some league minutes IMO.  With the injury records of Rooney and RVP alone he is likely to be used in at least 6-10 games I reckon.  On their current form I wouldn't put it past him keeping one of them out of the team either if he does well.

864~~~
Yes, true. The presence of Falcao and Wilson will concentrate their minds. Welbeck wasn't really competition as a striker.

865~~~
Van Persie vs Madrid missed probably more pretty good chances the season before.

866~~~
Yes, but Van Persie is a proven striker. Welbeck was never close to his standard  as a finisher.

867~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5dFgez6nGo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>  Nice compilation but the music is terrible. Is it ever not?

His dribbling/technical ability is also much better than I had envisaged. He runs past defenders for fun. 

That run at 2:09 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

868~~~
Are we sure he's not a winger?

869~~~
He could certainly do a brilliant job as a wide forward in a 4-3-3 IMO.

870~~~
Looks to have a remarkable close control!

871~~~
Looking at that video, we could stick him on the right wing and he would instantly
provide a more potent threat than Valencia.

872~~~
Believe he is the best young prospect for a while- fast, strong, two-footed, powerful shot, fantastic close control, vision, calm.  Will be a star one day, hopefully.

873~~~
then you lose is poaching threat

874~~~
I wouldn't class him as a poacher. He would ne ideally suited wide in a front three IMO.

875~~~
I think he will be better as the centre forward eventually but obviously a lot of competition there at the moment, If we do start playing a 433 then the wide forward role might give him some chances at first team level.

876~~~
Can't see him leading the line, he does better running with the ball, rather than finding space in the box.

877~~~
I could see him playing the role that Robben played in Holland's 352 formation and relaly using his acceleration to start from deep.

878~~~
He'd do well in the Pedro role, using his pace out wide and popping up at the back post.

879~~~
It's not so much that he's a poacher, but he's not going to get as many scoring chances out wide as he would centrally. That's a waste of his finishing ability.

880~~~
His instincts in the box are very good. Almost similar to peak RVP where he pounces on a oppurtinity with his left foot or even his head. (See his first goal that he scored on debut.) Don't think he can lead the line alone right now though at that level so playing with a partner up top would be better for him. Infact, partnering him with one of our 3 strikers is the best spot for him  in a front 2.

He can play a Wide forward role in a 4-3-3 but again don't think there he would contribute that much in general play as of now.

881~~~
Nah. He's more Sanchez/Messi than RVP/Chicharito. (Not in ability terms, yet!)

882~~~
Are we doing the comparison thing again?

I'm sticking with Liverpool era Fernando Torres.

883~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

884~~~
What? That's where he's excelled for the youth teams. It's like you're ignoring everything he's done as a striker for the youth team.

885~~~
I haven't seen much of him, but this is an outright lie. Almost every game I've seen him in he's been a predator inside the box. Yes he's a wizard with the ball at his feet too, which is what makes him such an exciting prospect

886~~~
I have seen a lot of him, and he is not about getting on the end of things, although he can do that.
He is more suited to creating for himself and others, hence suggesting wide striker rather than CF.
If any of you think leading the line will get the best out of him, that's your prerogative. I think you'd be discarding two thirds of his game.

887~~~
Such an amazing finisher for his age. Can do it on both feet which is great to see

888~~~
Was gonna post that video.
How much more often is he either off the front or wide, carrying the ball, and how much of it shows him finding space to get on a cross or short pass?
Watch and decide what he favours. If you say poaching/CF you are lying. (to use your own vernacular)

889~~~
Striker. If he has the positional sense to pinch hit on the wing for short periods of a match, then that's a bonus too

890~~~
Cop-out! Striker? I'm not on about him being a fecking winger. 
Way not to answer the question. Most of his work is from deep or out wide. Not playing baseball for short periods. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

891~~~
He is just nothing like Messi or Sanchez (who are completly different players anyway), because he wont be able to beat his man reliably in a 1v1 (e.g. like Januzaj). He might do good as second striker or wide forward, but this role/position is very contested; many different types of players can play it so you have to be really really good to set your mark.
I see your point why you dont think that he is a central forward and I tend to agree, but thats the only role very he might have a chance to become a top player.

892~~~
I don't even know what you're talking about.

893~~~
He is better at playing off the shoulder and getting in behind the last man than any young striker I can remember since Michael Owen. His pace and movement are near impossible for CBs to keep up with. His ability to drop deep and run with it is just what elevates him to another level. He also has great instinct in the box. He has played out left before for some of the youth teams so he could play a wide forward role while breaking through to get minutes but ultimately he will be best as a centre forward for me.

894~~~
As a striker they're not going to stay centrally all the time. They'll drop to link up play, go out wide (either side) when the team is defending leaving space to dribble, be in the box, etc...

He doesn't have the skills of an Alexis/Messi type player to play out wide consistently. He has great technique for a striker, but it's different when comparing him to other attackers. His finishing ability is so good that he needs to play as the 9 so he can gobble up as many chances as he can. We saw against Spurs, Wolves, etc... that he can find little space in the box and finish. Even using Sanchez/Messi as an example, they were moved centrally to get the best out of them.

895~~~
That video is like a story, going through the matches in pitches with a few supporters to finally making his debut in the biggest clubnstadium in England and you can hear the crowd, its fantastic!

896~~~
He beats men for fun, usually with pace, but has plenty of skill too. I have more faith in Wilson than Januzaj making it to the top.
I was on about the Messi/Sanchez position, not their styles. (Wide forward, or inside right in old money)
If he is good enough, he will play where he is best. Things change, in our side recently, dramatically.

897~~~
That corrigan guy does some top videos.

898~~~
I can see him become one of my favorite players. Skilful, clever, and hardworker. Feels like he has that X factor to be a top player. Just look at the type of goals he scored. So many "oohh.. f*ck!" moment.

899~~~
You could apply most of that to Ronaldo (no comparison, as one seems to have to say, all the fecking time these days), but the best position to get the most out of <b>his</b> talents, are not as a no.9. 
Wilson is more suited to running at a defence, than wrestling a couple of monster CBs.

900~~~
There's some serious X factor there. Very exciting player

901~~~
He will never beat men for fun at the top level. Very few players are actually capable of of beating their man in a 1v1 reliably. There are maybe around 20 players who can actually do that on a CL-level. Eventually less. 
He doesnt have the agility/low center of gravity/body control/ball control to dribble like Messi/Iniesta and is missing speed to just overpower players like bale or robben.

If he plays as wide forward his biggest strength is to run off the shoulder off his marker and behind the line. He could provide a good amount of goals with the right service. He also seems to be fairly energetic, hard to get off the ball and he seems to have decent work rate. All in all a good all around packages, but nothing like you are suggesting.

902~~~
Yeah. I can see why van Gaal feels Wilson should be given more chance this season. His quick thinking and ability to create space to shoot is just incredible for an 18 y.o. player. Exciting player indeed.

903~~~
Wait. He's missing speed? I saw him run past about 10 players against Man City to score

904~~~
Wilson isn't missing speed. That's the reason why he can run past defenders and score. He's really fast.

905~~~
Never seen you in the reserve forum, how many times have you seen him play?

906~~~
All this talk of playing him wide is quite amusing, don't think I've seen him play there for the reserves, did he play there for the U16s or early in his U18 days?

Perhaps because Welbeck was forced onto the wing people are expecting the same for him?

I still think the best comparison is van Persie (in style not current ability, obviously).

He could probably do a job out there but it would be a bit of a waste for my money.

907~~~
did u see Ravel or Pogba play for the youth teams?

908~~~
Yeah he played there occasionally for the under age teams, when he first came into the under 18's and for England under 16's  but centre forward is undoubtedly his best position

909~~~
Whilst not his preferred position it wouldn't be the worst idea in fairness. Robin played out on the right a lot for Feyenoord and Arsenal when Henry, Bergkamp and Reyes were kicking about. Samuel Eto'o played out on the right of a front 3 for Inter too during their treble season with Milito at #9. Even Robert Lewandowski played in wider positions when Barrios was at Dortmund.  If playing there can ensure vital first team minutes for Wilson then why not IMO until he's ready to take over full time as the center forward once the older ones leave/ retire/ unravel ? And it never hurts to show a little flexibility.

910~~~
It certainly can work to help a player develop, agreed, though I worry a bit about any player getting to far away from what got them to where they are.

Of course he couldn't play wing back, so he can only play striker in the 352.

It would be interesting to see him play wide in a 433, but again that's not what got him here and there will be a bigger learning curve for him to learn that position at EPL level than he will as a striker, where all his recent experience is.

Maybe for this season if we use di Maria in midfield hew could play out wide, but I'd like us to have something much better than a super young striker to play out wide, someone who had shown they excel out wide (whatever the age).

911~~~
The Cafe has been overrating our own youngsters for years, but this Wilson is someone I really rate.

912~~~
Yep him losing the lethal goal scoring touch might be an issue. But if he could maintain that aspect while learning the nuances of playing wide, it would undoubtedly improve his overall game and stamina levels. And one wouldn't put it beyond Van Gaal either. The Dutch love playing youngsters in a multitude of positions just to increase their football IQ and feel for the game.

But you're right and all. In the system we currently employ, playing him as a wind back would be suicidal and even Louis wouldn't be that radical. Can't envision him being anything other than a striker in the 3-5-2, not unless we switch to a 4-3-3 or its hybrid formations.

913~~~
Wilson reminds me of Van Basten in their similar style of play and multiple ways of scoring.

914~~~
The new Michael Owen

915~~~
Meant as a home-grown striker, of course Pogba will be a world class midfielder and Ravel had the talent but wrong attitude. Also liked Danny Welbeck as well who I thought would become a big star but another story. But Wilson is on a different level as a striker.

916~~~
Clearly you're underrating him. He's more of a Pele/Fat Ronaldo hybrid.

917~~~
As long as that's pre-Madrid etc I'd take that.

918~~~
Clearly you're underrating Van Basten. I think <a class="username" data-user="47956, @sglowrider" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47956/">@sglowrider</a> is spot on from what i've seen of Wilson's goal scoring abilities and so far. Even Wilson's style of dribbling is similar to the Dutch legend.

919~~~
The future is all round forwards rather than specialists like Chicharito.  Wilson can do it by becoming a better version of Welbeck, with more goal scoring ability.

920~~~
We have RVP, Rooney and Falcao as our strikers so that will definitely limit Wilson's chances there, unless Rooney is dropped into midfield. Over the past 18 months, with the shocking decline of our pacey players like Nani and Valencia, teams have found it much
easier to contain us by forcing us to pass it side to side. 
However with the new players we have added this summer, we now have very good options to attack down the wing if LVG choose to play with wingers in Di Maria, Januzaj and maybe Wilson can be used as a wide attacker too. He has the skill and speed to excel in this role and I am sure he will jump at the opportunity if offered the chance, seeing that his chances to play as a striker for now is currently limited. 
It is about time United regain that fear factor it used to have and in these players we have the chance to make that happen again.

921~~~
He is more like a Puskas.

922~~~
Misread it. Micky Quinn sprang to mind.

923~~~
Didnt say was a poacher, he still has a poaching threat. Rooney has it to but wouldnt class him as one either. He is suited to playing centrally. Look what happened with welbeck

924~~~
I agree. He's not a strict poacher clearly as shown by his speed and dribbling ability, which will be useful outside of the box, but he's too good a natural finisher (well at least potentially) to be wasted out wide even in a front 3 IMO.

925~~~
He should be sent on loan either in January or at the end of the year.

926~~~
Spot on. Think you can only give the opinion of he would be good out wide from watching his videos on youtube. Those who are regular watchers of the ressies will understand what he is all about. He comes alive in the box. class act we cant stall his development by making him a winger

927~~~
Not going over this again but, I refute the suggestion that you can only have a differing opinion if you don't watch the reserves.

928~~~
Natural striker.....let's play him out wide!

929~~~
Anyone who watched him in the reserves would be very excited to see him play as striker, and would have never seen him wide unless they watched him early in his U18 career.

As one of his biggest fans I find this idea that he should play wide coming from people who haven't watch him to be pretty silly, to put it nicely.

930~~~
He is a #9, its pretty obvious. He almost always plays there and has constantly excelled there. Why change anything?

931~~~
Yeah but then who comes if Rooney gets injured and RVP has one of his inevitable injury spells?

He'll get game time with us, for sure.

932~~~
So I haven't watched him in nearly enery game for the last two years, telling anyone who would listen that the best English striker since Shearer plays in our youth team(s)?
Some patronizing cnuts on here at times.
Inside-forward or wide striker is not the same as "out wide" or winger. 
If you think u18 and u21 football directly translates to first team football only older, then it is no wonder you struggle to grasp what I'm saying.
I rate him as high as anyone, but I don't expect to see him as a regular centre-forward for 4-5 years.

933~~~
Remember when we played Schalke and Neuer had a madness of a first half against us? If i remember correctly I think it was Giggs who was slotted in by rooney, Neuer came out and made himself look big but giggs kept his shot along the ground and it broke the deadlock. We obviously went on to win 4-1.

934~~~
That was the first leg and United won 2-0 that match. The 2nd leg United won 4-1 and had 2 Anderson goals and a Gibson goal.

935~~~
He might be a 9 long term but I can't see him as a lone/lead the line striker at PL level for 2-3 years until he - excuse the cliche - bulks up and gets to grips with the physicality. So I think in a 433 we would see him mostly as a wide forward and he has the tools to do well there and potentially it could become his best position. I think he would really benefit if we do switch to a diamond because he could do well in a front two even at his age, as his physique would be less important. At youth levels he has looked like a man amongst boys but that simply wont happen in the PL whilst he is still just a young lad.

936~~~
Wut, I thought it was the second leg. My bad.

937~~~
I think if we continue with the 352 which looks likely it may suit Wilson a little more to start with, just due to the fact he doesn't, as others have said have the physique to lead the line as a sole forward in a 433... yet, at his age.
Some saying he should be sent out on loan.. personally I think hes ready to make our bench week in, week out, if he were at any other club that didn't have a Rooney, RvP and Falcao he'd certainly be pushing hard at this point, I can't even grasp how many clubs would be falling over themselves to get him on loan should that happen. (doubtful it will)

938~~~
He still has plenty of time to go out on loan, if he could get the right move, I would be all for it. But the odd appearance this season and a good number of games for the reserves will be good at this stage. He is still very young, we are just too impatient when it comes to wanting to see players come through.

939~~~
If we played a proper front 3 then would playing from the left like Neymar does at Barcelona hurt Wilson?

940~~~
Any game time is going to benefit him but if we played with 3 up front, I think Di Maria and Januzaj would stop him getting any time in that role.

941~~~
Are you drunk?

Did I say anything about your opinion or whether you've watched him?

You were defending those who say they think he would be better playing in wide positions rather than centrally, without actually ever having seen him play beyond his two United appearances.

We're not taking about those who have seen him develop, like yourself, we're taking about everyone else. So please don't insult me I'm not questioning your personal qualifications to judge Wilson's potential to be better in wide positions rather than central ones.

Sure, those who don't know him can take a quick glace and think, 'interesting player wonder if he would be even better out wide (or as an inside forward or a wide striker)'. Everyone is entitled to an opinion of course.

But their knowledge base is extremely limited, like someone who has only studied politics for a month and drawn their conclusions already.

Fair enough, but don't expect those who have been studying it for years to be impressed.

And to some extent the opinion of someone who has seen a football player for one game and a sub appearance don't hold as much weight as those who have been watching him for years.

Whether it would be good for his development is beside the point, we're only taking about the value and quality of the opinion of someone in regards to a player they've seen for less than two games.

(As an aside, since you have watched Wilson develop, I would not roll my eyes at your argument about why he would be better in wide positions, if you want to make one, or direct me to where you've already made this argument.)

942~~~
Wilson is a natural predatory finisher. To shunt him out to the wing in some sort of Welbeck role would be criminal. I don't think Van Gaal will ever play him as anything but a central striker.

943~~~
He isn't going to be starting many games with RVP and Falcao in front of him.

Needs a loan ASAP. Hopefully to a Prem team, as he's clearly already good enough.

944~~~
There will be no loan. LVG needs 4 strikers in the squad - that's why Welbeck was sold. If he'd been intending to loan Wilson out he wouldn't have allowed Welbeck to go.

945~~~
This is not the best situation for Wilson. He needs to be playing games most weeks, simply because he's 100% ready and it would be futile holding him back just so he can score hat tricks in the reserves every other week.

However, there is the possibility that if Van Gaal insists on always playing two strikers for the rest of the season. That he (Wilson) still may get a descent amount of playing time, as it will then mean that we will have four players competing for two slots, rather than four players competing for just one.

946~~~
I should imagine he'll start in the FA Cup and a few league games against bottom half teams. Plus a few runouts as sub when we're 4 or 5 up against the likes of Liverpool and City <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

947~~~
Nothing new here really but it's exciting times for Wilson. Can't wait to see how he develops.

948~~~
Think 2/3 seasons under those 3 strikers, RVP will be 33/34 and he'll be prime to move up for first XI place.

949~~~
Wondering Is he still injured, btw ? Not got any updates.

950~~~
He played in the behind closed doors friendly against Bury the other day and scored

951~~~
He'll get game time this season. All it will take is a injury to one of Falcao, Rooney or Van Persie and he'll be almost certain to come on as a sub, especially if we play two up top. Injury to two of them at the same time and he'll start.

952~~~
Ah ok thanks. The Sky article mentioned Herrera, Rafael, Anderson featuring in a 4-2 win and didn't spot him in the training clips so was wondering.

Any idea who the other scorers were ? And who else featured from the younger lot ?

953~~~
The amount of pressure the media and we are putting on him already is crazy!

954~~~
If he get's 10 or so games this season including subs, he'll probably grab a few goals and that 10 games at United will be worth more then playing 30+ elsewhere. We need to look after his development and fitness. Unless we thought he needed to be brought down a peg or two

Who would you rather he learn from? Average players or world class players? What better environment for the him then Old Trafford? What a boost we've given him by selling Welbeck and loaning out Hernandez and some people would crush him by just loaning him out? Even if it was till Jan, he'd come back in the same situation. You might argue he'll have had games under his belt but he's training with the first team. If he get's selected playing for our first team, he'll have earnt it.

955~~~
My biggest worry for him is is fitness and whether or not he can remain injury free for the next few years. He definitely has the potential to surpass Welbeck, whether he will get to the next few levels above (RVP, Rooney, etc) no one can know.

956~~~
Wouldn't a loan out be counter-productive and a waste of time considering the following :-

1. He wouldn't be learning positive traits from world class players
2. He wouldn't be taking in important lessons in developing a knowledge of LvG's philosophy

If the philosophy learning is a crucial component to learning to perform in his system, why would moving elsewhere make sense?

957~~~
I see this 'staying to be tutored by world class strikers" thing is another 'redcafe-ism' that was started by someone and is now been regurgitated by other users like sheep.

958~~~
One of the daftest logic you'll see, people think he'll improve more by training with Falcao(even though he'll keep warming the bench whether he is ready to play or not because he'll never get game time ahead of our "stars" upfront), than actually playing competitive games. Redcafe logic at it's best.

959~~~
At his age, there is much he can learn by being around 3 top strikers. He has to get gametime though.

960~~~
Think at his age training with WC players and playing the friendly games we do behind closed doors in between helps him improve actually.

Given his physical frailties and injury issues i'd rather not loan him right now. PL window has passed now anyway and he'd get kicked in the championship without protection.

Who suggested loaning him anyway right now ?

961~~~
He can learn everything but he'll never show it on the pitch if he doesn't play regulary, and I don't see him playing too much football with the competition he has and with us not playing the Champions league and League cup. Btw I am not suggesting the loan either, my point is just that Falcao signing will stall his progress, and not help him like some people (want to) think.

962~~~
Exactly my thoughts. Saved me writing them down!

963~~~
Spending a year as an 18 year old competing for places with three of the top ten strikers in world football at their peak is hugely beneficial to any young talented player who believes he can reach that level. He can learn so many good habits in terms of positioning, movement and decisions as well as how to carry yourself as a professional at the very top. You'd be stupid to think he wont benefit.

However, if 18 monthss down the line he's still not getting regular gametime then you'd start to worry.

964~~~
I don't see how its just rhetoric. You would learn a lot in those training sessions with Falcao, Rooney, and RvP to tutor him. You learn from playing but you can't learn everything from it.

965~~~
Was mentioned by LVG as one of those injured in today's presser.

966~~~
He was injured prior to Burnley. I don't think he said he's still injured. Just that he's not ready to play a PL match yet and they want to be careful with him.

967~~~
How many of our loanees have done well guys? They all fail, simply because the clubs don't give a dogshite about them and if someone like Wilson plays in a very defensive and bad side, it just doesnt fit him at all. Keep.

968~~~
Lawrence,Lingard and M.Keane all had good loans last season and one of them is with the first team now.

Agree that I won't send Wilson on loan as of yet.Considering our 3 LB/LWB (Shaw,James,Young) are either injured or not fit enough to play the whole game at the moment I won't rule out it will happen at some point with our strikers.

969~~~
Lawrence his loan was decent, Lingard had a brilliant start but it went backwards from then on. But they were good/decent loans, out of the many. Our loanees often seem not to do really well, wouldnt loan him.

970~~~
Johnstone and Barmby had good loans as well last season.People tend to remember bad loans rather than good ones though.When he needs to get the experience that we can't provide, loan is the only choice.

971~~~
Thats assuming he goes on loan to a team that will fully use him. We sent G.Rossi to Newcastle and he barely played. Ideally, he would be loaned to a premier league team that will actually play him every game. Its a shame that Barca can send their youths to teams like Sevilla, and see them performing in their league day on day out.

Wilson on loan to like Southampton and getting game time would be the most ideal solution. But prem teams dont seem to like doing that here.

972~~~
I'm sure if there's no cap for PL loan Leicester will try to bring in a lot of our lads.

973~~~
I believe it is 2 players max loaned from 1 club.

974~~~
What is the benefit of sending him out on loan to a club, even a Premier League one, that doesn't believe, play or perform to the philosophy or mentality that LvG believes in? Isn't it counter-productive for him to come under tutelage of lesser quality players playing in a system that doesn't match his skill-set? Doesn't going out on loan delay the process of Wilson learning LvG's approach and role? What LvG expects of Wilson in terms of precise role, I imagine, will differ greatly from what others expect.....and won't that delay his learning?

I don't think Sunderland did Welbeck any good. I don't think it'll do Wilson any good. 

Train with the best, observe the best, play with the best, play as the best.

975~~~
Not sure who else scored or played was just told he played part of the game and scored

976~~~
To send someone like Wilson out on loan with his injury problems, would be madness. Partly because our medical staff is (or hopefully should be) a lot better than in a Championship or League-1 side. And partly because I fear they would feel pressure to use him, even if he wasn't 100% fit. 

First we need to sort out his injury-problems, then we can send him out on loan

977~~~
Johnstone probably was the best of the bunch - he was brilliant last season

978~~~
Yeah, I said in my next post that loan might not be ideal either. It all depends of the club you loan him too, and of course player himself, usually players who are physically ready and are big talents find it easier to get enough playing time, it's simple really. If manager finds him much better than the options they've got, of course he'll play him, but if he realise he is as good as one of players he already has and who will actually play for them next year too, then it's a no brainer for that manager who to pick. That's why the club needs to be careful with loaning the players, and I don't think we were that much lately, altough it's fair to say that players we loaned weren't really that big talents as we would maybe think. Wilson definitely is, and shouldn't be wasting any time.

979~~~
Where's he ?

LVG said 2/3 weeks ago he wasn't fully ready and he seemingly played in the Behind closed doors friendly.

Could use him off the bench with all 3 strikers starting now.

980~~~
If he's fit, I think the defensive crisis isn't helping his cause much. Either way, we need to get him back playing even if it's reserve level.

981~~~
Still injured.

982~~~
Burnley would be a great loan. They only have 1 goal so far this season and desperately need some attacking threat, and it ain't coming from Jutkiewicz or Marvin Sordell, who is truly horrid. 

Other than that, I fear he'd be buried if loaned to a Prem side. There are lots of shit Prem teams with half-decent number strikers like QPR (Austin and Vargas) or even Palace (Chamakh, Gayle and Campbell all bring at least something to the table). It's not like at CM where players like Burnley's CM's (sorry David Jones, you were a great reserve player here and are a good passer who just grew up in the wrong country) Whelan and Barton are all first choice despite not being good enough for top-level football.

983~~~
No way we'll loan him unless we want to use W.Keane as our 4th striker.

984~~~
Wouldn't be surprised if we loaned him. Januzaj can be the 4th striker.

985~~~
Sunderland would be a good loan move for him IMO, Poyet has no goals up front at all and I think Wilson would do well under him.

986~~~
Yeah I can't see a loan at all. Would be a waste for both him and United(I think he's just injured at the moment was in the stands with Fellaini,so he's clearly in the first team squad)

987~~~
Austin's dreadful. Utterly Championship standard.

988~~~
2 goals so far this season for a struggling team isn't bad. Both were great finishes too.

989~~~
I don't like the idea of Januzaj as a striker. It takes away both Wilson's chances to get minutes, as well as playing Januzaj is a position that doesn't really suit him in my opinion.

990~~~
It won't matter either way as Januzaj likely won't see much playing time as a striker.

991~~~
Go and talk to QPR fans, see what they think of him and whether he's up to it.

992~~~
I have. My dads one. I watch a good few of their games as a result and I think he's decent. Not as good as Remy but I could see him getting 15+ goals in the PL.

993~~~
He plays eerily similar to a young RVP. Even the way he runs at times. Thought he had a good little cameo today.

994~~~
Enjoyed that bit of control when he first came on.

995~~~
Nice to see him get on the pitch but he was shoved out wide right and we turn to shit at the end of every match which makes it hard for any of our subs to make much of an impact.

996~~~
Can't really judge him based on that performance, but the minutes will do him the world of good. The more minutes he gets, the more he'll feel he belongs there.

997~~~
Only noticed his nice little touch just after coming on. Shame we sat back the whole time he was on the pitch, as it never gave him a chance to actually do anything. Good to see him get on the pitch at least.

998~~~
Great to see him on the pitch and showed some nice touches.

999~~~
He does look like a very talented striker. He's got good speed and touch on the ball. This season is a great opportunity for him. With Rooney suspended and Welbeck leaving gives him a chance to get more minutes than we predicted he would. Van Gaal isn't afraid to throw youngsters into the team and of course he's still subbing Falcao in the last quarter of games. Chances will be there for the taking.

1000~~~
He struggled out wide when we went 4-3-3.

Good to have him back though.

1001~~~
Good foul, safely outside the box. 

Clever boy.

1002~~~
agree, I noticed that before, has got a good RVP-esque swing in his foot as well. Shame he didn't have much time to impress but very nice to see another youngster given a chance. I believe he can score if he plays from the beginning but that is hard to happen when van Persie is favoured all the time despite his below par performances and Falcao as a big name.. I would also like to see more of pereira as I think we should promote our midfielders first as its our weakest point in terms of depth. Well defense is one as well but we already give chances to youngsters there..

1003~~~
The problem is we have too many deadwood CMs.Fellani doesn't add any value to the squad currently and Fletcher has been poor so far not to mention the useless Anderson but they will continue to take the spot from the bench ahead of the youngsters.

1004~~~
fellaini isawfull even he came on after a long time sidelined with injury. He is just too slow, can't catch the player at the right time. Fletch not playing as a vice captain says it all. It's probably his last season. And as for Anderson I think it's his season. Oh wait, he is injured Valencia had a good game as CM so I think he is a priority as well..

1005~~~
As we're already having to include youngsters in key areas, Van Gaal has to be careful & have experienced players at his disposal on the bench. Pretty easy for fans to moan about who's on the bench yet ignore who's in the team. We ended the match with 3 youngster on the pitch, pretty fair going for any team.

1006~~~
I didn't blame LVG to include them.I just stated the fact that we have too many CMs who are not good enough but will always take place ahead of the youngsters.

1007~~~
I cant understand why we played him to be honest. We were winning the game and Everton was bound to push us to the ropes. Having two forwards in that circumstances is risky enough. Replacing a world class striker with a kid is in my opinion a risk too big to take.

1008~~~
Would have been better to put on Fellaini for Falcao tbh and keep Valencia on. There wasn't much need for Wilson and he's no defender. Wasn't a good game for him to play in like this.

1009~~~
Judging by Van Gaals comments after the game he wanted us to pick Everton off on the break as they went forward looking for an equalizer similar to how Holland did against Spain and probably thought Wilson's pace was the best way to do it getting into space with Baines flying forward but we never got enough control to do that

1010~~~
Weird decision to bring him on to wing position to defend, we probably had better players for that. Still, decent came even in that position.

1011~~~
Fine logic, bizarre choice then to use Wilson instead of Januzaj for that role.

1012~~~
I think Wilson was chosen because he might have been better at tracking back than any of the other attacking players we had. I'd much rather put on someone like Thorpe and played him in midfield to help shore things up there.

1013~~~
Wilson's got insane pace.

1014~~~
Yes, but is he affective on the wing? That's a literal question, not rhetorical/snide. I didn't think he had any experience there.

1015~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5dFgez6nGo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Its really hard to watch that video and not get excited by this lads potential.

1016~~~
I would say so. For the reserve he plays the RVP role so he's used to going out wide.

1017~~~
Gave away a bit of a needless foul today. van Gaal clearly rates him though and I think he's got a big future here.

1018~~~
Good to see him get used today at least. So annoyed we threw the capital cup game away, would of been a great tournament to give him, McNair, Thorpe, Blackett and Januzaj extra game time.

1019~~~
LVG prob thought we could utilise his pace on the break

1020~~~
Great post.

I would look at loaning him out next season if he still isn't playing regularly.

1021~~~
Any reason why he doesn't even make the bench today?

1022~~~
Seems LVG has gone with all experienced options now they are fit.


I think him not being on the bench and 3 CM's + Young being suggests a 4-3-3 to me as well.

1023~~~
Probably because we have most of our senior players back and Falcao on the bench. No point to have another striker on there.

1024~~~

1025~~~
Not the first time first teamers are talking about Wilson positively, good to hear.

1026~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1027~~~
Falcao out.

Rooney out.

ENTER JAMES WILSON. 

C'mon lad! This is your time.

1028~~~
Will surely make the bench?

1029~~~
There's no one else. So I'm pretty sure he will. Unless Van Gaal has a surprise for us all and plays with two strikers.

1030~~~
Would love to see him get a go today. This is what our club is about.

We need to build for the future and inject some additional hunger and pace into our team.

1031~~~
I thought he'd start today actually,  but I guess the formation didn’t allow.

1032~~~
Has changed his kit number to 49, he/someone wanted a 9 in his number.

1033~~~

1034~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I always wondered why he changed. Such a trivial thing for van Gaal to be worrying about.

1035~~~
Sounds legit.

1036~~~
He could cause Chelsea a lot of problems if he comes on when everyone else is tiring. Wicked pace and good dribbling ability to go with that. Obviously his finishing ability goes without saying. They won' know too much about him, I'm sure.

1037~~~
Before Falcao came to us....he has asked RVP to wear the number 9 shirt but he wanted to wear his number 20 shirt.....oh Louis <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1038~~~
At least that is the actual #9 shirt. But telling him to change from 47 to 49 because there is a 9 in it is weird. They're both just random high numbers. Must be all apart of the philosophy.

1039~~~
Awful songs. Couldn't enjoy it.

1040~~~
Watching the game at a Chelsea supporters, bold move.

1041~~~
Anytime goalscorer at 9/4 is tempting.

I'd rather he sat on the bench with the rest of them.

1042~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1043~~~
Good to see him get on today. LVG has put him on 2 crucial junctures already since been fit. Seems to rate him highly indeed. 

Didn't have much of a chance today but he needs to improve his all round involvement a bit too. Would have been a excellent option if Chelsea hadn't bunkered in a more open game if level.

1044~~~
I was hoping a chance fell his way because I was sure he would bury it.

1045~~~
Haha Same. Nearly had a half chance too before the referee whistled for a soft foul by RVP.

Had more faith on him finishing it than RVP right now.

1046~~~
His all round involvement will be fine in less of a nightmare of a game. Twenty minutes against a much stronger Chelsea side in a half where they were generally in control is hardly much of a chance for a youngster.

Nonetheless it's good to see him getting on the pitch. Important that he feels there's a way forward for him at the club. Especially since the evidence is growing (despite the goal) that RVP's best years are now behind him. With Danny and Chicha gone, Wilson will be a superb understudy to Rooney and Falcao.

1047~~~
Was unlucky with the header. Also a nice flick on to RVP. Pity we couldn't create more chances for him.

1048~~~
I've really liked what i've seen from his 2(?) cameos this season. He just looks so up for it, fearless.

1049~~~
Nice to see him come on today, it would have been a good experience for him. He's always looking sharp!

1050~~~
Great to see him used in such an important game. Lost our soul didn't we?

1051~~~
Loved the shot of Pereira, sat next to Wilson, sat next to Blackett, all sat behind Giggs.

1052~~~
Yeh, it did look like a school photo a little.

But yeh, great to see and as I said, in such a big game too.

1053~~~
Great to see him come on at such an important point in a big game, clearly is valued highly. He just seems like he always has the instinct for goals, he has good movement and has shown that he's a good finisher. If he can get over the injury niggles that seem to happen often to him I reckon we'll have a top center forward in the future. He could probably do a job on loan at another premier league club already, though I'd prefer if we kept him here to develop him. Same with Januzaj and Pereira. They just seem like the special talents that don't need sending out.

Don't want to keep banging on about it, but there is a clear difference between Wilson and Welbeck IMO and why I think Wilson will make it here. Wilson just has that knack and strikers instinct of being in a spot to have a chance (like for his header which he did quite well with to be honest). He's fast, he's good on the ball and seems good in the air as well. Needs to bulk up a bit but once he does and as he develops, I think he'll be a top player. Couldn't ask for better in terms of quality and the variety of strikers to learn from.

1054~~~
Glad to see the lad get a few more minutes under his belt. It tells a lot about how much LVG rates him, to bring him on when chasing such a big game. It will do the kid a world of confidence. Really want to see him get a goal soon.

1055~~~
Very impressed. He seems to have a knack for goals in him and he's fearless. Still unsure if I would like to see him go on loan or have him develop here.

1056~~~
I agree that you just feel he will score if he gets half a chance. Will be RVP's natural successor

1057~~~

1058~~~
Anyone got a picture of it?

1059~~~
Out of all our players, I hope Wilson gets the winner on Sunday. The amount of piss that would boil in the media and among Petrodollar FC fans would be fan-fecking-tastic. 

Our penchant for bringing through young talent continues to make a mockery of those who claimed that we "sold our soul" in the summer.

1060~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJHMFS-oOYc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1061~~~
With falcao out injured hope he can grab this opportunity to perform

1062~~~
It wouldnt surprise me to see him put in a better performance than any of our strikers this season. No pressure or anything, but the standards have been low so far

1063~~~
The goal was ridiculous, guy is lethal.

1064~~~
The reason Welbeck was sold...

1065~~~
Yup.

People will complain that Welbeck should never have been sold but to be honest he just didn't progress at all as a striker. Wilson has a lot of promise, is younger, and I think has more in his locker than Welbeck.

1066~~~
agree. he is class. very confident. down to earth. just wait.....

1067~~~
I would actually like to see him start

1068~~~
Says your heart.

He'll be on the bench and should he get on he will be buzzing and if he gets a half chance I expect him to score.

1069~~~
Looked bright when he came on today. Some nice touches and one good run where Kompany covered well after he had beaten one player.

Should have maybe brought him earlier slightly.

1070~~~
I love how much confidence LvG has in him, to sub off RvP when we needed a goal with 10 minutes to go says a lot about how Wilson is viewed.

1071~~~
I love this kid. Despite what some neanderthals say, our future is bright with guys like him already a presence on our team.

1072~~~
Great to see that he got another go today. Also, I think it's promising that LvG is willing to take off RvP to give him a chance. Think he played well too, he seems very hungry and willing.

1073~~~
Need to start a game to begin scoring goals.It's very hard to play well when you kept being thrown in the last 10-20 min in tough occasions like that.Despite saying that good to see LVG putting too much faith on him.

1074~~~
He always seems to get the ball hoofed at him especially last week. He must play like a world class Andy Carroll in training or something.

1075~~~
Nice cameo from him too.

1076~~~
Yeah we're asking miracles of him so soon as we sub him on in desperate circumstances. When was the last time we were comfortable in a game and could bring him on for a decent runout? Or at the moment we don't have enough games where we could give him a definite start. He is potentially a top striker in the making.

1077~~~
Agreed, not everyone can have a debut like Federico Macheda.

He deserves a start based on his reserve performances but I can't see one coming soon, considering we'll have Falcao back soon as well.

Maybe once we're in the FA Cup he'll have a chance to shine and really show us what he can do.

1078~~~
I think you forgot what happened last season...

1079~~~
Glad he's getting minutes. He's not had any chances to score, but playing in packed stadiums is big for him and any youngster. Slowly getting used to the atmosphere at first team level is good. He'll be slightly less bothered by it than if he was to just suddenly start.

I think he'll take his chance when he gets a start in December.

1080~~~
Darn my short memory. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1081~~~
I'd give him a start next weekend if Falcao is still out. Play the three of him, RvP and Rooney at the top of a midfield diamond. Looks very promising.

1082~~~
It's been good to see him come on in two big games now. van Gaal clearly rates this lad.

1083~~~
I was disappointed he didn't get to come on earlier as his pace would have been put to good
use as we defended deep early in the second half. 
I reckon the future is bright for him here as RVP won't be here forever.

1084~~~
want to see him start. agree.

1085~~~
Thought he had a few decent flashes.

If Falcao is injured next week, start him, or maybe even if he's not, start him over RVP.

1086~~~
Seems like the perfect replacement for RvP too. Not the same type of player, but he is technically good, left footed, and just seems like a complete striker. Hopefully he stays injury free, as talent wise he has everything to become a top striker for both United and England.

1087~~~
Starting him against Palace would be perfect.

1088~~~
I don't think he will start against Palace, but I certainly don't think he will be left on the bench as long if things aren't going right (and let's be honest, 'right' against Palace should be a couple of goals up after an hour).

I really hope LvG fast tracks him in to the first team as RvP winds down over the next year/ 18 months.  I've kept a close eye on him like we all have and he is seriously talented.

Even my dad realises now - he was at my house letting a builder in last week and helped himself to half an hour of MUTV, when I walked in the door he said 'you're right about this Wilson he looks good'!!

1089~~~
My dad said the exact same thing to me today <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OOPl7bM1YMv/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1091~~~
The U21's play through balls, maybe someone should suggest this to the first 11.

1092~~~
Didn't last the full 90 again. Any word whether he picked up a niggle or not?

1093~~~
Kagawa's started playing them now that he's back at Dortmund. Probably played about 5 in total in his 2 years with us.

1094~~~
No injury this time. Wilson and Pereira were withdrawn around the hour-mark due to their semi-first team status. He did limp around for a couple of minutes after a tackle in the first half, but then he always does that. Dodgy ankle. No question about it.

1095~~~
That's disheartening to hear. Hopefully he can manage it throughout his career.

1096~~~
Eesh. That's not good. Long term ankle knack can be a bugger to shake off. Just ask Jack Wilshere.

Could be the real reason for RVPs drop in form and Falcaos mysterious injury ...

1100~~~
Hopefully that's true

1102~~~
Would at least stop the Van Persie "favoured son of Van Gaal" drum for a week.

1103~~~
This is the reason we sold welbeck.

1104~~~

1105~~~
With RVP looking a shadow of his former self, Falcao constantly unfit/injured, and Rooney considered by LVG a #10, the scene really is set up perfectly for Wilson to make his mark. And at this rate, we're going to need him too, and quickly.

1106~~~
Really hope that's true. Not only would it keep van Persie on his toes (and boy does he really need that) but it'd be so great to see our identity-ridden side led by a homegrown talent. If he starts, I feel like he scores. It's basically how it is at U21 level, how much harder could it be here?<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1107~~~
Wilson to lead the front and Rooney in behind... works for me.

1108~~~
Obviously <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1109~~~
I hope the Wilson thing is true, not the McNair and Blackett part. I would rather Carrick be in there ahead of Blackett to be honest. We need to win this match, can't afford any mistakes and two young CBs are more likely to make one.

1110~~~
I like the look of Wilson but not sure if he should be starting for us yet. I would rather see Rooney up front in a 4-3-3.

If Wilson does start, we know that LVG will want to play Rooney, so does that mean going back to the diamond?

1111~~~
We can play the same line-up as against City but with Wilson for van Persie so Rooney is the 10 in a 4-3-3.

1112~~~
Well, teams have been defending deep against us for 2 years now.

1113~~~
About time on the Van Persie. Would probably prefer Carrick at the back though.

1114~~~
Home to Palace should be a good game to give him a start. I think we'll go back to 2 up front for this one, so a start for Mata too...


Personally I'd be more comfortable with Carrick at CB though...

1115~~~

1116~~~
That's exactly what I'm hoping for. Not only I think it would be nice to see Wilson, McNair and Blackett start but I think that side and system will get the best out of those 4 midfielders.

1117~~~
RvP was poor against City? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Edit: Would be chuffed to see Wilson start though. Has impressed in bits and pieces whenever he has played.

1118~~~
Any reason why Fellaini is dropped? He's been in our top 3 players for our last three matches

EDIT: I don't mind the team though. If Wilson does play I'd like him to have someone up there with him.

1119~~~
Probably just because he's not needed in his type of game. He's not one of our best players or anything, he'll be a player who comes in for certain games or gets thrown on later in games to do a job. Don't think he has the quality to be first choice. Certainly isn't as good as herrera and the others we have there.

1120~~~
Delighted for wilson, but was it just me who though Van persie actually played quite well? Was isolated a lot but he looked sharp, did brilliantly on that one move and in general his hold up play was good, apart from one or two instances. In recent weeks he has been a lot better then the opening few games anyways.

1121~~~
I would love to see Wilson start over RvP. He seems composed and hungry to me and has more pace than RvP, which seems to fit our current playing style more. It would also show that LvL goes for form over established name. RvP has been pretty poor this season and with Falcao out, Wilson deserves his chance to shine.

1122~~~
Except he has been in the last few matches. Certainly the equivalent of (if not higher) than anything Herrera has produced this season. Although, I agree the opposition may have a say on who plays.

1123~~~
Well that is certainly not true. Ander was significantly better than Marouane this season, or the last. Love how after a couple of weeks out, we're downgrading his performances. Infact Herrera has been one of the Top 20 players in the league so far performance wise, and is on numerous team of the season watch-lists.

Ander was more creative, more productive scoring 2 goals, had a better passing rate, played more decisive passes, won back more possession, was disciplined less often, had more open play dribbles etc etc and was better statistically :


<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s2.postimg.org/rbywd38yx/Untitled1.png" src="http://s2.postimg.org/rbywd38yx/Untitled1.png"/></a>


<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s30.postimg.org/dqbww9rq9/Untitled2.png" src="http://s30.postimg.org/dqbww9rq9/Untitled2.png"/></a>


Dunno how anyone can claim otherwise. Another thing to note, is that since Ander been injured, our style of play has regressed, and our most important player thus far - Di Maria has been forced wide to accommodate others rendering him subpar, instead of the #8 he's so effective at. Can't wait till Herrera makes a comeback following full recovery. Not only has he been better despite coming into a new league but he has much higher upside.

1124~~~
Not getting into the Hererra v Fellaini debate but those stats mean feck all. You're comparing a sample of just 5 games where Herrera mainly played against cannon fodder and Fellaini played against the best two teams in the league.

1125~~~
RVP or Wilson, at the moment I see no harm in giving Wilson a go.

1126~~~
He was a bit sharper but he's still slow as feck and never works very hard to press the opposition defence. Which isn't a massive problem when we play with two strikers but makes him next to useless as a lone striker. 

I worry that Wilson is too young/slight to play up top on his own though. Can see him getting bullied and struggling to hold up play. Will need our CMs to get very close to him which, in turn, exposes that flaky defence. 

Rooney replacing RvP would be a much better decision IMO.

1127~~~
RvP needs a serious kick up the backside, sick of seeing him mope around the pitch barely contributing any decent performances. I agree that we should give Wilson a go but we'd have to play the ball on the deck, as Palace have Hangelaand and Dann as CB's we wouldn't win much in the air.

1128~~~
And net result was that we won neither of those. So in-turn we could say United effectively achieved feck all with him in the team can't we ? We might've lost vs those 2 with Herrera but since when are United such pussies and risk averse ? Herrera would've also given us a significantly bigger chance vs either of those team with the added fluidity in creating chances particularly against a weak City that pooed their beds every time we had a real go at them.

That aside from the fact that Di Maria would've most probably been playing in the 3 midfield as opposed to out wide where he was a shadow of the player that made a scintillating debut, irrespective of opposition. It's a domino effect and we put Di Maria (one of the best big game players around too) in a disadvantageous position from the get go by not giving him a midfield player of equal wavelength to operate with in tandem.

1129~~~
I would be all for Wilson starting against Palace but agree with those that say we will need to play the diamond midfield shape around him, Otherwise I could see him isolated up front.

1130~~~
We seem to be playing it more on the deck anyway so I don’t think that would be much of an issue. I think RVP is playing ok, however, he is failing to do what he is paid to do, score goals. Sadly the truth is he has been failing at that for some time now, therefore it won’t be a massive risk to play Wilson over RVP

Players like Mile Jedinak, Mame Biram Diouf, Fraizer Campbell, Mohamed Diamé, Charlie Austin have all scored the same or more goals than RVP this season, given the players RVP has around him and the teams we’ve played it really is a poor return.

1131~~~
Huh? That makes no sense. Since when did the choice of Fellaini over Hererra have anything to do with how Van Gaal chose to play Di Maria?

1132~~~
Yup, of course it doesn't make sense. Apart from the fact that Fellaini cannot play in a 3 man CM in the diamond (because he's not very good at maintaining possession and doesn't contribute enough while on ball or have Ander's range of passing from deeper positions), necessitating the 4-5-1 hybrid to accommodate his talents in more advanced positions (not a #10 either but a cross between a #8 and a #10 with a license to roam and be a "nuisance"). If that is the inherently negative and bland style of play some want United to play going forward, then good luck. I'd rather play attractive football, which is what Ander's presence brings to the team in terms of fluidity and linking midfield with attack.

1133~~~
You really do talk tosh sometimes. I still remember our last "debate", so I'm not even going to try and address the points you've made there. Ridiculously over-complicating a simple sport.

And yes, I'm also looking forward to Herrera getting back into the team. Providing he plays a <b>lot</b> better than he did against WBA.

1134~~~
In case you weren't aware, this is a thread about James Wilson, not squabbles about Fellaini and Herrera. Go someone else with that, please.

1135~~~
Feel free to delete all those posts. They're dragging down the net IQ of redcafe (including my own fwiw)

1136~~~
forgive my ignorance, but not knowing a lot about Palace, what are their defenders like...big physical buggers or not, since this will have an impact of how Wilson will perform I reckon.

1137~~~
That describes them perfectly. Which is why I think playing Wilson would be a big risk.

1138~~~
Yup ok. In this particular case, one side tried to provide some reasons (right or wrong is relative because a lot of what we talk about is presumptuous while also working within the spirit of healthy forum communities) to back their argument, while the other interjected with insightful analysis including calling the opposing view "nonsense" and "tosh" without providing any evidence or hypothesis to the contrary and generally being snide in demeanor. Now I'm not deluded enough to presume that I'm 100 % or even 80 % right, but until it's proven comprehensively wrong, I'll stick by the view.

Anyway deal dealio then, I'm in favor of ending this amicably. If you don't think my opinions are worth your while and don't intend on addressing the points I make then please stop instigating a discussion with me in the future. I for one won't be worse off without the hassle of explaining my POV while getting zilch in return. Also, the sport is far from simple in its details.

Agree on the second part though while also feeling Herrera is being done dirty these days. He was obviously not at peak fitness vs WBA which did adversely affect his performance to some degree.

EDIT :

See this is the kind of shit I'm talking about. Don't argue the point in a civil manner, reply with shite degrading posts :

PS : Sorry Cina, just saw the reminder. Won't happen again.

1139~~~
With Falcao still out, Wilson would give us that pace up front. Why not give him a go, he's quality. Van Gaal always said age doesn't matter.

The only worry is indeed his lack of physical presence. But good, high tempo technical football can beat a rough and tumble Palace rearguard. And van Persie can always come off the bench.

1140~~~
I'd love to see Wilson start against Palace, I think he would be a revelation for us if given 90 minutes.

1141~~~
Yeah, maybe. On the other hand, I'd love to see him run at Hangeland.

1142~~~
I think that Palace would be the perfect game to start Wilson and see what he's got. We're going to have a lot of the ball I'd imagine and hopefully create a lot if chances.

1143~~~
Sometimes the bigger the defenders the easier it is for the attacker, it all depends on how brave Wilson is.

1144~~~
I agree- we could have sent him out on Loan but we elected to keep him here and in order to develop him he needs games - not always 10 minutes at the end of the match but he needs to start games and this seems like a good one. 
RVP is out of form and falcao is injured - if we are not going to play him now we might as well loan him out!

1145~~~
I am all for Wilson given a chance - but in fairness, RvP has been among our better performers in the last couple of games. 

But Wilson's pace ... electric. 

Imagine Wilson up front with di Maria and Rooney behind him - and Blind, Herrera and Carrick in central midfield. That would give us much better balance as we have 2 central midfielders who do a great job defensively.

1146~~~
As opposed to a 32 year old midfielder who's just back from a 3 month injury spell?

1147~~~
3 at the back for extra cover?
----------------------De Gea------------------------
----------Mcnair-----Carrick------Blackett---------
Valencia------Fellaini-------Blind--------------Shaw
-------------Rooney----------------Di Maria--------
-----------------------Wilson--------------------------

I hope not though - I dont want to see three at the back again - we just don't look comfortable

1148~~~
Called up for England U20s for the games against Canada and Portugal along with Harrop.

1149~~~
I actually want him to play this, then. He seems brilliant at making a yard a of space to get his shots away and also has more pace then RvP.

That said, I think I would look at replacing RvP with Rooney instead and bring in Mata.

1150~~~
We can't afford to start him against big/good teams, but only against cannon fodder ones. Because he's young and such, we are afraid to start him against big physical bullies CBs, which almost all of those cannon fodders have at the back. It's polemic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1151~~~
RVP should be starting as usual against Palace. Ridiculous I think, not to start your best striker (in form or not.)

Wilson hasn't done an awful lot in his cameos to suggest he's breathing down the neck of RVP but by all means, if by half time we're struggling to put away chances, then I'd be fine with a RVP/Wilson swap.

I just think it's plain daft to drop RVP when he could quite easily fire three past Palace.

1152~~~
I wanna say it was 2009/10, we lost a two legged tie with Bayern, under van Gaal I believe. Rooney was injured but SAF started him anyway, only for someone to kick his injured ankle ten minutes into the game, putting him out.

Did SAF bring in Berbatov, or best striker left? Nope, he played Nani up top.

Why?

Form and tactics.

1153~~~
Id be seriously worried for Wilson's ankles if Delaney starts for Palace.

1154~~~
I think McNair and Blackett would be more vulnerable to a mistake, yes.

1155~~~
It's more likely he'll partner Van Persie with Rooney in behind them, in my opinion.

1156~~~
McNair and Blackett are proper centre backs, whereas Carrick is a midfielder who's not even fully fit. For me, it's more so the quality than the age of a player. In that regard, McNair and Tyler are better than Carrick in defence.

1157~~~
Do you know how many games McNair has played at Centreback during his career? I'm talking youth too.

1158~~~
Not much admittedly, I am aware he played midfield as a younger lad, but he has been playing and training (I assume) as a centre back recently + half of last season. That's still better than a midfielder who's back from a long injury.

1159~~~
I just thought it was humorous that a player likened to Carrick who has recently started his transition into defence was being touted as a "proper centre back" and a better option to seasoned pro Carrick who has played four fold as many first team minutes at Centreback than McNair has. 

I like McNair, I think there's a reality check in store for him and his fans soon enough but there's big potential there.

1160~~~
McNair has played CB since 17 and is a proper centre back now...Though there's still a lot of room for improvement for him.

1161~~~
I think Carrick as a CB matches the quality of the other too as well, it isn't a judgement I have made purely on age. Anyway, this is the Wilson thread so probably not really relevant.

1162~~~
I'd like to see him start and see how he goes on against Palace. Not a great deal to lose with doing so, I think we need a shape that will see him get constant deliveries though and be involved and not just running about as a lone striker.

1163~~~
I'd like to see him play, but not in a 4-3-3. I'd have loved to see him alongside Falcao, however on his own, Palace will probably just rough him up for the most part.

1164~~~
He played upfront on his own last game of last season didn't he? I remember Fellaini playing AM, Kagawa strangely in CM, Lawrence on the left and Januzaj on the right.

1165~~~
Start him up top with Rooney. RVP on bench. This boy is a future star its their for all to see. Give him a run of games...

1166~~~
I thought the same until I saw Gary Neville's piece on his movement, give it a look on youtube. 


However I'd love to see Wilson given a go, I rate him massively and he has the legs to press up top with benefits us a lot more.  Plus he has the pace to run onto a long  through ball.

1167~~~
Blackett isn't a proper centre back either.

1168~~~
We've got a huge amount to lose so not sure why people are saying we haven't.

There's a risk that we could see Wilson drift through the first 60 minutes making no impact on the game at all, in the way Hernandez did at times when he started. RVP has looked sharper in his last 2 games and Wilson should be used as he has been so far imo (unless they're starting together and we're going back to a diamond)

1169~~~
This is very true. We need to start collecting points now. Performances have been improving (I think) but we can't take any risks. If Wilson starts and is poor and we drop points then there will be some backlash.

1170~~~
From Van Gaal's perspective this is arguably the most "make or break" game of the season so far. Would take bollox the size of oranges for him to drop RvP and start Wilson.

1171~~~
In current form we need to create chances for RVP to score goals. He's not looking a threat outside the box. I can think of 2-3 times RVP's missed a one on one this season. We see people saying the risk is he might not make an impact...well we've seen RVP have games like that too. If you wait to long, you risk a play stagnating. I don't think we should fear giving a player a chance. Wilson isn't as strong as RVP but his<i> movement currently is superior</i> - that last goal in the reserves is a great example. If we create chances, he will score goals because his technique is very good, he's single minded and he's composed. Would have no problem him playing at all. He could pick up a knock but so can every player. We know that more then most. But if we create chances, he'll score.

1172~~~
If Wilson is doing better in training and Van Gaal basically feels it's his time, he should start ahead of Van Persie. It's a decision I feel you can trust him with. The bolded part makes me very curious however, because apparently RVP didn't play against Chelsea. And Chelsea aren't the best team in the league. And Van Persie wasn't that guy with #20 making brilliant runs that game, being our only real goal threat because of his movement. Or what I actually mean is that if you really feel that Wilsons movement is superior and you're point to prove it is a goal for the reservers, well, that's not good.

Looking back at the last matches we played, RVP actually looked better the moment we played with another striker and wasn't isolated alone on top. He scored vs. Chelsea when Wilson had come on. He hit the inside of the post vs. WBA after Falcao had come on. His other two goals were assisted by Falcao. Van Gaal knows this, and if it were 11 vs 11 in the City match we would've brought Wilson on for a defender or midfielder because we were 1-0 down. And I feel that substituting RVP for Wilson in the City game is the whole reason for this debate, leaving me a little sceptical.

1173~~~
I think it's pretty natural that United supporters are excited to see a top young prospect. Especially with our history of developing talent, it's something even more special at United. Not to mention how hard it is to come right into the first team from the reserves.

Van Persie has looked okay, for him, but not like he did in his first season for us. 

That may not add up to Wilson being the better option, but it's understandable.

1174~~~
Wilson doesn't rely on service the same way Chicha does. Wilson is able to score great individual goals and can link up play very well.

1175~~~
As much as I would like to drop Van Persie I can't say I disagree with any of that. We could go back to the diamond and play Rooney at the tip with Van Persie and Wilson as strikers, it's certainly less risky than giving him his first start this season on his own since Rooney will predictably drift.

1176~~~
He could also have the game of his life that catapults him into the first team and we never look back.
We have to take a chance on him sometime, I agree that RVP has looked better in the last couple of games but he's still nowhere near the level he once was. We need fresh ideas and we might be able to get that through Wilson.

1177~~~
Exactly what we need. Our strikers need to be able to rely on their own abilities nowadays; he sure can do it.

1178~~~
We don't have to take a chance on him. Why are people so impatient with throwing kids in and giving them the big stage to impress? Let them get their gradually. We don't have to throw an 18 year old onto the starting line up ahead of Rooney and Van Persie just to see what he can do. 

Yeah in the under 21's. Fitness permitting we'd be absolutely mental to start Wilson over the other 2 strikers at the moment.

1179~~~
So when they're older, lets say 21 you just throw them in all of a sudden? It's best for youngsters to have a sniff in the first team and lead them gradually to a first team player, Rooney is not a striker in LVG's eyes, Falcao is injured, so why not?

1180~~~
No. I've clearly just said they should be introduced gradually. Wilson has played about 45 minutes in the league this season so I doubt he's 100% match fit. This is a must win game and RVP has looked better in the last two weeks.

1181~~~
He has played enough in u21, he wont last 90 minutes but we could get 60 minutes out of him. And you do know that we can play him up top with RVP right?

1182~~~
So you don't know how we keep players who don't play much in the PL match fit?Well there is something called the U21s league.

1183~~~
He wouldn't be starting over Rooney and RVP since most people are implying Rooney would play. With Falcao injured, what if we play RVP and he picked up an injury? We would have to play Wilson then wouldn't we. Wouldn't you feel all warm in side knowing RVP was on the bench if Rooney and Wilson got injured? In addition to that, he's playing in the under 21's because he's 18. He might very well go on to become better then both of those players. The fact is, you think it would be absolutely mental and yet not one of us saw training ....so if LVG selects him..then LVG would be mental. It takes a bit of imagination. Giving Messi his debut or a young Giggs. Selling Becks and then Ronaldo comes in and with Oles injury problems, is trusted week in week out and guess what! He's not perfect but it works out. Wilson is a finisher and deserves a chance and it's stupid to deny it just because he's young.

Robin has missed three one on ones this season. So could be doing better.

1184~~~
Yes. As I stated in an earlier post it makes more sense if he's got a partner but a lot of people have implied its him instead of RVP. 

What's that then?

1185~~~
I'm not denying him because he's young, it's because he's not as good as RVP and we have to win tomorrow. 

Not sure what you're talking about  regards to leaving RVP on the bench in case he gets injured on the pitch and we have to play Wilson. Of course we'd have to play Ailson then, but at the moment we don't. 

Again I'll say that starting the both of them makes more sense. Not Wilson ahead of either of them though, for me. Not yet.

1186~~~
The only place I'd have him in the diamond would be AM, but then I'd much prefer Mata or Rooney there. I don't think he's suited to play RCM, and Herrera is better generally. I also haven't been as impressed as most with Fellaini in recent games.

1187~~~
How is this showing impatience? No one is asking to start him every week. How many starts do you think he'll even get this season? Not very much when Falcao comes back. Giving him a start every now and then, some matches from the bench, and playing him in the u21 league is gradually bringing him into the team.

Also whether it's at u21 level or not, he doesn't have bad technique. He can dribble with speed, something our other forwards can't do. He can score with either foot and score long range goals. It's true that he's not absolutely gifted with world class technique like an Ibra, but a striker doesn't need that level of technique to become great. Nor does lacking world class technique mean he doesn't have great technique. He's a striker with a complete skill set. Through time and development he can become deadly at first team level. 

Chicha's qualities were what they were. He could play at first team level or u21 level and his qualities would remain the same. He relies on service and has great movement. He was limited, but deadly. Wilson suddenly playing for the first team won't suddenly make him lose his level of technique.

Finally, Rooney isn't competing with him. LVG has already stated that he wants Rooney to play behind the striker(s) and that he wasn't satisfied with him as a striker. I personally would like to see Rooney play up top again, but that is LVG's preference.

1188~~~
Probably not many but that's the shitty situation we're in due to our pathetic last 18 months. Just think its too much of a risk at this point in the season.

1189~~~
Get this lad on ffs.

1190~~~
Get him on and go Diamond.

1191~~~
I get the feeling Rooney and RVP dont want the kid to prosper. Have they given him even a chance at a shot on goal?

Rooney could and i think should have played him in on that RVP chance.

1192~~~
Van Persie tried squaring it to him before Mata hits the post.

Nonsense.

1193~~~
He was shooting, he wasn't squaring anything mate. He shot and it got blocked.

1194~~~
This lol

1195~~~
There was another chance that Wilson was in a very good position and Rooney just decided to fire it wide.

1196~~~
he has a presence. a true #9.

he will eventually replace van Persie.

1197~~~
Yep, that one too. a simple pass to Wilson and he has the whole goal to aim at. 
Rooney tried curling it around a player instead.

1198~~~
Yeah right at the end of the match Rooney should have laid it off. I think van Persie being poor so far and Rooney not really firing home either that when they even get half a chance they are going to be a bit selfish to try and get it going for them.

1199~~~
The guy has unbelievable acceleration. I honestly think he should be given a start and lets see how he does. Doesn't look likely though

1200~~~
I've just seen it in better quality, you are correct. Apologies.

1201~~~
He looks so eager and that's exactly what we need up front. We haven't provided any real moments for him to show his striking instincts. It's bit's and pieces here and there without any proper chances. Needs more game time but his potential is clearly there.

1202~~~
He's got himself into the some good positions recently and been ignored by those around him. Both Rooney and Van Persie could have and should have teed him up towards the end.

That turn and run he made was fantastic.

1203~~~
Had a couple of good moments when he came on, seems unphased by the big stage.

1204~~~
He's gonna be a good player for us.

1205~~~
he would start games but still RVP is safe shot with a lot of pressuer on van Gaal to start picking points. But his movement is great . we could create much bigger variety of chances for him than RVP who only slows the game down.. Wilson makes good runs and should be utilized more freuently

1206~~~
I like him, and he's definitely an exciting talent, but he hasn't been really involved in any of his first team appearances this season. Granted, a lot of these appearances have come in tough situations, but I feel like he could do more to get himself involved in the game (better build up and hold up play)

1207~~~
Had some pretty good touches today.

Made some sharp runs too but particularly Rvp and ROONey did not feed him.

1208~~~
It is such a shame that he's not getting fed by RvP and/or Rooney. When he gets on the pitch, i feel like things are gonna happen.

1209~~~
I don't totally agree with this train of thought though. I think a lot of the supporters would give him a little leeway if they felt he was going with the spirit of the club in picking youth over experience.

1210~~~
You can't have youth absolutely everywhere... We already had three 19 year olds who started the game today, which isn't a very common at all.

1211~~~
I think he's getting the right a pint of game time at the moment to be honest. He's having to work hard for his chances and is gradually gaining confidence and starting to fit into the squad mindset.

Didn't learn a great deal today other than his movement is good and he's bloody quick. I like the fact he's a natural finisher but also good with the ball at his feet and players to beat.

1212~~~
I don't get the "hype" around this lad, tbh. He's probably a decent talent who has impressed LvG & co. in training, but whenever he's been on he hasn't really shown anything out of the ordinary. Service to our strikers has been shit lately though. He probably suffers a bit since the attack isn't clicking at the moment.

1213~~~

What do you want him to show exactly? If you watch the youth, you would know he can be quiet. It depends how the team plays but look the truth is the truth. Don't matter if it's a lonely place lol. Once chances fall to him, then you'll probably get it.

1214~~~
He's getting game time. Might not getting any good balls as the teams isn't creating anything but that just gives him time to focus on the other parts of his game. At least there's no extra pressure on him. Managed to get out of tight spots well and he's quick.

1215~~~
I think you kind of missed the context of my post (with regards to the post I was responding to).

1216~~~
You meant that there would be less pressure on him to get results if he followed our traditions in giving youth a chance no? I don't agree that the spirit of the club is just going for youth over experience, it's giving youth the chances they deserve of course but there's always been a mix of both. You said there would be less pressure on him, but that's exactly what he is doing, right? Putting another 18 year old on the pitch wouldn't really change that.

1217~~~
I was responding to a post which suggested LVG was perhaps picking RVP as a safe option (despite his lack of goals) due to pressure and maybe wanting to have the most experienced players out there despite their performances. My point was that if LVG was to pick Wilson over RVP I could see that giving LVG points with the supporters as it would show guts. Also, I don't think it would be a huge downgrade right now to be honest. Wilson looks like he is raring to go and RVP is struggling at the moment. I hope Wilson gets his chances.

1218~~~

1219~~~
A million and one times better than RVP when he came on.showed better movement and actually can run unlike RVP. 

Deserves a start in our next game against hull at OT and RVP should be benched as he was totally ineffective again.

1220~~~
Nothing to add. This.

1221~~~
Seconded. Showed more about himself in 15 minutes than RvP did in 75.

1222~~~
Should have brought him on earlier if anything. 

Was put out wide both sides but did well.

1223~~~
For his pace he's dangerous to the opposition, RVP has to be dropped next game until he shows he deserves to start because Wilson has looked better in his limited minutes he has been given

1224~~~
He's got danger written all over him. Every time he gets on the ball you can see the defenders just aren't confortable. They don't know enough about him, don't know what he's likely to do. He's got pace to burn and nearly got away from Ox with the ball at the end and the sooner he starts centrally the better. Especially with Di Maria and Rooney supporting him, about time we had pace on the counter.

1225~~~
Please stop throwing him onto the wing, he looks fantastic up top, I just want to see him there.

1226~~~
Wilson is very good holding up play and defending...

1227~~~
Actually did more with his first touch than what RVP did in the previous 75 minutes.

1228~~~
Can't wait for him to grab his first goal this season. I hope he doesn't put himself under pressure by not scoring on his cameos.

1229~~~
Van Persie should be looking over his shoulder. He brings us that raw pace which we've been lacking in our attack. I think it's well worth giving him more than 20 mins to make an impact.

1230~~~
I'd definitely start him against Hull. Would love to see him in a full game.

1231~~~
No he hasn't. RVP should be dropped but not for Wilson. Wilson hasn't shown much. He's like a slightly clumsy Welbeck outside the box. Better inside the box where he hasn't gotten anything to work with.

1232~~~
Was really happy that LVG chose to bring him on. You could see Arsenal were vulnerable on the break so it made sense to bring on another quick player. Wilson worked hard and did well today.

1233~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Complete shite.

1234~~~
snow even if what you said was remotely true, it's easier to start games then to come off the bench. Wilson had a fair few touches and showed good composure. If Falcao is still Injured, play Wilson. Btw what you said I disagree with.

1235~~~
Stop being a WUM.

For those who need to be reminded he wasn't even played on his position today.

1236~~~
He's got pace hasn't he?

Would love him to start against Hull up front with Rooney. RVP seriously needs to get dropped already.

1237~~~
That turn of pace. Would love to see him start next game.

1238~~~
Rubbish, he's fantastic on the ball.

1239~~~
Wilson----Di Maria
---Rooney
Fellaini--Hererra
----Carrick
Back 5

Please...

1240~~~
I'm not sure we'll play the diamond again anytime soon. At least whilst our defence is frail.

1241~~~
Given Falcao's unavailability, Wilson should get more playing time. His pace makes a real difference. Will open up spaces for Rooney and ADM.

1242~~~
He really really needs to start the next game. It was quite shocking just how much better he was then RVP.

1243~~~
Bollocks <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1244~~~
Not the most appropriate comparison there

1245~~~
Seems like he's a smart guy. Didn't go for glory and always tried to hold the ball near the corner flag and waste a few seconds. Being a striker who won't get many chances, that was selfless.

1246~~~
Agree, though I think we should just play Rooney up top alone to make room for Herrera, mata and di Maria.

1247~~~
You saying Welbeck is bad on the ball? I really rate Welbeck's game outside the box. You think Wilson is better?

1248~~~
Deserves to start next game. RVP has really looked off it recently. Give the kid a proper go against Hull. 

I love his energy when he's on the field.

1249~~~
What do you think that means? You thought I was saying that Wilson is shit?

1250~~~
Impressed with what I've seen of him this season in his little cameos. He's rapid and direct with a very good touch. Does remind me a bit of Danny tbh!

1251~~~
Yes

1252~~~
He isn't playing on the wing, he's playing up top but pulling out wide to cover the fullback in defence which is exactly what van Persie was doing. Part of the reason van Persie keeps playing is because he knows his job defensively and sticks to it throughout. Wilson's still learning that. So far in his time in the first team he's gone on a couple of decent dribbles and did very little else. He looks promising but I think people are getting a little carried away here.

I definitely think van Persie should be dropped and would love to see Wilson play but don't be surprised if he contributes relatively little if he starts given the football we've played recently.

1253~~~
He's younger. Wilson's playing out of position but he's a better striker. Time will show that.

1254~~~
Big touches and often loses the ball out of bounds. When you receive the ball 5 times in match, losing it out of bounds once is 20% of the time. 

Like Welbeck he's a striker played on the wing, for United. It's natural to compare the two. Welbeck is excellent outside the box but he turns into Bambi on ice inside it at times.

1255~~~
They're talking about Hull and a game at Old Trafford. We should play two strikers and he should be one of them. We could use his pace.

1256~~~
Welbeck also played out of position a lot. Whether or not he will be better is irrelevant for the next game. RvP is a much better player. Only thing Wilson has over him is pace. He hasn't done anything to warrant a start in a team already with plenty of youngsters starting. His role as of now is fine.

1257~~~
No I don't but to suggest he's weaker outside the box then Welbeck or more clumsy is true from what I've seen anyway. I agree that Welbeck is good outside the box and it's he's main strength but there isn't anything Wilson couldn't do. 

Having Wilson in your team instead Welbeck wouldn't really change your teams approach or build up in my opinion.

1258~~~
I'm really not seeing a defensive contribution from Van Persie at all, he's a passenger.

1259~~~
I liked the maturity he showed at the end where he got into space down the right but then held it up to try and eat up time instead of randomly crossing it into the box. He should start vs Hull.

1260~~~
Eh? He made some vital clearances today. Especially from corners.

1261~~~
I'm on about in open play. He's just kind of wondering around not doing much up top.

1262~~~
Nice cameo.   But still not ready for the responsibilities that come with being a starter.  There is no rush and we have proper world class talent up front not to put such pressure on a teenager.

1263~~~
I didn't want to say he's a lesser version because he's younger. But to me he is a bit clumsy. Has a tendency to dribble out of bounds. Not quite sure what to to at times. One time he gave the ball back to McNair instead of just running down the open flank, utilising his pace. Another time he makes that run but the stops instead of keep going on. 

He's promising but he shouldn't start when we're playing with one striker. Fine to give him a shot with two up front. Didn't realise we're playing Hull next.

1264~~~
In that case, same lineup as today but with Wilson in place of RVP. But 5-3-2 might be an overkill against Hull at home, regardless of defense.

1265~~~
Di Maria played centrally when Wilson was on the pitch, Wilson was wide. Logic would suggest it should have been the opposite way around.  It would certainly have suited Wilson a lot more. His pace up against the back two could have been lethal. Clearly LVG didn't enough faith in Di Maria's defensive work rate to do it. As it happened Di Maria played Rooney in and nearly scored so the decisions was justified I guess.

1266~~~
Thought he was wonderful in possession today.

1267~~~
Thought he come on and did really well. Give us some much needed legs, and drove with the ball well.

1268~~~
The fact that the bold is probably true is testament to how crap RvP has been.

1269~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing him start in the diamond beside Rooney next game. At home against Hull, we shouldn't need real 'balance' to play the 4141.

1270~~~
Great experience today in his development. I've watched this lad in the reserves and his potential is huge.

1271~~~
Did more today in 20 minutes than RVP did in the entire game. I’ve no idea what it is with RVP at the moment but he’s currently our weakest link and that’s saying something given the injuries we have.

1272~~~
The kid is fast as shit. Once he broadens out a bit, nobody will be able to get the ball off him.

Glad he's getting minutes here and there, even in very hard games. Shame we haven't seen him on the end of a meaningful chance yet.

1273~~~
Di Maria played centrally the whole game alongside van Persie because of his threat on the break. The way it worked was when we had possession it was Rooney in behind a front two of van Persie and Di Maria and out of possession the two forwards split to cover the fullbacks while Rooney stayed in the middle. I don't think that really changed at any point in the game. You just saw more of Wilson back in front of Valencia more often because the fullbacks were pushing on more at that point. It wasn't a case of him being brought on to do a specific job to compensate for anyone else - he just played the strikers' role in exactly the same way every other striker has played there in the 352. Di Maria was still pulling out wide left past the 90th minute to track Chambers most of the way.

Di Maria played centrally because he's one of the best players in the world on the counter attack and he showed that again today with the chance he set up for Rooney after dribbling from the halfway line, the ball he played through to Rooney for a one on one which was incorrectly called offside and of course his assist for the goal. Wilson has shown nothing so far to suggest he could contribute that kind of threat on the counter. Having pace is important on the counter attack but what's far more important is making the right runs, playing the right passes and making the correct decisions. Wilson is talented but decision-making is something he'll develop as he matures and he has a long way to go before he comes close to possessing Di Maria's counter-attacking threat.

Definitely true to an extent but because van Persie's been so frustrating this season his contribution game-on-game is a teeny bit overlooked while Wilson's is exaggerated because he's a new kid on the block (and because everyone loves a dribbler). I agree he deserves a shot against a weaker team but I just think the level of service our strikers have been getting recently is pretty pathetic so it's easy to blame the out-of-form striker.

1274~~~
I would agree with you if RVP was in form or even if Falcao was fit. Welbeck was played out of position a lot but he's too hit and miss unlike Wilson.

1275~~~
I love his pace and the fact that he is extremely comfortable running with the ball for a goalscoring centre forward. Why does he seem to play at right back when he comes on in these cameos though?

1276~~~
Im probably more excited about this kid than any signing we made in the summer.

1277~~~
Wilson is good. And with regular time, I can see him getting goals. He has everything a striker needs.

I hope that he starts next game. Van Persie has been poor this season and I doubt that Falcao will start next game, regardless that he'll return (Van Gaal wants his players to be super fit). Time for Wilson to have a chance to shine.

1278~~~
He honestly hasn't done very much but we look much more dangerous when he takes part in the runs.  I would certainly start him against Hull, especially that he had the good match against them last year.

1279~~~
He seems to have that magic quality of vision and football intelligence.  Has a calmness way beyond his years or experience level.  

I think he has it in him be an absolute world beater - more excited about him than any other teenager.

1280~~~
Surely he'll be starting soon if RVP continues this rut he's in and Falcao is still injured.

1281~~~
Agree with all here. Should get a start. Once he gets his stride going he looks very quick. Actually looks like he wants to put in some effort too, unlike RvP.

1282~~~
I like his arrogance. Swans on to the pitch looking cool as a cucumber and looks super composed every time he gets the ball.

1283~~~
Biggest "Dont give a toss" face ever when he was coming on

1284~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I thought the same. He's been practising that in the mirror. Chewing gum and all.

1285~~~
Chews on his gum like a cocky little fecker too.

1286~~~
I noticed that as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1287~~~
Van Gaal clearly rates him in tight games, his pace, dribbling and work rate helps a lot against tired defences. Came on against city, Chelsea, arsenal, and Everton so far. He hasn't really had a chance so far to actually get a goal, but he's getting more and more involved and could've had a chance for a goal if Di maria just weighed that one pass better.

1288~~~
Wilson is better at running with the ball at pace and going past players IMO. Also seems more purposeful with the ball usually, while welbeck is at his best for linking up and doing one -twos.

1289~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3AD8VSIIAA4kVv.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3AD8VSIIAA4kVv.jpg"/> 

I can only assume he is referring to Falcao's limp cock.

1290~~~
Wilson did that one turn in one game. Besides that he's been hesitant with the ball. Not a close control dribbler. I think he's very similar to Welbeck in many ways but I don't remember Welbeck being that comfortable as his age. I'm comparing Wilson to present Welbeck, not them at the same age. If you compare Wilson to Welbeck five years ago he might be better than him in most aspects. I just can't remember well what DW was like when he started. Less games

1291~~~
We are badly in need of some pace in our team, and starting Wilson instead of RvP against Hull would be a good start. Hard to find a place for Herrera right now though.

1292~~~
Welbeck's always been a good dribbler. What are you talking about?


Edit- ah it's Snow.

1293~~~
I haven't said anything different. I just said I don't remember what he was like at the beginning. Some people took it as offence when I compared Wilson's play to Welbeck's, which I rate. I've always maintained that. Just think Welbeck is poor inside the box and will never improve that area of his game.

1294~~~
Needs to start now. 100%

1295~~~
Actually he doesn't. But Mata does.

1296~~~
Yeh, Mata is the far more important one. Nothing needs to change with Wilson.

1297~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">----------</span>Carrick
Herrera<span style="color: #ffffff">----------</span>Di Maria
<span style="color: #ffffff">-----------</span>Mata
Rooney<span style="color: #ffffff">-----------</span>Wilson

1298~~~
He hasn't done anything to warrant starting and certainly shouldn't be playing just because Van Persie is on the wane. If RvP and Falcao are out, Rooney should be lead striker with the likes of Mata and Di Maria behind him, in front of Carrick, Herrera, and Fellaini.

1299~~~
No doubt there is a place for Wilson to start in place of RVP (when Falcao isn't fit) but it's not going to stunt his development or anything if he keeps going the way he is for now. Mata is the one who needs to be playing.

1300~~~

1301~~~
He screams United doesn't he?

1302~~~
I'm sure he's picked up a yard or so of pace since last season. Don't remember him being this fast the few times I watched him during 13/14.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This!

1303~~~
RVP isn't out - he's fit to play, but he's been pretty useless all season. It's not a case of Wilson doing anything to warrant a place, more a case of RVP doing nothing of note. I'm up for Rooney playing striker too, but if we don't do that then I see no reason not to play Wilson. RVP has offered us virtually nothing so far, Wilson would at least give us some pace up front and he's a very good finisher too. I think he played well against Arsenal, I can't see what RVP offers us right now that Wilson doesn't also

1304~~~
Wilson hasn't actually done much and shouldn't (imo) be put in the lineup just because RvP is currently cack. A more appropriate solution should be Rooney alone as striker (his best role imo) with Mata and Di Maria wreaking havoc behind him, which would then allow us to have a 3 man midfield of Carrick, Herrera, and Fellaini.

1305~~~
Spot on. That would work like a treat IMO. Rooney would score a bucket load

1306~~~
I thought Fletcher had picked up some serious pace when he burned past Chambers... Oh that's Wilson.

1307~~~
This

1308~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1309~~~
His distribution looked good when he came on too, not superb but good nonetheless. This is a positive sign, one of my biggest concerns was that because of the position he is in within the squad, majority of game time would be impact sub stuff when we need a goal and therefore he'd be pigeon-holed into the Hernandez poacher role and his team work and general play would suffer.

1310~~~
I'd start Rooney up front with Mata as 10, no idea why he hasn't tried it. Saying that I'm interested to see what Wilson can do when he gets 90minutes under LVG.

1311~~~
That doesn't appear to be an option though, he wants two strikers. I'd rather put Wilson in for a game to see what he can do in van Persie's place.

1312~~~
He's been tearing it up in the under 21s.

Has also had impressive cameos every time he has come on as a substitute and looked more lively than RVP in those cameos.

With Falcao being injured and RVP horrendously out of form, what more does he need to do to warrant a starting chance?

If those don't warrant it, then how do players get their chance?

1313~~~
Of course we can revert to one striker formation but if LVG wants to use two strikers, Wilson should be given a chance.It's as simple as that.

1314~~~
Hold on, if we're playing two strikers it should be Rooney and Falcao (as soon as he's fit) surely?

1315~~~
Looked bright here and there the few times he was involved. Hope he starts a home game against average position soon.

1316~~~
Falcao is injured and we're talking about the match vs Hull.Knowing LVG even if Falcao is fit he'll play Rooney as no.10 and Falcao+RVP up top.

1317~~~
He was really fast last season. That's part of the reason why he was able to score goals while dribbling from 40 yards out.

1318~~~

1319~~~
Mata will probably feature having missed the Arsenal game but let's just not go down the road of him not deserving it as that isn't as simple as what he does when he comes onto games. That chance where RVP and Di Maria cocked up with Maria getting offside - I've no doubt the kid would have got a shot off because he would have just run and run. He's shown in a few games his composure. He's shown he's willing to be the same player (for the first team) for the most part with his running. His movement and direct play will come in handy. He also showed against MK Dons, he can rise above other players playing shite as he and Pereira took responsibility. So there are things but if we're too sensible then yes Mata must play and I hope he does.

1320~~~
Very good cameo appearance. He's pass to Di Maria just after coming on was superb and he's pace, directness and willingness to run at the opposition is very promising. He deserves a start against Hull in my opinion.

1321~~~
A goal in the last few games would have been immense for his confidence, but he must be brimming with it as it is. LvG got rid of Welbeck to accommodate him and hasn't been afraid to throw him on in big games with the result still in the balance. That's a helluva show of faith in the guy and I don't imagine we'll have to wait too long to reap the rewards. 

Now LvG needs to take his gamble a bit further and start him at RvP's expense.

1322~~~
What if he goes into an aerial challenge, lands awkwardly and chokes on the gum?

1323~~~
He's only played 83 minutes across 5 games. Better than nothing but it's hardly fair to say he's being given a <i>proper</i> chance to stake a claim.

He's at least looked positive and a threat in his cameos. The pass out to Di Maria when he came on was very good, and he's a made a few good dribbles.

1324~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1325~~~
Is he the least nervous person in the world? If he had gone into business instead of football, he'd probably go on to run a massive corporation or something. Mighty impressive for such a young lad.

1326~~~
He must be wondering what he has to do to start a game, playing with RVP is like playing with 10 men at the moment.

1327~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1328~~~
First time I would agree, we need to see what Wilson starting does for our attacking play.

That said, RVP again got next to nothing in terms of service yesterday.

1329~~~
What if someone pulls his gum out and sticks it up his arse? How many packs of chewing gum does it take to fill me anus?

1330~~~
Your anus? Only one way to find out, mate.

1331~~~
At this point I would like to see the kid be given the chance over RVP. He at least gives us movement up top, and he has shown glimpses of potential in his limited game time so far.

1332~~~
Rest RVP for the Stoke match. Wilson in.

1333~~~
I'm not having a go at him but he's done nothing to warrant a starting place over Mata, who won us 3 points last week. I mean, I'd be happy if he does start, as I love seeing academy players being given a proper chance, but I'm not ready to say he's "deserved it" and "must" start.

1334~~~
I don't think anyone would say he 'must' start but if he were to start I believe he would be fully deserving of it, having impressed in training, the reserves games, and in his limited chances on the pitch.

1335~~~
Asshole...

1336~~~
Very self assured.. but then again so was Kiko Macheda. He's a darn sight superior to Kiko though.

1337~~~
Put the kid in the XI!

Been saying it since the end of last season.

1338~~~
Wilson seems like he can better handle being isolated up front than van Persie would be. Given how often van Persie's been isolated up front in the last few matches, I'm not surprised that he's been ineffective. Wilson's more used to being isolated up front than van Persie is, who's always at his best when he has support around him. Even in the U-21's, when our midfielders were too deep in certain matches last season, Wilson did a very good job by himself up front, continuously causing problems to the opposing defenders with his movement, pace, and energy. His dribbling's also fine and is needed when he's isolated and without much support.

van Gaal continuously giving him chances means that he rates Wilson. I won't be surprised if, in the near future, he'll give Wilson his shot whilst moving Falcao and/or van Persie on.

1339~~~
Wilson has pace, but does he have strength? He looks a bit too weak to be able to cope with playing as a lone striker in the PL imo. I'd want to see him with another striker alongside him if he's going to start a match.

1340~~~
he looks strong enough actually.

1341~~~
Agreed. It's not just any old games he's putting him on in either. He's come on against Everton, Chelsea, City and Arsenal now, twice even when we've been defending a narrow lead and the easy option would've been to go for someone more experienced.

Van Gaal clearly rates him and I wouldn't be surprised to see him make a further step up to regular in the next year or so. I think Wilson is a big reason behind the decision to sell Welbeck.

1342~~~
Plus Kiko was sort of cocky, whereas Wilson's just quietly unflappable. He doesn't act massively confident off the pitch, he just shows it by rarely missing an opportunity when he's <i>on</i> the pitch.

1343~~~
Promising young player, but can't quite shake the suspicion that much like Januzaj, he's developing a small legion of fanboys who are already inflating him to be something more than he is - which is a promising youth player.

1344~~~
Think it has more to do with RVP being close to useless this season in this situation.

1345~~~
In terms of styles, he and Rooney ought to make an excellent partnership on paper. He'd provide everything which RVP is so egregiously lacking at the moment.

1346~~~
Rooney works well with every strike partner, to be honest, from big, strong target men to false 9's like him.

What I like about Wilson is that he isn't just a poacher. He's more than that and has shown more in his locker than players like Kiko did. He's also very mature and confident, and this should help him when he continues to develop his game.

1347~~~
Yep, it's tough to see what worse he can do to RVP right now anyway.

While LVG doesn't seem to like Mata as #10 and Mata had his chance with Rooney out. Didn't take it.

1348~~~
True. It's possibly his strongest asset but maybe also the reason why he's never quite been seen as a standout global talent - because he always tends to bend his game to whoever his partner is (RVN, Ronaldo, RVP etc), whereas the top strikers force managers to build teams around <i>them</i>. It's a rare quality in a top player though, and it's been crucial to our success throughout his career here.

1349~~~
It's a tough one, he's definitely ready for a start and would give us a different type of attacking outlet. On the other hand, we desperately need to get RvP a goal and get him firing and in form.

1350~~~
Did I miss something last night? Did he do anything special cause I can't remember? I rather start Mata than Wilson at the moment, and shift Rooney to striker.

1351~~~
The problem is that he's had three or four games now to try and play himself into form, and it's not happening. The whole point of having other quality options (Mata, Rooney alone up front, Wilson, Falcao when he gets fit) is that we don't have to persist indefinitely when a player loses form.

And he's getting on a bit now, so it could be that a break is exactly what he needs. One of the biggest problems at the moment is the lack of energy he's bringing to games, so maybe he needs to recharge the batteries a bit.

1352~~~
I agree that Wilson should be given a chance over RVP, but can we calm down with how well he's done when he came on? Overall, yes he did more in 15 min than van Persie did in 75, but consider that he was <i>fresh</i> off the bench and ran around against <i>tired</i> Arsenal players who were running up and down the field for the last 20 minutes trying to tie the game! His dribbling also did not look very good and it seemed he was kicking the ball and running after it rather than making the ball do what he wanted it to (Januzaj, imo, has the control of a young player that Wilson seems to lack). 
Overall, Wilson did great, but it was partly due to the fact that he was fresh and Arsenal were exhausted, not because he manhandled the defense.

1353~~~
I'm tired of people using this as an excuse because RVP is failing and is in a blatent decline,

all the worlds top strikers make their own luck by beating their man with pace, beating their man with a dribble, getting themselves into goal scoring positions and if they get a chance they'll take it. RVP <b>used</b> to have these attributes but for some reason he has lost everything that made him good and now he's a hindrance more than an asset.

Wilson has been scoring for fun in the reserves therefore for the next 2 games which honestly we should be winning wilson should be starting ahead of RVP and we can see what he can do, who knows maybe the rest will do RVP good too.

1354~~~
Januzaj is a lot more than just a "promising young player".

1355~~~
He's no longer a youth player, I'll give you that.

1356~~~
Wilson should be broken in over time. Rooney should be number 9 not number 10

1357~~~
Who would you play as the 10?

1358~~~
Personally I'd play Herrera or mata but LVG doesn't appear to like them

1359~~~
It's hard to tell re Herrera as he was first choice until the injury. I think at present I'd prefer him there then Mata as he's a bit more dynamic.

Mata, though putting up good stats, doesn't seem to fit in with the speed of game LvG is looking to implement.

1360~~~
Agreed. Its his best role.

1361~~~
Then again dirk Kuyt was key in his dutch team so that prob says more about LVG

1362~~~
Don't be silly. Van Persie was never known for his pace or dribbling. He has been in decent positions and has hit the shot straight at the keeper a few times. He's out of form, not declining dramatically. He'll play top level football until he's 35, I have no worries about that.

1363~~~
Seems very cool under pressure and holds the ball up brilliantly, distributes it well and has good pace... What's his shooting/heading (scoring) ability like?

1364~~~
Well a bit better than you Angelo, sorry to have to say that.You are still fantastic though.

1365~~~
His shooting with his left foot is his best ability probably. Can score from virtually any position and always seems to know his angles.

Heading is accurate and he has a decent leap but due to his frame and physique more limited right now.

1366~~~
Only a 'decent' leap? Didn't Giggs say he has the best standing jump he's ever seen.

1367~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Jun/james-wilson-targets-more-headed-goals.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...n/james-wilson-targets-more-headed-goals.aspx</a>

Nicky Butt did it seems.

Anyway he doesn't score that many headers so far.

1368~~~
looked quicker than I thought he was at points during the game on Sat.

1369~~~
Just me who think he runs funnily? Good player, and it's good to see him getting a chance. Can't wait to see him score for the first team again.

1370~~~
Dont really get the connection been made with him and Mata not starting.

Its pretty obvious why he got game time ahead of Mata yesterday. As for future games they play in totally different positions. Wouldnt mind seeing both of them in our starting 11. Mata's weight of pass could really exploit his pace.

To say he has a group of fanboi's is just weird and totally unjustified. People are naturally excited about him and rightly so. Giggs gave him his debut last season, LVG has followed suit this season.

At 18 He's the most exciting striker to come out of our academy in a long time. Its only a matter of time until he hits the back of the net for the first team. Let people get excited, he worthy of it.

1371~~~
I just wish he was brought on sooner for RVP, he looked wasted at 60 minutes. I think he could have definitely scored if played as the last man for longer, rather than being shifted onto the wing.

1372~~~
All this 'Wilson must start' stuff is too late. If Persie does drop out of the team, Falcao should be brought in.

1373~~~
Not necessarily. All depends on the opponents. Once he scores a few goals and settles his stock will continue to rise. His pace is something RVP and Falcao cant offer.

LVG is the one manager I could easily see leaving the bigger names on the bench for a youngster.

1374~~~
But he hasn't scored a few goals though.  And Falcao is now fit. Falcao is also not an immobile front man anyway.

1375~~~
that's why I said once he does.....

Falcao's fitness isn't exactly something Id be putting my house on at the moment either. Obviously Wilson is still behind him in the pecking order but you never know what way things will pan out.

1376~~~
but he has scored a few goals...more than Falcao actually <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1377~~~
So has Anderson. 

We are referring to this season, obviously.  Presenting a goalscoring argument to Falcao based on previous seasons will only have one winner anyway. 

And yes, I did notice the wink <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1378~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I think Wilson has a case for starting the next game for me. His pace, movement and all round ability to bring other players in is excellent. He's started one game for us and scored twice, and in his very short cameos this season has looked impressive. Either way, RVP has to be dropped.

1379~~~
I just think that the reality of the situation is that we need to get a good look at Falcao sooner rather than later. 

For me, Wilson should have gotten his chance in a recent game, perhaps against Palace. However, Falcao should play now if he is fit.

Our leading scorer has 4 goals so far. The likes of Costa and Aguero have more than 10 each. It would be a huge boost for us if we can get a striker on that sort of run, and I'd say common sense would suggest that Falcao is most likely to be that man.

1380~~~
With him not playing for the U21's this week, do we reckon he could be starting tomorrow? Or is that too big an assumption to make?

1381~~~
Could be. Didn't he score a brace against them last time when he started?

1382~~~
Sure did. I'd love to see him get a start tbh.

1383~~~
Is he injured? Not even on the bench.

1384~~~
He's 4th and the pecking order so hardly surprising he's not on the bench with Falcao back.

1385~~~
Think he wasn't in training pics yesterday too.

1386~~~
According to some reports....he's ill and not injured

1387~~~
Hopefully that is the case, and he is back in a few days

1388~~~
Getting a bit worried, this guy isnt really fit and often injured I have the impression. Even when he plays for u21, he can barely endure the 90 minutes.

1389~~~
Any news if he's injured or just ill?

1390~~~
Not really true. In fact over the last few years he's had to play almost every game because of the shortage of strikers in that U18s group and never had problems finishing games. He covers a lot of distance every game too because he makes a lot of runs with and without the ball.

He's had a little spate of injuries over the last 12 months but nothing worrying, he's still managed to get plenty of football under his belt.

1391~~~

1392~~~
cheers mate!

1393~~~
Be a shame if he's out, his goalscoring record against Hull is outstanding <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1394~~~
We've already played Hull.

1395~~~
I hope we can send him on loan in January. He needs games and he's ready to play for a decent side, might even make sense to move him abroad so he can work on certain areas of his game - a loan spell in Spain, Germany or Italy would be something he could benefit from IMO.

1396~~~
If only Ajax wasn't borrowing Millik, i'd take Wilson in a heartbeat.

1397~~~
Are you Ajax fan? Are you happy with Milik? He's a big prospect here in Poland, he obviously won't reach Lewandowski's level but he could become a handy striker for our national team. His international record is actually much better than Lewandowski's.

1398~~~
Nah I don't think we should loan him out unless it's somewhere we can keep a really close eye on him. Basically if a PL club had serious intentions of letting him try and win a first team place I'd go for it, otherwise we should keep him here. Loan spells are such a low-yield gamble these days, especially abroad.

1399~~~
I think there's a chance he will start tonight.

1400~~~
I am yes! He's much better then Sigthorsson and seems to have muscled him out of the selection already. There is talk of buying him at the end of the season. Not sure he'll be an Ajax striker like Ibra or Old Bitey', but he scored a double hattrick in a cup match a few months back which was very amusing.

1401~~~
Damn it how am I working one game behind?!  Right I've caught up now it's all about Stoke...

1402~~~
Can’t see it myself, I reckon he will start with RVP and continue to give minutes to Falcao at the expense of Wilson. I think LVG has handled Wilson very well so far, he has immense talent and it’s only a matter of time until he will be a permanent fixture in the team. I reckon he is seen as RVPs replacement, quite an achievement if he manages it.

1403~~~
I'm just happy that he appears to have freed himself from Leverkusen who don't seem to be keen on idea of playing anyone other than Kiessling (see Drnic). He won't reach the same heights as Suarez or Lewandowski obviously but if he can be a good forward playing regularly for a decent team I will be very happy.

1404~~~
Wasn't involved with U-21s last night because he had a "dead leg" so that would be very unlikely.

1405~~~
Heard that. Let's wait and see.

1406~~~
You're forgetting Rooney was hobbling at the end.

1407~~~
He can certainly reach that level, he is one of the biggest striker prospects and is quite far for his age and his position, he has the abilities, and he has similar style. He is fast, strong, smart, good in the build/hold up, has a great left foot and also has skills/technique, can also head the ball well, he is a very complete striker and with the right steps, I dont know why he couldnt reach that level. It's hard to predict with young strikers tho, Balo, Welbz, Guidetti, Pato would all be world class strikers at the moment..... While nobody knew Lewa, Falcao, Suarez, Cavani when they were 20.

1408~~~
Very true. I have to admit that I rate him quite highly and really want him to do well at Ajax, which he's doing so far. Let's hope they can sign him for the 1 million I've been hearing and see him grow for a few years. But, Zikovich is waiting in the wings as well, very talented for his 18 years.

But, this thread is about Wilson, so we should get back to that. I'm hoping to see him start or play, but with Falcao back and RvP back in LvG's good graces, it seems bleak. Not to mention the dead leg.

1409~~~
I think Van Gaal said he was fine after the match, not 100% sure though.

1410~~~
As I said.....

1411~~~
big night for him. Will be harder to get starts when Falcao is fully fit.

1412~~~
His chance to outperform Van Persie really.

1413~~~
Hope he does well and scores a goal, lost our identity havent we ?

1414~~~
Yes Wilson!

1415~~~
Huge chance for him tonight. Hopefully can get RVP going with a bit of friendly competition as well.

1416~~~
Id be more concerned with Rooney missing than Wilson playing.

1417~~~
The midfield that played on Saturday needs a striker like him, as there was no penetrators in it, or runners ahead of it.

Now there is someone for them to hit with quick movement. Wish him the best tonight.  Will probably come off injured after 8 minutes knowing us (and knowing Stoke for that matter! ).

1418~~~
Really excited to see this lad again, apparently LVG said he had planned for Wilson to play a role on Satruday but couldn't because of illness.

1419~~~
Called it, to be fair. Well done.

1420~~~
Big chance for him. A cold, Tuesday night against Stoke and that...

1421~~~
Big night for him, I have a feeling he's going to be electric.

1422~~~
Obviously RVP is a rival for a starting spot, but I think RVP leading the line will help Wilson a lot. He can go and get involved while RVP continues his disciplined role of being on the shoulder of the last defender and stretching the opposing team and also holding up the ball to bring others into play.

If Wilson was asked to do that role himself against veteran CBs I expect he'd be less effective

1423~~~
This only further shows LVG's confidence in Wilson. Big night for the lad. Good luck

1424~~~
Looking forward to seeing Wilson in action tonight, hope he plays well & scores a cracker

1425~~~
The reason why I think selling Welbeck was the right choice. We knew that Welbeck was never going to be more than a squad player for a top club, but I think Wilson could develop into something special, or atleast on the level that Welbeck is right now.

Always exciting to see a highly touted youngster starting.

1426~~~
Really excited for him, I hope he delivers.

1427~~~
Do you guys think that if Fergie was in the same position as LVG right now, Wilson would be given a go like this?

1428~~~
If Falcao wasn't fit, then he definitely would have. Who else is there?

1429~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/ShamoonHafez" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>
Yeah. Who else is there ?

Tho possibly playing wide.

1430~~~
Is this only his second start for the club?

1431~~~
4-4-1-1 with mata in behind?

1432~~~
I rate him and all, hope he goes on to be a success here etc etc

However, am I the only person who thinks he's got a face you'd love to slap?

1433~~~
I'm sure we will hear after game. Likely to be short term

1434~~~
Who plays out wide in that ?

1435~~~
"He's got the best standing jump I've ever seen"

1436~~~
Here's hoping

1437~~~
Point.

1438~~~
Januzaj and Valenica/Young, with Smalling/Rojo moved to FB, Carrick moved to CB and Flecther brought in.

1439~~~
Not really grabbing the chance yet unfortunately. Hope we'll see Falcao early in the second half.

1440~~~
Looking very lightweight out there so far. A boy against men.

1441~~~
I'm sure that's the plan. Wilson is getting minutes because Falcao isn't 100% match fit yet. Today should be the last time we see Wilson for a while.

1442~~~
He's pressed well and tracked back both wings well.

Also should have had a penalty.

The strikers aren't getting much service tho and RVP refuses to link with anyone these days.

1443~~~
That is not the problem. (against the EPL defenders sneakiness and smartness is more successful than body is... - he does not look like he will have that body in the future so he has to develop other abilities...) But he looks lost as he seems to be eager but his positioning is not that great and a bit clueless - atleast in this minutes of the match that I have seen.

He tries to press - but it is somehow not coordinated.

1444~~~
Herrera and him have pressed well as a combination few times. RVP doesn't that much tho. He is covering for Fellaini and Mata when they go forward as well so gets bit deep at times.

Problem is in this formation you need both strikers linking up but RVP is a total solo act these days. The other guy has to just spoonfeed him.

1445~~~
Heh. Don't think him and Robin will be best buddies tonight.

1446~~~
He's really coming into the game now. Ireland should really have been sent off. Nobody was catching him.

1447~~~
Which has squandered two goals for us. Outrageous decision making from both of them. Hope Van Gaal has a chat with them.

1448~~~
He took it onto his weaker foot too.

Yong and lernin' though.

1449~~~
Out of curiosity. Which two of our strikers have best partnership?

1450~~~
None of them?

1451~~~
Sadly yes..

1452~~~
Not since we flogged the one striker who looked most capable of forming a partnership with Rooney anyway.

1453~~~
I reckon Rooney and Falcao might be a very good combination. Rooney drops deep whereas Falcao will stay as an out and out number nine.

1454~~~
It will wind up being Falcao and Rooney once everyone is fit.

1455~~~
I love his runs, very breezy and glides past people.

1456~~~
Poor guy can't hit a barn door whilst in the first team.

1457~~~
On another occasion he should've won a penalty and got a red card for Ireland.

1458~~~
He's had one chance really and he created it himself tbf.

1459~~~
Awful decision not to pass to van Persie but greed in a striker isn't the worst thing I suppose

1460~~~
Should've played in RVP but other than that he was good. Has a nice burst of pace.

1461~~~
Meh to him. He shouldn't be keeping Falcao out of the team. I like how quick he is and how well he closes down though.

1462~~~
He did outperform Van Persie indeed.

Strange decision to take him off when the game had opened up and his pace was our main outlet on the break.

Also he needs to play as the main number 9 but RVP stayed central today while he was doing leg work behind.

1463~~~
Nonsense <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> He's unlucky not to have scored this season already from the few chances we have made for him but the goals will come.

1464~~~
Would have do with handling Stoke at set pieces.

1465~~~
Luckily he created something in the second half, otherwise you would see million posts in this thread about how he is not ready for the first team, how he will be sold to a Championship team after a few years etc (just have to look at the match day thread in the first half).

1466~~~
Mate in the first half for Anders miss, RVP took an age to get the ball in position and if he had of been quicker it would have been an easy tap in for Wilson

1467~~~
Don't worry, I was pissed off when they sold Macheda too.

1468~~~
There was enough there to see that the lad has some talent.

His pace and ability to dribble at speed are something we really miss in our 'established' strikers.

1469~~~
Thought he got pushed off the ball far too easily. But he has pace, which is something different to our other strikers.

1470~~~
I think his skill set is brilliant and he'll score a lot of goals due to his pace. He ended brightly, too. He really should have passed the ball to Van Persie, however. You would assume the game would have been over had he done so.

1471~~~
We'd be absolutely livid were it not for Young and De Gea's heroics. I was fuming at the time and still am. There can be no room for that shit in a game like that, fair enough if it's a match like the Hull one but they were threatening.

1472~~~
Doesn't change the fact that Wilson should've passed it to RVP.

1473~~~
He's usually very good in one on ones and at that pace he might not have seen him really. Pretty much he goes head on for goal once he gets going.

On the other hand in the first half RVP was clearly looking across but took ages to not pass to him for a simple tap in.

1474~~~
That's rubbish. Wilson should have scored. Where do you get the idea he should have passed to RVP? He was 18 yards from goal with a great opportunity to shoot. It blows my mind you're trying to make out a striker in that position isn't entitled to shoot. 9/10 he would score that but it wasn't to be. It's completely different to the situation in the first half where Robin took an age to get into position to pass it - so much so he had to pass it back to Ander to sky over.

1475~~~
Should've passed to Van Persie.

1476~~~
I thought it was an encouraging game.

Looked nervy at the start, struggled to get into it and was perhaps over-awed a little but grew into it, good couple of runs showing his pace and should have bagged a goal.

Nothing to write home about, but encouraging enough for only his second start.

1477~~~
He could've passed to Van Persie but he was well entitled to go for goal himself. He should've scored.

Nice to see someone with a bit of pace playing up top.

1478~~~
He had a quiet first half but it's very encouraging the way he played in the second. Some great shows of pace and confidence. I'm not arsed he didn't pass to RVP, as he could just as easily have finished that himself (or RVP could have just as easily missed) and it shows the lads self-confidence which I think he only found in the second half. Mind you, the whole team was playing better for most of the second half, so that obviously helped.

1479~~~
And yet if he did pass it and Van Persie missed you'd all be on here saying how it was an awful decision to pass and he should of had the confidence to take it on himself.

People are so quick to judge and write off players. Inside 45 minutes of one single game the usual people were saying he clearly wasn't ready for the first team. The guy actually played well, had some really good moments in the second half and showed good bursts of speed for his chance on goal and the Ireland foul. No complaints for me.

1480~~~
Despite everyone being pleased and getting hyped up with him getting a chance tonight , he did virtually nothing for the entire game apart from run around a lot. Bad decision not to pass to Van Persie and when he took it on himself he should have buried the chance. But, having said all of that: I like him a lot, he clearly has a lot of potential, and I think he has the potential to be great in the future.

1481~~~
Nothing wrong with not passing to RVP, he made himself a great chance, which he should have scored.

1482~~~
RvP wouldn't have passed to him in the same situation.

1483~~~
It was promising but clearly shows a few areas that he needs to work on when playing grown mens football rather than in the reserves

1484~~~
That's incredibly harsh. The bit where he was too selfish he more or less created for himself and he did brilliantly when Ireland should have been sent off for hacking him down.

1485~~~
feck this "Should have passed it" shit, he created the chance and had the confidence to take it on, I want to see that in a striker after RvP's sloth mode malarkey. Wilson was anonymous in the first half but got into it in the second with a couple of really good runs, I wish LvG had left him with Falcao.

1486~~~
He should've just scored.

1487~~~
2 single moments in the whole game though and he hardly touched the ball at all. He has potential though as I said and I do like him a lot. And if nothing else all his running shows that he's got good energy and desire too which are always great attributes in a player.

1488~~~
Noway should he have passed it! He should have scored!  

Now since he missed it, you can only say he should have passed.

1489~~~
He looked a lot sharper than RvP - the potential is there for all to see.

1490~~~
Why do some people think he should have passed? Is it because after creating the chance yourself you're not entitled to shoot or was it because the angle was wide? Or was it just cause he missed? Funny how Wilson get's all this stick and Mata didn't against hull. In that position he's entitled to shoot. He was not at an angle but you know what? If he had of passed it, some would moan at him for not shooting - what can you do?

He should have scored. He was right to shoot but it wasn't a miss through indecision and he'll be alright.

1491~~~
Very promising stuff. Hull would've been a lot better for him - alongside Rooney at that. Great pace and tidy feet, and as shown from his performances at youth level, he knows where the goal is. Just difficult wrt continuity seeing as Falcao/RvP exist.

1492~~~
Because RvP was wide open to his left. Wilson was trying a bit too hard to impress.

1493~~~
He's learning...great run out for him and no doubt realises that the difference between the reserves and the first 11 is very very different. However, I thought he really equipped himself well and will no doubt learn from this.

1494~~~
Those are areas that are weak for him in the reserves as well tbf.  Needs more strength to begin with.

Anyway, he's type of striker who'll barely be in the game and boom score a spectacular goal. And then become more lethal when the game opens up.

1495~~~
I think LvG is using him well. He's getting football at both levels and can see what he needs to improve on. Probably the second most exciting player we have on the counter attack already though. Probably impact sub is is current role.

1496~~~
There wasn't much space in behind first half certainly. I feel for the forwards because the team ponces about a lot threatening to look forwards only to pass it sideways and back. For all your bs, you could say the same about RVP so what does that tell you?

1497~~~
He was barely at an angle. He has every right to shoot. Make no mistake. He's a striker. He didn't miss because he was in a bad position to shoot. He missed by an inch and that can happen. I'm sorry i'm not getting this trying too hard to impress talk at all. The two chances where he took it upon himself to run with the ball, he got their lad booked and he missed a good chance to score.

I do not remember instances where he was running into blind alleys. I don't remember times he was hogging the ball. It's a nonsense.

1498~~~
Why is that bs? He hardly touched the ball all night, made a bad decision not to pass to RvP and should of scored when he took it on himself. RvP didn't do much either granted but was more involved in the game. I'm not saying he played badly but he didn't play well either and your kidding yourself if you say that he did.

1499~~~
If it was reversed, and he was to take it onto his favoured left foot then fair enough, but taking it on to his right was the wrong decision, in my opinion. Of course, it shows the bravery and confidence of the lad, and that run that resulted in Ireland's booking shows what a threat he can be if he is left space in to which he can accelerate.

1500~~~
RvP was wide open. He should've passed it to him. That said, can't really blame him after RvP didn't pass to him in the first half. They both cost us two easy goals.

1501~~~
He should have scored but if he did any easy pass to RVP then the game would have been much easier (he nearly cost us)

1502~~~
Imo he tends to have good balance and shrug off some challenges in the reserves. Thats not going to happen against Stoke CBs

1503~~~
Showed great energy and had a few good runs. Should have probably passed it to RVP late on but I guess it shows his striker instinct.

1504~~~
RvP would never have passed in a million years if the roles were reversed.

1505~~~
Unlucky with his chance.  Should always have taken it himself.

Did little else to impress really.

1506~~~
Impressed with Wilson, I like his powerful runs and he wasn't afraid to use his weaker foot to shoot. Only 19 years of age and will improve a lot working with the top strikers we have in training.

1507~~~
Van Persie would already be closed down by their CB if the role were reversed tbf.

1508~~~
I'd probably give you a green laughing smiley if that wasn't so depressing.

1509~~~
I'm not so sure. The pass to van Persie was the easy ball and he had a better chance of scoring which is why Wilson's being criticised, but the fact he kept going and took on another man was a good sign all the same. If he can dribble in the Premier League like he can in the reserves - and he's shown glimpses of it - then we're onto a winner here.

1510~~~

1511~~~
Damn I want to cry

1512~~~
I thought it was an okay performance, he worked his ass off, and had a couple of moments where his build up was very good.

1513~~~
He did well, but for me he should have passed so we could get that third goal and close the match, shows inexperience but that comes with being a 19 year old striker. If he had scored okay fine then you won't say anything, but it was clear that RvP would have had a far easier chance than himself. But he is a lad that is very confident in himself and i like that, you need confidence to break into Man Utd's first XI.

1514~~~
RvP wouldn't have beaten the CBs at all.

1515~~~
I'm always shocked when I see him jink past players, doesn't look like he should be that quick and agile.

1516~~~
why?

1517~~~
His change of pace is very nice. Looks to have good acceleration.

1518~~~
Like a young Michael Owen

1519~~~
He's rapid. Love it when a youngster comes in and isn't afraid to run at opponents.

1520~~~
Unless he scores a lot of goals, he's got to understand that more is required than a few standout moments per game. 

Just turned 19 though so he's got all the time in the world.

1521~~~
The defender stepped out quite early and did a good job when defending 2v1... could have passed very early but it was in pace and he did a good think not to lose composure and showed some confidence which is a good signed. I was only disappointed by his finish I expected 95% goal from him in those kind of chances as he is one of the best finishers in the team.. but maybe it was because he didn't have many touches in the game and was working hard for the team closing down players.. 

I am quite satisfied with his performance.. he showed pace like Januzaj at the start of his senior carrer

1522~~~
I don't think it was the wrong decision. On another day he sticks that away easily. It's good that he had the confidence to go all the way.

1523~~~
For all the People that say he should have passed it to RVP - RVP should have squared it to him for that Herrera chance. RVP took so many touches of the ball and finaly decided to lay it to Ander. But he could have squared it to James much much quicker too and James was in a much better position to score.

I hope those two moments have given him a boost actually. I hope they have showed him that he can take on people at his level. He has been keeping it simple in a lot of the matches he has come on.

1524~~~
I like the fact he can beat a man for pace, as thats what we are missing from our strikers since Saha or a younger Rooney, but tonight he really should have put it on a plate for RVP. I was screaming at the screen for him to pass it. Game over at that point if it goes in

1525~~~
He wasnt really in the game but those two bits of brilliance just show what a talent we have

1526~~~
Was surprised he didn't take that chance really, but that was very encouraging in the second half. Wasn't really in the game much in the first half, but you can tell he has loads of potential. Says a lot about his confidence and finishing that at his age I expected that chance to end up in the net, a shame he missed though. Was a brilliant run.

1527~~~
Also feck that about saying he should've passed to RvP. That's part of the reason why Welbeck isn't at the club anymore. Whenever he was in a chance as a striker, he passed it to somebody else to finish off or fecked around with it and made a mess out of it. Yes Wilson missed, but he didn't lack conviction at all and was very purposeful and had only the goal in mind. Taking that on and being that bit selfish is the difference between average strikers who won't ever get good numbers, and potentially world class forwards.

1528~~~
Did brilliantly just before being brought down by Ireland!

1529~~~
Rooney plus one.

1530~~~
That's highly debatable. We haven't seen much Rooney-Falcao or Rooney-Wilson partnership.  Rooney-RvP is clearly overrated as it was proven in 12-13 season.
To be honest, since Ronaldo left, I haven't seen Rooney link up well with any forward, bar Chicharito maybe?

1531~~~
Not remotely bothered by the miss, he'd earned the chance. Invisible before that though, but then got a bit of a spring in his step after, before being frustratingly taken off instead of RVP.

1532~~~
Rooney did really well with both Welbeck and Hernandez. It's only RvP which he's failed to really link up that well with, which I would put down to RvP rather then Rooney who has almost always linked up well with his partner. Maybe the problem is they both like to come deep generally and like the ball into feet and so they can clash with having similar styles.

Anyways, I reckon Falcao-Rooney could be a great partnership, though we haven't seen them together yet really.

1533~~~
Did fine today. Quiet first half though, but good to see that the work rate is there. If Rooney and Di Maria aren't fit for the Southampton game, I don't mind Wilson starting. His pace can really hurt Soton on the counter where they are really susceptible which was evident against City.

1534~~~
To be honest, we aren't missing Welbeck at all. Wilson offers the same pace, energy, work-rate, dribbling, and runs that Welbeck. The only downfall to Wilson's game is youthful naivety, but that can be easily eradicated.

From having no Manc forwards in our team in a long time to potentially two in recent years. Wilson looks really promising as well, and I'm very happy to see him being given chances here.

1535~~~
Im delighted with him. When the goals arrive we'll all be raving about him. Only a matter of time <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1536~~~
What a prospect this kid is! Last night he showed some real flashes of potential, so much so that I find myself thinking that we don't really need Falcao, although I'd like him to get fit and show us what he can do. In Europe, I am not sure Wilson would be enough during the next couple of years.

1537~~~
Welbeck and Rooney was great the year Welbeck lead the line.

1538~~~
Shame his chance didn't creep inside the post.

1539~~~
I love Wilson, obviously.

But he should have passed it.

Of course I wouldn't have passed it myself! So I can easily forgive him.

1540~~~
Thought he had a fairly quiet game with some explosions of magic that we know him for. His pace on the break is something we haven't had properly for a while, and his willingness to take on and run passed players and is exciting to watch. 

I thought he was desperately unlucky with his chance, people saying "he should of passed it" just don't know strikers. He would have been absolutely hammered if he passed it!. Yes he should have scored but on his weaker foot he got it inches wide, which can happen to anybody really. Thankfully we got away with it but we have to expect mistakes with young players.

Either way I was impressed, you can see why everybody speaks so highly of him.

1541~~~
A few whispers going about he's starting tomorrow

1542~~~
Came from this. But no source given.

1543~~~
A bold move if true. Who do we think this will be in place of? Mata?

1544~~~
Interesting. Him and RvP in front of Rooney make sense.
I guess we revert back to diamond with Carrick behind Herrera and Fellaini, Rooney at the tip and Wilson-RvP as strikers. 
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1545~~~
Wont surprise me. Think Van Gaal would want Rooney slightly deeper to help with the midfield. We'l go 3-5-2 again in that case which is a shame. Would have loved to see the diamond.

1546~~~
Exactly <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Say all you want about passing in there, everyone knows it was the right thing to do, everyone knows like feck would they have passed it themselves had it been them there.

1547~~~
Hope so, he has the pace we lack upfront. Mata and Januzaj were disappointing, Wilson took his chance the other day.

1548~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Exactly!

1549~~~
Bollocks. Hernandez, as you say, Welbeck when he lead the line in 2011, RVP in 2012/13. Dunno what you mean about their partnership being overrated that year: RVP scored 30 and assisted 9, Rooney scored 13 and assisted 13. He also assisted plenty of RVP's best goals that season.

1550~~~
Wilson starting means 352 and no Di Maria.

1551~~~
We already know there's no Di Maria. But why does it mean 352?

1552~~~
Wilson starting (presumably instead of Mata) doesnt really change the system at all.

It is a 3-5-2/4-4-2 Diamond hybrid; Carrick can drop deep into the back line and allow Young and Valencia to push on = 3-5-2, but just as easily Carrick can push forward into midfield making it a diamond. The two formations/systems arent really that dissimilar on paper.

1553~~~
It actually came from this
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/barneyrednews" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/barneyrednews</a>

1554~~~
That's correct, and I think we look much better when Carrick plays slightly ahead of the defense (so in diamond formation), not as a CB.

1555~~~
This is true <i>if </i>Carrick is one of the '3'. Mostly when we've started that formation it's been with three proper CBs (McNair, Smalling and Blackett, for example.) I think that's the formation people have a problem with, and rightly so based on our consistently poor performances using it.

But I agree that starting Wilson has no impact on the formation. He fits into the 442 diamond and the 352 the same as any of our strikers.

1556~~~
I don't mind Wilson starting but not over Falcao. However, if we do play that stupid 3-5-2/5-2-3 then Wilson has to play. That formation only works if we have pace. WE saw against Southampton what happens without ace and nobody is going to deny we didn't get lucky that game. Against Arsenal we were lucky but difference was we looked threatening when we attacked as we had pace to hit them with.

I just hope we play the diamond

1557~~~
Can we afford to start a player that we <i>know</i> will need to come off at some point, with our luck with injuries, though?

It only took Smalling going off on Monday to see our game plan go up shit creek.

1558~~~
Chances are either of them will go off, whoever starts. But another reason why I'd prefer Falcao to start (assuming it's a back 4 we play) is because Wilson will be better to bring off the bench. He's quicker and will be more direct against a tired Liverpool back 4 hopefully

1559~~~
If true, I think it's because LvG wants Rooney in the hole

1560~~~
Wouldn't surprise me......Liverpool are so weak in the defence so Attack Attack Attack!!! and Wilson's clever runs could give Lovren & Co. are lot of trouble

1561~~~
FFS. Who's injured now then?

1562~~~
*fingers crossed* pleasebediamondpleasebediamondpleasebediamond

1563~~~
I'd rather see Falcao start than him.

1564~~~
Is Wilson a local kid? I know he's come through the academy but is he Mancunian?

1565~~~
Ffs How many time does Van Gaal have to say that Falcao ISN'T FIT ENOUGH TO PLAY MORE THEN 20 MINUTES ATM for people to stop calling for him to start?

Its beyond parody now.

1566~~~
I think he is, he is at the club since 7 or 8 if i'm not mistaken.

1567~~~
From the West Midlands

1568~~~
Nah he's from Biddulph which is basically Stoke on Trent. Not far, 45 minute drive.

1569~~~
Looks like a diamond to me. Best way to go, I back us to score more then them.

1570~~~
He's had another week of training since LVG said that. He should be getting there by now.

1571~~~
Thats not going to help with his match fitness.

1572~~~
Thanks.

1573~~~
Hope he starts. Would be a vote of confidence, as well as a huge challenge and opportunity for him!

1574~~~
Good news, his pace would potentially be very useful. Huge show of faith from Van Gaal. 

Who would have ever imagined that Wilson would have had this much play time though, considering we only have the premier league and he is competing with Rooney, RvP and Falcao?

1575~~~
A few hours before the Falcao transfer, Wilson was rumoured to be considered 3rd choice and it was supposed to be the reason for Welbeck probable departure.

1576~~~
He'll score if he starts.

1577~~~
Will be delighted if he does start, showed some good things against Stoke and his pace will trouble Liverpool.

1578~~~
Highly unlikely our 4th choice striker would start.

1579~~~
Yup, him starting games already occasionally shows how highly Van Gaal rates him.
Edit: I should add, starting games when Rooney, RvP and Falcao are all fit.

1580~~~
Not sure if LvG rates him as much as Giggzy does. From what I've read, Giggs has been advocating for Wilson to play more.

1581~~~
Not really, Mata was terrible against Southampton so it wouldn't be surprising if he was dropped, Rooney will probably play deeper because of this and Falcao isn't fit enough to start matches yet.

1582~~~
I suppose that's possible, although unlikely. You play your best players in the important fixtures and that's Rooney, RvP, Mata, Falcao, who are all likely to play since Di Maria is out.

1583~~~
That's another reason Wilson might start though, as he's the only other attacking player in the squad that has proper pace.

1584~~~
It would be more plausible if we were missing a striker, rather than a winger/midfielder.

1585~~~
The same people had news about Wilson starting against Stoke. 

As for it being a surprise, it's actually not - we badly need some pace and he's the quickest forward currently fit.

1586~~~
All depends on Van Gaal's tactics I suppose. Falcao's availability suggests it he will play.

1587~~~
Well, it's between Wilson and Falcao if Van Gaal does drop Rooney back into midfield like I expect and I don't see Van Gaal starting Falcao against Liverpool when he's only played 20 minutes in the last month.

1588~~~
I think that was the plan, to gradually get Falcao back to full match fitness which is why he didn't start last week. He seems fully fit again, so this would be the ideal game for him to have a game.

1589~~~
After than incredible run, doing it all himself, it would have taken extraordinary selflessness to pass there. 

People always say strikers should be selfish. Wilson has a hair trigger on his gun.

Welbeck would have passed. But then he wouldn't have created that chance.

1590~~~
Hope you're right . Times three.

1591~~~
We desperately lack pace without Di Maria so starting Wilson up top with RvP and Rooney at the tip of the diamond is a great idea.

1592~~~
Unlikely I think, though he would give us some pace.

1593~~~
Quite likely I think. The main thing everyone took from the 3-0 was United's lack of pace and players to run at people. With Di Maria out its essential we have someone who can stretch them and stop them from playing a high line. 

If Wilson can do that, it means we can take control of the centre of the pitch and make it a very tiring day for their midfielders and in turn keep the ball away from the wings.

1594~~~
Last big game Di Maria played he was used up front against Arsenal. Would make sense that we decided to use his pace on the counter like that and with his injury, another player who has speed and can carry the ball up the pitch would get the nod. Especially a player who is more at home playing the forward role than Di Maria himself

1595~~~
Who would you drop out for Wilson? Mata?

1596~~~
Also bear in mind we hopefully won't be playing a back 3/5 which opens up a slot aswel.

1597~~~
If rumours are true, and Wilson is to start today, then I think it would be the right call. With Di Maria missing, we have no one in the final third who runs with the ball with pace, as well as Wilson does, and because a 352, 442 diamond can be pretty narrow, at times, we need someone who can carry the ball.

1598~~~

1599~~~
Why are these leaks still happening?!

1600~~~
Willo to start today then.Deal with it Scousers.

1601~~~
Yep, this. Without Di Maria, either Wilson or Januzaj needs to be on the pitch to give us some pace and penetration. And he's shown enough in his outings so far to deserve the chance.

1602~~~
Even with Di Maria it would be great to have his pace. 

Rooney, Willo and Angel blasting forward and being unleashed by quick one touch play from Carrick and Herrera/Mata <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1603~~~
Makes sense to inject some pace into the attack. Good work rate too. Big day for the lad.

1604~~~
Well if it will be the 442 diamond then why not I guess but if it's that fecking 352 shit then I'd rather want Falcao to start or just put Rooney and RVP up front. Need a lot of ball shielding and experience up front because everything will be so slow and such.

1605~~~
Told you pace was the reason...

1606~~~
Yep fair enough. I'm a bit shit at picking lineups. Hope he scores a couple. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1607~~~
So how many goals will he score this afternoon?

1608~~~
Two academy plus four English players starting in our biggest derby. Nice.

1609~~~
I would be happy for at least one assist to be honest.

1610~~~
Needs to show something today. Surprised he starts, I haven't been impressed yet. Hopefully he grabs the chance this time.

1611~~~
If he gets service, I have absolutely no doubt he'll have a good game. Those criticising him most heavily are those who haven't really watched him that much and don't know what he's about.

My big worry is that with so many midfielders on the pitch Liverpool will choke off all supply lines and he and RVP won't get enough of the ball.

1612~~~
He'll score today. You heard it here first.

1613~~~
I wonder if Wilson gives us an easier out through a packed midfield, as you can knock it over the top for him to run on to. Falcao and RVP can only offer trying to hold it up with strength.

1614~~~
But we lost our identity.

1615~~~
What is the point in a James Wilson?
He's pretending to be anonymous so he can appear out of nowhere and score a screamer? That's the plan, isn't it?

1616~~~
Not really gotten into the match at all. Partly because our service to the frontline has been nonexistent.

He is trying hard but looks slightly out of his depth so far. Should be hauled off for Falcao/Januzaj etc. at some point.

1617~~~
He's stretching their defence a wee bit. It's not like van Persie is pulling trees either. We spent too much time having Fellaini and Young backpass in our field to get the ball to them.

1618~~~
Not involved so far, but it's the same with Mata and RVP, so it's not really his fault.

1619~~~
I don't expect anything of him when he's playing in such a broken system.

1620~~~
Oh aye, the service has been awful. Other than attacking down the wings we've nothing coming forward.
It'd almost be better taking him off for another midfielder, like you said Januzaj maybe?

It's not solely his fault but he does look out of his depth.

1621~~~
I don't think he looks out of his depth really. It's a classic striker performance in a team that does nothing to set him up. Can't see the runs he most likely makes on TV, so it's impossible to actually comment on his performance.

1622~~~
Can anyone see what this guy is actually good at except from running fast? I wish I could see it but I just can't.

1623~~~
LVG can

1624~~~
He has not justified his hype, but he has time and definetly has the ability to do so.

1625~~~
Will struggle if there's no space. I feel for him a bit because at the youth levels, the teams pass the ball better. Very rarely do you see this kind of shit. Until we pass the ball properly or have consistent width, it's going to be tough because we're not going to create chances. Will do him good in the long run.

1626~~~
Its the usual bollocks around here. People hype the youngsters up then roll into their threads to talk about how disappointing they are.

Wilson did fine today. He will develop into a very good player over time.

1627~~~
He did what you expect of someone feeding off table scraps and not playing to his game, same way Falcao was constantly making forward runs off defensive the lines and was only picked up twice.

1628~~~
Difficult game for him today and wasn't really involved. He should rather come on and hurt other teams with his pace. He's young, talented and has all the time

1629~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I take it you never watched him in the U21 team.

1630~~~
Felt a bit sorry for him. He's not gonna suit a 3-5-2 with the way we played it today.

Ran him bollocks off for the team though, which was great to see.

1631~~~
From what I can see, the players just don't give it to him - when they do, they play it miles ahead of him and he can't get to it. Not great a great game but it don't think he can't be blamed too much.

1632~~~
Tbf there wasn't much talk around about Wilson being a disappointment in this thread (although I'm sure there're plethora of them in the match day thread).

He need to stick to the wing more to get more ball the way Van Persie did.With his current physicality he's not gonna win any header inside the box so he need to get the ball from deep or wing and run with it if he want to have chance to shoot in those tight matches.Though with how Falcao played when he came on I think Wilson will start the next match.

1633~~~
van Gaal helped Wilson take a huge step to becoming a regular for us. To start him against our hated rivals was a brave decision.

I have no doubt he will score many goals for us.

1634~~~
Did nothing spectacular but nothing wrong either, he had moments of class and also looked like a player who wasn't phased by the size of the game.

1635~~~
Never seen him in the u21 so not sure what he's about but I think we need to stick to him playing in the FA cup and against weaker opposition.

1636~~~
Really pleased for him, the lad just doesn't seem fazed at all. Days like today, academy kid playing against the club's greatest historical rival are what the club is all about and will speed up his maturation curve. Important thing now is to be realistic with our expectations - hoping for a youngster to step up, fully express his range of talents and and perform brilliantly vs Liverpool in his 3rd start as a first team player is a bit unfair. He will take his time, have some teething issues, make a few inexplicable errors along the way, hopefully learn from them, have some patches of poor form but that's all perfectly natural, every footballer goes through that.

The management must now do everything in their means to preserve young Wilson instead of throwing him to the wolves week in and week out, figuratively speaking and that's where Giggsy, who was a prodigy once too comes into the picture. We must be extremely careful with him, Januzaj and McNair (great gesture by Van Gaal TBF with the sub) and bring them along gradually, or risk physical and mental exhaustion because we are not talking about normal circumstances. Playing for an elite side like United or Madrid or Bayern at age 18 or 19, with massive expectation levels and media scrutiny can be extremely daunting and something a lot of us can't relate with, hence the disproportionate criticism.

1637~~~
He is quick isn't he? Kept up with Sterling, unfortunately we don't seem setup to take advantage of that pace, seems to be in the team to cover for Di Maria's work rate.

1638~~~
Barely had a touch.

1639~~~
yup. didn't have much of the ball today. a very difficult game for him.

1640~~~
He's holding the fort until Falcao's fit.  Shows promise.

1641~~~
Didn't have much ball time but we never seem to get our forwards involved much. Absolute workhorse and I love that. I think he did a good job of making runs to open up some space for van Persie and others. He helps stretch the defence as they have to be aware of his ability to get in behind and track his runs. I remember a few runs he made and should have been played in but no one was spotting him and van Persie especially was favouring looking for a different pass.

1642~~~
Worked hard today and it was nice to see but didn't add much overall to the game. Hoping it's not a case of Federico Macheda mark 2 with this guy.

1643~~~
I think the game just panned out differently to how LVG expected it to. He thought we'd have to attack on the break because Liverpool would try and control it, but we had control and therefore few chances to break and score. We did break for RVP's goal but that was one of the only times. So its one thing to put someone in with pace, but its another thing to use that pace. We were unable to get him into the game in that way

1644~~~
Didn't really threaten them in terms of attack, but one thing I did like is how he charged after Sterling after they cleared one of our corners.  He caught him as well!

1645~~~
Ran around a lot and overall it was good experience for him, but he barely got a kick.

1646~~~
I noticed that, not many players could run down sterling like that.

1647~~~
Didn't get involved in the game as much as I would have liked, but done a lot of hard work off the ball.

1648~~~
He worked very hard tracking back and defensively today.

Most of the occasions in transitions he was behind Mata and RVP both. 

I think that's why he was played ahead of Falcao. Almost a self sacrificing role at times.


Was quiet in the attacking sense though.

1649~~~
Yeah, Rooney and RVP particularly ignore him when he pulls into space around the box.

1650~~~
That's true, so please do tell if you have.

1651~~~
He will have better performances once he has a supply line that can pass to our own players more than 4 yards away. Not much service, but made sense as to why he started, helped put pressure high up. Good to see him start and put in a good shift without actually having a chance (think he pretty much created one for himself second half which he blazed wide)

1652~~~
He worked hard for the team. He'll be hoping to be involved more up top but that'll come with time.

1653~~~
Worked hard and put in a shift. Didn't have many opportunities to showcase his talent. He'll get better.

1654~~~
He can do just about anything.

Looked a bit nervous i thought, first time I've seen him look nervous.

1655~~~
Just look up some of the goals he's scored and you'll see he's far more than a speed-merchant. It's not without reason that basically anyone who follows our youth team (ex-pros included, such as the Neville brothers) have very high hopes for him. At U21-level he carries the ball very well, is a clinical finisher and just a very intelligent striker. Scores all sort of goals. He's basically the whole packet and he "just" need to translate that into senior football, but he just turned 19 so there's plenty of time for him.

1656~~~
He's very good, don't worry.

1657~~~
Cool, I guess he just needs to find his feet with the grownups then. Pogba didn't look like a world-beater in his first-team cameos either. Good to hear.

1658~~~
He didn't do much today apart from running around a lot and trying to win back possesion. But he looks like a player in the making but still a long way to go

1659~~~
He's about two years off imo. Needs to be brought along slowly and would probably do well with a loan at some point.

1660~~~
My favorite moment of him today was following a missed corner by us. When Liverpool went on the counterattack, he beat everyone on speed to get back in a defensive position to support Carrick, which tells me that he's no ordinary forward. Of course he was quiet on the attacking front, but that time will come when we have better service from midfield. It won't be long before he finds his groove, I'm very confident about it.

1661~~~
He had the sort of game you'd expect from a young striker feeding off scraps. He's not experienced enough to impose himself on the game in the way RVP can and we gave him no goalscoring chances, but he still ran his socks off. 

Probably my second favourite moment (after the offside goal, of course) was how he caught up to Sterling like he was stood still. How we miss that sort of pace.

1662~~~
I agree he looked a little bit nervous (shock, right) and maybe a little bit out of his depth at the moment. I have really high hopes for the lad and he can play a part but he really can't do much without proper service.

1663~~~
could have had his goal today if Rooney saw him/ wouldnt be so selfish after Evans gifted Sterling a chance. Rooney just had to pass it across instead of shooting with his left foot straight at the goalie.

1664~~~
Needs a goal this season to get going!

1665~~~
Time is on his side and he is definitely not overawed by the occasion.

1666~~~
I think he just wasn't getting the service he's used to, so grew a bit frustrated, but a mature performance in the sense, he did he's duties on the pitch.  Would of liked to have a bit more impact going forward, but was always an outlet.

1667~~~
My view also. Bags of potential but not ready for regular first team outings. Would much rather see Falcao getting his chance now and hopefully taking it.

1668~~~
I would like to see him up top with Carrick in midfield. Our midfield was incapable of providing any service into the flanks yesterday, it didn't really at all - probably should have been an impact sub.

1669~~~
Hopefully as soon as Falcao is 100% fit we can send him out on loan, they would certainly be a lot of takers!

1670~~~
Played alright when he was given the ball, but could do with some time in the under 21s to get back in the rhythm of scoring goals

1671~~~
Just not done it despite being OK today.

1672~~~
I thought he had some nice touches in the first half, but I don't really remember much from the second half.

1673~~~
Should be scoring as a striker shouldnt he.
Good play overall but that doesnt cut it for me.

1674~~~
Did well today.

1675~~~
0 service, but still works hard and links up well, this is not the best time to get him in the first team, back to u21 could be good for him.

1676~~~
I thought he did extremely well, just didnt have the clear chances he'd have hoped for. Almost all of our attacks in the first half came from a good touch, pass or piece of holdup play from Wilson and he drew a booking and a freekick in a dangerous position too.

Unfortunately the rest of our attacking players werent so bright today and the likes of Rooney and Falcao brokedown moves after good pieces of play from Wilson

1677~~~
Thought this was the best he's done in a long time. Deservedly stayed on instead of Falcao.

1678~~~
Showed strength and awareness on the ball, actually had a first touch that didn't span 20 yards and laid it off well on several occasions, could have gotten on the score sheet had Di Maria slipped it to him in the box when him and Herrera played the one-two near the end but Di Maria chose to shoot instead. I really can't see how people can be so harsh on a player who just turned 19 and was playing with zero service from a midfield trio that had all the fluidity and flair of a fecking Lada.

1679~~~
Can we just sort out the formation and the lack of service first before playing him?It's painful to see him being used like this.Would actually affect his confidence as well.Even the world class striker Falcao looks off in this setup.

1680~~~
I gave him my MOTM today and was surprised to see him with only 4%. I suppose Herrera and di Maria being neck and neck shows most people base their vote on who scored. 

For his overall performance and contributions over the course of the 90, I definitely think Wilson deserved it though. I really can't think of an incident where he wasted possession or failed to hold up the ball. Normally he did well with the ball, beating his man impressively a few times and creating plenty of space for others if not. On top of all that he never stops making runs and closing the opposition down when they're in possession, forcing them to give away the ball. Certainly offered a lot more than Falcao today anyway.

1681~~~
It was between Wilson and Ander for me. Gave them both 7 in the ratings too

1682~~~
Pretty much this.  

I like what I see in Wilson but this level (season overall) is just a bit out of reach for him right now.

1683~~~
Best game in a while. Looked the liveliest player and held the ball up and wriggled space away from defenders quite impressively on a number of occasions. Very promising.

Until Di Maria came on, his pace was a real refreshment, amongst quite a lot of crossing from both sides.

1684~~~
Yup. Best performance in the first team IMO. Even better than when he got a brace. Great learning experience for him too. Up against physical, lower league players flying into tackles. He's looking stronger all the time.

1685~~~
Not really, was the fact they were simply better then Wilson was.

Wilson played well for the first half an hour and then faded into nothing, much like all of his other games so far at senior level. I just struggle to see what he brings to the table apart from pace, Welbeck and even Macheda looked better in there first few senior games then Wilson thus far.

1686~~~
I thought he did well, it's the first game I have seen from him where I really felt he was bringing something to the team (rather than being given gametime due to being a youth product etc). Whilst there are complaints about formation, I really couldn't see Wilson doing much for us as a lone striker so 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 is probably what we are left with if we want to see Wilson.

That said, after Januzaj last year I would be more willing to see a 4-3-3 to accommodate Januzaj, than a 4-4-2 for Wilson.


I certainly didn't consider Wilson for MotM today. I didn't think anyone really had a great game but for me, Di Maria had the greatest impact on the game, so I gave it to him.

1687~~~
I don't know how you can argue Herrera was 'simply better' than Wilson was over the course of the 90, unless you're giving a massive amount of credit to him for the goal. Wilson offered a much greater contribution to the team imo, for the reasons I've already mentioned. Herrera was very quiet except for a few involvements.

I can see why you would give it to di Maria but then again I doubt very much he'd be a contender if he hadn't scored. And I bet Wilson would have scored if he'd been the one to come on with 30mins left, and put up top during a set piece 1on1, to break against a team who had thrown everything forward. Don't get me wrong, I massively rate di Maria, but Wilson is more deserving for MOTM over the course of the entire game.

He had his quiet spells during the game, but so did Falcao because we were playing so poorly they had no supply. He offers fantastic pace, movement, determination and seems to have a good engine on him.

1688~~~
Herrera didn't have a good game apart from his goal.

1689~~~
Too soon for him this season, needs to be loaned out in my opinion, like a few others.

1690~~~
Well it's based on the fact mainly that Herrera was contributing in the second half a lot more then Wilson. After the initial first 30 minutes Wilson was pretty much anonymous. Granted his service wasn't great today but still. Everyone claimed that Wilson was this great poacher and finisher yet I'm to see evidence that he is any of those yet. God I really do hope he turns it around because he will be a fantastic asset to have if he does but at the moment he just isn't bringing much to the table.

1691~~~
Decent performance today. Did little wrong but needs service to shine.
when will he get it?
No guarantees in a team that makes RvP and Radamel fecking Falcao look shit!

1692~~~
Maybe. Or maybe he just needs service. I'm not sure tbf!

1693~~~
If you are criticising Wilson, then first compare him to Falcao who was before his injury considered maybe the best striker in the world - him to freshly 19 year old who came from our academy AND who was better today.. what can he bring to the table when he has got no support? Not only him but also both senior strikers suffers from this a lot. Welbeck would do obviously much better on his own but he is no longer here. so let's just hope that Wilson will develop soon into at least as usefull player as Welbz was befroe he left. He will benefit from these minutes he got..

1694~~~
It's still early days but I've seen nothing from him so far that suggests he will be a first team player here, he's been mediocre at best in the majority of games he's been involved in.

1695~~~
Maybe wait until he actually gets a chance to score?

1696~~~
Strikers score goals.

1697~~~
They do? Weird the way so many games involve one or more teams not scoring, isn't it?

1698~~~
People read too much stats these days.

1699~~~
It's a very difficult setup to come in to at the moment, as the entire team is pretty much struggling. Strikers are feeding off scraps and having to come deep to get involved. Our chance creation stats in most (especially away) matches have  been abysmal. So it's very difficult to judge a forwards contribution. 

There's been a couple of matches where I've even questioned bringing Wilson on, instead of a creative player like Adnan - as our problem hasn't been finishing, it's been creating. So yeah, Wilson has not really impressed but I'm not too bothered yet.

1700~~~
Don't get the criticism at all. Especially after a game where he showed he's really developing and looking more able to compete, physically, with adults. Feck all chances to score though. The story of his extremely limited first team football this season. Two goals on his debut last season should be all the evidence anyone needs that he's a finisher, even if they've never seen him play for the reserves.

1701~~~
True.

1702~~~
Falcao and RVP are barely strikers then..

1703~~~
I'd agree that he probably hasn't had the best service to him but the best strikers get into the right positions and sometimes even create chances off their own accord. Something Wilson seemingly isn't doing so far

1704~~~
He's hardly played but he has had a few, difficult chances. All created by himself.

1705~~~
He's struggling to put his mark down and get properly involved in games at the moment. Not a question of ability just a learning process. He's had hardly any service or chances fall to him yet so its not like he's stinking out the joint and missing endless sitters.

1706~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/bvu1S.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/bvu1S.png"/>

1707~~~
Agree completely. All our strikers have struggled at times this season. All a matter of the service they're getting and that fuc*ing 352 pox

1708~~~
I don't know whether it's his new developed habit or instructed by LVG but he seems to drift wide a lot for the first team, which make him ever harder to get into the right position when we're attacking.Plus I have an impression that other players especially Rooney/Di Maria are not to keen on giving the ball to him.There seems to be a lot of problems on how our attacking moves are functioning at the moment.I still don't really get that "philosophy" tbh.

1709~~~
Welbeck would have been brilliant in the role we've got Wilson playing.

1710~~~
People keep banging on about his pace and yet he never really looks quick.

Certainly not upto speed with senior level games either.

1711~~~
Weird comment. He looked lightening quick today a few times. Same in most (although not all) his other games.

1712~~~
Nail on head. We're creating feck all at the moment making it impossible to judge Wilson...and Falcao for that matter. Di Maria back will change that

1713~~~
Yeah at least a couple times every match you can see him outrun the opposition even when he starts way behind. He has used his pace really well to get to loose balls and track runners.

1714~~~
Today was his best work in terms of using his speed advantage to press and defend. Something I was worried we'd lost with Welbeck.

1715~~~
I don't think it's really fair to judge him yet. 

The lad simply needs more passes, through on goal, rather than down the channels.  I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed, but there have been a few occasions where he's found himself in some space, and needs a through pass, only for the ball to be sent out wide or to another striker who takes the shot themselves. 

One example today, would be when Di Maria had the ball in the box and could have squared it to Wilson in the middle. The only other proper chance he had was when Hererra put him through on goal. 

Right now he's feeding off some really poor service (the same as our other strikers), but the thing is, the team would rather give it to RvP or Falcao to shoot (or they'd rather take it on themselves) than give him the final ball.

1716~~~
Has he had a single chance so far this season? There was one against Stoke but that was all his own doing.

He's not going to score goals if we don't set up chances for him and most of his appearances have come when we've been shit for one reason or another.

1717~~~
Our service to the strikers is dreadful. We have 3 at the back who either punt it for RVP or Falcao to compete for and thus Rooney and Mata pick up the loose balls. Very few times do we get to the bye line or in behind the defence.

1718~~~
badly needs a goal..

1719~~~
The through ball by Herrera is actually the way we should play if we want to use Wilson effectively.Normally he would have done better with the finish though.

1720~~~
Strikers feed off some decent fecking service.

1721~~~
He badly needs the players behind him to look something like competent footballers. He had one really decent pass to feed off for most of the 90.

1722~~~
Agreed. But that doesn't resolve the fact his positional sense hasn't been great and that he appears to go missing in games, surely?

1723~~~
What striker hasn't gone missing for us this season?

1724~~~
He is clearly a good finisher but the service to him to-date, has been non-existent. I would love to see him play in a game where he gets good service. He chased the ball down well yesterday and often found himself playing in the channels. He obviously needs to be playing a central role as that is what his game is all about. It's frustrating watching him play as we aren't playing to his strengths.

1725~~~
Did well, didn't really have any chances but what he did do he did very well.

1726~~~
Disappointed that he (and Falcao) failed to score against Yeovil. Strikers need service, but they should be able to notch against lower league opposition

1727~~~
Think a lot of the criticism on him is a bit unwarranted. Yes, he hasn't scored but his service has been poor and other players seem reluctant to pass to him, even when he's in scoring positions. Hope he can snatch a goal soon, will do wonders for his confidence and I hope for the confidence of his teammates in him as well.

1728~~~
Agreed.  If he or any of our strikers were being supplied with the type of passes that Costa or perhaps Harry Kane as of late, i'm sure we would be scoring a lot more goals.

Instead, our tactic over the last couple games has been to lump the ball forward and hope that our strikers win headers, against much taller CBs, which we inevitably almost never do.

1729~~~
I also feel it's a bit early for him but with the service our strikers get, it's difficult to score

1730~~~
Clearly not ready. He's like a headless chicken most of the time.

1731~~~
I still have patience over this boy as this is his first full season with the first team. Will only judge at the end of the season.

1732~~~
Perhaps, they said the same thing about Chicharito and I don't think he ever looked like he was really quick either. Might just be the way the running style looks.

1733~~~
Hernandez was very quick too. With objective evidence to confirm it. He was tracked as the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.us.terra.com/sports/worldcup/2010/fotos/0,,OI131629-EI14441,00-Top+fastest+players+in+the+World+cup.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quickest player at the 2010 World Cup</a>.

Wilson's got a very elegant running style, so it's not always obvious how fast he's moving. Mind you, if you didn't pick up on how quick Hernandez was either, chances are the issue is not them it's you!

1734~~~
true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> not blaming him for failing to score , how many chances has he got so far this season? i can only think about that  "one on one" against stoke and that's all, other than that he was just chasing loose balls from his teammates unfortunately.

1735~~~
Not really relevant to the point, but Kane's getting less than 2 chances a game in the box and Costa less than 3; they've just been incredibly effective.

Aguero, Pelle, Carroll, Bony, Sakho and Jovetic have actually had the most, but I get the general argument.

1736~~~
True, but I feel this experience can only benefit him (and us,) in the long-term.

1737~~~
Di Maria and Mata could have played him in a few times yesterday. 

That Stoke chance he created on his own.

1738~~~
yup..and that's the unfortunate part for him right now. we are just not creating enough.

1739~~~
You mean our midfield is like a headless chickens most of the time! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1740~~~
Wilson is eons quicker with the ball at his feet than Hernandez.

1741~~~
I haven't seen flashes of genius from James yet, but I love to see young players given a chance, as we did with Macheda.

1742~~~
How many has Wilson got?

1743~~~
2 shots inside the box, in close to 5 hours play.

Whether that's awful movement, coming on late in games when the others aren't chasing goals or players intentionally passing to Van Persie instead, I don't know.

1744~~~
Thank you David Moyes.

1745~~~
He's right though. Look at City and how often Nasri, Silva, Clichy, Zabaleta, Kolarov get to the by line for a cut back. We are currently too narrow and too predictable, but at least harder to beat.

1746~~~
So much less less than all the other strikers you mention.

In other words, your stats back up what everyone has been saying. He's not been getting any service. 

Odd decision to leave Wilson's stats out of a thread about him.

1747~~~
Indeed. Getting to the byline is an extremely important way to create goals. The crucifixion Moyes got for that comment was ridiculous.

1748~~~
Thank you David Moyes.

1749~~~
For sure, but with Moyes it was quite clear to me at least we were instructed to cross the ball far earlier, so for him to complain about it was a bit odd. Most obviously it was Evra crossing from deeper than ever before.

1750~~~
We definitely tended to hit crosses from deeper than usual last season. 

The "byline comment" was just him talking about a specific game, though, saying we had got to the byline so much he couldn't believe we didn't score. Which is fair comment. Getting to the byline is an extremely dangerous situation in football. It didn't deserve the mockery he got on here. "David Moyes thinks getting to the byline is the same as scoring goals!! LOLLZZ!!"

1751~~~
Yep agree and as a defender it is up there with players running at pace at you or in behind you as the hardest to deal with. (We have been short of both this season in our team) Di Maria aside and what a difference he make to our team.

1752~~~
He's very tidy in possession with a sweet left foot. If he played for Arsenal you'd be wishing he was ours.

1753~~~
I'm sure he was for the reserves and in training but he's not shown that during matches so far. Like I said he's still raw and looks a year or two away from the step up. Mind you it doesn't help that our midfield creates feck all for our strikers.

1754~~~
Not really - as he's not scored a goal, we would be saying I hope they keep playing him. 

I want Wilson to do well, I like the fact LVG is blooding him and playing him so often. BUT for me he hasnt quite done it this year as yet, decent touches and good movement should be standard for a striker. Goals is what will make him a utd player, and as yet he hasnt done that. I personally think he will. But with Di Maria back now and pretty much our whole forward line fit I think he'll get less game time.

He cant say he hasnt had chances to make an impact though, even if creativity in the side has been fairly weak.

1755~~~
What sort of chances have been put on a plate for him though?. Apart from the 1 chance which he made for himself (he probably should have passed to RVP) I can't think of any shocking misses or should be goals.

1756~~~
Im talking about game time. I think he's done okay in games. But he's often played just off the striker and has he created any chances? I cant think of any. He's shown glimpses etc, but for me hasnt quite done it, not an issue as he's young and its great he's getting opportunities. 

By chances I meant opportunities to show his ability, not chances for goal. But lets be honest top strikers (including Falcao and RVP in this criticism) should be able to turn half chances into chances and create goals from nowhere. We havent seen much of that this season.

1757~~~
Sure he hasn't taken the league by storm but then people rarely do straight away. I think this will be his bedding in season so to speak, and after this he will be stronger and more ready. He is still quite thin and gangly so seems to bounce off the defenders, but his pace and dribbling will become very handy in the future.

1758~~~
Most United fans don't want Berahino and Kane and they're both 21 until the end of the season and have 30 goals between them in half a season. Doubt they'd care about a goalless Arsenal player.

Also, Harry Kane's created a chance every hour this and last season. Wilson's creating 1 every 6 hours, so a bit early for "sweet left foot". Not mentioning the goals.

1759~~~
Hasn't kicked on, but then he hasn't had that many chances yet. Maybe best to go on loan for his own development. We can play Adnan up front instead when needed.

1760~~~
Oddly the same thing was causing Van Persie to come under fire yet then it was put down to his workrate <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
Service to the strikers has been largely poor for the majority of the season.
Just pulled up some assist stats.

Di Maria------6
Rooney ------4
Herrera-------3
Mata ---------3

Falcao -------3
RVP----------2

Is that good enough from our midfield and no 10's really? 
Falcao creating as many assists as Mata isn't really acceptable from what is supposed to be our most gifted no 10.
Fabregas has 14 for Chelsea and Oscar 6, only Di Maria who's been injured 6 weeks looks respectable.

1761~~~
This has been the main problem, I would argue Herrera has also hardly played much though

1762~~~
With the injuries our numbers are pretty good, Fabregas numbers shouldn't be used as reference, because 14 assists is what you have in a season, not half a season.

1763~~~
With the 352 you'd expect the wing backs to share the creative burden, so that needs to be taken into account.

Hererra hasn't featured much and Mata's really only hit his stride in the last month or two, so your point is valid. Our creative players haven't been creating enough. Mata's looked really good in his last couple of outings so hopefully this won't be an issue much longer.

1764~~~
Di Maria just needs to keep shooting lots, because the ball always seems to accidentally find it's way to a free player in the box. It's quite the amazing skill. Worth the £60m in itself really.

1765~~~
It's another tough one to call as above we ain't had the service from midfield to so its hard to make an opinion, same with Falcao.

Wilson is a young boy and needs to be loaned out really but as we've sold Welbeck we will have to keep him here!

1766~~~
I looked at wingbacks and they've amassed 3 assists between the 4 of them, quite surprised by that actually as Young and Valencia have looked very effective, stats tell a different story. 
I am not at all sold on this 3-5-2, our players just aren't creating enough from wide areas to warrant a continuation with it. Obviously LVG is hamstrung in respect of fit personell but if you can play 3 fit CB's and 2 wingbacks then you can put out a fit functioning back 4 too. 

Fully expect stats to change with Di Maria and Herrera now available but it does explain why all our strikers have struggled for goals in the first half.

1767~~~
Yeah, it's funny actually. We've spent all season complaining about how poor our defending has been but we've only conceded one more goal than City/Chelsea. We've scored 10 less than them, though. Sames as Southampton and Arsenal. Only three more than West Ham! Considering the wealth of attacking talent we're supposed to have that's actually a much more important issue than our defence, which is getting all the heat. Not to mention that our defence has been crippled by injuries but all our most attacking players (apart from DiMaria, anyway) have been unusually resistant to injury.

Obviously, you could argue that Van Gaal is being forced to play more conservatively because he doesn't trust our defence but as the man would say himself, it's all about balance. We seem to have spent the first half of the season going from one extreme to another.

1768~~~
That's because we have no midfield, without one you seem shaky defensively and you are inept offensively. We have quality and quantity in defense and attack.

1769~~~
To be fair, stats won't show moves started by Young/Valencia that have led too goals.

Also, to be fair to Young - its largely the fault of our strikers that he hasn't grabbed more assists - he's been creating many excellent chances.

1770~~~
True, but I actually think we have a decent set of players to field a decent midfield, not the best but better than what we have been seeing. Injuries obvioulsy have not helped though I guess.

1771~~~
Someone on Football Weekly made a very good point. For our 352 to be in any way effective we've been hugely reliant on Young. Take him out of the team and we're toothless. If his hammy keeps him out for a few weeks, either Van Gaal shows some balls and goes four at the back, or we're in for some seriously turgid and low-scoring football. I like Luke Shaw as a fullback but he hasn't a clue how to beat a man, so is completely pointless as a wingback.

1772~~~
I agree with you they are quality midfielders, but they aren't playing well together, which create a host of problems our defenders are unnecessarily under pressure and our strikers are rarely put in ideal situations.

The senior players like Van Persie and Falcao struggle, and it's even worse for Januzaj and Wilson. I think that only someone like Lingard or Di Maria can cope with that, they like to provoke run with the ball, force the decision.

1773~~~
Aye, I remember silently nodding in agreement when hearing that. Think he's bang on...  even to a certain extent on the right hand side too. Rafael makes for a better wing-back then Shaw, as he can beat a man... but I don't think he has the intelligence that Valencia does in terms of picking and choosing his moments. Nor does he have Valencia's speed and strength.

But yaeh, can see LVG reverting to the diamond considering our current injuries.

1774~~~
I'd be worried going out with a back four that had Valencia and Young at full back, I don't really see that as a viable option.

We've seen a few times with Valencia that, as creditable as his performances at full back have sometimes been, he's caught out defensively more often than a full back should be. Young hasn't really had a run at full back, but there's no reason to assume he'd be much better. Neither of those guys learned their trade worrying about offside traps, or covering centre backs who get drawn inside, or organising marking during a corner. Playing them as wingbacks is fine, since it switches the balance of their game to being more attacking, which suits their strengths. 

Of course the reverse is true if Shaw and Rafael are your options. Playing them at wingback is daft, since neither is really able to beat a man by themselves, and neither has a consistently outstanding cross on them.

1775~~~
It's just a completely different ballgame. For all that Valencia gets stick for being predictable and one-dimensional he's still much better able to cope with being a winger/wing-back than Rafael. And it goes without saying that Young is vastly superior to Shaw on the opposite flank.

Reminds of that time Fergie experimented with Paddy Evra on the left wing. In terms of tricks, skill, technical ability and general flair he's probably the best fullback we've had in years. Still looked utterly lost on the wing though. You can't spend your whole career making over-lapping runs with a man advantage then suddenly be expected to handle a 1 vs 2 situation from a standing start and still create something.

I've made my feelings about 252 abundantly clear but - for the love of god - don't persist with the damn thing when we don't have any fit wingers. That way madness lies...

1776~~~
Yeah, it's not great when you've one less player on the pitch.

1777~~~
Agree completely. Hes made some crucial interceptions in the wing back role. Given Rafael is the natural full back its odd. His covering of the whole back line has actually really impressed me. Possibly down to a better football brain than Rafael maybe that and being more experienced. Hes a great squad player to have, very useful.

1778~~~
Shaw/Rafael could comfortably play in a back 4, but Young/Valencia are better suited to 352 where its not as vital to be fabulous defensively and being able to beat a man is more important.
I think we should play 433 and stick to it - but wtfdik. Also Young is better defensively than some here are making out - he's actually pretty switched on, which was surprising to me.

1779~~~
What exactly are you basing this on?

1780~~~
Their performances as wing-backs. What else would I base it on?

Although, to be fair, it's also based on seeing Evra look so out of depth on the wing too.

1781~~~
Agreed with Pogue, there is one major difference between Wingbacks and fullbaks is that wingbacks have to create space via dribbling whereas fullbacks create spaces by creating overloads, one is clever running the other clever dribbling, Shaw and Rafael are adept at the former not the latter, they won't make good wingbacks.

1782~~~
Just imagine if this thread was made to discuss James Wilson and not wingbacks and Rafael vs Valencia comparisons.

1783~~~

1784~~~
Agree totally but if the forwards aren't getting supply then it affects them, Wilson needs service from these guys and stats are showing he's not getting it. 
<a class="username" data-user="84350, @bishblaize" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84350/">@bishblaize</a> of course there is a worry going with a back four containing two wingers but something's going to give against Southampton anyway. We've functioned before today with Smalling or Jones outside the CB's and as pointed out, our defense isn't actually the problem.
We need to get the ball into our forwards and start finishing teams off. 
We've personnel now available who can create from the middle, Herrera, Di Maria, Rooney has pace power and trickery, I feel sure our forwards will get more service with a 3 like that. 
Wilson may get to sit out as he's in there to add pace but with Di Maria and even Rooney it injects that anyway.

1785~~~
You're all going to eat humble pie. Look at our team, even Falcao, a world class striker has hardly made an impression. People were calling for RVP's head before his last four goals (in one game he only managed 13 touches of the ball).

None of our forwards have looked good this season and they've all struggled to see much of the ball. LVG instructed Falcao to drop deep in the second half against Yeovil FFS! If those seasoned players are getting less touches of the ball than forwards from opposing teams how easy do you think it is for a teenager coming into the team?

He has been tidy in possession every time he's seen the ball, im not making that up, you only need to watch games more closely. How harsh of you luckyspurs to criticise the chances he's creating when United's midfield has barely been creating chances in general.

1786~~~
Great strikers make meals out of scraps.  James hasn't done that yet, but it's still early days.

1787~~~
352 is clearly not the way forward. We lined up with 5 fecking defenders against Yeovil Town for heaven's sake! The 442 diamond has been easily the best system we have had this season, and we provided the best attacking stuff we have played thus far.

I said in another thread about a month ago that I think Di Maria is the difference between us winning and playing well. Him staying fit will be key. Without him, we are laboured and methodical. We could really do with a '21st century' striker in the team. Hopefully Wilson becomes good enough to be that guy.

1788~~~
Average per 5 full games (450 minutes)

Welbeck - 140 touches - 16 shots on target or chances created
Kane - 150 touches - 14 shots on target or chances created
Ings - 120 touches - 12 shots on target or chances created
Berahino - 100 touches - 10 shots on target or chances created
Wilson - 100 touches - 3 shots on target or chances created

Wilson's not had much of the ball, but he's hardly doing anything with it.

1789~~~
While that stat is great, the touches could be near the half way line.

1790~~~
Yeah. We need stat of touches in offensive third if not in penalty box.

1791~~~
Those are useful stats, probably more useful than others might give them credit for.  It's very unlikely that more than a few of those touches were near the center circle.

Still, I think you have to look at a footballer in the position of James Wilson qualitatively, not quantitatively.  He's not going to enjoy the quality of play around him that RvP and Falcao will, quite appropriately so, and when he does come United have typically been sitting deep to defend a lead (could be wrong about that, though).   In any event he's still very young -- obviously -- and unless your name is Messi, Ronaldo or Rooney you're not going make a massive impact in a side (that's struggling to begin with) in a top league when you're 19 years old.

1792~~~
Well Januzaj did but yea, it is very rare and as a striker it's more difficult, especially in a side struggling to create clear chances, even for top strikers like RVP and Falcao.

1793~~~
<i><b>Who has been the best player in training of late?</b>
"I’d say James Wilson. He’s such a threat in terms of he’s always looking to run in behind. He is very quick and his finishing, while I wouldn’t say it’s surprised me, it’s just the consistency and how hard he strikes the ball and how well too. He’s been very good for a lot of this season in training and I think it’s only a matter of time before we really see him make a big impact."</i>
                                                                                            - Chris Smalling in his recent interview

1794~~~
But in some games he played full back.

1795~~~
Really need to see him get a proper go in a creative setup.

Either he's been used as a sub out wide chasing back, or as a late sub when the team been sitting back or the game over or used as a sort of deep striker in 3-5-2 system where we barely create much anyway. All this has now affected his confidence a bit too.

1796~~~
Yeah, agree with all of that. The timing for him to step up to the first team couldn't be worse but better sooner than later that's for sure. Hope this doesn't affect his confidence much and he will smash some goals for us. Needs desperately goal to start him up and with Herrera and di María coming back he may flourish now but obviously will wait for his chance over Falcao.. Even tho Van Gaal once showed he can play him as he provides that speed and balance in attack, which is useless when he hasn't got any support tho and the only thing he does is press the defenders or chase back to help defending..

Anyway I don't think he did much worse last game than for example Falcao and over some past games than even Persie who is quite poor this season too apart his two good games, so I don't get this criticism, the freshly 19 years old given such inadequate stick. It's actually funny to see some post about him..

1797~~~
I've been disappointed with Wilson because of the hype he got from others after his youth performances, just hasn't seemed to be that impressive. But the service our strikers get is poor so it is hard to really judge him. Needs to play in a system that actually consistently creates chances.

1798~~~
Smalling and McNair all said the same thing about him but people believe they know better than the two defenders who were up against him in training...

1799~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">
Fortunately we don't judge players based on what their team-mates say about them. Two young players in a team praising another young player; not exactly unheard of. 

No-one praised Macheda, Diouf, King, Rossi, Ebanks-Blake, Campbell, Hernandez or Welbeck in the past? They were all judge harshly and fairly by their team-mates, who weren't in any way trying to relieve the pressure on them by recent poor performances. 

Welbeck on Smalling (when Vidic and Ferdinand were still at the club)
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)"><b><i>"I would have to say Chris Smalling is the most difficult to get past in training. He’s one of our fastest players and can rival most of the forwards for pace. He also reads the game really well and is always in the right place at the right time, clearing up any danger. I’m just glad that I get to play with him for both United and England. I’d hate to play against him!"</i></b></span></span>
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">
Smalling on Rooney (2 months ago)</span></i>
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)"><b><i>"He's our talisman up there. When you've got him you pretty much know you are going to start the game 1-0 ahead because he's going to get a goal. His record is tremendous and to have that sort of pace and the width around him is just brilliant."</i></b></span></span>

If you believe Rooney scores every game, Smalling is close to the perfect centre back and United have brilliant pace and width upfront, then yes, base all judgements on quotes.

Sure Ryan Mason thinks Nabil Bentaleb's brilliant and Harry Kane praises Andros Townsend. Walker probably thinks Eric Dier is top quality in training. It's extremely hard to judge until we see it on the pitch. They're all professional footballers so good enough to make millions of pounds from the sport, so they've clearly all got talent.

The quote tells you nothing you don't already know from watching the guy on his progression so far up the ladder.

1800~~~
Thse stats don't mean much, if anything at all.

In many of the games he's come when we've had no control of the game and ended up playing like a defensive winger. The only chance he's had in 11 games was the one created for himself which says it all.

1801~~~
Who judge players based on what other players say? It is just indicator that he does good despite all the stick he is given... That particular part from Smalling indicates also that Wilson impressed him from all players in the team, he could pick Falcao or anyone but he chose the 19year old..

 There is probably no people who judge him based on only the comments. It's just interesting stuff to hear that.. And maybe it's better to think that he can do much better according this interview than his late cameos in this quite dysfunctional atm, some people obviously have no time or are not interested to watch youth games so they have no clue how good this kid is going to be.. 

And I am completely sure that Rooney scores every game and Smalling is close to perfect CB and is the worst player to play against, he just needs to stay fit..

1802~~~
So..... who are we better of with then..... Wilson or Chica?

1803~~~
Just to add fuel to the fire..... would we have been better off with Chicharito or Falcao?

1804~~~
Well... Chicarito would definitely have scored more goals in the same amount of minutes.

1805~~~
Wilson over Hernandez
Falcao over Hernandez

1806~~~
Anyone think he will start today in preference to Falcao? It's definitely a possibility given that he was on the bench ahead of Falcao last weekend.

1807~~~
I think him and Falcao will play together upfront.

1808~~~
You thinking diamond with Rooney behind them?

1809~~~
Now that is something I would like to see today.

1810~~~
Possibly, nothing can be ruled out at the moment. Who's going to be dropped though? 

Yep, LVG may want to utilise his burst of speed. I'd imagine QPR will be playing a defensive game today and so far RVP and Falcao have failed when teams have deployed that tactic.

1811~~~
Think Falcao was more rested than dropped whatever Van Gaal says.

Wilson needs to be a lot more active. He's hardly got himself into a goal scoring position, aside that Stoke game, in all his minutes this season. Their are full backs who've found themselves in more goal scoring positions (though admittedly he's been played deep at times).

1812~~~
I'd like to see Carrick/Blind at the base, Di Maria the left side Herrera the right and Rooney at the tip of the diamond. With Falcao and Wilson ahead of them.

Though I'm expecting 352 again.

1813~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> get in there lad!!! deserves that goal.

1814~~~
Great cameo, along with fellaini and the change of formation he turned the game around for us. For once LVG got his subs right!

1815~~~
Doesn't do anything

1816~~~
He was very good today and finally got his goal outperformed Falcao by a mile.

1817~~~
Very good cameo. Deserved goal from Wilson!

1818~~~
So delighted. This could be a big day for him.

1819~~~
Delighted for him, was very good when he came on.

1820~~~
Deserved that goal.

1821~~~
Rather we develop him like how Spurs is doing with Kane. But, we need to cater to our world class players first who have not shown much.

Give me

4-2-2-2
De Gea
Defender
Carrick/blind - Herrera
Someone - Di maria
Rooney - Wilson/Falcao

1822~~~
Nice cameo.

1823~~~
Great game. MOTM? Between him and Blind, IMO.

1824~~~
And thats why he deserves to get gametime. Happy now?

1825~~~
Get in!! Deserved that. He's been fantastic since he came on.

1826~~~
Happy for him, well deserved goal.

1827~~~
He was great when he came on. Probably our best player today.

1828~~~
Did okay today but he needs that space to do anything. Glad he got the goal, well taken.

1829~~~
He's gonna be a special player for us, great talent!  We just need to find the right formation and XI to suit our strikers.

1830~~~
So happy for him. He deserved that goal.

1831~~~
Good game and nice composure for the goal. Could easily have had a couple of assists too. Nice seeing some pace in our attack.

1832~~~
His pace is really fantastic, huge quality. That strike before the goal was pretty hard too.

1833~~~
Pleased he got his goal. Brought some pace to the attack.

1834~~~
Falcao probably died a bit inside when Wilson scored. Could have ramifications going forward as Wilson was fantastic in his cameo today.

1835~~~
Played well, good goal

1836~~~
Booyah. Well deserved goal for him, hope it will do his confidence wonders!

1837~~~
gif of his goal? I got up from my seat and missed it

1838~~~
Really good cameo from him today. Well done lad.

1839~~~
Did great when he came on. The difference in having a striker with pace who takes people on is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Need to stop pandering to the needs of big egos and think of the team (which surprisingly is LVG's mantra)

1840~~~
He is fast as fook this lad.

1841~~~
A better player than Falcao and suits us more than Falcao. The one thing LVG has gotten right so far.

1842~~~
Disagree. He needs service and support just as much. The difference was the formation behind him as much as anything else.

When he fills out and bulks up a bit he'll get so much better as well. Still a baby

1843~~~
Lovely finish from him.

1844~~~
Think he'll start against Leicester next week.

1845~~~
Great finish from him, worked his ass of when he came on, constant pressure paid off.

1846~~~
Yep, should be sold to Hull or QPR
<span style="color: #ffffff">Im joking (just in case)</span>

1847~~~
I'd like to see Wilson and Falcao start a few games together, with Di Maria in behind.

1848~~~
Really nice cameo followed up by his first goal of the season.

1849~~~
Must say iv been very critical of Wilson recently but today he was excellent in his cameo. He wanted the ball, created space, worked hard and was lightening. Well done lad.

1850~~~
Watch on my grainy stream I thought it was Di Maria creating the first Falcao break chance. He is at least fast as Di Maria IMO.

1851~~~
Worked well with Falcao IMO

1852~~~
Unlucky not to get an assist as well... Gutted for Falcao but pleased for Wilson.

1853~~~
I still think he disappears when the opponents are in place defensively. Looks like a boy against men for now. But a good talent, just needs to get used to senior football.

1854~~~
Very happy for him, deserved the goal. Still a bit lightweight and pushed around too easily but troubled QPR's defence a lot more than most of our players today.

1855~~~
Good game and showed the hunger to run and hassle the opposition. Could have got two assists too if Falcao was more clinical.

1856~~~
His strength is let down at times, once that is sorted and if he stays injury free no doubt  he'd be class.

His instinct to get the rebound was nice and good shots twice.

1857~~~
So delighted for him - I think he's vital for us in lieu of Danny Welbeck.

gives us something different with his pace and willingness to run at/behind defenders just like Danny did - hopefully the big difference is Wilson is an out and out finisher and already shows the composure necessary to inspire confidence in 1 on 1 situations.

We've already seen RVP and Rooney fail to create any kind of effective striking relationship - our summer answer? Bring in a very expensive totally similar, slow, ageing, knee injury recovering striker. The experiment has not worked.

1858~~~
Very good appearance from him, I wasn't much of a fan of him but he really shows what he brings to United.

Could have easily got 2 more assists too.

1859~~~
Not many 19 year olds manage any type of consistency tbf. Especially at big clubs. Give him two years and he could be a serious player for us...

1860~~~
Was excellent when he come on. I guess that's why Van Gaal played Di Maria up to, to kind of replicate what Wilson did today with his pace and ability to run with the ball, but what he has is that made us improve was better hold up play and was constantly competing with QPR's backline. Worked incredibly hard and deserved his goal.

1861~~~
Better than Falcao...erm....ok....

Didnt see the game and sure he can develop into a brilliant player. Maybe he also suits us better but there is no way you can call him a better player than Falcao

1862~~~
Falcao should have scored 2 or 3 times today, I dont know why it didnt happen for him today but you have these kind of games. Despite not scoring I tought Falcao also looked good today, he looked beter than RVP looked most games just missing the goals today. We all know how good his finishing can be if he is at his best. So would be a bit silly to keep him out of the next game just on the basis of not scoring today.

I want to see Falcao and Wilson as striking partnership more often and way less of RVP upfront !

And obviously 4 at the back and a midfield of Rooney Di Maria/ Mata, Fellaini and Carrick/Herrera

1863~~~
Coming on a sub mostly too. He is doing alright I think.

1864~~~
He was in space on shoulder of last defender twice where a decent through ball and he would have had a chance.

Rooney passed the other direction once and Di Maria just hit a soft shot once.

Rest of our players at times don't pass to him enough.

1865~~~
For United Wilson is clearly better. Couldn't give a toss what Falcao did before.

1866~~~
How many times do you see a player have a shot, it get saved and then the player be quick enough to react beat his man and finish? He's very sharp but still developing his strength. He was more direct today which was important. He could have done more in other games but it's unfortunate he played well and Falcao was having an off day in front of goal. Hopefully next game they'll both be on form.

1867~~~
Yay, we love you again. For now.

1868~~~
Agree.Falcao has been good except for missing easy chances which is uncharacteristic for him.Wilson and Falcao up top is a good solution at the moment for me.

1869~~~
You talking nonsense in this thread also lol

1870~~~
He did very well when he came on, when we're leading and there are going to be counter attacks he's very useful.

1871~~~
Really glad to see Wilson finally getting on the scoresheet. I hope it is a case of now that he has his first, the goals will start flowing regularly for him. Quite a few of our most dangerous chances came from him as well. Falcao narrowly missed two good balls across.

Having him on the pitch, and getting in behind the defenders is far more dangerous than having two slow players paired up top together. If we insists on playing with two strikers, I'd like I to play Wilson and the one of RVP or Falcao. Wilson may not be as good a forward as them, but he brings far more team balance to a team that lacks pace and movement.

1872~~~
He struggles to use his pace and for strength in a packed game, but even in that create shooting chances for him and he is quite lethal.  Not really had it till now.

1873~~~
Played very good when he came on. Pleased he got himself a goal.

1874~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1875~~~
Not as much as you. Missing chances now count as unlucky lol

1876~~~
Need to get Herrera behind Wilson and I'd put money on it he'd score a shit load of goals just from good runs with pace.

1877~~~
Did well when he came on, working the channels and creating chances, glad he grabbed a goal and should start vs Cambridge.

1878~~~
So happy for him. Worked so hard. His first shot wasn't himself (too much time thinking) but second shot from rebound was his natural self. Cool finish.

1879~~~
What I want to see is Falcao 90 minutes in the game like today with an actual functioning formation at his back, not that shit 3 defenders and 5 midfielders bullshit Van Gaal is trying to shove down our piehole. I want to see him play 5 or 6 games 90 minutes in a 4-4-2 preferably linked up with Wilson.

If he isnt the beast (or atleast turning into the beast) that he was at Porto, Atletico and even Monaco by then and keeps struggling to finish his chances than I'd say fine put him on the bench bring Van Persie back, dont buy him and let him go back to Monaco and buy another striker in the summer with the money that was reserved for Falcao. But if he does get to his best again and could play like he did today in the second half or beter but with just scoring those chances the way he did at his previous clubs (could have easily put 3 in the net today for example) than buy him and make him the main striker and when we play with two strikers link Wilson or Rooney up with him and use Van Persie to sub him.

1880~~~
Great energy in the 2nd half and really played well

1881~~~
Was fantastic today, glad he capped it off with a goal as well.

1882~~~
He still needs a lot of work, but his pace causes so many more problems for defenses than the likes of RVP or Falcao do.

1883~~~
he had a really good cameo. very good impact, and got his goal. extremely happy for the lad.

1884~~~
Was really impressive in his cameo. Him and Falcao looked to combine quite well together a few times, as well. 

It makes such a difference having a striker with pace who can stretch the pitch - which presumably was what LVG was trying by playing Di Maria there. The key problem being that Di Maria looks completely lost there and is so much more effective when attacking players from midfield.

1885~~~
He is beter than Falcao because he had his first good game this year were he wasnt totaly invisible and scored his first goal in the entire season. Makes sense.

1886~~~
It happens and if he keeps getting these chances and hopefully more watch this guy go. He looks much better than RVP this season for me.

1887~~~
Yep Akash has obviously got no time for Falcao and is talking drivel to be fair <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1888~~~
Best half he's had this season.

1889~~~
Unlike Falcao, he has a very legitimate excuse of a)Not playing as much and quite often when we were seeing games out and b )Having zero chances to work with. In fact this was first chance he's had this season not created by himself.

It's not the first time this has happened. If you want to keep your hand in the sand feel free.

1890~~~
Di Maria doesnt work as a striker simple as that.

If you want to play 2 strikers you need one with pace, he had Robben in the dutch squad to make his gameplan work if he plays two slow strikers like Falcao and Van Persie upfront together it will never work. 

The thing is I tought Wilson linked up with falcao far beter than he ever linked up with Van Persie so I'd really like to see those two playing for the next couple of games.

-----------DDG-------------
----Jones-------Rojo-----
Valencia--Carrick----Blind
-----Fellaini--Rooney-----
---------Di Maria-----
----Wilson-----Falcao----

For the next couple of games for me

1891~~~
Very good cameo, needs to put on some muscle, but this kid has potential

1892~~~
I really like his confidence. Others might have laid it off to the more established player instead of taking on the shot like he did. Glad he scored from the rebound as it means he won't get criticized like he did after his chance against Stoke, which I thought was unfair.

1893~~~
He just has 'it'. Really really like the lad.

1894~~~
His composure when on goal, skill, and good burst of pace, he has shown glimpses of them. Combined with his height and good body frame, I can see we have a gem in hand. But then, I was so ecstatic about Welbeck potential, too.

1895~~~
A much much much better centre-forward than Di Maria. Delighted for him today.

1896~~~
Have I mentioned that I love that kid? 

He's a big wet sack of 'it'.

1897~~~
Van Gaal seemed very pleased for him.

1898~~~

1899~~~
Unlucky not to get a couple of assists. He was absolutely right in those positions to cross unlike the one he got stick for. Took his goal like someone who was full of confidence but we need to get him facing the defender more often because he knows how to score goals

1900~~~
Can this guy kick on and become our main man? Van Persie, Rooney and Falcao are getting on and can't see any of them being here in 5 years or so.

1901~~~
Nice to see him get on the scoresheet. Deserved it.

1902~~~
Another Premier League experienced gained by not even being loaned.

Goals like this one may unlock the potential, further.

1903~~~
His best game this season. Delighted for him, I hope he gets more chances, maybe even a start in the Cup.

1904~~~
I was really happy to see him going in with a lot more purpose today and scoring that goal. I hope things will kick off from there for him.

1905~~~
Hopefully he builds on from this. He has a good instinct already for his age and speed which can help get at defenders. He's been unfortunate that many of his appearances have come at the end of games when the tempo has dropped, or when we're hanging on so he can't really play with freedom. Or he's been on the wing. But he has natural ability in front of goal. I like how he went for the shot twice himself rather than letting it fizzle out, or passing to Falcao or Di Maria.

1906~~~
He did a bunch of positive things and showed great composure and pretty good pace, but did anyone else feel like he walked around when we were in possession? He doesn't need to be constantly coming to the ball, but there were times he could have made a run in behind and just didn't. Looked like Balotelli has at Liverpool.

1907~~~
Nice finish from young Wilson today.

1908~~~
Wouldn't mind a front three of him, Rooney and Januzaj against Oxford.

1909~~~
I get the feeling that he's playing a bit under instruction and wary of that so not playing his natural game. He usually plays as the furthermost striker running the channels and looking for the balls behind the defence, but with Falcao there he's playing a more withdrawn role with defensive responsibilities.

1910~~~
Very promising showing today. Best this season from Wilson I think. 

He's a bit lightweight but once he finishes growing, and Ronaldo's himself in the gym, he could be a real star.

1911~~~
Wilson and Dybala with mix of two a bit more experienced strikers sounds like a well balanced attacking formation.

There's a chance and hopefully plan for that.

1912~~~
What would you play against Cambridge? I know, they all look alike. Blazers and boats and that.

1913~~~
I'm going to try play it off as a joke and walk away. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1916~~~
Good cameo and glad he scored. Think he needed a goal. Wouldn't be against seeing him get a start.

1917~~~
Good performance today. Why does he always have wrong jump timings when he tries to head the ball?

1918~~~
It's not timing, he just jumps to try and look like he is doing something. He doesn't fancy the physical battle in that situation (and really, there is no point him trying to out muscle a big defender), so it would look stupid just standing there while the other guy jumps. A lot of strikers of younger players do it.

1919~~~
He might also be under instructions to focus on sprinting, since he's mainly out there for his pace. It's not a major worry yet, but our off the ball movement has been so poor for a while now, so I'm always concerned by it.

1920~~~
We have three legit talents in him, Januzaj and Periera. I hope all three are given a fair chance to make it here.

1921~~~
Put Rooney instead of Falcao and Herrera/Mata in Rooney's position and we are golden.

1922~~~
I posted this thing I noticed earlier in the thread. He should make a better effort. He misjudges it by such a margin that I am starting to doubt his ability to perceive depth <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1923~~~
We need to worry about making top four this season and kicking on next, but let's worry about 5 years time.

1924~~~
Thought of the day, Wilson & Januzaj should be our new Ronaldo & Rooney, going into next year and beyond.
Sir Alex would have begun buliding a team around those type of youth talents.

1925~~~
Can't see it happening for Periera. He should have been out on loan this season.

1926~~~
That goal should settle down the lad, although he never shows any nervousness anyway. Well taken finish!

Correct.

1927~~~
You can certainly say that Wilson brings something different to the side. In a team of skilled but shooting-shy and sluggish players - you have this rocket who pulls the trigger every time he gets the chance.

But James - please learn to jump with a bit more accuracy. His ability to miss-time every ball he jumped for, was a bit....embarassing to say the least <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Lovely goal though - and I want you playing regularly.

1928~~~
This lad is lightening - fastest striker we've had since... can't think of any faster strikers really - anyone? He's fairly composed on the ball as well and seems competent with both feet. I've been less than impressed with him earlier, but today he was quite impressive.

1929~~~
Delighted he scored at the end, loved his pace in the match.

1930~~~
Cole?

1931~~~
Really glad he scored yesterday! He was obviously buzzing during the interviews, hopefully he should kick on now because he is a talented lad who can cause problems for the opposition and score for fun. He just needs a bit more game time!

1932~~~
Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.

1933~~~
You are right. Cole was very fast. Other than him,we haven't been blessed with fast strikers.

1934~~~
Rooney and Tevez were pretty explosive at their best, no?

1935~~~
I'm really happy for the lad, he deserved it as he works hard. I hope he bets a few like yesterday and show our so called senior players how it's done!

1936~~~
Chicharito says "Hola!  "

1937~~~
Obviously not the general view, but I thought he was his usual ineffective self when he came on.  I fully expected him to miss, I was screaming at him to pass it after his previous attempts at going it alone. 

tbf, he took his goal well, but I am yet to be convinced.

1938~~~
Yeah he almost set up two and scored one. Is it any wonder you were wrong that he scored?

1939~~~
He had a brilliant cameo. He took players on, stretched their back line, and played Falcao in twice. He was well within his rights to take the shot, and it was hit with some venom.

1940~~~
Welbeck is very quick. Deceptively so, with those enormous strides he takes.

1941~~~
Think he's probably quicker than Welbeck.

1942~~~
Cole, Yorke, Rooney, Tevez, Bellion, Saha, Campbell, Welbeck, Hernandez off the top of my head.

1943~~~
I'm glad Wilson had such a good cameo, because it increases the chances of him starting the upcoming games (solving the pace issue in the process and allowing Di Maria to play in a more natural position).

1944~~~
Pretty sure he is.

1945~~~
Quite a few. Bellion was lightening, but never part of our first XI, nor was Campbell, also a very quick player mind you. Yorke was never that fast, was he?

Saha was probably the fastest of the bunch, rapid when he first came to the club, but then he lost quite a lot of pace due to injuries. 

Hernandez probably follows, but he was never fast running with the ball. Wilson is very capable, more so than Welbeck who probably have similar outright pace. Rooney was also very fast when he broke through, but always lacked a little acceleration compared to the most rapid - Tevez was always slower than Rooney.

So we used to have quite a few fast strikers, but we've been slow-ish going forward for some time now; aging Rooney, RVP, Berbatov. Wilson will inject quite a lot of needed pace to our attack.

Ridiculous how LVG played ADM as striker because he wants pace up front and then loaned Falcao when he already had Rooney and RVP; sounds a little stupid to me.

1946~~~
True, but Wilson is surely faster off the mark and with the ball?

1947~~~
Rooney was always faster than Tevez, imo, but Tevez probably quicker off the mark. Neither were true sprinters like Wilson seems to be though. However, did you see the sprint of Onouha? That man is still seriously fast. Wasn't he a 100m runner in his teens?

1948~~~
Seems to be getting tougher. First noticed it in the fa cup game.

1949~~~
Don't praise him too much, luckyspurs will soon be here with all his stats to show how he will never be as good as x y z

1950~~~
Yeah, Nedum is fecking ridiculous. Beat Di Maria a few times for pace on complete fifty/fifty long balls. I think he's actually rated as the fastest CB on FIFA. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1951~~~
We've had a lot of fast strikers. One thing James has is what looks like an ability to glide past players. Hope he keeps  on improving.

1952~~~
Quite possibly. I wouldn't have thought there was much in it if so. Welbeck is decent off the mark, but Wilson might be a bit quicker. I would predict Welbeck has a higher top speed, but again, it's probably marginal.

1953~~~
Yeah, Welbeck was pretty quick when he fully got into stride but i think Wilson't acceleration off the mark is quicker.

Plus Wilson can carry the ball comfortably at pace. Welbeck didn't have that ability as much.

1954~~~
That would be a shame. The kid has talent and is a regular feature on the bench. I think VG will give Periera a chance if he remains patient and keeps working hard.

1955~~~
The sad fact is that he's not the type of midfielder Van Gaal is looking for right now. If he was Herrera would be playing ahead of him anyway. There's at best two positions for him to play in as he's not a DM and he's not going to see any minutes as a 10 with Mata, Rooney, Herrera and Januzaj all ahead of him for that role. So as a CM he fighting with Rooney, Herrera, Carrick and Fellaini. 

Currently we are a dysfunctional team trying to work out what's best to get enough points for UCL qualification. That's no place for a kid to be getting his first few caps. It's different to the days when Ferguson could throw in a youngster to play alongside 10 other seasoned pros in a well oiled machine.

1956~~~
Who knows what Van Gaal is looking for right now. I read this morning that Herrera has some timekeeping issues and that is the reason for his absence. Periera may not get starts for the first team, but he can still get minutes at the end of games we are winning or in the cups. He needs to be patient and bide his time.

Wilson, Blackett and McNair have got caps this season, the Fergie and 10 pros statement doesn't make any sense. Periera will get opportunities too if he shows in training that he deserves them. He needs to stick around as this shit on a stick system won't last for long. Whenever we shift too 433/4231, under the main "philosophy", he'll get minutes.

1957~~~
He seems very professional, while it could be true I think that's the least possible reason for it IMO. Ever since his court business he's been getting shafted.

1958~~~
It's his calmness in front of goal which I love about him. He does not rush or miskicks the ball like Welbeck. He reminds me a lot of how Rudd used to be in front of goal. Just never got phased while going for goal no matter how many people were around him.

1959~~~
Hes out of contract in the summer, I doubt he will be here next season. He could have got minutes vs Yoevil but didn't, if he gets 0 minutes vs Cambridge he'll be leaving. Its a shame as I thought he did very well when he came on vs MK Dons

1960~~~
I'd like to see him played alone up top against Cambridge.  Want the other players forced to give him service and show what he can do.

1961~~~
Why would you expect him to miss? He's brilliant with finishing. You should be more concerned with the other parts of his game at first team level thus far, not his finishing.

1962~~~
Haha, this is exactly me opinion about Falcao.

1963~~~
Call him 'the Golden Boy' because he's going to win games for us. He's starting to look comfortable out there, personally I'd start him over Falcao right now, though I'd rather see Rooney up top alone than either. 

I'm sure that's not the safe choice, but I don't think Wilson has anything holding him back, he just needs the minutes.

1964~~~
Is it true his contract expires at the end of this season?

1965~~~
Signed a new one last season or last summer I believe.

1966~~~
Shame

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ghdPS6zLoHI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1967~~~
Good. Thanks. Never believe what you read on twitter.

1968~~~
State of that pitch. Would never see that in "Modern Football"

1969~~~
I hope he keeps progressing, but hes done nothing to deserve a start ahead of Falcao just yet.

1970~~~
He and Rooney is the only strikers partnership that can work (with the current bunch of attackers). Wayne likes rapid partners.

1971~~~
Never heard Colleen described as that before <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1972~~~
Well, he's shown he can outpace the entire opposition, Falcao can't do that. He created two wonderful chances which is not something Falcao was able to do last game. 

But I accept I'm biased, part of my interest in playing him is to get his career rolling. I feel the same way about Januzaj, di Maria might be a better winger but I want to see Januzaj start on the wing more than I want to see di Maria there. Besides the fact di Maria is wasted on the wing.

1973~~~
I'm with you on that one.

I have not been impressed by Falcao, he may have better movement and finishing but we really need to start looking for options outside the fantastic four of similar player.

1974~~~
I'm prepared to write off the first half of his season because he was coming back from a major injury. I'm hoping we see the old Falcao again, or it will be a risk to keep him beyond the season loan.

Honestly I'd put Rooney up top before either of them, and Herrera back into midfield.

1975~~~
Thats brilliant but Falcao has 3 goals and 3 assists, and tbh apart from his finishing actually played quite well last game.
I hope Wilson gets the start vs Cambridge, and I also agree that I would rather Wilson kicked on than Falcao, but he hasn't quite earned the place ahead of him just yet.
Wilson is a good threat coming on of the bench when the game is stretched so he can use his pace, but he has started a few games and been anonymous so we need to ease him in. Would be awesome though if by the end of the season he was our starting forward and was banging them in.

1976~~~
According to Andy Mitten on play up. James Wilson last week took Wayne Rooney's long held title for lifting weights with his legs. Coaches at Carrington are amazed by the young striker's strength, aswell as his speed and skill.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://news.playup.com/articles/3825405-pay-up-and-play-up" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://news.playup.com/articles/3825405-pay-up-and-play-up</a>

1977~~~
Wow. That's amazing. And him looking like he's not even started filling out yet. If he can add some real power to his game he'll be quite the handful!

1978~~~
Interesting, he doesn't exactly have that 'thunderthighs' look. Then again, that ridiculous burst of pace must come from somewhere, and he's got a vicious shot in his locker too.

1979~~~
To be fair Falcao's job is to score,  so it's no small thing that he's struggling to finish. That's pretty much the reason I wouldn't worry about starting Wilson, his finish right now is probably as sharp or sharper than Falcao's. 

But if I was van Gaal I'm sure I would try to play Falcao into form now that he's fully fit.

1980~~~
Play them both. It will be good for the both of them.

1981~~~
This lad is what Manchester United is all about. I know we shouldn't hype a player who has played so few games for the first team, but i can't help getting a bit excited! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Hope he goes on to have a great career for this club.

1982~~~
Most people don't get their strength/speed from muscle mass, more from fast twitch muscles. He certainly seems the type that will have fast twitch, a little like Messi/Aguero too.

1983~~~
I feel the same way about him. I don't think he should be a nailed on starter yet, not by a long shot, but I wonder how long it would take for him to make himself a (semi)regular starter, even though he kinda is that right now. Thats probably also because both Falcao and RvP are missing their shooting boots.

1984~~~
James Wilson's first half vs Cambridge:

20' I think this was his first touch, neat control and lay off

21' Straight after his first touch, similar again

27' Simple ball rolled to him, tried to control it but rolled under his foot.  Lost ball.

30' Controls ball just inside Cambridge half, turns, loses it.  Cambridge attack, win corner, should have scored (ball blocked on line and then headed over from a metre out.

38' Gets a touch at the edge of the box on a breaking ball, tries to turn and is pushed off it.

That's it.  No contribution.  He may go on to score a hat trick in the second half, but he's essentially just not done enough so far.  Versus Cambridge.  No movement, nothing.  He wouldn't get a kick in a stampede.  This is all too regular an occurrence for him, this isn't a knee jerk post after a quiet first half.  I am well aware that we've been poor in general and he's not got much support etc etc.  He just doesn't affect games nearly enough, just no impact whatsoever.

He's not good enough to be a United player.

1985~~~
Such insights.Brilliant.

1986~~~
Nothing like writing off an 18 year old with about 5 starts in his career <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ffs.

1987~~~
As per usual, our strikers are the least culpable for our direness.

Weird that people seem intent on singling them out in games like this.

1988~~~
He's certainly all about pace for now. Doesn't impact games much, if at all. I don't watch the reserves but he's not ready for this amount of senior football. We should limit his playing time more.

1989~~~
Throw in all the 'FFS' you like.  He's just not good enough.  Giggs (and others too) have talked him up, he just doesn't contribute enough and has not in any game he's played - even the couple of games he's scored in.

And it's not just about him - the fact that LVG continues to throw him in ahead of the likes of Januzaj is baffling.  Januzaj is clearly ahead of him, clearly the better prospect, Wilson just doesn't deserve the game time he's getting.

That's all/

1990~~~
Followed by an insightful reply.

1991~~~
Pathetic post.

Strikers need service.That's all.

Januzaj and Wilson are different players.

1992~~~
Except he scored in his last game. On top of that what is the comparison with Januzaj all about? He is not a Striker and Janazaj has played more minutes this season than Wilson

1993~~~
Needs to step it up in this half. If not take him off and bring on RVP.

1994~~~
What's RVP going to do with no service? That's the issue here.

1995~~~
Yep, a fair point.  My point is more on the back of his impact in every game he's played so far - I just don't see it in him.  I don't see him making it here.

The above was my first post in this thread, probably one of the few posts where I've criticised a United player on here - certainly a young United player.  I think part of my issue with how poor he's been has been that he's got in Januzaj's way in terms of game time in a lot of games this season, and I see Januzaj as the far better prospect.  Frustrating.

Hope he scores now.

1996~~~
Players like RVP can create chances out of nothing.

1997~~~
Not true, one of the biggest myths on here.  A striker with no service can touch the ball more than 5 times in 45 minutes of football.  Strikers can and should make things happen, not just hang around waiting for service.

1998~~~
FFS <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1999~~~
Not if they don't have the ball.

2000~~~
I think this is Januzaj's first appearance since November.  In the meantime, I can't think of too many games that Wilson hasn't been involved in, in terms of appearances and named on the bench.  If you don't think Wilson's involvement has hampered Januzaj's then fair enough, I couldn't disagree more.  Regardless of what their respective traditional positions are.

2001~~~
Wilson has usually been playing due to Falcao/RVP being injured.
I don't seen how Wilson is hampering Januzaj since he isn't going to play as a Striker.

2002~~~
That's an extremely easy post to make, but not an easy one to discuss.  I take it you have a different opinion?

2004~~~
Poor today

EDIT: Yes I know he aint getting service, but when hes got the ball his touch has been off

2005~~~
He looks extremely frustrated in this game. Don't blame him, service is just non-existent.

2006~~~
Very peculiar. Some on here love having a dig at our strikers despite the fact that errrrmmm they get absolutely no decent service.

2007~~~
Hasn't been his day today but deserved to start after his good cameo over the past weekend.

2008~~~
At the moment, I think coming off the bench is best for him. Not ready to start for the first team IMO.

2009~~~
:-D

2010~~~
My opinion is thats utter nonsense

2011~~~
Can't be good for his confidence that any game he has started, the service has been particularly shite.

2012~~~
There's also a peculiarity that some people kind of exempt our attacking players from any blame for their lack of effect in, you know, attacking.

To be a striker for United, you need to be able to make chances for yourself.  You don't just wander up front, hang around the last line of defence and walk off afterwards saying, the lads created nothing.

If Wilson was showing short and chasing loose ends and making runs and working, like Falcao has shown in patches tonight, that would be something.  He offered nothing, zero, zilch.  Incredibly disappointing.

2013~~~
Are you watching the match? He has come deep to try win the ball because the service is so wank. Obviously strikers thrive off of good service and that's pretty obvious. I certainly wouldn't criticise Wilson tonight at all. The service isn't just bad, it's literally non-existent.

2014~~~
The best strikers don't just rely on service.  I think it's a nonsense to suggest they do.

It may be a wider point.  Wilson reminds me of a Michael Owen-type striker - fast goal scorer, relatively light but will stick chances away.  I think that the modern game has moved away from this type of striker being successful - for me, an out-and-out striker needs to be able to bully defences too, a la Diego Costa, Drogba a couple years back, maybe include Bony in this category if he can kick on at the highest level.  I don't see the Wilson type making it at a club like United these days, at least not unless he can start contributing way, way more in general play.  Maybe similar to how Bojan didn't make it at Barca.

2015~~~
Has he?  I've listed the amount of times he's touched the ball in the first half, though admittedly solely from my own recollection.  When else has he come deep and contributed?

I'm not just talking about tonight either, more of a wider point with Wilson.  Just doesn't do enough.

2016~~~
That's just bollox. He's 18/19 FFS. How can you write him off? I would be far more worried if he were missing chances but the fact is, he hasn't been getting any service. His strengths lie in his finishing, not being involved in the build-up. Not every striker is Costa or Drogba, there are different styles of strikers.

2017~~~
What part is bollox?  I've replied to your specific assertion that he has come deep tonight due to poor service, when he clearly hasn't done this at all.  You're switching point to me writing him off.

I have said he won't make it at United, and as things stand right here and now that's my opinion.  I am more than happy to be proved wrong, in fact I'd be thrilled to be wrong.

But I have major concerns about his game in general to be honest.  I don't think there's enough in his locker, and even if his strengths lie in his finishing, I'm not sure he's the type of player to find himself enough chances to be effective enough at that at a club as big as United.

2018~~~
I think you misinterpreted my assertion of him 'coming deep' - I was basically having a dig at how shit we have been tonight as I recall twice Wilson came back to win the ball in sheer frustration: he was booked on one such occasion. That's a dig at the lack of service he has received tonight and his obvious frustrations. I have alluded to the fact that he is more of a 'fox in the box' striker and doesn't strike me as someone who would be involved in the build-up play; ala Hernandez.

How you can disregard that he literally had no service tonight is staggering? There is no way he can be critised based on tonight's performance. At least he has an excuse, he's a young lad with not much first team football under his belt. What's Di Maria's of Flacao's excuses tonight?

There is no way anyone can make any definitive call on whether or not he is or isn't good enough at this point. I would love to see him start in a match when we create actual, you know, chances.

Fwiw, I think the bollocks part is your assertion that modern day strikers all need to play like Drogba or Costa. You do realise that, they are a certain kind of striker, right? Not every striker is blessed with their physicality and obviously will play to their strengths.

2019~~~
Only noticed him when he was booked. Saw Falcao a lot though he was poor too. Doesn't get on the end of enough chances. Must be movement; can't solely be the supply he's getting.

2020~~~
First - his booking didn't come from him coming deep out of frustration.  He miscontrolled a ball, went after it and took a man down.  It was his fault, and nothing to do with him coming deep, or trying to link play up.

Second, your mention of Hernandez probably reinforces my point.  I don't think a player like Hernandez can make it at a club like United any more, I just don't see it happening.  Same goes for Wilson, I see him as a very similar kind of player.  If United were willing to let Hernandez go, then I struggle to see how Wilson will make it here.

Third, I'm not disregarding the lack of service tonight.  I'm saying that a good striker doesn't always need to rely on service to do well.  Falcao had the same lack of service, still found himself a one-on-one and had plenty of touches coming deep and getting involved.  Wilson did neither of these.  RVP came in and had a chance, same lack of service.  I'm not saying Wilson should be as good as these right now, but emphasising that lack of service alone isn't a good enough excuse for a complete lack of involvement from a player playing a central role on the pitch.

Thirdly - I'm not saying that every striker needs to be a Costa/Drogba type.  For instance, Aguero gets by alright.  I'm just saying that a fox-in-the-box striker (your words) like Wilson either needs a physical presence (a la Drogba) or needs to contribute way more outside the box.  Wilson is never going to be a Drogba type player due to his size, do you think he can be an Aguero type player?  Or do you think he can be a successful modern day Michael Owen?

Where do you see him fit in long term?  How do you see us needing to set up to fit a player like Wilson in?

Modern day football is completely different to even just 5 years ago - United are no longer going out against teams and stretching them as teams are set up to prevent exactly like that.  If we go a goal up, maybe then we can stretch play as teams come out against us, but when teams are set up to play us on the counter then a player like Wilson is just ineffective.  Is this point a stretch?  I certainly don't think so.

2021~~~
Yeah I've made my point. I'm not doing long posts all night. I disagree with you.

2022~~~
Fair enough mate.  Friday night spent posting long messages about James Wilson after a nil all draw with Cambridge is where it's at.

You'll be back.

2023~~~
Just not a match setup to get the best out of him. He needs to get the space to either run at the defence or run in behind and with Cambridge sitting so deep and so many people behind the ball he was going to have a hard time. When we went up against QPR they had to open up a bit and you can see that Wilson was able to take advantage of that as he was great in that match for me. He is just a young boy and he'll get use to being crowded out and sides sitting behind the ball like that but atm he isn't as you really don't see it in reserve football. Again I think you just have to look at the QPR match to see his talent.

Wilson isn't just a fox in the box either and I find it absurd to even suggest he is like Hernandez.

2024~~~
I just have nothing more to add. I have no firm conclusion other than he looks a promising player, to me. He wasn't in the game at all tonight as we were atrocious, absolutely atrocious. As I said, I would love to see him start in a match that we create plenty of chances in. 

I don't watch any reserve or under 18 football but the lads on here - who to be fair, seem to know their stuff - really rate this guy. Obviously he's a talent. It's way to early to make any definitive decisions on whether or not he's going to make it here. So, all in all, it's just opinion at this point.

2025~~~
Winning.

Yeah, honestly, fair enough.  I genuinely hope you're right and I'm wrong, I've no interest in being the 'I-was-right-on-the-internet' guy at the expense of a young English lad making it at United, especially a striker - we haven't had an English striker come through the ranks in too long.  I won't add anything else to this reply, I think I've made my point too.

2026~~~
Couldn't get into the game, I don't know why this surprises so many, he has virtually no experience in a true competitive environment, it will take time.

2027~~~
He's started 4 games in his whole career. Not as in, he's only started 4 United games, but he's only ever started 4 professional football matches.

To write him off already is absolutely insane.

2028~~~
The game passed him by, he's young so I'll lay off him. If he was Young though I'd tear him a new one.

2029~~~
He isn't physically ready especially in such a system when teams sit deep. You need to supply him with chances where he can be lethal and interplay to get him involved.

He is not able to create for his own in such games at senior level yet, but then so aren't any of our other forwards.

2030~~~
Who the hell promoted you?! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Yes he was bad but not as bad as your post!

2031~~~
I think right now he definitely suits when the game is more open, he struggles to get space against tight deep defence like tonight. He will learn that though in time.

2032~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2033~~~
Everyone needs time to assert themselves.

Let's see how he is in a years time

2034~~~
I like Wilson. I think he'll make it at United. I also think it's fair to say he's not quite ready. He hasn't learned how to play at this level yet. Pretty much every game he plays passes him by completely. LVG should have kept Welbeck this season and perhaps loaned Wilson out to gain some experience. As it stands he's been a bit of a passenger.

2035~~~
Good article on Wilson here - <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/f365-says/9656422/F365-Says" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football365.com/f365-says/9656422/F365-Says</a>

2036~~~
I don't think anyone can really say what he's meant to do. Drop deep now and then to touch the ball? It's difficult to judge anyone other then from deep where offense starts. No one can really expect a kid to look great in a team full of experiences players, who seem to be under the impression the last 20 odd years didn't mean much.

It's easier for a young defender to impress at times. One great header and some nice passes and that's it. When you're up top you are reliant on service and when you don't get the ball so you drop deep where it's congested and it's not really his game. We're so slow that there's always 11 men behind the ball

Unless the team look to play through you, it's very difficult but the experience will be good for him in the long run. Wilson won't turn the team around. The team have to supply the forwards and create chances and then our forwards will grow in confidence. I think most people watch the games at the minute, and know that they can fall asleep for 30 minutes and probably not miss much.

If a young Giggs came into this team, we'd be better but we'd still have problems. A young forward won't solve our problems. We need to sort out the players and the mentality of this team. We are lacking the fight at the minute and that's a team problem. We're not about to see Wilson fighting back and becoming our Messi. People are wrong to expect that.

If Wilson isn't getting many chances, it's because he's not getting much service. It's the same with Falcao and RVP. They're not getting the service. One chance a game IF they're lucky....it's not good enough. If we saw game after game, chances galore. If we saw, great crosses coming in and some fast interchanges, then we could look at the forwards but that's not the case. It's also unfair on the forwards to expect them to get so few touches because of the teams faults and tuck them away all the time. It don't happen.

Players need touches to get into the game. When they are starved of the ball all they're doing is running and getting frustrated. That is not what we want.

2037~~~
He's a good option when games are open and we can counter, but in games when the opponents have 9 men behind the ball he is useless.

2038~~~
so what the other strikers did better? Falcao was sligthly better because he dropped deep more often and very likely was told to do so as he is not as fast as wilson who was probably told that he should try to beat the line and to wait for the long balls which were totally off that day, poor kid made a lot of runs and couldn't get a single ball. Then RVP came on they parked the bus and we had more time to make accurate pass so one of our players picked him and he missed the glorious chance. I saw no big difference. If it was Will Keane he would have surely been told to drop deep also but Wilson for his speed had different instructions, last game he created 2 chances and scored one, unlike Falcao who is unable to hit the sea from the beach. 

Although I admit there is big room for improvement for Wilson in terms of ball holding, interplay and airial play BUT he is not useless, he just play different game and doesn't do much worse overall, and I am glad he has got his minutes and gain experience..

2039~~~
I don't get all the hype about this kid, he has had enough game time to show what he can offer, (probably at the expense of Januzaj & Herrera) but has done nothing to impress me. Maybe he is a victim of our 'style' or our overall poor form, but at the moment he certainly is not what we need.

2040~~~
He turned 19 a month ago, is playing in a team where were creating less chances than any time in the past 20 years and has played 564 minutes of first team football which in terms of minutes is just over 6 games and has scored 3 goals and some people are writing him off entirely. Its as if some people have never actually seen a young player starting their career before and expect teenagers to be the finished article and lead the team even when the senior players around them are struggling.

2041~~~
RvP and Falcao have hardly looked 'United class' this season, and they'd probably look just as bad if they came on for short cameos and usually in difficult situations too. 

I agree he's not looked as promising as I was hoping, but it's too early to be writing him off. Our team isn't functioning well enough at the best of times and it's unfair to look for such an inexperienced player to come off the bench and change that.

2042~~~
I'm not writing him off either, like most United fans I want it to 'happen', but the truth is it is'nt at the moment, are RVP and Falcao doing any better ?
thats not the discussion.

2043~~~
Blooding a young player annoys those who only think in terms of big money signings.There's no patience for that. Wilson being boringly British doesn't help either.
But of course many of these big money signings were not so amazing at age 19 either...

2044~~~
I know what you're saying, and I even agreed that he's not looked as promising as I had hoped. In fact, I'd go further and say that there's been virtually nothing to get excited over in his play. But then again, who has looked exciting? Which of our players has looked anywhere near the level we expect of them?

2045~~~
You win !

2046~~~
Pretty much agree with this, I said it a few weeks ago that I think Macheda showed much more in his early United career then Wilson has, but hoping we are eventually able to start creating chances for our strikers and then it might work out for Wilson

2047~~~
Macheda came into a team which actualy created chances and played fast attacking football, at the moment we play shite, even Falcao/RVP look clueless at the moment, what do you expect from a 19 year old then?

2048~~~
This is what i've been saying all along. I have faith in the kid, but in the same token even though its not entirely his fault his lack of goals makes you wonder whether he was more worthy of this chance in the first team under LVG than Chicharito and even Welbeck. Where Welbeck lacked in finishing he provided more workrate, linkup play and created chances.

2049~~~
He's more worthy of playing time because he has more talent than those two players. I didn't think he was currently the better player over those two. With Rooney, RVP, and Falcao there was no point in keeping the other two despite them being better strikers currently. Wilson is at an age where you can give him left over minutes to develop where as you can't do that with Chicharito and Welbeck. Both would be unhappy. The strikers we currently have allow for United to not only display results in the present, but also the future.

It's as simple as that. Wilson makes more sense to have as a 4th striker over Chich and Welbeck. Potential, age, and the ability of the 3 other strikers has everything to do with that decision.

2050~~~
It's yet to be seen if he has more talent than both these players imo. The boy obviously has talent though no doubt but right now Welbeck would be doing more in a United shirt than Wilson.

2051~~~
Welbeck would definitely be doing more because he's currently the better player. I still rate Wilson's potential more though. I'm more impressed with Wilson's finishing. I've seen Wilson dribble half the length of the pitch and score goals. He has great technique for striking a football and his speed with the ball is impressive. Welbeck has superior technique, but it's used in a way to link up the play. I rarely saw it used to directly hurt the opposition. It was always used to help bring the ball out if United were facing a superior possession team like Bayern last season, partly because our team was so bad when getting pressured. Welbeck just didn't fill me with confidence in the final third with him slipping in critical moments or messing up simple finishes. 

He's 19. He's figuring out to get himself involved because the defenders are bigger, faster, and read the game much better compared to youth defenders. It's a step up in terms of quickness of thought. Once he figures that out you will see him be much more dangerous. 

I can't stress enough that he's not like Chicharito who is a poacher. He can score all types of goals that we didn't see from Chicharito and his technique is certainly better than Chicha's. That's not to say he's entirely independent of service. He certainly does need it, but not more than Chicharito.

2052~~~

2053~~~
Sorry I'm going to break the flow here. 

IMO Welbeck's a far better player than Wilson, age difference notwithstanding. The type of pace they provide is vastly. Wilson's "pace" is far more limited than Welbeck's. He's no faster than Welbeck is with the ball, may be a better finisher, but is vastly inferior in terms of helping the tempo of link up and passing play. These are attributes that can be explained without taking into account age difference because they showcase very subjective skillsets.

2054~~~
All very true but I'm not sure why you would want to ignore the age difference. Wilson will improve, just as Welbeck did.

Also, Wilson is a far more direct player than Welbeck is and more selfish as well.

2055~~~
I'd like to see us try him as a right inside forward in a 4-3-3 with a focus on pace. 

He'd be excellent playing from that channel pulling in snapping shots away like he does. Rooney leads the line well and loves to counter attack and Di Maria, while I prefer him in midfield can play from deep in that role and really excel with two pacey players to attack alongside him in Rooney and Wilson. 

Herrera, Carrick and Blind can take care of the possession and defensive side of things. It has a lot more penentration than what we currently play.

2056~~~
The difference between Wilson and Welbeck's dribbling is that Wilson can do it faster with open space. Players can't catch up to Wilson with the ball where as they would with Welbeck. This is a great quality to have for counter attacking. Welbeck on the other hand is better technically so he can dribble out of pressured situations that Wilson couldn't.

With Wilson you can expect Schneiderlin would never be able to make that tackle.

2057~~~
I kinda get where you're coming from calling Welbeck more selfish but I actually think the opposite is true. Welbeck is far more a team player now, and was far more than Wilson when he started playing for us.

2058~~~
Having seen both of them develop at United, have to say Wilson has far more pace than Welbeck at the same age. Wilson is lightning fast, Danny was never & still isn't as fast as him. it really is a shame that our team plays so ponderously slow.

2059~~~
Gosh. As soon as that happened you just knew we wouldn't win the game. Rooney was in acres too. Didn't even need to take a touch!
He just has no bloody control of his legs.

He can be so useless at times, Welbeck.

2060~~~
It's Danny's thought speed on the ball that makes him much pacier than Wilson IMO.

2061~~~
Welbeck is brain dead on the ball lol, he's only ever reactionary. He's got pace and power and that's about that, Wilson will be a better finisher and has much better movement as well. He'll surpass Welbeck by the time he's that age, which won't be hard because Welbeck is massively overrated. Gone to an inferior side with no strikers and has fallen into the exact same position as he was with us. He'll be playing mid table football in a couple of seasons.

2062~~~
In the box I'll grant you that, but it terms of linking up play and spotting passes and runs, he's far better than Wilson.

2063~~~
Wilson is not bambi on ice if that is the comparison we are talking about.  I feel that Wilson has more composure when it comes to putting the ball in the net where else Welbeck seems to try the harder way of putting the ball into the net like chipping the keeper or aiming to the top corner.

2064~~~
Lovely goal. Fair play to him. Some on here seem to have decided that he's shit.

2065~~~
Excellent goal. 

Seems to be growing in confidence all the time, not that he was particularly lacking it initially anyway.. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2066~~~
Star in the making.

2067~~~
Very nice finish.

2068~~~
This is the best I've seen of him, albeit against poor opposition

2069~~~
Thats what he's all about. Great finish

2070~~~
Excellent goal, took it really well. Shame no one came up to celebrate with him. Poor little Wilson.

2071~~~
Lol, i saw that, seemed to be alone after scoring.

2072~~~
Aside from the goal, he looked nimble in possession today. Good to see.

2073~~~
Fantastic finishing, amazing pace - that run down that right win where the defender just gave up is what we like to see - dragging defenders out of position. His first touch also looked much better today.

2074~~~
Same with his goal last week I think. poor lad.

2075~~~
Wilson's great and it bodes very well Van Gaal likes him. I think everyone who has watched the reserves knows the lad can finish but his work rate and application whenever he's had a chance in the First Team has impressed me a lot too.

2076~~~
if he continues to take his chances, it does not bode well for the long term futures of one of RVP/Falcao.

really happy to see him make strides this year, long may that continue.

2077~~~
Thought he was really good today, his passing was good as was his touch. He fully deserves the playing time he's getting currently.

2078~~~
Been looking a lot more confident and a lot better as the seasons wore on.. Earlier in the year he wasn't really doing much with his time on the pitch but he's clearly progressed. Good to see.

2079~~~
Fantastic finish, and contributed well to the build up too.

2080~~~
Play him every game. I don't care if we win or lose, I just wan't to see him play every week. Same goes with Januzaj.

2081~~~
Every goal is a joy to watch. I would be made up if we could get a striker through the academy to make it. In a way it's the ultimate achievement for an academy.

Played well in general. Took his goal well, made tackles, interceptions, as well as holding the ball up well.

2082~~~
I love the way he strikes the ball. I noticed in his video of reserve goals he loves just smashing it in.

He generates some power with very little back lift.

2083~~~
I've reserved judgement on this lad because I wasn't impressed with his decision making early on, greedy bastard was my initial thoughts and they've not really changed. Starting to see just why now, lethal finisher and great build up play overall, needs to work on his positioning with his partner striker but he's a real threat to the front two.

2084~~~
In the reserves his touch is is often fantastic in tight spaces and finishing from that range is his speciality. Glad to see him finding that range in the first team. Now he needs to do it in the Premier League.

2085~~~
He needs to improve his strength. Rest of the game will get better with more experience and confidence.

2086~~~
No surprise to see a finish like that (and a good cameo full of pace and desire) for those who've watched him develop. To the doubters questioning why LVG kept playing him, it's because he's the kind of player who is almost certainly exceptional in training (just as he was week-in-week-out for the youth teams), and just needed a bit of game time and some half-decent service to get to grips with the senior game. He's only just 19, remember. It will still take time, but he has plenty.

His talent is terrifying. There's no natural weakness in his game - if we develop him properly, he has the potential to be fast, strong, a superb finisher from range, a clinical poacher, a good header of the ball, a gifted dribbler, and a hard worker with a strong striker's mentality and good attitude. There's a reason people at the club who work with him keep coming out with superlatives about him, just as they did with Januzaj. Unlike the caftards who had decided a week ago that Wilson was shit and Januzaj was never going to make it. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2087~~~
I am actually surprised that he stayed fit for such a long time. Top player if he has injury-free career. Needs to work on his aerial and hold up play. Once he gets it to the reasonable level he will start for us and will not let Van Persie or Falcao take his place. In two years he is certain starter..

2088~~~
He looks to be building himself up fairly well. Has gained a lot of Muscle in the past 6 months particularly on his legs

2089~~~
He is deceptively built/strong, I think. He has clearly made huge improvements since his debut (when he scored those 2 goals), though it's been gradual and steady so not so immediately noticeable. I don't know how legitimate it is, but i've heard from several that he has recorded a higher leg press than Rooney, making him #1 at the club. Anyway, the power in his play must come from somewhere - he's clearly been working hard in the gym. Great to see, as combining great physical traits with his skill could prove deadly. He seems to be a natural athlete.

2090~~~
Another good outing, he looks very confident every time he strides on and he took his goal really well, exciting prospect.

2091~~~
He covers a LOT of ground for a striker.  That was an impressive runback today that broke up Cambridge's attack.

2092~~~
Still seems weak to me, but you can see he's broad shouldered enough to change that. He'll fill in a bit over the next few years but hopefully not to the point where he's too heavy to accelerate like he does now.

It's weird watching him run at full pelt. It's almost like his legs are so fast that they leave his upper body behind.

2093~~~
Im a bit worried how hes fitting in to the team. I think weve all noticed the other strikers are a bit reluctant to pass to him and today he was off celebrating on his own until Rooney as Captain went over to him. Hes a great talent and if there is anything to this i hope LVG nips it in the bud.

2094~~~
There isn't.

2095~~~
Christ <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> All strikers are reluctant to pass - just look up some games RvP and Rooney played together. He scored our third goal in a 3-0 win against a league two side - I think our players are excused for not sprinting to him.

2096~~~
Great goal. Another positive display.

2097~~~
Probably his best cameo appearance for United so far.

2098~~~
Anyone that has watched Wilson in the reserves knows that he is a far better at running with the ball and at dribbling than Welbeck.

Wilson can go past 5 players at pace and then finish expertly. Welbeck has pretty poor composure and needs instinctive chances to be a goalscorer. 

I think that Wilson has looked nervous playing for the first team and his touch has been off somewhat due to that. If Wilson can become confident at senior level then I don't think that there will be any argument as to who is the better player between him and Welbeck.

2099~~~
When I look at Wilson, he reminds me a lot of Harry Kane last year. Everyone at Tottenham was raving about the kid, yet his performances on the pitch were inconsistent and he seemed to doubt his actions.

Wilson reminds me a lot of that but when he gets a sight of goal, he instinctively becomes a goalscorer. That's the most promising aspect of Wilson - the boy can score goals. Kane is easily the more well balanced player, but Wilson has the potential to be the more lethal striker.

Kane has considerably bulked up over the past year and that has given him confidence to wade off defenders and run with the ball. Wilson too has put on a bit of muscle, but he can put a whole lot more and when he does, he'll have the power to add to his speed. That's when that boy will really blossom.

2100~~~
Very promising striker - needs to work on a few things - particularly his use of the ball when deep, and getting in the box more often to be fed - he seems to create most of his goals himself at the moment.

2101~~~
I don't know if it's the beer I just had but the way I just read that, it had nothing to do with football. 

I have to get my mind out of the gutter.

2102~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Also he goes down easily - but some would say that's a good thing.

2103~~~
Now that you point it out<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2104~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2105~~~
I was desperate for Wilson to come on. It's about time he was given a run of games. He'd of actually made runs and has pace. Drop Falcao for him, ffs.

2106~~~
He took part of the sextape ?

2107~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jG6cCSqg0U?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2108~~~
I really wish he'd play instead of Falcao. He loses the ball several times in that video, but he actually makes runs and puts pressure on defenders. He also beats men which Falcao rarely seems to do.

2109~~~
It is time to give him a go.

2110~~~
Should be up top with Rooney for the rest of the season. 

Our two "world class" strikers can rot on the bench for all I care. fecking useless.

2111~~~
Agreed.

2112~~~
Van Persie out for 2/3 weeks.

Surely he is in.

2113~~~
Wilson went off injured in the last U21's match. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Edit- The injury been reported as only a dead leg. Which I guess is good news.

2114~~~
Van Persie will still play broken.

2/3 months out, he'd probably still make the bench.

2115~~~
A dead leg can keep you out for longer than you think.

2116~~~
Good point, a Van Persie in a wheel chair can still fit with the "fillosophy"

2117~~~
He should be given a chance.

He really can't do any worse than Falcao, RvP or Rooney have done lately.

2118~~~
Where is he ?

Oddly been pretty much sidelined since he scored vs Cambridge.

2119~~~
Given the small amount and high quality of the substitutes, it's not really a surprise he didn't make it to the bench.

2120~~~

Wasn't as bad as Sterling's the other day

2128~~~
Got injured in last night's U21 game and was substituted after 40 minutes. Hope he comes back soon. I like him as a backup striker on bench as comapred to Falcao

Injured, not going on loan:

2132~~~
Vote of confidence from Van Gaal..

2133~~~
Surely with Rooney back upfront now, and our formation at the current time, it leaves two "top class" strikers on the bench when RvP returns providing we don't put Rooney back in midfield. Wilson obviously adds something different to Falcao and RvP but I can't imagine LvG putting him on the bench ahead of RvP/Falcao or bringing him on ahead of them.

If Falcao/Rooney were to get injured and Wilson was loaned out then we would only have 1 striker available so maybe that's LvG thinking at the current time. How long is RvP out for?

I feel a loan move would of been better for him this year, he hasn't had a full season of playing competitive football and I feel it may have held him back slightly this year, he has looked nervous at times and hasn't demonstrated his true ability.

2134~~~
In hindsight yes, maybe we should have loaned him. Perhaps Januzaj as well, as crazy as that would have sounded in August. But we always knew we'd have far fewer matches this year with no CL so a big squad was never going to be entirely necessary.

No question in my mind Wilson will be a quality Premiership player in the future, whether he goes on loan next year or not.

2135~~~
Get rid of Falcao and RVP, Buy 1 more decent striker and then promote Wilson to 3rd choice. We need no more than that in a 4-3-3.

2136~~~
Might as well just keep van Persie for the extra year, and then buy a much better than 'decent' striker the summer after. Wilson's still third choice in that situation.

Next season: Rooney, van Persie, Wilson.
Season after: Very good striker, Rooney, Wilson.

2137~~~
What striker is going to join to be back up to Rooney? I'd not want to pay top dollar for someone willing to be a cover player....

2138~~~
Not as back up to Rooney. Phase Rooney out. He's our best striker right now, and I like him as a player, but the role of striker has moved on. I guess it would depend on how Rooney did next season.

2139~~~
We also have Hernandez, Henriquez and Will Keane returning from loan, one of them might impress LvG in pre-season like Wilson did and get a chance next season

2140~~~
So phase out Rooney, who I believe has 4 years left on his contract? Sign striker who has only ambitions for the 2018/19 season & pay top dollar for him?
Any striker worth his salt is going to want regular game time.

LVG loves Rooney and he isn't going to phase him out for some time. Whoever joins will be back up to Roo for the next 3 seasons. So as I said why pay top dollar for a finished product who is happy to be benched for extended periods. It matters not how you think the role of a striker has moved on, our main man under LVG will be Rooney, as he is  just about ideal for the role.

2141~~~
Funny you say van Gaal sees him as "ideal" for role. How long has that been the case then? A couple of months (if that)? Before then he apparently wasn't "ideal" for the role.

It's my opinion that we shouldn't sell van Persie (who has one more year) to buy a 'decent' striker ('decent' is someone like Berahino or Ings.)
I think we should keep van Persie, see how it goes with Rooney, and then potentially sign a better than 'decent' striker the summer after.
Get over it.

2142~~~
I said I thought Rooney was just about ideal for the role, not what LVG thought about him. I said LVG's loves him & isn't going to phase him out anytime soon. 
In the recent successful displays Rooney has played where he is best utilised & it's worked very well. Do you honestly see Van Gaal changing what works?
Anyone who's going to get game time is going to have to be able to displace Rooney & have better characteristics than LVG than sees in Rooney. Have you missed the multiple interviews where he has stated what he sees in Rooney & how highly he rates him? I don't think he'll be looking to replace him during his tenure at Old Trafford. If United buy a striker, I'd guess it'll be a young striker with potential. Or simply make RvP honour his contract, as he wont get a better deal elsewhere. 
I'm over it, just questioning your point of view, with valid questions & having a differing opinion. Sure this is a discussion forum....

2143~~~
IMO it's not just what he could provide in matches or in case of injuries. Have to think that LVG sees a benefit in having a young, quick, energetic forward around training purposes, especially given that he likes to train for certain situations. Wilson can test our defenders and provide them with challenges that the likes of Rooney, RVP, and Falcao cannot.

2144~~~
Thats a good point actually. 

I really wanted him to see him come on against Liverpool and Sakho in particular.

2145~~~
Phase Rooney out while he is still in his peak years? I don't think that makes much sense.

2146~~~
According to the Metro .Newcastle as made an enquiry to take him on loan.

2147~~~
When is he back?

2148~~~
He's already back. Played for the under-21's last week.

2149~~~
Unless we buy, we are better of keeping. I certainly would loan to that shower of shite after not giving Rossi a chance. Let's focus on getting the boy stronger. He's have quite a developmental season and would enjoy playing in this team at the minute with the confidence flowing. That is unlikely at the minute but wouldn't loan him out. He can play wing too (wide forward) so plenty of options.

2150~~~
I would like to see him play for Newcastle for the remainder of the season. I am really eager to see him get games.

2151~~~
He can't just go on loan now, they would be inquiring for next season.

2152~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2153~~~
There's no point in him going on loan. Training with the first team and adapting to van Gaals philosophy is much more important than a few sub appearances for a Premier League team.

2154~~~
Can't imagine a better place for character building...

2155~~~
I agree,although loan deals tend to have a positive impact on some strikers.

2156~~~
Just thinking out loud here. If we would sign Dybala or someone similar and get rid of both RvP and Falcao, That would leave us with Rooney, Dybala* & Chicarito competing for one spot. Rotation and all that ensures they will all get their games. In that case, I would not mind seeing Wilson go on a season loan at a Newcastle or some similar team. More chances for him to play and develop himself, and come back at the end of the season making a strong case to be included the year after. 


*or any hotshot striker

2157~~~
I would bet against anyone that Wilson won't go on loan next season.

2158~~~
Hernandez is gone.

2159~~~
I think so too, but hey, who knows. We also thought Young would be gone, look how that turned out.

2160~~~
The last place we should send him is to Newcastle. That club has turned into a complete joke. Plus the last time we loaned them someone, Giuseppe Rossi, didn't they just decide to not play him and when they did it was completely out of position on the left of midfield.

2161~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2162~~~
Doubt he'll go there ,but you can't blame them for putting in a cheeky enquiry.

2163~~~
For me he should be our "3rd striker" next season.
I don't think he needs a loan and Newcastle would be surely the worst club for such a loan.

2164~~~

2165~~~
newcastle is definitely the last plae we should send wilson out on loan, infact any player.

2166~~~
I wouldn't loan him out either. He's having of those seasons. He could have scored yesterday but got too good a contact on the ball. Let's get him working hard over the summer and let him blossom at the club. I think  this season will have been character building for him. He struggled when we struggled and hasn't got into the rhythm of scoring. We should set him a realistic target for next season. I think ten goals isn't something beyond him. When the team is free flowing, it will encourage him more but unfortunately he came into team struggling with the system.

2167~~~
Probably a bit late and missed the news, but has he signed a new contract? Wasn't his deal ending this summer?

2168~~~

2169~~~
Good news, get him regular top flight football for a year and he should be ready the following season.

2170~~~
It's disappointing he hasn't been given more opportunities ahead of Falcao. Depending what happens in the summer, a loan seems necessary to give him some game time to develop.

2171~~~
Is he injured?

2172~~~
<b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/James-Wilson.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">James Wilson</a> may have only made his senior debut a year ago today, but the Manchester United striker is well versed in the art of scoring and knows exactly how to put the ball in the back of the net.</b>

The 19-year-old is, in fact, regarded as one of the most exciting prospects at Old Trafford and looks set to enjoy a bright future under Louis van Gaal. 

During a recent interview with <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/magazine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Inside United</a></b> magazine at the Aon Training Complex, Wilson revealed exactly how he became a striker within the Academy and explained his secrets to scoring... 

<b>Growing up, did you always play as a striker?</b>
No, I started out as a winger but I think my biggest downfall was probably my fitness. I wasn’t really fit enough to be a winger at one point (laughs)! I think there was a point in the Under-15s or Under-16s when I wasn’t fit enough to be a winger, so they put me up front for a few games and I scored a few goals, so it has all gone on from there. Now, I am probably fit enough to play on the wing, so I have always got that in my locker.

<b>So who can we credit for converting you into a striker?</b>
It was Tommy Martin, or maybe another coach before him, but I think he was the one that told me to go up front. We had a few injuries at the time, when we were younger, and I was the only one there who could play up front. Like I say, I scored a few goals in my first few games and here we are today.

<b>What’s the most important quality needed for scoring a goal?</b>
You can score different goals from different angles and distances. You have just got to be alert for when something drops for you in the box, you have to react quickly in those first few yards to get a shot off, or maybe beat a player and then put it past the keeper, but you have got to be cool when you get your opportunities. You have got to be calm. If you have got something in your mind, don’t change it. Just do what you are planning to do.

<b>So when you are through on goal, how do you decide what to do?</b>
It usually depends on the keeper. If you are quite far away from the box, you can always take it around him. I have got the pace, obviously, to just knock it past him and put it in. It is all based on the keeper. If you have got something in your mind, don’t change it. It is a bit like a penalty, if you are going for one side, then make sure you shoot to that side. If you change your mind, then it can all go pear shaped!

<b>Can you have too much time on the ball in that situation?</b>
You can probably think that you have got too much time on it but, like I say, you just have to relax and stay calm. Obviously don’t milk it and take too much time on the ball because the defender or the keeper will get to you! You just have to relax and take your chance.

<b>In terms of finishing, what is your favourite type of goal to score?</b>
The most I would say that I have scored in the past few years is going round the keeper. It is an easy goal if you go around the keeper in the right way because it is an open net. But there is nothing wrong with a 30-yard screamer into the top corner! As long as it goes in, I’m happy.

<b>Finally, a lot of fans dream of scoring a goal for United. Having done it yourself, could you explain just how it feels?</b>
It is an amazing feeling, especially the second goal that I scored against Hull in front of the Stretford End. It was unbelievable, the sound. I could just hear the fans chanting my name and it just gives you goosebumps – in fact I am getting goosebumps now just talking about it. It’s an amazing feeling.

2173~~~
I hope Wilson figures a lot more next season than he has this season.

2174~~~
We should send Wilson, Pereira and Januzaj to PSV next year. Then I can have a second club to support.

2175~~~
considering those are three of my favourite players, my allegiance would be very much under threat if this loan-trifecta were to materialise. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it. it's borderline asinine... how can a striker still be called upon time after time if he has literally ONE shot on target since january. unforgivable.

2176~~~
PSV would gladly take Januzaj and Pereira but I don't think Wilson would have a place. PSV have 2 good strikers in Luuk de Jong (yes the one who failed at Newcastle) who's scored 19 and youth product Jurgen Locadia who got benched this season but is a great poacher.

They do lack wingers though: Narsingh hasn't found his pre-ACL form, Bakkali is leaving on a free, Jozefzoon is out with an ACL injury and they only have 2 youth players in Locadia and Bergwijn who could do a job there. Wilson would be getting a place as winger if he comes.

2177~~~
wilson doing everything he can tonight to show that he deserves first team chances.

2178~~~
Not really why he seems to have slipped back behind Falcao in the pecking order. Earlier in the season he was seemingly favoured (he even started the Liverpool match)

2179~~~
Yeah he's got to get more first team action next year, city have been absolutely terrified of him tonight.

2180~~~
Tonight showed why he deserves more first team action next year. Hope LvG is watching.

2181~~~
Class ahead of U21/Reserve level.

2182~~~
i know it was only u21's, but he's so clearly ahead of falcao in terms of ability at this point, it's not even funny. i'd take his pace any day of the week. terrifies defenders and at the very least opens space for others.

2183~~~
I think injuries and the Falcao situation haven't help. Really hope he stays here(not go out on loan) next season.

2184~~~
It is funny and true. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Imagine someone told you last year that Wilson, in terms of ability would be better than Falcao next year <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2185~~~
Really impressed with him tonight, we were relying on his pace on the break, he got in twice, scored on the first occassion with a clever finish and made a goal on the second, looks class.

2186~~~
How would he work with Memphis? Seems like they are both very fast and good goalscorers.

2187~~~
If we played a fluid front 3 like Barca do I think they'd work well, but apparently LvG prefers a more rigid version with a big #9, so for Wilson to get games I think he is going to have to learn to play from the right of the front 3 as I don't think from what <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> has said he'll get to play as the lone #9 under LvG.

2188~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRZo5-KzL0I?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2189~~~
Looks ready. Hopefully he's used more next season.

2190~~~
He looks very strong all of a sudden? Been hitting the gym it seems.

2191~~~
According to dailymail, his contract is up at the end of the season. We need to sign him up. 2nd most talented player in the academy excluding Adnan.

2192~~~
I'd rather Wilson be loaned to a BPL team tbh. Pereira and Januzaj would prosper in the Eridivisie though.

2193~~~
99.9% sure he signed a contract last summer.

2194~~~
Apparently he can leg press more weight than any other player in the squad. Beat Rooney's record earlier this season. Now he's (presumably) stopped growing he'll fill out a lot.

2195~~~
I don't see how he is not getting any game time ahead of Falcao at the moment. Falcao is gone in the summer and I'd rather see Wilson getting game time. I'd nearly start him ahead of RVP for Sunday too. His pace alone will help stretch Arsenal's defense

2196~~~
RvP probably won't start, I think Rooney's substitution was more precautionary than anything else.

2197~~~
I don't see the point of loaning him, honestly.  He immediately gives us speed that we're so badly missing up front.  I hope we find more game time for him next season and Falcao is out of his way.

2198~~~
Yeah I don't see us signing another striker this summer (unless RVP goes too). With European football and the domestic cups there should be enough minutes for him next season at OT

2199~~~
Haha, that is impressive if true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Great potential this lad, really hope he makes it here.

2200~~~
SAF in his time would probably define him as good as a new transfer deal.

Not the first time outpacing everyone on the pitch. Van Gaal's new headache in the striker's department.

2201~~~
For those repeatedly saying its unbelievable that he hasnt played ahead of Falcao recently he has actually hasnt been available to play (using Van Gaal's rules) since the Spurs match he got an injury against Everton u21s and went off then got a knock against West Ham u21s and returned against Leicester under 21s and then was sick for 2 weeks so he wasnt actually fit and available to play since March

2202~~~
Didn't he sign a new contract last summer? According to Daily Mail and Transfermarkt his contract is up this summer.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3078177/Premier-League-free-transfer-list-2015-James-Milner-Chelsea-hero-Didier-Drogba-Arsenal-crock-Abou-Diaby.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...o-Didier-Drogba-Arsenal-crock-Abou-Diaby.html</a>

2203~~~
Fairly sure he did, transfermarkt aren't reliable and dailymail probably got it off there. If it was really expiring this summer the papers would be all over with Pogba shite just like they were with Andreas.

2204~~~
I can't find anyhere (Google search or Twitter search) that he has signed a new contract last stummer.

2205~~~
James Ducker tweeted earlier today that his contract is until next summer but he seems to have deleted so not sure. I've seen other people who are clued up on youth contracts say he isn't expiring this summer though as well. I don't think there is anything to worry about with him.

2206~~~
Hopefully the extra few pounds of muscle might help stop the numerous niggly injuries that keep occurring.

2207~~~
Really not worried about him, think he will resign in the summer without much hassle. He knows he is rated at the club and whenever fit he is on the bench.

2208~~~
Real men squat! Plus im sure Valencia would leg press more than Wilson

2209~~~
Don't be decieved by build...

2210~~~
I think his contract is until 2017.

2211~~~

2212~~~
Yeah it is

2213~~~
Would give him a start against arsenal ahead of Falcao

2214~~~
I've been a regular gym goer for about 8 years and agree with you on that. I've seen really small powerlifters shift incredible amounts of weight. 

However I was referring to this tweet from Rio...

I saw Valencia in the gym today...the guy throws the wieghts around like how I threw @RobbieSavage8 about! #strongestwingerinthegame #fact !

Wilson may be the strongest leg presser but I'm slightly dubious especially due to his young age as he probably hasn't fully developed yet

2215~~~
I'm not just making shit up.

Here's a<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/sport-opinion/andy-mitten-james-wilsons-manchester-8529655" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> link</a>:

2216~~~
I honestly think Wilson will become a club great, he has everything needed! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2217~~~
Valencia, might be one of those gymers that skip leg day.... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2218~~~
I think it was Ryan Giggs who also said Wilo has the highest jump he's ever seen. Can't remember if he specified what kind of jump.

2219~~~
Was Nikcy But me thinks, standing jump.

2220~~~
So it was. He said "Wilson is unbelievable in the six-yard box," commented Butt. "He's got the best standing spring you've ever seen in your life."

2221~~~
Which fits with him breaking records on the leg press.

2222~~~
He should start. Same for Januzaj.

2223~~~
I smell a rat...

(Or was this article from before Ando left?)

2224~~~
His first touch is puresex.

2225~~~
Rooney's out but it's likely Van Persie will feature ahead of him.

2226~~~
I do like the caf, when a player has been out of the first 11 for some time, there's a fierce rush to forget just how out of place they looked the last time they played there. Yep, Wilson looks promising. Does he deserve to start right now? No way. Hasn't looked at home in the first team yet, and great play in U21s means nothing in that regard.

2227~~~
Deserve? Young players get random looks into the first team, not always because there wasn't a better option available.

2228~~~
Yes, but I think with 2 games to go, beating Arsenal to give us a slight chance of top 3 is not the time to give a young player a random look at the first team.

2229~~~
still pretty poor aerial game, especially his timing, but plenty of time for him to learn that..

2230~~~
James Wilson won't blossom into the kind of striker we expect him to be, he won't be our main striker in the next 3-5 years.

2231~~~
Do you mean he won't develop into a great striker, or that he won't develop into the right type of great striker that we need?

2232~~~
he won't develop into the right type of great striker that we need.

2233~~~
Alright, but isn't that too early to say? When i watch him he seems to be pretty good at everything, strong body, dribbling, pace and good passing ability.
He is raw atm, but he is 19 after all and still damn good for his age.

2234~~~
It is.

2235~~~
Its enough of a challenge to excite him with little enough on the line to lose.

Its makes more sense than it would have before we secured 4th.

Gotta take a chance somewhere, Falcao and a not-match-fit Van Persie isn't ideal either.

2236~~~
Don't think he'll start vs. Arsenal but he might start vs. Hull.

Love how people are so sure about predicting player's future.Let's tell me what's our best XI 5 seasons away from now when we're at it.

2237~~~
Completely missed this post, sorry. LvG his profile of a striker is a prime van Persie, a Lewandowski. Great at linking up play, holding up the ball and scoring goals on their own. They don't necessarily have to be Drogba's. Wilson is a tall guy and maybe van Gaal sees enough potential in him, I think he's likely to stay. He doesn't like loaning out talents because he can't mold them that way, he only does it if they have no chance of getting gametime.

Earlier in the season Wilson had alot of freedom when he came on a as a substitute, but I think now that van Gaal's methods become clear he will try to develop him into functioning piece. I see no reason why Wilson can't become a van Gaal 9, he just has to pick moments on when to dribble with the ball. Wilson can't do this too often because he'll lose the ball more. He won't be done learning when van Gaal is leaving, but he can certainly learn alot in these years.

If he sees Wilson a winger he could play on the right, but we've currently got 5 wingers + Nani, Lingard already. Memphis and Young can only play on the left effectively, it will depend if those 2 are good enough to keep that side covered or that they both get benched. I don't think that will happen so he will have to fight it out with Di Maria, Januzaj and Mata for that right spot, I think Wilson has more chance at our aging striker position.

As for Memphis and Wilson playing together? Could happen as they play in different positions.

2238~~~

2239~~~
He can piss off. We wouldn't want him going there.

2240~~~
I could see us considering that as Fletcher is there to look out for him.

2241~~~
Personally I wouldn't want him going there unless Berahino leaves. Villa is an even worse idea, especially if Benteke stays put. 

Wilson needs to have guaranteed first team footbal, even if that means going to the Championship. It's not such a bad idea, Jordan Ibe certainly made the most of it.

2242~~~
Villa are almost certain to sell Benteke and Sherwood seems to be good with young players so that could be a good option for Wilson as well.

2243~~~
I do not understand how he did not get more game time this season with our underperforming strikers(injury aside). With the assumption that we will get another attacker next season, I can not see him getting much game time either. If he does go to loan, hopefully he can make as good an impact as Welbeck did at Sunderland to ensure he becomes an important part of our team the season before next one.

2244~~~
Yeah Championship might be better to ensure he starts every game. Villa could be good too, if Benteke leaves then Charlie Austin might come in and they are looking at Bamford too but I imagine it will be a Bamford or Wilson deal. Austin isn't the best so he give him some competition and Villa play some good open football which would suit Wilo.

2245~~~
I would have brought him on today instead of Van Persie. Arsenal were leaving huge space in behind their defence so even if he hasn't scored I think his pace would have meant they couldn't press us as high as they did

2246~~~
Even if he doesnt do anything production wise, he's so much more effective by the fact his runs spread defenders allowing more space for others.

I really hope he starts against Hull.

2247~~~
Send him to the championship for half a year and then look again in January? If he does well one of the relegation threatened teams will look at him anyway.

2248~~~
I'm a huge fan of Wilson but like Januzaj, it hasn't helped that everytime we've given him a chance this year neither have been able to step up. LvG may be a little gun shy on Wilson right now.
vs. Hull we should give them both another chance to impress, theres very little to lose.

2249~~~
I think we could of won the game with him.

2250~~~
We shouldn't loan him out. We should work on his strength over the summer. He made 16 appearances so far which is not bad considering the competition and the lack of games. Hopefully next pre season he's fit and can show his qualities.

2251~~~
Wonder if Gary Monk would be interested? Honestly believe that would be the best team for him in the league but not sure he would get as much game time as we desire.

2252~~~
Exactly.  He needs to learn how to grab the manager's attention and make himself undroppable.  Y'know, like Falcao has.

2253~~~
I dont know why he's persisted with Falcao, nobody does, and to a slightly lesser extent Van Persie as well,
but it's still a fair statement that Wilson hasn't shown what he's capeable of in the selective chances afforded to him this season, neither has Januzaj, which is a shame, if he'd given one or two decent displays it would perhaps... at least give Van Gaal something to think about instead of us having to watch Falcao slip and slide around the pitch continuously.

2254~~~
Cant expect much of a 19 year old when the team as a whole isnt performing well.

2255~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hirstclass" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Hirst @hirstclass</a>
James Wilson named in England Under-20 squad for Toulon <a class="externalLink" href="https://t.co/TANAeouk26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/england/status/601651406500712449 …</a>

2256~~~
LVG hopefully is always encouraging Wilson to play his natural game. Hopefully he has a great tournament.

2257~~~
Well done for getting in the squad but I can't help but think he should be with the under 21's.

2258~~~
Would love to see him get a run out against Hull.

2259~~~
Nah, this bunch play better football than the U21's.

2260~~~
They are taking Ings, Kane and Berahino and then out of the other three the only one he could probably replace is Woodrow, and even then i don't think he'd make the cut down to 23 considering the form of Bamford and Afobe this season.

To be fair, he's not had any impact on the first team here, and the 6 forwards they picked are playing and scoring in a higher level than the U21s league.

He needs a loan imho.

2261~~~
Perhaps he could have gone there in January when they lost Bony and didn't replace him. They've looked rank up front since (No top half PL side should have Marvin Emnes as their 2nd choice centre forward!). 

I think they will definitely bring in a striker this summer, and it will probably be a more established prospect than Wilson, so he might struggle to get a look in.

2262~~~
He needs a higher standard of football than the U21

2263~~~
Very much so, the gap bewteen the first team and the Reserves is huge.

Especially if your manager i. interested in tactical precision to the degree to which Van Gaal is.

2264~~~
I mean for England not United. We need to send him out on loan.

2265~~~
Instead of splurging on a striker, I would prefer to see Wilson up front. It seems like a very United thing to do. Kinda similar to when fergie put his faith in Welbeck and decided to sell berba.

2266~~~
Also a very stupid thing to do. Welbeck didn't develop very well either so I'm not sure the example works. And welbeck was much older.

2267~~~
I wouldn't be surprised to see him play a lot more next year. If we don't buy an RvP replacement then its likely LvG has full confidence that this could be Wilson's breakthrough year.

2268~~~
that season when welbeck was leading the line with rooney, we did quite well and were level on points with the champions. welbeck got 12 goals. it was the season after with RVP coming in that welbeck couldn't develop. anyways james wilson, i don't think we will see much of him here, this season or even later

2269~~~
Wilson will always be better than welbeck.

2270~~~
Always, except that welbeck played better for us throughout his United career than what Wilson showed last season.

I'm assuming Wilson will go to be much better going by the way people rate him here, but he played like a kid last season in whatever games he played. Didn't look ready.

2271~~~
Welbeck was good that season. He just never improved in the following 2 years, hence why we got rid.

2272~~~
Indeed but like I said welbeck was much further in his development at the time. Physicality he could handle himself in addition to the other aspects. Wilson looked a little lost. Unless he is a lot more ready and improves drastically by next season I don't see him as good enough right now as second choice striker.

2273~~~
I don't disagree. But I wasn't arguing that.

2274~~~
The original point was when Fergie got rid of Berba and got in Welbeck it was the United thing to do and wasn't a mistake at the time. I feel getting rid of RVP for Wilson isn't a bad idea, aslong as we also replace Falcao and Hernandez with a striker.

2275~~~
The difference being like I've said above, that welbeck was ready and much further in his development than Wilson is, based in last season's evidence. The post I replied to suggested we don't sign a striker and have Wilson as second choice. Going by your last sentence, you disagree with that as well.

I mean the Wilson of last season simply cannot be second choice striker for a club this big.

2276~~~
From what we've seen Wilson isn't good enough. He's young and there's potential but not enough to warrant being a place behind Rooney. Should prove himself in the Premiership by going out on loan imo.

2277~~~
And that's partially why England fail to produce elite young players, when you have a young player and room for him, just play him, give him a fair chance.

2278~~~
I've never agreed with this theory tbh. There are plenty of opportunities for English players if they are good enough.

2279~~~
All the reports coming out last season were that LVG really rated Wilson very highly iirc. I'd imagine he'll be part of the first team squad next season.

2280~~~
You might disagree, but Germany, France, Spain and Italy in the last decade all begun to reproduce quality players, mainly because of the playing time given to the young players.

2281~~~
Welbeck had two loans first, plus we had Hernandez too, and we even kept Berbatov for an extra season just in case.

2282~~~
He will, van Gaal doesn't loan out his best talents and he even got gametime without much cupgames and when we had Falcao, RvP and Rooney. I'm pretty sure if RvP leaves he will be replaced and Wilson becomes 3rd striker.

2283~~~
Sounds about right. The fact he started Wilson against Liverpool shows that he obviously has a lot of faith in the kid, even if it maybe came a bit to early for him this season. I'm looking forward to seeing him develop, I personally think he's a star in the making.

2284~~~
Fair point.

2285~~~
I hope he actually gets some game time up top when we are attacking next season. Most of his playing time last season was spent out on the wing trying to defend a lead. 

I'd probably send him on loan to the Championship but van Gaal seems to prefer keeping players around so I'm all for that if he'll actually get the play time.

2286~~~
I've seen a few headlines today linking him to Hull on loan.

2287~~~
Because mainly all those countries (I'm not including Italy because I'm not 100% sure) have more talented young players than England. The few english players who looked good at very young age all got opportunities to develop (Wilshere, Rooney, Kane, Sterling).

2288~~~
I don't think that it's the case, I think that England miss on a lot of talented players because they tend to buy shit foreign players and not give a chance to the young players.
No country can be in such a bad situation that they have to import the likes of Gouffran or Eder.

2289~~~
Nah if the talent is good enough (which it isn't) they'll play more. Exceptions like city and Chelsea aside.

2290~~~
I think they're, it's just not the sole reason because young English players on top of being less talented, they're also more expensive.

2291~~~
The new generation are definitely as talented as any foreign players. Just look at the success the Chelsea youth team had recently and England have won two U17 Euro titles in the past five years.

Game time is a major problem though. At the Euro U21s this summer the England squad had the fewest senior appearances of any team. When we beat Germany at the end of the season their U21 team had something insane like 500 more appearances at senior level. It is undeniable that this is a problem.

That can't be true though. The EPL has far more foreign players than any other major league. Surely less places for English youth means less chances? It isn't just about the standout talents. Some lesser players can develop if they get the chance, the lack of opportunity for that chance has to be a problem, no?

2292~~~
Maybe you are right, but I disagree.

Hardwork paid off, I'm a living lesson. Thanks <a class="username" data-user="11370, @Sultan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/11370/">@Sultan</a>

2294~~~
But you still think it was a "stupid" decision to sell Berba and play Welbeck instead of buying a replacement?

2295~~~
Its not really about just having room. If you're having to engineer gametime for a player, you have to ask yourself if the player is best off somewhere else where he can play consistently. Elite youngsters tend to just force their way in.
It seems like the manager would have to go out of his way in order to give Wilson minutes. Few (if any) of the top young players around were gifted gametime. They were always the best option for the team despite their age. This isn't the case for Wilson. 
The issue is that England don't actually create many special youngsters - not that they don't play enough.

 And pretty much no quality young strikers over this decade. Young strikers have to be seriously special to get consistent gametime at a top division club. It's not unique to English football.

2296~~~
Hate to keep chiming on about this but Solanke and Abraham at Chelsea scored 82 goals between them this season for the Chelsea youth side that won the youth Champions League and the FA Youth Cup. They both hit 41 goals this season and in the youth CL Solanke averaged a goal every 60 minutes. At the moment two of the best young strikers in the world are in the hands of Chelsea and they are both English. We are producing great talents at the moment.

2297~~~
Germany, France, Spain and Italy produce great players because they concentrate on ball skills instead of kicking the ball and running.

The change needs to come at school level. Until the FA invests in this at grassroot levels...we will still be looking up at these ccountries.

2298~~~
Almost all English talents are very strong and/or very fast (mostly strong). Because of this, the most of them can already play at a high level when they're quite young, and are labelled a top talent. But they're technically, tactically, mentally so far behind the other nations.

Because of that, Im very excited that United is heading in another direction a bit, looking at the likes of McNair, Pearson, Rothwell, Pereira, Januzan Lingard, Keanes.

2299~~~
Just wrong. We hadn't won anything at youth level since the early 90s before 2010, there has been a marked improvement in the quality of young English players in recent years. Why don't you look up Man Utd's own Angel Gomes and reeducate yourself.

2300~~~
Did I say you've won something? Angel Gomes is 14, lets look at the PL English youngsters

2301~~~
So you think that Loftus-Cheek, for example, has a lack of technique on the ball? By your reckoning that superiority based on physique should have resulted in more success, or indeed it isn't superiority is it?

2302~~~
can agree with most of that.

2303~~~
Every team should seek to emulate Brazil in their pomp, you cannot get those kind of ball and dribbling skills unless you start very early.

2304~~~
Because we got Van Persie and Kagawa. This is not to say I didn't want to get RVP. I mean, he played a massive part in us winning the title, so I guess SAF buying him was justified, but I think Welbeck would have improved a lot more if he didn't have to play on the wings for more or less two seasons. I mean, that season, him and Rooney were immense up top for most of the season.

As for Wilson, don't think he's ready yet. Needs a loan to a Championship or EPL team.

2305~~~
a loan deal seems right...he certainly needs playing time.

But with us letting RvP go, Falcao...

We have Rooney and who else?

lots of mention of midfielders and defenders. We need 4 top strikers to challenge.

van Gaal seems to like the lad...so Wilson may play lot more matches this season even if we get 2 top strikers.

2306~~~
We don't need 4 top strikers at all. Wtf would we do with 4 top strikers when we only play 1 at a time? No team has 4 top strikers.

2307~~~
I don't even think Januzaj would start week in - week out for the majority of Premier League sides as a loan player. And he's considered a winger.
Wilson would barely play much for any team in this league. 

Championship loan would be the sensible choice. In fact, I'd actually go for League One half-season loan.

2308~~~
dreaming of 4-4-2 I suppose.

2309~~~
You must be having a laugh.

2310~~~
Th
That's great for them. They still aren't good enough to dislodge Costa. And gametime is crucial for youngsters.
Like I said - when players are genuinely the best option, they tend to get picked despite being young.

You can't force youngsters into the side. The likes of Isco, Draxler, Gotze, Neymar... were better than their competition. 
Same for Stones, Barkley, Sterling and many others down the years like Rooney and Owen.

2311~~~
I think people who think Wilson would play loads on loan in the Premier League are having a laugh, personally.

2312~~~
That doesn't mean he should go on loan to a League One club, that's simply idiotic. Adnan would easily get into the majority of PL sides as well.

2313~~~
They are both 17. Abraham especially isn't physically developed enough for senior football. All of those foreign players that you mentioned came through at lesser clubs than Chelsea. Chelsea play a one striker system and Mourinho is known for not trusting young players. They are both top top talents but are at one of he worst clubs to get a shot. Both would get minutes at Santos, for example.

2314~~~
You're right tho. We love to overrate our youngsters but other than a decent return in the u21, he hasnt shown that much yet for other clubs to even consider starting him. No club would seale a 19 year old striker who's scored 3 PL goals as an improvement.

2315~~~
No, they are superior in physique but inferior in technique, and tactically. I havent seen RLC that much tbf, but wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt turn out to be a world beater later. He's almost 2m and a huge lad, it's quite easy to become leanient on that. He has shown some skills tho so cant judge that.

2316~~~
I think it would be "stupid" to replace Rvp with Wilson instead of buying a striker like I said.

2317~~~
Blimey.

2318~~~
fecking Falcao was getting chances being shit game after game while Wilson should have getting that game time to prove himself more.

If he stays clear of Injuries which is a major worry with him, Wilson will be a star.

2319~~~
I see some here still not realise how good Wilson is/will be.League One?Ok mate.Let's go and watch more football.

2320~~~
I think giving Wilson the chance is the better risk to take. Especially after expecting so much from Falcao and being let down massively.Instead of spulrging big money on a striker, waiting for him to adjust to the pl and LVG's system. I rather see a young, quick and highly rated Wilson given the opportunity. There aren't many good strikers available in the current market anyways.

2321~~~
Wilson is not going to get us a 10 goal return though is he. Minimum that's what we need from our second striker. He has a lot to learn and is better of being a number 3 or going on loan to a Championship club where he will get minutes.

2322~~~
I think 10 goals isn't a ridiculous target for someone his age. If given the right amount of opportunities, I am confident he can deliver. After the whole Falcao debacle, this seems like the right way forward.

2323~~~
The last time I was so confident a youth player would make it, it was Ryan. Even the class of 92 I was more hopeful than sure.
He is a finisher in the mould of Ian Rush. He just seems to know the best thing to do to score. That's  at junior level, and he needs chances to hone that at senior level. He is also pretty damn quick, running with the ball
Future England star, for me. Just needs to play.

2324~~~
4 "top"  strikers when we'll play a system with just 1 striker?

2325~~~
I think some people think we still play 442!  With two strikers we needed four top strikers, with one striker we need two or three. Preferably one of which can play other roles (I.e. Depay). Sadly, Wilson is not good enough to be the "third striker".

2326~~~
Well that sucks.

2327~~~
Not really, they wont get a game.

2328~~~
I know, that's why it sucks. They just signed Falcao, and Costa and Remy will be ahead of them as well.

2329~~~
I trust LVG to be a good judge of how good Wilson is. I have no qualms putting faith in youth. All the minutes we gave Falcao last season were a total waste, Wilson wouldn't have done any worse and would likely have scored more than 4 goals.

2330~~~
I feel the same. 

Wilson could be about to ge the boost his career needed, LVG might just go in the season with Rooney as the only striker and hope Wilson can be a good backup.

2331~~~
Wilson's had a lot of problems with injuries. Not sure it would have been a good idea giving him so much football in his first season playing senior football.

2332~~~
That probably would have been the optimum amount, really. You don't want to give a potentially fragile youngster a full season as first choice, because that sort of workload can cause injuries and burn-out. But nor is it ideal to keep them on the bench all season. You want to aim somewhere in between the two so as to build up their conditioning and settle them into the rigours of first team football.

I can't seem to find solid stats, but I'm guessing Falcao got something like 30 appearances, a fairly even mixture of starts and half hours coming off the bench. That would have been optimal for Wilson.

EDIT: Compare to Kane who, according to Soccerbase, played 56 games. <i>That</i> would have been too many.

2333~~~
I was watching a highlights reel of him and only just realised that he is genuinely two-footed. Hope to see more of him next season, be it out on loan or with us.

2334~~~
Looks like it will be him, Rooney and another striker if RvP left

2335~~~
Yup. Genuinely two-footed and a good natural finisher as well. Always looks comfortable in and around the box.

2336~~~
That's all well and good in hindsight. You don't go and loan one of the world's best strikers (at the time), assume he will be shite and just let a youngster play instead.

2337~~~
No of course, but after half a season of consistent failure you might start to consider giving the kid a proper shot, instead of pointlessly persisting with Falcao right up until the very end of the season.

2338~~~
And deceptive pace to boot. If he develops accordingly, we've got a fairly good striker on our hands.

2339~~~
Can't tell if this is sarcasm.

2340~~~
I was serious, you never know how good a player is until he is given the chance. Who thought Harry Kane was that good this time last year?

2341~~~
I feel the same way but that is a very risky strategy ofcourse.

2342~~~
Would have been absolutely barmy to have an opportunity to permanently sign a 29 year old striker who was - until very recently - rated as one of the best in the world and is recovering from a long term injury, then give up on him completely halfway through his first season in a new league. 

Giving up on him at the end of his first full season is risky enough and Jose Mourinho (who knows a thing or two about football) obviously thinks we called it quits too soon. So it would be completely absurd to suggest Van Gaal should have written off Falcao as early as you suggest.

2343~~~
He didn't have any problems benching Di Maria, so I don't buy that logic. Probably more to do with the fact that VG doesn't believe that Wilson was ready to shoulder such a responsibility at that stage.

2344~~~
Di Maria was signed on a long-term contract so different rules apply. Freezing out Falcao halfway through last season would have been the end of his United career. The same wasn't true of Di Maria. At least it doesn't look that way right now.

2345~~~
That doesn't matter. What you are suggesting is, that the only reason Falcao was played ahead of Wilson was because VG wanted to save his United career, which I don't think is the right way to look at

2346~~~
I wasn't happy when Falcao took minutes off our player when it was clear he won't make it with us but I get Van Gaal for giving him chance for so long time. He was his dream signing and wanted to prove it to be a right decision while still hoping he can have some great game or two to make Van Gaal think about another loan deal or permanent transfer for him.. 

he was waiting for the turn of things for him but I can't see it coming even next season, he will struggle and it will cost Mourinho the title.. once Costa starts picking up his hamstrings they're playing with 10 man. It will be an upgrade on Drogba though..

2347~~~
No, that's not what I'm suggesting. I'm saying he wanted to make absolutely sure Falcao was a busted flush before giving up on him. Not for the sake of Falcao's career but because he didn't want to lose a potentially brilliant striker without giving him enough time on the pitch to make a proper assessment. There are loads of examples of signings from abroad who have a poor first season but end up as the best players in the league. Writing someone off after their first half season would be a crazy risk to take.

2348~~~
There may be load of examples but Falcao won't be one as we didn't keep him after his first season with us. 

Fair enough for the rest of the post. My point simply is that Falcao may have been persisted with because Wilson wasn't ready to step up and be our lone striker. Also, Falcao was benched for Rooney as soon as VG had confidence starting Herrera in the midfield. IMO, it didn't matter with Falcao, the writing on the wall was there after the first couple of months. Hence, came the line that we do not have a 20 goal striker or we would be doing much better.

2349~~~
Really hoping we'll see Wilson take a big step forward next season. Hes been plagued with niggly injuries for 18 months now. A lot of which are common enough for players of his ilk.

Im sure he's continued the extra gym work he was doing which should help him avoid some of the muscle strains he was prone to.

His pace is such an asset, coupled with his finishing  I think he can make a big impact given the extra matches next season.

2350~~~
There's not giving up on someone and then there is prioritising his minutes over a younger player, which happened, the evidence was all there, should Wilson have got injured, Falcao would still have got minutes, but in the second half of the season he should have seen less minutes than Wilson I think.

How many other 30 year old odd strikers who moved to the PL for the first time at that age with a WC reputation and performed abysmally the first half of the season after returning too quickly from a bad injury then managed to turn it around for the second? Can't imagine many.

2351~~~
So where is the line then? By half way through the season, it was pretty clear that it just wasn't going to happen for him. A lot of the time he was playing badly, but even in those games where his general play was ok, he just looked totally incapable of scoring goals. And his 'recovering from injury' quickly becomes irrelevant too, since he categorically declared himself 100% fit in January.

Yet, as I said, Van Gaal persisted with him, to our serious detriment, right up to the very end of the season. With an extremely gifted and highly rated young prospect sitting on the bench and very much ready to be given his chance (and the academy and reserves staff undoubtedly singing his praises to LVG at every opportunity), are you really saying that at no point did it become 'barmy' to be mindlessly chucking Falcao on again and again and again.

What's that saying they always attribute to Einstein? 'The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.'

2352~~~
I wondered if you were serious because I can't see LvG going into the season with only Rooney and Wilson as strikers.

2353~~~
sorry Kane had around 80 something matches in his pocket before that season, and he only caught fire from early winter. even then he got burned out end of season. far too dangerous a risk that it's so hilariously illogical to think of.

2354~~~
At least one full season. Same as any other new signing from a different league.

Ideally more but the nature of the deal means the most we <i>could</i> give was that one full season, to decide whether or not he was good enough. So all the more reason to give him as many games as possible over that period of time.

2355~~~
Kane was a starter, Wilson wont be, He wont burn out.

2356~~~
I suppose when you put it like that it makes sense. Just hard to stomach for someone who has such a high opinion of Wilson's potential and is so keen to see us give him his chance asap. And there was something so futile about Falcao's performances. If anything his most promising games were his first few, and after that he just looked more and more stagnant.

2357~~~
Wilson had 3 or 4 injuries and an illness in the 2nd half of last season. A lot of the games which people thought he should have gotten a chance in he wasn't even available for given Van Gaals insistence on people playing for the u21s first after they've been injured

2358~~~
The structure of the deal was a killer really. Puts so much pressure on the player and the manager. Reminded me a bit of the Tevez cluster feck. Brought factors into team selection that everyone could do without.

2359~~~
True. Then again, we could have bought him outright for a huge fee, committed to paying him that massive salary, and he might very well have been just as hopeless, and we'd be fecked.

2360~~~
This is also true!
