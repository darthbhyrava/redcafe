Couldn't find a new thread for him. Quite easily been our most important player since Scholes retired and Fletcher got ill. He is likely the only true central midfielder in the squad that is at least above league average at his position and we are very badly missing him right now.

Hope he returns to action soon. Whether or not we make a purchase in the next week, to me him and Rafael are the two most important players in the squad because we do not have adequate back up for either of them.

Come back soon Geordie Prince!

2~~~
Carrick of 2 seasons ago can definitely come back too... that weird, crap imposter Carrick who turned up last year... well actually, he'd probably be a better alternative right now.

3~~~
He's always backed one average season with a great season. So I'm hoping this season will end up being great.

4~~~
This will end in tears.

5~~~

6~~~
Really looking forward to having him back. He'll finally have a good midfielder next to him and he won't be required to create everything for once. Think him and Herrera could be a very good pairing. If we even sign someone like Vidal, playing Carrick behind Herrera and Vidal could work really well. Hell, even playing him behind Di Maria and Herrera could be almost identical to what Madrid played last year, only with Herrera in for Modric and Carrick for Alonso.

7~~~
Problem I see is carricks 34 now. We've been trying to find a partner for carricks for years and it's got to a point we need to find his replacement. Your right he's going to be pivotal this season, but how many more has he got left in the tank.

8~~~
He's becoming 'better' in people's minds by not playing. A bit like Fletcher last year, when funnily enough, Carrick was poor.
It's suddenly "when Carrick returns..."

Most agreed a month ago that he needs to be a squad player. That's when we know we're closer to where we want to be.

9~~~
33 and reckon he has a couple of very good season left in his tank, primarily because he is fundamentally sound and takes great care of his conditioning to carry the workload he's been tasked with for his entire United career.

10~~~
That's a bad comparison because Carrick's bottom level is comfortably higher than an average day for Fletcher or Cleverley and when he does have a bit more time and space, he kills the opposition with his passing. His issues have always been when he's been isolated and the athletic midfielders try to press him for time and space. With outlets like Herrera and hopefully another good CM, he will have a much more comfortable time ahead.

11~~~
He turned 33 last month.

12~~~
you'll be eagerly awaiting for a while. He won't put in another performance again unless its predeceased by the word "awful".

13~~~

14~~~
As has been said already, when the team is playing sh1t injured and absent players suddenly become that much better than anyone on the pitch.

I'm not holding my breath that Carrick would improve matters to any extent.

15~~~
Absolutely.

16~~~
people have already forgotten that his performances were described as gutless, terrible etc.

17~~~
Did we ever find out where he was hiding last season?

18~~~
I really don't think Carrick would have made our MF look any better in the 2 openers.

I think he should come into the team and play as the centre-most CB, at least in games where we know the opposition is going to sit back.

We need someone in that back three who can comfortable carry the ball 30 yards out of defence and make a pass to a player in a more attacking position. That link between defence and midfield just isn't there. 

We also need someone with a bit of balls in midfield, who is going to take the initiative in making the risky pass, think this could then rub off on the rest of the team. I think Herrara can potentially be a player with this quality, but we could definitely do with 1 more at least.

19~~~
I am not holding out for him coming back and being anything other than completely terrible.

Our Michael isn't one for standing up and being counted when the chips are down, he is usually one of the first ones to disappear at the first signs of trouble.

20~~~
He's a slow starter. A long layoff and no preseason. Don't get your hopes up. If we are going to see the Carrick of two years ago it'll be around December.

21~~~
He's played midfield on his own for years. We'll be a much better team when he's back.

22~~~
I certainly think this is a possibility, especially for home games when we can expect to have a lot of the ball.

23~~~
Ideally he would be a bench player this season but that would have meant signing another CM. Carrick will probably never get back to his best but we still need him since the other alternatives are just dreadful.

24~~~
Definitely, amazed how much people overlook this. Our midfield has just been Michale Carrick for such a long time, if he didn't perform it didn't. He had to do everything. Eventually when the team as a whole was in a negative position it was going to catch up with us/him. If we go to a 3/diamond and he's playing with Herrera/Di Maria I think he'll show people again how good he is.

Absurd how much he's being written off when as I said he's had to be the most defensive player and the most creative player for us for ages. With players who will take responsibility to create and also help defensively, who won't just pass the ball back to him or stand sandwiched between players Carrick will look a lot better imo.

25~~~

26~~~
He needs a runner, or to be part of a 3 man, I don't think Herrera is the runner for him, so let's see what pans out.

27~~~
I think with him and Di Maria in, we will see a totally different team. 


Pace to burn across the whole of the defence. 

Rafa and Shaw offering width, 

Carrick water carrying, almost a third centre back. 

Carrick playing from deep can sit back and allow Jones to play at RCB and Rojo covering the left side. 

Herrera and Di Maria working their arses off and breaking forward. 

Mata appreciating Herrera and Di Maria's movement around and beyond him and Rooney and RVP ahead of him. 

+ Points: No Valencia or Young but genuine pace and width. 

Flexible as substitution can change the game tactically and offer plan B. E.g Januzaj for Mata and switch to 4-4-2.

28~~~
He played with Scholes sitting deep alongside in a very successful period.

29~~~
now, he's 33

30~~~
It's not like he was a great workhorse or runner even then. Depends on at what form he comes back this season though but he doesn't necessarily require a runner alongside.

Herrera works box to box hard enough anyway.

31~~~
I'm talking in today's team, the dynamic with scholes and team at the time was totally different.  Do you think a pedestrian midfielder alongside a 33 year old carrick will be good enough now?  If so fair play to you, each to their own.

32~~~
In the right setup I think Carrick can be a top player for another couple of years. His game doesn't rely on explosive pace and intensity and his experience at 33 should serve him well. He'll be back after the international break, right?

33~~~
I've never been a great fan of Michael, but he can be good if used properly. He doesn’t need one, but two runners beside to get the best out of him. 

Midfield trio of Carrick sitting deep + Di Maria and Herrera can be very effective. If one of them gets injured we're fecked though, no cover in the squad.

34~~~
For me, Carrick is the player we miss the most. The only true player in our entire squad (and now Blind I guess) who can link defence and midfield/attack. Look at Fletcher today - he hardly ever was available for the ball from our back 3. Not only will Carrick naturally take up the position to receive the ball, he has significantly more quality than Fletcher once he has it.

35~~~
when is he back?

36~~~
Not that keen for his return to be honest. Think he is due back around the end of September? He was pretty shocking last season though. This year he is just another year older. Probably a good squad option, but he won't be improving us that much.

37~~~
Yeah but we missed him a lot last season, and he played virtually every game.

38~~~
Will he be back after the international break and how many others will be back by then i suppose Shaw, Herrera and Rojo will be back by then? .

39~~~
The question is, will he play? I think if we go more offensive, he doesn't as Blind will play the DM role with Adnan or Mata as a AM in a 4-1-2-3. If we go defensive, then Blind and Carrick will play beside Herrera in a 4-2-3-1

40~~~
I think he would start with Herrera and Mata as part of midfield three with Di maria, Rooney and Rvp as three upfront, blind is more likely to play as a cover for DM/CB/LB in case we have an injury crises like we have, but i think Carrick starts when fit and he's far better than Blind for me, i suppose against City/Chelsea/Liverpool away we can pack the midfield with Blind, Carrick and Herrera otherwise it will be very Defensive.

41~~~
I think LVG will use Carrick as a CB.

42~~~
It is indeed eagerly awaited, or at least by me. He's had one poor season since he's been here, and that's when our whole team went to shit. I don't see why he can't have another great year!

43~~~
Think more likely as an anchor man in a midfield 3, occasionally acting like a 3rd center back, but mostly similar to the Busquets role in Barca. Letting Herrera and Di Maria or Mata have more freedom.

44~~~
I don't think he is due back until early October despite the fact that his boot came off this week, which is a bit of a shame because then he will need time to build up fitness. 

I think we miss him. Last season in the PL he had the second highest passes per game (behind Yaya Toure) and that tells you how involved he is in our play. In the first game against Swansea Blackett, Smalling and Jones made the highest number of passes and today it was Evans, Blackett and Jones was fourth. the defenders are seeing too much of the ball because no-one is showing themselves as an outlet. We need our CM to dictate the play. The CBs aren't going to do it. For all of the criticism people have of him Carrick is good at getting the ball forward. With Di Maria and Herrera flanking him in a midfield three he wont have to get up and down the pitch as much. 

He also gives LvG the ability to switch the system without making subs because he can drop back three when we lose possession and he can then comfortably step out and we go back to a back 4 when we are in possession. 

Carrick has the ability to play quickly between the lines. I refuse to pretend that 2012/13 never happened - he was our best and most important player imo and he will be a massive asset again if he can regain some confidence and form.

45~~~
Back in training. Excellent news.

46~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

47~~~
Good to see.

48~~~
I love how he was called every name under the sun last season but now those same people are looking forward to having him back. I agree he was below par last season but he is a great footballer and regardless of the new arrivals, will play a big role this season. I still think it will be 4 or 5 games before we see him feature though.

49~~~
No I still don't think he's good enough <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

50~~~
He's had some really good seasons and then some really bad ones. He's been our best midfielder for all these years after Scholes but that's not saying much at all.

51~~~
The really bad ones (last season aside) I think were more under appreciated. It was only Fergie's last season that he was getting the recognition, he wasn't really doing anything different though.

52~~~
Don't care what anyone says he's a quality player although I'm hopeful Blind puts him out the team the only reason that would mean he's better than Carrick and I doubt that. So under rated its frightening.

53~~~
He finally has some serious competition for his place with Blind. Can't expect to be walking into the team the next match, after putting in a few sub par performances. 

Was virtually undroppable along with Rooney, RVP and Mata. Not anymore this season. He is still a quality player and I think he has a good 2-3 years left in him in a midfield trio barring serious injury. The increased competition will do him some good and give him time to rest as well.

54~~~
From what I recall, the season where he started getting recognised was different. I remember reading an article on the BBC which compared his statistics to his time before, and there were distinct improvements in categories such as success rate, touches, forward passes vs sideways and backwards, pass completion, etc. 

Whilst I agree that he was always slightly underrated, I disagree that it was purely such. He made big improvements in that season, he was a lot better than before.

55~~~
I still worry that he isn't good enough to be a starting CM for us. Good to see that he is fit again though, no one likes players to be injured.

56~~~
Going to play a massive part this season, Carrick and Herrera (on paper) compliment each other. The latter's high energy approach should allow Carrick a bit more space to play his game. Throw in Di Maria and we have an excellent midfield 3. Might seem a bit lightweight but the quality there cannot be doubted

57~~~
Or was it last season he was being over appreciated?

58~~~
I think its just that the people were pissed off at his performances because they knew he was capable of putting in better. I doubt a lot of people would have wanted him sold. He really has been an unsung hero for us over the past few years. But unlike the past few seasons, he has cover this season in Blind, so hopefully like others have said he will get more rest, thus keeping his performances level high.

59~~~
I don't know. You might be right but my feeling has been that we was quite poor for some time, then picked up his game and people just started saying he's under-rated (which he was for some time). After that, he's been largely over-rated. He's been called the best midfielder in the PL plenty of times on here - comical really. 

And like I said, we really haven't had a proper midfield for 3-4 years now so it's no surprise he's been our best but that's nothing to be happy about.

60~~~
But he was different. I think it was RVP's indirect influence on the team - Fergie said that they (he and Phelan) understood at some point of the season that you can just hoof the ball from the back (Rooney vs Aston Villa, for example) and RVP would be ready to control it up top. I think that Carrick really missed that kind of partner for years, actually and thrived when he found one. Chicha also was capable of scoring the occasional one (there was a brilliant one against Chelsea), but not on a regular basis.

61~~~
Prior to Fergie's swansong season, I agree that Carrick was underrated by many. I always thought he did a good job for us though. However, in Fergie's last season he really took it to a different level. He really started to control matches the way he hadn't done so before. Last season was poor from him (and it stood out more because of his performances the previous year - it was a bigger drop), but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt seeing as we were so poor overall. I really hope (and believe) that he can be as influential as two years ago this season. I think LvG will get him in the right frame of mind, and he will benefit from having Blind, Di Maria and Herrera around him rather than Anderson, Cleverley, Fletcher and a 40-year-old Giggs.

62~~~
I agree that he did lift during that season but and did improve but in regards to his play, not much was different but the team was functioning around him which made him more influential and standout far more. I don't think much actually changed with his game.

Look at that pass for Hernandez against Chelsea, what a ball and what a header, there is a great assist. That happens this year, Hernandez isn't doing anything with that ball and it would be looked as the wrong option from Carrick by some. It just clicked that year. Obvious competition this year from Blind and varying systems but I think when fit, he will be a regular and in my opinion, rightly so.

63~~~
This.  He can be our non-slipping Gerrard type player, feck all running but controlling the game.

64~~~
Never been a big Carrick fan to be honest. Great range of passing, great positionally, good technique, but so many other parts of his game, especially under pressure let him down. To be fair his last season under Fergie this seemed to improve. I do think he is well suited to being the anchor man in the current set up though if we have three central midfielders. Sit there position himself well against the break and just do the simple things with the occasional surprise direct ball. I agree he needs a high energy midfielder with him which Herrera may be ideal for. i havent seen Blind play as a central midfielder, so for that reason I would start Carrick ahead of him. Once/if the majority of our squad is fit I expect him to be fighting out with Blind to play there.

65~~~
Mainly due to the lack of options around him. Cleverley hidden behind his opposite number, Mata crowded out, Rooney godknowswhere, Valencia acting as if he's doing something productive.

Our players have a distinct inability to move into, and create, space.

66~~~
Yeah, this would've been my answer too. With players like di Maria and Herrera who almost enjoy playing under pressure, Carrick will be okay I think. However it is my main gripe with the man also, he just always went into crab mode against the big teams.

67~~~
Yep. I'm quite excited to see Carrick in a Pirlo-esque role, to be honest. I think he'd thrive in such a position. Like you say, he's going to have some lovely running next to him now and that'll suit his attributes.

68~~~
I'm a big fan of his personally. Perhaps I'm slightly blind-sighted to his faults and poor games, as I immensely appreciate the type of player and midfielder he is and what he offers - same with Busquets - but I still think he can play an important role here and near enough recapture the heights he set in 2012/13. When you also consider the midfielders he will be playing alongside this season compared to previous seasons, he should be complimented far better with plenty of energy, movement and mobility around him. He needs options on the ball to provide the perfect platform for di Maria, Falcao, et al, to excel and in a team that should dictate games better he will hopefully perform well.

69~~~
Personally when we signed him and Hargreaves I wasnt excited. Thought they both bought great attributes and lacked in others. I think Carrick is one of those English players who would probably have been successful abroad in a slower paced game. The things he does well, he does do very well though and I guess we have been spoilt with the likes of Ince, Keane, Robson, Scholes the last 25 years which was such a high quality for any midfielder to add to. 
I think Carrick has had 3 or 4 spells where he has been really good, a lot of average ones and 3 or 4 spells where he has been really bad. I do think if we are playing a back three he can play an important part, especially in the short term protecting the defence, not in terms of tackling but in his positional sense. I have been overly harsh on Carrick over the years, I think a lot of people have overly praised him as well but he has been a good and more importantly successful player for us so he certainyl deserves his place in our history. I also think he always comes across very well and down to earth as a person when interviewed, which lets be honest, in todays age is becoming more and more rare

70~~~
Am I the only person who doesn't eagerly await Carrick's performances this season? I believe that 2012/13 was his peak as a player which was a wonderful season on his part. I am skeptical that he can reach that level of play again.

71~~~
I would say so. He is still a top player. Whether he reaches those peaks again isn't the issue, the issue is we need good players in the midfield and he provides that.

72~~~
I think Carrick can and will go back to his 07/08 self now that he has better players around him. 

His game is all about his reading, passing and vision...That does not go away with age. 

In fairness to the guy, he's had a lot to carry on his shoulders, in the cesspool that is our midfield. 
Now with Herrera, Di Maria and maybe *Captain Scouse, he can concentrate on that role again, as opposed to trying to keep our midfield together. 

*Just assuming Rooney will be played in midfield at some point

73~~~
Nope add me to the list. Said it in the 'unpopular opinions' thread that I don't see him getting back to the heights he reached before and I can see him declining and being phased out of the team, which is why I don't think he should be counted anymore when talking about starting midfield options.

74~~~
If we continue with today's formation then it's perfect for Carrick to step into Blind's position when needed. He'll suit the base of the diamond far more than in a midfield two. Keeping possession and intercepting passes are his two best attributes.

75~~~
Agree. Blind was great but if Carrick can get close to his form in fergies last season, which I believe he can, then he's perfect for that position. Blind and Carrick can fight it out or either play together in the tougher games, it's good to finally have some back up though.

76~~~
He'll be a fine squad player this year but I don't see the need in him anymore. We basically bought a young, not as good as he used to be, version of him in Blind, who'll probably be the squad player next year.
His legs are probably gone and his static play was one of the problems in the last few years (except 12-13, where he was great).

But he'll be great cover this year.

77~~~
Agree. I can see a midfield of Blind, Carrick and Herrera for the tough games and for the other games Blind and Carrick interchanging. Carrick is not that young so he can be saved for the big games and Blind can play week in week out.

78~~~
I really can't wait to see Carrick flanked by Herrera and Di Maria. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

With Blind in the team as well, I'm really chuffed to see we have midfield options of this quality now.

79~~~
When do we expect him healthy enough to even be considered for selection?

80~~~
The bench you mean.

81~~~
Glad to have him back but I only see him as a squad player, mostly because of age.  Blind is only 24 and I would like to see how he does with increased playing time over the course of this season while Carrick is phased out.  While he wouldn't have as many things to worry about with Herrera playing next to him, he seemed to be even more static last season that previously.  It should also be plain from his appearances as a back that he's not suited to the position at all.

I do hope that the club and the fans will give him the respect he deserves when his last day with the club comes.

82~~~
Sounds like he's still some way off making a 1st team appearance going from what LVG said in his conference. Said he needs a lot more time on the grass then a lot more training sessions and then more to get up to match speed.

83~~~
Sounded to me like he's possibly about a month away from being fit for selection.

84~~~

85~~~
Shame he's not back sooner. We could do with him and Blind behind Herrera while we're waiting for the defence to sort itself out.

86~~~
I think people are massively overstating the impact he'll have for us.

He looked past it last season and I think he won't ever give us the performances from 2 years ago again. The sole thing he'll do for us is bring in a bit of experience and the ability to calm things down a bit when we are infront, which might have saved us today. But beyond that, I think he'll be a bit like Fletcher, slow and limited and I can't see him having a bigger role than occasional sub for Blind or Herrera.

87~~~
Damn, we could do with him back now!

88~~~
I think once he comes back there is a real possibility LVG may play Herrera as a #10.

89~~~
The sooner this man is back the better. We miss his ball retention and calming play so much, especially in front of the nervous defenders we currently possess. His ability to get us out of sticky situations and taking the sting out of the opposition with clever forward passes is sorely missed.

90~~~
Not that I'd agree entirely with it but I reckon LVG will stick him at centre back.

91~~~

92~~~
Ladyman going with the same story

93~~~
Will certainly be interesting to see Carrick under LvG and the new players. Have always had a soft spot for him.

94~~~
Cracking journalism there.

95~~~
Carrick has never been that great at CB. I thought if we played 3 at the back he'd be decent enough as the middle CB, but if we keep the diamond midfield he'd be better off in the midfield.

For me Carrick is our best pure central midfielder still. Di Maria is more of an advanced player. I'd like to see him playing the deeper role with Blind and Herrera in front of him and Di Maria at the tip of the diamond.

96~~~
I am highly sceptical, after the responsibility was passed to him last season of being the main midfielder he wilted horribly. I can't bring myself to say that he's going to miraculously return to incredible form. Even after an injury - it's just to much I think.

97~~~
He's been our main midfielder since he signed. Regardless of who we've played, it's been Carrick plus another. He's carried our midfield through our most successful period ever. Fantastic player.

98~~~
There were a few periods where other midfielders played but, you are right mainly through Carricks absense. But I am sorry, I can't buy into 'he has carried our midfield' at all. It lends absolutely no credit to the roles played by Fletcher, Anderson, Hargreaves and even supporting roles from O'shea and Cleverley.

Fair play to him though, I hope he can get something back, at 33 I am not holding my breath is all I am saying.

99~~~
I think changing formation to have both Carrick and Blind sitting is the way to go in away matches and games against the big teams. Maybe a 4-3-3, with this is our midfield and attack:

Doubt that will happen though. It would mean benching Mata, Rooney and RvP, which I just cannot see happening.

100~~~
was clear as day once we bought Blind that he would play CB.

101~~~
Carrick at centre back. Jesus titty fecking christ.

102~~~
I wouldn't say so. Blind can play multiple positions, and Carrick is 33 and won't be around forever. Blind is his replacement. 

Carrick gets dominated by physical forwards when he plays at the back.

103~~~
It was passed to him the season before. He responded by being arguably our best player.

104~~~
every one of our defenders gets dominated by phisical forwards. At least Carrick can pick a pass. I dont say it is a good idea, just that i thought he would play there under van Gaal.

105~~~
Great way to improve a shite defence is to play someone who's shite in defence there.

106~~~
Think he could work in a defensive three, but if we're sticking to four at the back then no, no thank you.

107~~~
With our current injuries/suspensions we could do worse, but we have Rojo and Blind who can both play there don't we?

108~~~
Blind's no better than Carrick would be there but yeah, it'll be Rojo & Smalling if we play 2 at the back for now.

109~~~
That's definitely the pairing I'd choose. If Carrick plays at CB to keep Rojo out on the left then I can't imagine what Shaw's been doing in training.

110~~~
I meant, without the Ferguson security blanket. Granted a lot of players threw in the towel and bottled it to be fair.

111~~~
And to be honest neither should it. Hargreaves was never fit after CL season, Anderson awful, awful player, fletcher ill, o'shea a utility man who played everywhere and Cleverley did what exactly? Had a good start after community shield performance and then got injured and came back crap. Carrick only one for last few seasons who was capable of staying fit and playing any run of games to any decent standard (last year below, yes). He has carried midfield.

112~~~
Like I said, he's had his injuries and periods absent and I wholeheartedly disagree that he's carried our midfield for as far back as 2007. That quite frankly is complete fabrication.

I am happy to agree with Pogue when he said that Ferguson's last season he was incredible and I will agree that he carried it then. To go on to state that our other players were crap and injured and ill and bit part players is doing them a huge disservice. Almost rewriting periods of our history where Carrick had some equally up and down performances. 

Lets agree to disagree, as I stated - the "Carrick carried our midfield for years" paradigm. I am not buying it.

113~~~
Agreed, it's a massive overstatement. You could argue he carried it in our last title winning season but he wasn't as influential as that in any of the other seasons. For the most part, he was an important player in a midfield duo where his partner was equally important. Which is perfectly fine of course, but not exactly carrying the midfield. Yes he was consistently part of that midfield while his partner(s) varied but that doesn't mean he had to do it all on his own. Initially Scholes was at least as important as him, for a while it was Fletcher who also played a crucial role, even Giggs had a good run there and Scholes' was pretty damn good for about half a season after his comeback.

Over the entire period Carrick was the most consistent and important midfielder but rarely did he actually carry our midfield.

114~~~
From last season into this, I looked at our central midfield options and was of the opinion that only carrick deserved to be there again for this season. I'm happy that is the case.

115~~~
If he comes back, may be we can try 433.

----- DDG -----
RB CB CB Shaw
--- Carrick ---
Herrera - Blind
AJ - WR -ADM

OR

Rooney play wide instead of AJ, with Falcao and RVP fight for the striker spot.

I feel that having Carrick Herrera and Blind in midfield may be will create more stability or balance in midfield.

116~~~
He's 33 and no longer playing with greats like Scholes/Vidic/Ferdinand and for Fergie. He won't be playing under those ideal conditions and it will be a bonus if he can recapture his best form from yesteryear. I'm not expecting him to turn back the clock in any big way.

117~~~
Yeah same here. But we are still hoping that he can at least do the job for this year or may be another year.

118~~~
In what universe, after that train wreck of a season from Carrick could you deduce that he was the only one that deserved to continue this season? Puzzling.

119~~~
I think Blind and Carrick could work as a double pivot, with Ander infront, Mata or Wazza as the #10 ADM wide left, someone else on the right and Falcao / RVP as lone striker. This sounds plausible for big games, away.

120~~~
Based on last season being a one off and him deserving of a chance based on what he did two years ago. 

I'd like to see him at CB, I think he'd be better than the current options we have.

121~~~
He's a bit slow and not a great header or particularly strong. Beckenbauer could get away with it, not so sure about Carrick.

122~~~
We lack leadership and someone who can impose himself in defense, Carrick is neither of those things and he's slow and not very agile, I don't see how it would work. The thing that gets me is that by the time he's back Jones should be fit and Smalling and Rojo will have played a month together as CB's injury permitting, if LvG thinks they are all so poor as to need replacing by a 33 year old CM then surely he would have pushed harder to buy a CB in the summer.

123~~~
Based on how Rojo played I could easily see Blind at left back.  But more than anything I want to see Carrick get a chance with all our talent.  Carrick has always been about making a team tick.  He does nothing amazing by himself; He just helps the team.  And that was the issue last year, there was not much to help.

----------Carrick---------
--Herrera------diMaria--
-----------Mata----------
---Falcao------Rooney--

That is what I want to see...

124~~~
People thinking he'll have this huge impact on us will be massively disappointed, what we needed against Leicester was someone to take the game by the balls and lead us, if Carrick had played it would've have made a blind bit of difference.

125~~~
Disagree. It needed a level head, someone to dictate the tempo.

126~~~
When the going gets stuff Carrick doesn't step up, he shys away, he wouldn't have been able to do anything Blind wasn't already doing.

127~~~
That's a bit of a clichéd view, in my opinion.

Carrick has had at least three top class seasons for United, and another couple of very good ones - you don't attain those standards by shying away in the tough games.

It didn't need an emotive response on Sunday, but rather someone to put their foot on the ball and play intelligently and at the right pace. Carrick is as qualified as anyone to do that.

While we're struggling so badly with defensive issues, I wouldn't mind seeing a double pivot of Carrick and Blind, with Herrera ahead of them.

128~~~
Lots of negativity on the previous page about Carrick's potential conversion to CB. If that's LvG's plan, give it a chance - Guardiola seems to have converted a good number of players at Bayern.

129~~~
Because I didn't judge him purely on last season. I just looked at who was left last season, knew loads of money would be spent and thought who is likely to survive and deserved to play a part in new era.

130~~~
A lot? I'd probably go with "all"

131~~~
Would have been the perfect response to going 3-1 up at the weekend.

132~~~
All of Leicester's goals came from direct balls over the top, there was nothing Blind or Carrick could've done to prevent it. We needed organisation and someone to win those first balls.

133~~~
I seem to be on the same wavelength as your self playing Blind and Carrick in front of the back whilst the defence beds in and functions as a unit. 

My biggest concern with Carrick playing as a defender is lack of strength when playing against big strong forwards (Lukaku, Benteke, etc). He generally tends to get bullied. If Van Gaal decides to play with 3 central defenders I'd say Carrick would be an ideal player with his quality of distribution from the back and reading of the game.

134~~~
Yes. Another option I would have thought was one of the coaches to have come on the touchline and instructed players to play possession football and pick them of on counters. We now have an ideally suited player in Di Maria to play such a game.

135~~~
Well the thread title is wrong, I'm not eagerly awaiting his sure to be mediocre run at CB if that's really LVG's plan. And the nonsense about "wait and see" because LVG has converted players before is just that, nonsense. He's 33 and he's had runs there before, what magic will LVG weave that'll suddenly make him a competent CB that wasn't there under Fergie when he was actually a better player

136~~~
Our father who art Carrick
Hallowed be thy name
Thy return will come
Evans ill be done
in defense as it is in protection
give us this day
our holy red
and forgive those who pass it backwards.

137~~~
Amen

138~~~
Not really. They came from United defenders getting isolated in wide areas. Which is where we needed a bit more help from midfield, especially when both our full-backs were constantly getting caught upfield.

139~~~
I agree. Carrick is obviously injured, but Fletcher was sat on the bench.

Tbh though, I'm not going to slate LvG for failing to make that sub - we're all wonderful coaches with hindsight. I think he, like all of us, was probably of the view that we'd go on and extend the lead. He'll surely be more cautious if the same situation arises in the future.

140~~~
Fair point. But the likes of Carrick and Blind would've helped us keep possession better, preventing Leicester launching attacks as frequently. Once the game went to 3-2, it was noticeable how little we retained the ball.

The other thing is that holding players tend to fill in for attacking full backs, and both Rafael and Rojo left a lot of space in behind at the weekend, leaving the CBs exposed.

For tougher assignments, having the extra insurance would be prudent. Against West Ham, for instance, I think Blind on his own will be fine. Against Everton the following weekend, I'd prefer an extra conservative midfielder in alongside him.

141~~~
No they really were long balls, out wide or centrally makes no difference, they bypassed the midfield and Carrick doesn't exactly have the engine/pace to track those balls over the top to pick up 2nds. Its a case of if the defense wins them then its irrelevant.

142~~~
One of Moyes' best tactical performances last season was West Ham away - Carrick played at centre back, but it was Fellaini - from midfield - who dropped in at the relevant time to pick up Carroll.

I'm no fan of Fellaini, but he is probably a useful player to have around for these tough away games, where opposing teams are going to look to prey on our aerial weakness.

143~~~
You have to retain possession - starving Leicester of the ball prevents them from launching long balls.

Carrick would've been a good option to get his foot on the ball and play intelligently. I thought Hererra was very good for the first hour, but it become infuriating how many times he aimlessly hoofed on the edge of his own box - he panicked and all it served to do was give Leicester the ball back.

144~~~
Is LvG on crack? Carrick is never a CB. He's slow, doesn't stick in, can't head and has like zero aggression. It's a bit late as well to convert him into a CB - a position he has played handful times in his career.

145~~~
Disagree. When a fullback pushed up you rely on your central midfielders to fill in. Carrick's defensive awareness an positioning is second to none, especially when he's being asked to sit fairly deep. With him and Blind both holding we could have stopped at least two or three of those goals we conceded.

146~~~
Yeah, that's a fair point.

147~~~
For away games I'd play both Carrick and Blind in front of the defense with Herrra, Rooney, RVP/Falcao and Di Maria ahead of them.

148~~~
I honestly don't think Carrick would of made much, if any difference on Sunday, Blind did ok for the first hour so the only way Carrick might of made a difference for me was if he was brought on at that point to calm things down in posession, something he is well capable of doing, But if we got the Carrick of last season then I would doubt he would contribute to the game at all.

In regards to playing Carrick at CB, I think it could work, But it would need to be with someone like Jones who can be quite physical otherwise it wouldn't work at all, Him and the inexperience of Blackett would be a disaster IMO.
If it is true then it speaks volumes of what he thinks of the current CB selection we have

149~~~
Yup. 4231 with Falcao up top and Rooney, Mata and Di Maria behind him. Rooney and Di Maria out wide.

Would actually seriously consider Hererra as a 10 instead of Mata, come to think of it. That would give us the most solid midfield we've had in years.

150~~~
Carrick and Jones together would provide Van Gaal with the two ball playing CB he needs for a possession game. Blind in front of those two and you have a system quite similar to the Barcelona set up of Pique, Mascherano and Busquets.

151~~~
When will managers learn that Carrick is not a CB. No pace, no strength and no ability to head a ball. He is worse than useless there.

152~~~
Not that I condone using him as CB, but Carrick does have strength, you don't need pace and he can head a ball, his problem is positioning, hence why I think he should be played as a sweeper/playAmaker but I'm crazy, either way I agree he shouldn't be part of a 2 main CB, but not for the reasons you posted.

153~~~
Ball retention wasn't a problem in the first half, the players on the pitch were more than capable of playing keep ball they just lost their heads, I agree in more challenging games Carrick can be deployed along with Blind in front of the back 4 but his presence wouldve made no difference against Leicester.

154~~~
It's Leicester, we should never be playing s back 4 and 2 sitting midfielders against them, the players lost their heads and the back 4 went to pot, their goals came from defensive errors and that was the problem.

155~~~
Carrick is crap in the air, he isn't physical and you have to have that in this league. We've seen enough times how rubbish he is at the back. 

I've always been a fan of the no nonsense defenders like Vidic, Stam and Bruce. I blame the lack of world class CB these days on managers that care more about defenders that can pass a ball than defend and throw themselves at everything.

156~~~
Have you not been following Leicester this season? One of the form teams of the PL who have caused real problems for many of the best teams in the league. A gung ho approach was always going to hurt us and lo and behold, it did...

Anyway, I wasn't advocating Carrick and Blind from the start. Once it became apparent that Blackett and Rojo weren't at the races it would have been a good option. Especially once we got our noses in front. With our first choice back four we should never play two holding midfielders but we've got real problems in defence right now, so needs must.

157~~~
I agree that ball retention was no issue in the first half, and that's why we enjoyed superiority in terms of scoreline. We lost our collective cool once they made it 3-2 and we completely stopped playing football, resorting to long, aimless punts.

158~~~
I suppose he'll have his usual slow start to the season when he does get back. So by the time he finds some sort of form the season will be in the back half anyway.

159~~~
It might improve the passing from out of defence but won't improve the defending by the defence.

Not a good idea.

160~~~
Jones throws himself at everything - that's why he gets so many injuries!

161~~~
LVG loves converting players' positions - Carrick must be the one he has in mind here - maybe that's why he didn't buy another central defender

162~~~
Indeed he does. Still our best CB though. His problem is he isn't as robust as those names I mentioned.

163~~~
Carrick is too slow. Please not him at CB on his comeback game!

164~~~
Hope Carrick returns soon - really need his experience & know how in midfield - not in defence though.

165~~~
Carrick struggles against big target men at CB. He's far better in the midfield still.

166~~~
Any idea on his return date? With Herrera being out with a fractured rib we could do with him in the midfield. Although I wouldn't want him fast-tracked into the team for the Everton game, might be too soon for him.

167~~~
I would play Blind at CB and play Carrick at CDM.

168~~~
Any chance he'll be back tomorrow?

169~~~
I wouldn't have thought so.

170~~~
Think van Gaal said he is a couple weeks away from being fit.

171~~~
the sooner he return, the better for us.

blind has been doing well but still lack understanding about english football and sometimes can go missing positionally. carrick infront of the back 4 will offer better protection. he will thrive playing with players like di maria who always offer movements going forward.

172~~~
Yep Carrick is an outstanding player and hasn't had a decent midfield partner since Scholes. He will feel it much easier along side Herrera and Di Maria and Blind.

173~~~
It will be really interesting to see if Carrick will play Blind's position.

Blind today has so much time and space. If a team gives such time and space to Carrick, he can easily pick a pass...

174~~~
He'll shine in Blind's role, I am sure. Saying that, I am very pleased with Blind's performances too.

175~~~
I'd like to see him alongside Blind actually. I dont think we need to play 3 strikers. Get Falcao to lead the line. Wayne playing of his shoulder at 10. Herrera likes to surge forward in the box anyway.

176~~~
If he can get himself fit and in form he'd be a better option than blind imo.

177~~~
Nope,thus far i reckon blind and Carrick will complement each way other perfectly.

----Carrick------Blind----
---------Mata/ander---------
---------DiMaria---------
---Vanp---------Falcao---

Free floating role for Angel,added width from the full backs.

Not as mad as it might look.

178~~~
I think we would have to in the big games. We are far too open at the moment to beat any of the top teams.

179~~~
Carrick and Blind as a base is something I'm dying to see.

180~~~
I wouldn't be putting Carrick in ahead of Blind right now, for the moment he's a very good back up option to DB or someone to bring up to see out a game.

I wouldn't want to see both starting regularly together, who's position would he take? I  beleive it would hinder our creativity or goal threat too much for it to be plan A.

181~~~
Great news. Get a sub appearance against West Brom then hopefully be fit enough to start vs Chelsea, or if not them, the away game vs City.

182~~~
Good news. I just hope we get the 12/13 Carrick back.

183~~~
He starts very slowly usually and he gave us a full season of average last time out....not sure he'll be the messiah we need for those games.

184~~~
Do you think LVG will change it though? I'm not seeing much changes so far to the 2 striker formation.....If that second striker was Welbeck and working his socks off ironically I'd feel more comfortable that what RVP is serving up.

185~~~
If he's looking good in training then I think we actually <i>need </i>to play him as a base with Blind against City at the very least, acknowledging his usual slow start to a season/after an injury.

186~~~
I think we need to play Carrick for the last 30 mins for the first few games which might eradicate us completely losing control in the 2nd half in every game.....

187~~~
Its a good time to get him back, he can get some minutes vs wes brom and seeing how he is doing we may play him against chelsea and city. For van gaal match fitness is very important and you can be sure that if carrick isnt match fit we wont see him playing full games. He is still building falcao up 3 games into his season, what do you expect of carrick?

It does provide us a good option too, ander carrick, blind,valencia and fellaini(for the time being) in the midfield fighting for two places. I think it is important to have good strength on the bench too, or like today we may get pegged back. So having carrick back will be helpful in that case too. I hope he picks up philosophy of van gaal ASAP as i think hhe could atleast do a good job for this year. He is 33 now, we will need to replace carrick soon, i feel old!

188~~~
Hard to say, he wasn't exactly impressive last season, but the same could be said for a majority of our players. If he can find back to his 12-13 form, then he will certainly be a great addition to our MF.

Also, i'm curious about how he will play alongside our new MF additions. Historically, Carrick hasn't been at his best when paired with a less mobile player (like Blind) in a midfield two, but a trio of him Blind and Herrera <i>might </i>work.

His calmness, composure and ability to read the game will certainly be welcome when we face the tougher teams.

189~~~
True, but then again, he's never had a competent midfielder next to him, or hasn't for a good 4 years. Always been one of Scholes/Giggs who offered nothing defensively because of their age, or Cleverley, who just isn't very good. For once he'll be allowed to be a proper holding midfielder and dictate tempo and I think it could really improve him and get him back to his best. Won't need to go forward or close down like before.

190~~~
His composure to see out games is what we really need. The amount of games in which we could take off Herrera/one of the strikers/di Maria and have a pivot of Blind and Carrick just strolling the ball around, controlling the tempo will be great to stop us shitting ourselves.

191~~~
A truly underrated player will prove his worth when back and will shine with competent midfield partners for the first time in years.

192~~~
I thinking the same. He will be very good for us. It is such a big shame that he is already 33 but he can be at top level for 2 maybe 3 years still.

193~~~
I hope he can at least extend our control of games to the 75th or 80th minute. Falling apart after 70 every week will be tough.

Even if he ends up as back up to Blind, he's a fantastic option off the bench or to come in when games come thick and fast (which won't really happen too often). 

He'll love the way Di Maria finds space between the lines and out wide. He missed that kind of target last season.

194~~~
Hopefully he's fit for the West Brom game as I want him to be starting against Chelsea.

Assuming Herrera is fit enough to come on off the bench at least, start with a diamond of Carrick at anchor, Blind and AdM either side and Mata as #10. 

So against Chelsea,

195~~~
LVG doesn't really seem to throw people into action straight away. Usually starts with a 20 minute sub appearance. Are there any u21 games over the internationals?

196~~~
I think it'll cost us against Chelsea and City if he doesn't. We should drop a striker and play 433, but even that means one of herrera, blind or Carrick missing out.

197~~~
I'd expect to see this against Chelsea:

-------------Falcao---------
DiMaria----Mata--Valencia/Herrera
-------Blind---Carrick/Herrera

so basically a 4-2-3-1 and Herrera plays instead of whoever can't. We're not going to just naively go all Arsenal against Chelsea I don't think.

198~~~
That's if van gaal drops RvP. Most people would agree that it's the right thing to do though.

199~~~
It's just astonishing watching us struggling to get out of the pressure after those minutes. We tend to get panicking, and just lost composure when defending.

200~~~
Hope everyone keeps in mind that he's returning from a lengthy lay off. Will be slow going to regain top form.

201~~~
Awesome news. And fingers crossed just in time for our difficult run against our major rivals. I'd feel a lot better at least having the <i>option</i> of playing Carrick and Blind as a pair in a 4-2-3-1 type formation, even if we didn't start out that way.

202~~~
He won't be fit enough for Chelsea but great news nonetheless

203~~~
Decent Ogden article. I'm really looking forward to see how LVG uses Carrick. Instead of Blind or alongside?

204~~~
For the bigger game I think both Carrick and Blind will be important. His ability to control our passing game is key, as is his composure.

205~~~
Carrick strives when partnered with another skillful CM, whether with no so young Scholes and Giggs, or Cleverley. I can envisage him, diMaria, and Blind/Herrera will form an excellent combo. Carrick makes other perform better; a trait that only few players have.

206~~~
What a watery non specific point, how exactly?

207~~~
That's exactly the mystery. How on earth we could reach CL final with him and 36 y.o. Giggs in CM?

208~~~
Capable passing and a reserved approach to the game helps others shine I suppose, be nice to have another option available, especially in that DM role.

209~~~
No?
With the international break and West Brom the Chelsea game is still 20 days away, thats plenty of training time

210~~~
30-60 minutes against West Brom and then he <i>might</i> be ready for Chelsea.

Playing with 3 up front seems suicidal against the league leaders, so i hope LVG begins thinking about how to beat Chelsea and City now, starting against West Brom i'd like to see Blind given more help! 

The only player in the squad that could do this is Carrick imo, what you gain by playing Fletch or Valencia in that position is outweighed by losing a Rooney/Mata/RVP on the bench. But once Carrick is fit the choice becomes more even and its something i'd like LVG to try out asap.

211~~~
Training has nothing on a competitive match and specially one against such a tough and physical opponent.

212~~~
really looking forward to see him with better players around him. Carried our midfield 2 years ago. Especially in big games we could well use him to play the 2nd no.6 iso a striker.

213~~~
Carrick is a tremendous player with one flaw that really has stopped him being able to considered as top class - that's his inability to handle a pressing game for a sustained period. It's not to say he can't but, he needs help when pressed - when he has people moving and providing options but, if that's not available then he folds. Nothing to be ashamed of as few but, the true greats are able to deal with it.

Getting to the point - I think with the current squad, with likes of Blind, Herrera, ADM - he'll have options, if pressed he will not be forced to fold and because of that everything else he brings in terms of reading the game, controlling the pace, his passing and experience will I think be truly welcome stabilizing presence. Definitely be interesting to see if LVG uses him and Blind together because for some reason I think Blind was bought primarily due to how long Carrick was going to be out and LVG had planned to use him in the role Blind plays now. If he plays both then we lose one of our more attacking players but, that might not be a bad thing to add more confidence in the back.

214~~~
It will be interesting to see what Carrick's role will be when he returns. For me, initially, he will be such a useful option to bring on from 60+ minutes to help us close out games alongside Blind. A bit of extra composure in possession in the closing minutes of a game should prevent opposition teams building up the sort of momentum that has seen us clinging on (albeit quite admirably) recently. As others have mentioned Carrick alongside better midfield players is an interesting prospect too and with Blind in the team we may even see a more progressive Carrick going forward particularly with the movement and ability up front to target.

215~~~
It's not watery at all if you see his worth. If you don't by now, any discussion is pointless.

216~~~
I still think there is a high chance you will see him play centre back.

217~~~
It is a little odd that you've decided to quote me from like ten days ago...

218~~~
This.. since our formation is so versatile we could easily change to a more defensive 4231 by dropping one striker for Carrick and subbing off key players later on in the game if we're well in the lead. 

De Gea
Rafael-Jones-Rojo-Shaw
........Carrick(sub)-Blind 
Januzaj(sub)-Mata(sub)-Di Maria
..........Falcao/Rvp

219~~~
I think that experiment would come to a bad end very quickly. He's a last resort there, no more. I actually think he'll be starting week in, week out on his return, possibly at the expense of Blind. Form dependant, of course.

220~~~
I cant see LVG dropping Blind - he's done very well in each game he's played.  As for Carrick, i dont necessarily disagree about him not being suited to centre back, however, i dont think our manager will see it that way.  I could be wrong.

221~~~
I thought the same when we were playing 3 at the back but now we've switched to a back 4 I'd say its unlikely.

222~~~
Blind gives us energy, but at the moment, he has nowhere the tactical and positional awareness Carrick has. Be nice to see Carrick get some minutes against West Brom.

223~~~
Who knows what LVG will do ? If we were still using 3 central defenders then I would be more willing to believe that Carrick might feature in defence. Recently LVG's comments have suggested that his preference is for one right footed central defender and one left footed; in which case, Carrick would be competing with Jones, Smalling and Evans for one place. I'm struggling to see him winning that contest unless at least two of them are injured. Carrick's lack of pace is problematic if we intend to play a high line.

Personally I think having 33 year olds in midfield is hugely problematic and seems to require either the balance of the team to be changed to accommodate them, or their team-mates to adjust their games.

224~~~
Yeah, I really like Blind. But I do think Carrick on top form is a better player, and I still think it's possible he can get back to his form prior to the arrival of Moyes. Flanked by the energy of Herrera and Di Maria, Carrick could be really great. Hopefully you are wrong, I don't think I can deal with too much of Carrick at centre half!

225~~~
Personally, i dont want Smalling anywhere near our team.  He has gone backwards at a very, very quick rate.  As for Jones and Evans - neither are convincing.

226~~~
Well I, for one, am genuinely excited about seeing Carrick partner up with one or more top class central midfielders. 

Since Scholes hung up his boots the poor cnut has had to put up with a succession of "nearly but not quite" partners and had to shoulder far too much responsibility for keeping our midfield functional. Sharing the burden with smart, talented and hard-working players like Blind, Hererra and Di Marian could be exactly what he needs for an Indian summer in his career and exactly what United needs to get our central midfield back up to a level where we can compete for trophies again.

227~~~
I echo these sentiments. I was looking back at Carrick's highlights during the 2012-13 season and he was genuinely phenomenal, and that was playing in a much, much weaker team. 

I think, once he's back, he's going to have a genuine Alonso/Pirlo effect (not that he's as good as them etc. etc.).

228~~~
Bizarre that he's coming back after missing basically the whole of LVG's reign and I'm very interested to see how he fits in. Obviously he's comfortable in both CM and a little deeper but he doesn't suit the roles LVG has made for Herrera and ADM in our system. The only place I can see him fitting in is in Blind's place, unless we shift Di Maria out wide and play 2 deeper midfielders in a 4-2-3-1-ish thing.

Anyway it'll be great having him back however we use him, I'm sure he has far more to offer than he showed last year.

229~~~
Van Gaal seems like a fan of Carrick and I think he'll have a bigger part to play in our season than some think. It'll be great I have him back.

230~~~
Why? Do your opinions have some sort of built in obsolescence ?

<i>That </i>Carrick in <i>this </i>team. Yes please.

234~~~
Carricks long passing accuracy is no doubt impressive but I don't understand while he has to drive it knee or waist height, no matter what player is at the end of it, its almost impossible to control it and keep possession while being man marked. Driving it to feet would be much more ideal. 

Excited about his return, wanna see him in the Blind role.

235~~~
Very true. It'll be interesting to see how he fits him in because I'd be surprised if he's not a regular and Van Gaal doesn't seem a big one for rotation.

236~~~
Hopefully we play well against West Brom and get a good lead so he can get the last 20 minutes under his belt.

237~~~
Looking at that video above, isn't it a bit of a falsified myth that Carrick is slow? He often uses pace to catch seemingly faster players over distance. It's not an attribute associated with him because it looks so effortless, but his ability to read the game and make those long strides of his back into defense are vital for our success. His technique is also world class. If anything, he can appear a little too casual and relaxed at times, which can cause him to lose the ball or make silly misplaced passes. Overall though, he's one of those players that it took some time to realize how good he really is and how important he is to the team!

238~~~
Really? Hardly the receipe for a cohesive conversation is it? I had to check back earlier in the thread to even know why I said what I did. You're quite right my opinion won't change within the space of 10 days, so if its pointless to converse with someone holding my opinion why the feck would you quote me in the first place?

239~~~
An experienced, composed midfield player with excellent passing ability 

Of course LVG is a fan - think he and Herrera will be a great combination

240~~~
Alongside. Chelsea, City, Arsenal coming up. We need a more solid base to the midfield against quality opposition, don't we? Carrick and Blind with Herrera in front is an exciting prospect. The idea of a United central midfield in a position to control and dictate games, well, I can scarcely contain myself.

It's funny, I only wrote that 11 days ago and it now feels like the answer is obviously alongside. I'm not even sure what has changed in that time to make my mind up.

242~~~
There's nothing wrong with his passing?<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Sometimes he will send it to another player at an awkward height because he hits it with pace, especially when he plays it through the middle. It makes it harder for it to be intercepted.

243~~~
Of course it's a myth. He always lacked agility, but that's another thing, but he was never slow.

244~~~
Carrick was soooo good in the 12-13 season. He was as good a playmaker as any that season, not to mention being so critical in shielding our defence. Absolutely incredible.

245~~~
Wow, what a video, I could honestly watch that all day. Probably one of the best compilation videos I've seen. It really does highlight the amount of work that Carrick gets through, that goes largely unnoticed. The little interceptions, the quick lay offs, the one-twos too make space etc etc. Nothing too flashy, just brilliantly intelligent football.

It actually got me quite emotional watching that as the best two players, by far, were Carrick and RVP. And I have a feeling we'll never see those two hit that level again. Tempted to go and stick the 12/13 Season review on now.

246~~~
Carrick pissed on midfields in Europe for over half a decade with partners in their 30's. Embarrassing that he can't crack the England team. Sums up the English football mentality. They would rather have a star name than a player with tactical awareness, positional discipline, good technique and proper ball retention abilities.

He will return and improve our defending as a team immediately.

247~~~
Or maybe people don't rate him as highly as the Cafe.

248~~~
I love Carrick so much. This just proves I'm right.

249~~~
Yeah sorry you are right, let's return to the real question, why I let a life take me away from the caf for 10 days.

250~~~
Great video. It's amazing how quickly you can forget what you're missing. I'll never understand those who wrote him off last season. The issue was clearly the tactics, and it was obvious at the time. Anyway, I'm expecting his usual slow start to the season which might be more pronounced given its coupled with his lack of a preseason. I probably expect him to be eased back gently in and maybe hit form in the new year which I'll be glad for. It's also important to remember that he will be at the beginning of the process of learning LvGs philosophy and in that respect will be a bit behind the other lads. Looking forward to having him back though.

251~~~
I've always been a big admirer of his, but then again, I have massive appreciation for the type of midfielder he is so perhaps I am a bit blind-sighted by his weaknesses. That said, I've always felt he has been very harshly criticised on here after he demonstrating the level he is capable of reaching in our title-winning campaign. As another poster said, him and RvP were our two best outfield players and while I don't hold much hope for the latter recapturing his 2012/13 form, I see no reason why Carrick cannot.

It widely-renowned and practically notorious for Carrick to take time to hit his best form, but in a team with midfield runners and players that compliment him more than any recent season, I don't see no reason why he cannot perform to a high level again. He didn't do well enough last year and shied away from responsibility at times, but you have to take into consideration he played in a deteriorating side, a Moyes-managed side and also suffered due to tactical instruction too.

I'm under no illusions that he is well into the twilight of his career and can't be depended on, but he has become an even more pivotal player for us given the loss of experience in defensive positions and the fact he can offer tutelage to young players and guidance in difficult matches when we are under the cosh. It's probably optimism speaking, but in games that he features, 5-3 losses to midtable sides will really prove to be an anomaly and we will fare far better from winning positions.

252~~~
He'll be a huge boost now that he's finally back. Does so much defensive work that goes unnoticed, and helps control games. Nobody in our team has the ability to dictate games like he does either. The way Van Gaal talked about him in the pressers makes me think he rates him really highly and him being out was a huge loss. Now that he finally has midfield partners able to create and do defensive work like Blind and Herrera, players willing to go deep and pick up the ball, and energetic players, he has every chance to go back to his best. The only problem is the age but given Herrera and Blinds mobility, I think it'll prolong Carricks career.

Put him at the base of the diamond, Blind on the left and Herrera on the right, Di maria at a free role in the middle and that will IMO be our go to lineup in big games where we need more defensive cover. Seems like the Chelsea game will come too soon for him to start, but hopefully the City game a week later we can do something like this:
Just a great mix of passing, control, defensive workrate and players shielding the defence, and creativity and pace going forward. No players there who don't do their share of defensive work or pressing, and all very capable on the ball. In smaller games we can expect to dominate we can put him at center back next to Rojo/Jones or simply rest him to accommodate Mata/RvP.

253~~~
Good point. In theory, he will be used far more sparingly too which should be of huge benefit to him.

254~~~
The Carrick of our 20th title win would be highly welcome. The player of last season was terrible though, but that could have been down to tactics and such. I guess we'll find out soon enough.

255~~~
Yeah. Over the past what, 7 years, for the most part he's had Scholes, Giggs, Cleverley or Anderson as his midfield partner. Fletcher for that 1 year was the exception in that he had a good partner, but that coincided with Carricks shite run of form that lasted a while. Him pretty much playing every game for the past few years no doubt took its toll at times and I think being used more sparingly, along with having the creative/defensive burden lifted from his shoulders he'll be even better. 

His performances last season I'd put down to style and the general lack of movement from everyone.

256~~~
Don't want to put the cart before the horse but this lineup looks very promising on paper. Our midfield looks at least a hundred times better than last season and Di Maria, Rooney and Falcao together look deadly. My only concern would be that Di Maria wouldn't get the space and time to do what he does best, i.e. run at the defence if he plays right behind the two strikers. IMO a flatter 4-3-3 would suit him better and he can then run into the gaps created by the front three and create havoc.

If Van Gaal can somehow get the team to gel together now then we will be a formidable unit. I can see us comfortably getting Top 4 and with some luck a late challenge for the title cannot be completely ruled out.

257~~~
That video. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> passing masterclass.

258~~~
Yeah lets pretend someone who has  over 20k posts just stops in every 10 days or so. Don't reply to the rest of the post, I'm still interested in why you quoted me when it would be pointless to converse with someone holding my opinion.

259~~~
It has to be one of him or Blind, or else this shit is going to be so static and incredibly dull. I can't remember the last time I actually had more fun watching us play football, and putting Carrick and Blind in the same team and also moving Di Maria from his best position will instantly suck 90% out of it. It's almost as if people don't <i>like</i> watching good football.

260~~~
Disagree completely.

We're going to be on the end of an absolute hiding from City and Chelsea if we play Blind as the sole holding player. The likes of QPR and West Ham have just walked past our midfield in it's current state. Imagine what Fabregas or Toure might do.

I don't think it will affect us going forward either. Di Maria, Rooney and Herrera more than make up for the lack of agility of the two behind them.

261~~~
In the games against Leicester, West Ham and Everton a real feature of the closing stages of those games when we were under pressure was a lack of composure, hoofing the ball away and adding to the general panic.

We were caught out at Leicester, lucky West Ham didn't capitalise and thankfully De Gea was god-like in the Everton game

Adding a player who is composed, will help us control the game to a greater degree and use the ball well will be a welcome addition - I felt it was embarrassing how poor we were against West Ham - down to 10 men granted but we had no control over that games for the last 25 mins or so.

262~~~
Exactly, its kinda scary to think if we had a composed, cool headed midfielder he could've got the ball out of defense and turned it into an instant counter attack (considering the other team were well pushed up the pitch) this would bring back our fear factor, because even if we're sitting deep taking a beating we can strike back with some of the most deadly attacking players in the world. Now I see the fuss people have over Strootman joining <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

263~~~
Really hope he gets a run out on Monday in the second half. Will be nice to see him surrounded by good players in midfield for a change. If he can recover the type of form that he showed in that compilation we really will be formidable with Herrera/Blind and the movement of our forward players. Defensively we will be infinitely better off with Carrick at the base of the diamond as well with his frame and astute positioning.

264~~~
Don't think he ll play a pl game without even playing in 1 practice match.. Think he ll play a small role next week after the West Ham friendly.

265~~~
Can't wait to see him back for us.

266~~~
We could do with a behind closed doors friendly in midweek. Waiting until Friday for an U21s game is too late if he is to be in contention for the Chelsea match. Maybe the game against City was always the more realistic target.

267~~~

268~~~
Its a fair point. But he's been back in training for a while hasnt he? Im hoping he has been looking good in training and Van Gaal has been saving him as our surprise weapon for this game. Obviously he may well not be ready yet in which case Van Gaal wouldnt pick him. But I wouldnt rule him out purely because he hasnt played yet. If he is fit then throw him in there, at the end of the day he is going to improve us even if he's only at 80%. And he has to come back at some stage - bring him in against Chelsea and he he should look sharper for the City and Arsenal games.

269~~~
We should stick with the same team we've had for the last few weeks. Bringing Carrick in now against the best team in the league currently is a bad idea IMO. Sure use him as a sub when the pace settles down a bit, but if we start him he might get caught out. 

He could only really take Blind's position, and he has been our stand out performer for the last few games.

270~~~
No way would I bring him in in place of Blind. Im talking about playing 4-2-3-1 with Carrick next to Blind.

271~~~
It's the most logical. We'll need a great defensive performance but also attack well to win this one. Van Gaal has been talking about balance. Carrick and Blind in a 4231 formation with di maria and one striker will get us that balance.

272~~~
Only issue is that Carrick has shown (as with a lot of players) that he needs games and a run of games to find form. Thats my only concern with the Chelsea game the fact he hasnt had much/any game time. 

If he's fit I'd still 100% play him in the formation most are showing, with Blind, Herrera and Di Maria. And there are a few variations that this could work, i.e 2 sitting or diamond. 

But think he'll be key in some of these big games. Just hoping he hits the ground running, rather than a slow start. (Fergie always used to say Carrick starts the season slowly I personally disagreed and thought he just didn't get given game time to get a run going)

273~~~
Ye I think he has been back a few weeks in training, cant possibly be match fit though so it is a gamble to go with a player who is going to be 80% at best. Although, he has not been good this season, would Fletcher not be more likely to get the nod ? And Herrera also says he can play a more defensive midfield role, although Im yet to see that.

I dont have an issue with the formation and with a fully fit Carrick it makes sense but I personally wouldnt give someone their season debut in a game like this, we shall see what LvG thinks soon enough.

274~~~
Saw a thing on the official site about Will Keane saying whatever side he's on in training, that they always win because of how smart of a player he is and bow they always dominate possession. He's exactly the type of player van Gaal likes, so hopefully he'll be fit to play. Next to blind and behind herrera, di maria and then either another winger or 2 strikers, both would work IMO. Would just make us a lot more solid defensively and help us dominate possession even more.

275~~~
Remember Nani against Madrid. It just goes to show you dont always have to have matches behind you to play well. I agree its definitely a risk, I guess I just feel there are no obviously good options for making us solid against Chelsea, for me this is the least bad option. IF he is fit.

276~~~
I dont remember the specific situation with Nani? my memory is not what is used to be!
And if Carrick had just been out a few weeks then its all good, but he hasnt played competively for about 5 months!

I dont mind the formation and idea of playing more defensively, but Id go with others to start and maybe bring on Carrick. Although I am not sure if Herrera is fully fit either, he didnt look 100% on Monday after his rib injury.

277~~~
With Nani (and my memory isnt the most reliable either to be fair) he hadnt played for ages, he was like the forgotten man, and then boom, he comes in for the biggest game of the season and until he went off he was outstanding. 

Like I said though, that is how I remember it but he may have had some isolated games or at least minutes here and there. I remember being amazed when he started, it felt like the first time Id seen him in months. But he probably had picked up some minutes here and there. 

I just dont trust Fletcher. But maybe he is a better choice. Youre right about Herrera, he looked off the pace. 

Anyway Van Gaal will know better than any of us who is feeling up to it. Im just certainly looking forward to when Carrick and Blind are fit to start playing together. Maybe now isnt the time for it but when those two are available to play together itll be a really good option for these kinds of games.

278~~~

279~~~
Being out for so long, I doubt he'd be sharp. Chelsea might be too big of a test right now

280~~~
Well, Fergie always did say that Carrick usually started playing his best football by the end of October!

281~~~
There are some right c*nts tweeting in response to that tweet.

282~~~
I would have thought that he was scheduled to play for the U21's tonight! Will be interesting to see if he's involved.

283~~~
I wonder if he's playing for the U21s tonight. So far 67 pics on Getty Images from today's training and no sign of Carrick (nor Anderson, Pereira, Wilson, Blackett)

284~~~
I would think that those mentioned are involved tonight - excited to see who's playing!

285~~~

286~~~
good to know - I assume that rules him out of starting on Sunday?

LvG at press conf today

"Even, for example, I let Michael Carrick play this evening in London for the reserves [<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2014/Oct/preview-west-ham-under-21-v-man-united-under-21.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at West Ham</a>] because I believe that he needs that. He needs to play matches, especially when you are five months injured. He told me it [will be] his first appearance in the second team."

287~~~
Yeah. I would imagine that he'll get another appearance for the U21's before being considered for the first team.

288~~~
Would there be any rivers knocking about for this match?

289~~~
Subbed after 60 minutes tonight.

290~~~
How'd he look?

291~~~
Like Carrick who had been out for 5 months but was clearly playing a level far below him.

292~~~
I didn't pay attention, the match was just on in the background. Sorry! I assume he was a bit rusty though.

293~~~
I could see him pairing very well with Blind and adding sorely needed screening.

I have to admit that I was a latecomer to the Carrick bandwagon.  I thought he was better at Spurs and was horrified when Ferguson offered him his current deal.  I just didn't get it.

...yeah...clueless.

294~~~
Yeah seems he's a way off still.

295~~~
No surprise he would be rusty. Probably needs another match at that level. Throwing him in against Chelsea and City would be a potential disaster.

296~~~
Quietly went about his game, rusty but who wouldn't be?

297~~~

Not the ideal circumstances to return...

300~~~
BIG BIG game for Carrick. If he can start attacks from the back, it'll go a along way in us getting back into the game.

301~~~
Starting to look like he might be our best choice in the right cb slot, even ignoring injuries.

Sad that his main competition atm is a 19 year old thats played ... 3/4 senior games?
I'd play blackett and carrick next match i guess. Role might suit him.

302~~~
Great to see him on the pitch today. He does bring us a calm head which we need atm. Did all right at the back. With injuries and suspension I assume he will play next week?

303~~~
Let's just hope he doesn't get injured. Also quite curious how he would work out with Herrera.

304~~~
Was cool, calm and collected.

305~~~
Even at center back in his first game back, he was picking some lovely passes out between the lines. Can't wait to see more of him and I'm praying he stays fit.

306~~~
Rather have him at CB at the moment than Jones, Smalling or Evans for that matter.

Welcome back Michael.

307~~~
Class as always, he might be the best center back at the club right now.

308~~~
This is how we need to line up from now on.

309~~~
Cool, calm and collected on the ball, and I think that actually filtered through to the rest of the players as the half went on. I thought he was quality when you consider it was his first game for however long.

310~~~
Smalling and Jones could learn a thing or two from him when it comes to playing at centre back.

311~~~
Not sold on him becoming a centre back but hey if mascherano/xabi Alonso can do it then why cant Carrick?

Might work well in the style of play that LVG has implemented because clearly it asks a lot of our defenders to pick a pass and carry the ball forwards.

Good to have him back and it will be interesting to see whether we play with a midfield of Blind + Carrick supporting Rooney, Di Maria and Herrera/Janujaz/Falcao

312~~~
Superb, like he's never been away.

313~~~
Usually seems to take a while to get his shit together at the start of the season. But he picked it up pretty well today. Good to have him back.

314~~~
Composure on the ball was great to have.

315~~~
Hasn't played for 6 months, steps into a derby match out of position and looks better than our actual CB's.

316~~~
Thought he was brilliant today.
I wouldn't mind us playing him at CB if Rojo is out for a considerable amount of time
His experience will be greatly needed.

317~~~
At the buffet line?

318~~~
Something something Anderson.

319~~~
I thought he did well. What he hasn't got in physicality he makes up in understanding and game management. 

I can't get over the fact Manchester United CBs look absolutely s**t scared when the ball is anywhere near them.

320~~~
I think LVG might just make him our main CB considering that he needs CBs who are good on the ball and can pass from the back. He was great and our main CBs should be watching and learning.

Class act.

321~~~
I've seen him play much worse at centre back in 11 Vs 11s. Creditable performance given the circumstances.

322~~~
Thats the thing, we can make use of him on the ball, it'd be great to have on the pitch. 
Im not entirely convinced by him as a cb defensively (its a cliche but im not convinced hes up to the physical side, his positioning is pretty good) 
but none of our cb's are good enough defensively to make much of an argument to play them ahead of him really.
Not in their current form.
Anyway, they're injured or suspended regardless so it'll be interesting to see how it goes (if he plays cb).

He could make part of a good defence if you had the right players around him imo.
A Vidic like cb who's a bit more imposing and ... well tall for a start.

323~~~
Got a new formation:   


Like Bayern's formation at the moment. Carrick is kinda a half-CB, half-CDM like Alonso, dictating play. Rafael and Shaw provide width and Blind sits in when they do so, allowing a back line of Blind - McNair - Carrick - Rojo, if needs be. 

Note: this is not a 5-3-2.

324~~~
I think a ball playing CB is a must the way we are trying to play. We are looking to build play from the back, but our other CBs usually just pass to the player besides them and don't take the responsibility to bring the ball forward, or panic the moment some pressure is applied and punt it up the field.

I think we will improve a lot in our overall play, even if the trade off for that is that Carrick is not as good defensively as the others. Besides we are already bad defensively overall as it is, so might as well improve our build up play from the back.

325~~~
Looked great when he came on. Passing and calmness on the ball was something we've really been missing. Will be a huge boost to have him back again.

326~~~
Great to have him back. I think he should start as CB vs Palace too.

327~~~
Shame he had to come back under such circumstances. Glad to have him back though, he could still do a job.

328~~~
The best cb on the pitch today. Not bad for a midfielder who's been out for five months.

329~~~
Brilliant player, he really is. Not even sure that he's lacking that much physically either. He seemed to have Jovetic in his pocket on a run, and Jovetic is hardly sluggish. Also, he's pretty tall and good in the air.

330~~~
Said it many times in the past year & got my arse torn for saying it, but Carrick could be a top-class CB for us - if we sort out our mid-field & bring him into that position. I already rate him higher than anyone at the club at CB & he's rarely injured!

Its a no-brainer for me - Carrick at CB for the rest of his career at United..

331~~~
I don't think he'll bring anything much that Blind hasn't. Even when he had carried our CM on his back I have always felt we could do better than him.

332~~~
Oh God. Is Michael Carrick our best centre back?

333~~~
What a classy comeback.

334~~~
He can definitely be an option at CB, especially as he ages. Probably not against top opposition, but in most games he's good enough defensively with the added ability to bring the ball out and distribute from the back.

That said I'd also like to see us with a base of Blind and Carrick in CM - it would give us such a strong foundation and control over the game, and allow for the front four to do what they do.

335~~~
Top opposition like City, for example?

I've been waiting for Van Gaal to make one of thise positional swaps he's famous for. Not the most exciting idea but Carrick the CB makes a lot of sense for our new 'philosophy '. Can see him getting a run of games now. Quite nice to not be massively dependent on him in midfield. When did that last happen?

336~~~
Yeah you've got me there, but I'd still feel a bit uncomfortable going into a game with him up against a really physical or quick striker in a top side. Is he going to hold his own competing in the air from set pieces against Chelsea's giants? Is he quick enough to recover if we play with a high line and has to chase down a lightning fast striker facing his own goal? 

I might just be nit-picking but it does concern me. Certainly for most games though I think he has the ability not just to fill in at CB but to potentially make himself first choice in the position. It would be a great move from LVG - I also liked that he had the balls to put Rooney into a deeper position when required after Moyes last season had Rooney and Van Persie so high up the pitch regardless of opposition.

337~~~
I know what you mean. It makes me a wee bit uneasy thinking of him up against really powerful, athletic strikers. Mind you all our other CBs make me uneasy for various reasons so that's no reason not to give it a go!

At the end of the day, he's got an extremely intelligent approach to defending. Which can go a long way.

338~~~
He's older than Vidic but if he can convert successfully to centre back then why not?

339~~~
That ball he played out the back when 2 players were hounding was absolutely sublime. Glad to have Carrick back and I hope he returns to his 12/13 form.

340~~~
Carrick is as hench as anyone in the squad so I don't see his strength, or lack thereof, as a concern. He also reads the game better than anyone else at the club. I think he'd be the perfect foil for an athletic defensive partner like Smalling, Jones or Rojo. He could be the Rio to their Vidic. Watching Rojo try to be the last man today was painful.

341~~~
Looked really good today. It's going to be difficult for van Gaal to leave any of the midfielders out at present. Anderson doesn't count.

342~~~
I think it's more aggression he lacks. You don't see him going in for a crunching tackle, or brave head first defending. He is the modern defender in terms of reading and intercepting very well. In England I think you need both.

343~~~
I'd agree. We've lacked a commanding reader of the game back there for a while. Playing a combination of any of our other CBs is the reason there have been so many gaps in the defence and failed offside traps, imo. They're just too rash.

344~~~
I think you need a bit of both everywhere to be fair and i dont think its a lack of muscle or height or whatever that would have me worried about the physical side of his game.
Its more a mentality thing imo.
I've heard him and others like alonso say in interviews if you need to make a tackle then you screwed up or words to that effect
and i largely agree but i think he has the balance off a bit really.
Hes just TOO reluctant to make a tackle and sometimes when he just needs to put the boot in and stop an attack he'll back off and continue covering passing angles the attacker has no real intention of using (hes going to go through carrick instead).

Alonso can and will stick the boot in when needed, always felt that was carricks weakness and the thing that made him very good instead of great.

345~~~
Problem with him at Cb have been his instincts and getting bullied by physical and fast players who are rough. For example Fellaini demolished him a few times.

346~~~
I think he has a lot to offer in the role - a calm head, very good on the ball, tidy. Think he could be very good at organising the defence too but ...
Your asking a hell of a lot of whoever you put next to him.
Like they need to able to deal with the drogba's, carrolls and costas as well as the likes of sanchez and sterling.

Rafael and Blind not being a particularly imposing physical presence around him wouldn't help either.

I'd still give it a go though.

347~~~
Where do people see him fitting in if LvG plans to play him in midfield? Does he displace Blind? On the bench? I find it hard to justify that Blind should be dropped but maybe that is what will happen.

348~~~
I'm quite certain that he'll play a lot as a CB, even when our other CB's are fit for once. 

That's not because he's the perfect CB, but just because he has the quality to bring the ball out of defence. Something our other central defenders struggle to do. 
We've got phenomenal talent in attack, but even for world-class players, it's difficult to break down a side defending deep in their own half. One of our biggest problems is that teams can often counter and commit players forward, because they know if one of our CB's recovers the ball, they'll have enough time to get back into position. With Carrick at the back we'd lose some physicality but at least there'd be a composed player, with the quality to bring the ball out of the defensive area. Would bring a massive difference to our attacking game. 

Just look at the Sturridge-Suarez partnership last year. They excelled not only because of their quality on the ball, but mainly because Liverpool's system and swift transition meant they often only had to deal with one or 2 defenders each, instead of a wall of 10, standing around their own box. 
We don't have that pace in the team, but good passing can replace that. 

In games against taller strikers the manager could even opt to have him alternate with Fellaini during the game, depending on the situation.

349~~~

350~~~
I cant see Blind being dropped, personally. So I would guess Carrick's main opportunities will come starting next to him - it will be interesting to see what that looks like hopefully in the near future - or in defence. His experience and composure could be invaluable there until we strengthen.

351~~~
I would play Carrick and Blind.

We have missed Carrick I think.

Short term he might be needed at the back though...

352~~~
Blind has being excellent for me and deserves a starting spot but if Carrick can come in and do a better job I'm all for improving our squad no matter who's effected by it. Blind is young so if Carrick does displace him, he will eventually replace him either way.

353~~~
So Carrick has been called into the England squad having playing about 45mins of football this season for United. I'm a little peeved at Whoy for this. He better not get injured!

354~~~
He could do with some minutes and if Roy sticks with the diamond then he's ideal for the holding role. However it is quite something that him and Walcott make the England squad despite only just coming back from long term injuries.

355~~~
He's in the squad?? Bloody hell, where did Roy get this grand idea from?

356~~~
So he's gone from not being good enough to get in the England squad, to being good enough to get in the England squad, by literally doing nothing for 5 months?

357~~~
Yeah its very odd, I really do not get it

EDIT: Gerrard has retired thats it.

358~~~
Delph has come in since...although I think he might be injured as well...which presumably means he'll have been upgraded to captain by the time he's fit again.

359~~~

360~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I know it sounds ridiculous seeing as he's only just returned from 5 months out, but i could see where LvG is coming from if we're to move him there. Can't get consistency and composure from your current CBs? Convert your most reliable defensive midfielder. Good on the ball, experienced and an older head to partner McNair.

Will admit i was against this before the season started but it does make a lot of sense.

EDIT: Just seen the discussion about him moving to CB was an old one. Never mind.

361~~~
This England squad has nothing to do with form, clearly. Smalling's in it, and he is coming off the back of a total clownshoe performance. He's not really done anything this season anyway. Tyler Blackett is probably more worthy of a place, if he has to pick a United defender.

Has Ricky Lambert even scored a goal this season? Has Lallana done anything?

Andros Townsend is garbage. I was starting to forget that Theo Walcott even existed.

England squads are pretty grim these days.

362~~~
Why Carrick still plays for England? Has been treated like shit from a few managers but he still continues answering their calls. He might be their best player during the qualification stage, but then on Euro 2016 Woy will return from retirement Gerrard/Lampard and play him instead of Carrick.

363~~~
Gerrard will still manage to get on the plane even if he has only one leg.

364~~~
I wouldn't mind seeing Carrick at CB at this stage. What we need is consistency and experience.

365~~~
Carrick should retire from the NT to prolong his time with us.

366~~~
If Hodgson is going to play with the diamond in an effort to play all of Rooney, Sturridge and Sterling in their best positions then he needs a player that can play in front of the defence and distribute the ball. 

Carrick is still the best in the country at doing this and I think Roy realises this. Not taking Carrick to Rio was a mistake, irrespective of his poor form last season. The country has nothing like him and it's a shame.

367~~~
Was shocked to see him (and Walcott) get back into the squad so quickly. I guess any minutes Carrick plays now is good for us to get his sharpness up.

368~~~
He rarely gets picked anyway.

369~~~
Carrick picked. Walcott picked. Three left backs picked. Chambers will continue to play RB over Clyne.

Joke.

Anyway, Carrick did well as CB next to McNair I thought. Very calm, good forward passes, good reading of the game. Can see it working.

370~~~
I dont think he should play CB tomorrow. I'd rather give the rookies a go. He's coming back from a long term injury and I dont think its fair to ask that of him.

371~~~
Fraizer Campbell isn't an opponent id take lightly when considering to play Carrick at the back.

372~~~
Who of our CBs is fit? Is McNair up and running again? If not we hardly have any other option than playing Carrick as a CB, do we?

373~~~
Our fit and available CB's are McNair, Blackett and Thorpe.

10 league appearances between them. A sad state of affairs...

374~~~
Didn't he retire after missing out on 2010 WC or 2012 Euros? only to come back and miss out on 2014 WC. Why would he want to play for England again??

To think how under used Carrick and Scholes have been, two players who would be celebrated if they played for technically astute countries, yet are shunned by England.

375~~~
Doubt Carrick will even play. Don't know why Hodgson called him up.

376~~~
Only reason I can imagine is because they feel bad for leaving him out and he needs some rhythm. LvG made him play with the reservers which was new form him, he might think it´s better to train with an England squad than with Ando, Pereira and McNair at Carrington.

377~~~
Maybe because he loves representing his country and takes great pride in getting the opportunity to put on an England shirt whether on the pitch or on the sideline.

378~~~
Why would he previously retire than?

379~~~
He doesn't have many disciplined midfielders at his disposal. Can't think of a calm head who could play for England in the centre.

That doesn't mean I think Carrick will play, but it's obvious why he's straight in the squad now he's fit.

380~~~
I think he'll play......very late but i think Hodgson has realised that he needs Carrick for his diamond system

381~~~
I've missed him. Easily our best player in the first half, altough that's not saying much, but still, he was off for almost half a year.

382~~~
The only player that tried forcing anything in the game.

383~~~
van Persie must be delighted he's back, we've lacked that pass into him and Carrick seems to find him at every opportunity.

Reassuring performance from Carrick.

384~~~
Good performance considering this was his first full game in a long time. Looking forward to the game where he partners Blind in the midfield.

385~~~
Shame RvP still couldn't do anything when having that sort of service.

386~~~
Did fine for his first start of the season, looked sharp on the ball.

387~~~
Was typical Carrick performance today. Calm, composed, and controlled the game from deep. We've got no one else in our team who plays those penetrative passes through the middle of the park that takes out like 4/5 of the opposition player.

388~~~
Class today, we've really missed him this season. His added height, muscle and composure in midfield, not to mention his brilliant and incisive passing. Think an energetic midfielder like herrera would be great next to him too.

389~~~
Half a page after a very good performance in his first league game since last May? Wow. 

He's an excellent passer and will get better. Just in time for the xmas season fixtures.

390~~~
Glad he's back! Will be a key figure for us for the remainder of the season and did very well on his return. Love those first time passes to feet.

391~~~
He and Shaw were far and away our best players (with a passing nod to McNair) - the fact that we dropped off so dramatically in midfield as soon as he had to go back to centre-back was quite telling I thought.

392~~~
Agree, if he plays it has to be in midfield he's wasted in defence, which means Blind will have to be dropped or accommodated elsewhere .

393~~~
Why exactly? Blind is the better player. Controlling a game is all well and good but it isnt exactly impressive when the opposition have no intention whatsoever of getting out of their own half. He's a good backup to Daley or a player to bring on to kill a tight game off.

394~~~
Glad to see him back, he did well when he came against City and put in good performance on Saturday second only to Shaw who was the best player on the pitch. Think he will keep his place against Arsenal so be interesting to see how we line up in midfield if by some miracle we actually have some centre halves available at that time.

395~~~
Carrick is a better CM than Blind, Blind keeps it nice and tidy and i do rate him but imo Carrick offers more in that position. With his passing he could be our Pirlo (obviously not as good as him).

396~~~
I like Blind a lot - he's been very good for us so far, and could well be my favourite of the signings we've made... but he's done nothing so far to show he's as good as Carrick was 2 seasons ago... so if Carrick can get back to that level (and I don't see why he can't) then he should be our starting option.

Also, your description for controlling a game is <i>exactly</i> what Blind is good at. He's nowhere near as incisive as an on-form Carrick is.

397~~~
Thought Carrick looked excellent for first game back.

398~~~
Carrick is quite comfortably the better player.

399~~~
Sorry should have clarified a bit better. I was talking specifically about Saturdays game. I'm saying whoever played in that position would have had an easy ride controlling the game, I don't think we can take anything away from that performance in terms of the deeplying midfielder to be honest, for me the praise is a little over the top.

400~~~
Something happened in the summer of 2012, ever since the beginning of that season he started playing really incisive passes.

401~~~
Injured his groin on England duty.

402~~~
F'ing typical.

403~~~
FEEECCKKK

404~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously, one can just laugh.

405~~~
Great.

406~~~
Carrick should never have gone to play for England. Absolute joke that this has happened.

407~~~
ffs

408~~~
Absolute joke !

409~~~
I cant believe he didnt tell them to feck off after being dropped from the WC squad. Should focus his remaining career here.

410~~~

411~~~
If I didn't laugh I would cry myself into a coma

412~~~
And so it continues.   We are going to have to buy in January just to have enough players to field a team.

413~~~
Is there any chance that he's faking it so he doesn't have to go on international duty? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

414~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> just cba now......

He better be fit for Arsenal!

417~~~
Jesus titty-fecking christ. Hopefully the scan is to make a decision about whether he's ok for England.

418~~~
You've gotta be kidding me?

Can we sign a new squad? And ask for warranty for each player we sign?

419~~~
Christ on a bike. Might as well just shut down the whole fecking operation we got going on here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

420~~~
Absolute stupidity to join up with the england squad after two games back

421~~~
Now even our traditionally not injury prone players are getting injured?
fecking England duty.

422~~~
I know that playing for their country means a lot to the players but I don't see a chance in hell SAF would have let him go this time. I am not really blaming Lvg but I was genuinely pissed when Carrick was picked in the squad and now he gets injured. Carrick has been repeatedly fecked over by England, he had a poor season so wasn't picked in the world cup squad even though a lot of non performers got picked. Now he has played 1 game after a 4 month injury lay off and suddenly the same manager decides that he wants to pick him. He will probably play a few qualifiers and then be dropped because he is too old.

423~~~
Our injuries are getting beyond a joke now. What the hell is going on?!

424~~~
Why the F was he even called up? He has started one game all season and was overlooked for the WC.

425~~~
Ah well, at least we've got another few weeks to overrate him even further upon his return to first team football.  <span style="color: #ffffff">Fishhhhhhh!!</span>

426~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

427~~~
Never picked.... Why the feck is this happening..

428~~~
what can you say.......

429~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ffs

430~~~
You know how you can sign a goalkeeper outside the window due to an injury crisis... surely we can now do this for a centre-back?

431~~~
He hasnt had the scan yet, maybe it wont be as serious as feared. 

I dont know who Im trying to kid here.

432~~~
He was doomed from the moment he played CB. Blind's fitness is on borrowed time.

433~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

434~~~
This season seems unnaturally fecked up when it comes to injuries. I mean, we seem to have injury crisis' often but this season it seems a lot worse than even those lofty standards. It's gotten to the point where no injury news even surprises me.

435~~~
I say cancel all training sessions, warm up and warm downs - The Sunday league way.

436~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

437~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

438~~~
Is anyone bothered ? He hasn't been a part of this year and probably won't play a relevant factor even if he was fit.

439~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

440~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We laugh now but the Netherlands play in a couple of hours <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

442~~~
Should get Anderson in there asap then.

443~~~
Did United hire Arsenal's medical team for this season?

444~~~
I was and still am hoping he can be a factor for us. We're short of options at that defensive holding midfield position, it's basically just Blind. Really miss Carrick's forward passing and defensive presence in front of the back four. A blow if he is out for long.

445~~~
That's exactly what I thought. He should have told Woy where to stick it!

446~~~
Woy, Woy, Woy does this happen to us? Looked good in his 2 games back as well!

447~~~
Another injury, FFS! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Really hope Michael is back for the Arsenal game.

448~~~

449~~~
I'm not so much bothered about him in particular, more so that we're averaging over a player a week in injuries.

450~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

451~~~
Exactly.
How the bloody hell did he get called up!?

At least he's got best part of 2 weeks until the next game

452~~~
He should retire from England.

It's not like they pick him for the important stuff anyway.

453~~~
This just blows. I thought England was super happy with Stevie Me playing the holding role recently, unlucky for us Hodgson decided to use his head for once.

454~~~
Just to take the edge off that stat it works out at over 3 injuries per competitive match... Wait...

455~~~
Slippy Steve retired after the World Cup <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

In fact it's all his fault when you think about it...

456~~~
Couldn't give a f*ck about injuries at this stage, I'm beyond caring.

457~~~
Oh yes, forgot about it. To be fair that was an utterly forgettable international career anyways.

458~~~
Not sure why people are crying about him joining up in the first place. He's played twice and it would've been great for us for him to get more match fit before the next game

459~~~
I think he's being smart. He doesn't want to risk getting an injury so he is saying he is 'injured' to not play. That's right, I've decided to take the optimistic approach.

460~~~
For. Feck. Sake.

Why call him up?

461~~~
Being the drummer of Spinal Tap seems a safer option than playing at centre back for United.

No doubt Carrick pulled up in an bizzare gardening accident.

462~~~
Why didn't he retire ? What's there to gain for him and for England to call him up ?

463~~~
I think this as well, he most likely wouldn't of started anyways, so hes better off just going back to Manchester and training there with the other players who are coming back from injury. 
(Now waiting to hear the reports hes out for the rest of the season).

464~~~
He was needed to pull England through our perilous group <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

465~~~

466~~~
Happy because now Woy will play Gerrard as a holding midfielder instead of Carrick against us (Slovenia). I just hope it is really minor and he will be fit for Arsenal game.

467~~~
Gerrard has retired from England!

468~~~
Oh crap...

469~~~
Hopefully it's a fake injury so he can avoid sitting on the bench

470~~~
Sounds like he felt a tingle up his scrotum and decided to have it away on his toes sharpish before it turned into an actual injury, now he can get his nuts massaged at Carrington for 2 weeks and be ready for the Arsenal game.

471~~~
I have to think this is it, a a bogus injury scare to deprive Roy of the pleasure of seeing Carrick rot on the England bench.

Different manager of course, but didn't you Brits repeatedly overlook Scholes for England duty?

472~~~
We've actually only been slightly better than you on the injury front in recent years, it just seems this season we've gotten as bad. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

473~~~
Spot on

474~~~
So he's fit for Arsenal then. Who cares about anything else? At his age, I think missing international duty is a good thing.

475~~~
'Hopefully' fit anyway. You would have thought he might consider this a warning of the risks of international football at his age.

476~~~
fecking Hodgeson, how can you mistake Carrick for Sturridge you dick.

477~~~
Hopefully the Carrick injury is a "united player injured just before mid season international game" injury.

478~~~
Not overlooked. Just wasted in favour of inferior players.

479~~~
One hell of a scrotum that. And to think he has won so much throughout his career despite this disability. Respect.

480~~~
Wow. Whoever put that hex on our centerback positions really did a damn good job. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

481~~~
Great. THis ruined my morning. It seems every fu.king one of our players will get at least one injury this season. Not to mention Carrick played as CB, that position is obviously cursed. 
I'm praying for Blind.

482~~~
<b>Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick is hopeful he will sign a new contract at Old Trafford after the turn of the year.</b>

Carrick pulled out of England's squad for the double-header against Slovenia and Scotland after suffering a groin injury in training.

The 33-year-old will start his rehabilitation at Carrington later this week and United boss Louis van Gaal will aim to have Carrick fully fit by the time his team take on Arsenal a week on Sunday.

Carrick has only played twice for Van Gaal because of an ankle injury he suffered just before the Dutchman took over.

But he is more than happy with life under the former Ajax coach and he is keen to extend his contract, which expires next summer.

Carrick suffered an ankle injury just before Van Gaal flew into Manchester after guiding The Netherlands to third place in the World Cup, but he has been impressed with the new coaching staff.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9562136/premier-league-manchester-uniteds-michael-carrick-hopes-to-sign-new-contract" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...ds-michael-carrick-hopes-to-sign-new-contract</a>

483~~~
He'll only get a rolling 12 months, I would have thought?

484~~~
Check his record - one if the first names of  the sheet and a fixture I  so many champions league games. His tenure will be appreciated more in the years ahead. We were true European heavyweights with him as the anchor.

This injury seems minor.  I bet he plays against L'arse. I guess they aren't really that french these days.

485~~~
this is so frustrating. hope he is fit for arsenal. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

486~~~
Well, everyone here who knows a bit of voodoo, please start doing your thing to keep our team fit now. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

487~~~
Around this time last year didn't Moyes give him a 2 year extension?

488~~~
It's mostly Le Toon filling that role these days.

489~~~
Frustrating that he's picked up another injury. Just getting himself upto full match fitness and working has way back into form and now another set-back. Wonder if we rushed him back too soon.

490~~~
Disappointing as a midfield pivot of him and Blind would of given a solid base in front of our weak defence.

491~~~
Oh Jesus, how frustrating is this!

492~~~
Hopefully just a precaution rather than a real injury.

Bizarre calling him up in the first place.

493~~~
What I'm most bothered about though more than anything, is that we're going to have yet another new back 4 when we play Arsenal next week.

494~~~
Sell the players, invest in robots.

495~~~
I believe it was a 1+1 year extension with the club having the option to activate the second year extension. Moyes was glad about it but it seems Woodward and the board were already considering the possibility of a new manager coming in and assessing the squad. LvG has always spoken very highly of Carrick, so it seems logical that his contract will be extended until the summer of 2016.

496~~~
Thanks for the clarification. I think LvG realises the value of experience and I know Carrick isn't the most vocal, but leadership too especially as we have got quite a young squad now. Warren Joyce was full of praise for him the other day.

497~~~
Fixed <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

498~~~
Reinvent ourselves as a Speedball II team.

499~~~
That'll probably be his limit. He'll be 35 in July 2016.

500~~~
Good thing we have Blind, we should be looking at one more of that type next summer. 
EDIT: Unless one of the young ones can step up.

501~~~
His the experience our team lacks, gutted his injured but will be vital for us in the race for top 4!

502~~~
I think he still has this season left in him...maybe next. We need to shore that position up quickly.

503~~~
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Roy Hodgson on the bad run of injuries England players have had of late</b></span>
"We've had two injuries like this in training.
Daniel Sturridge was the first and now Leighton.
<b>Michael Carrick felt he could get through his problem initially, but then pulled out. It certainly wasn't something he picked up in any of our training sessions.</b>
I think Leighton Baines's injury might be the accumulation of Everton playing a lot of games recently."

504~~~
Youri Tielemans bought and loaned back for one more season would be ideal.

505~~~
Are we going to have to resort to Anderson?

506~~~
I loved that game!

507~~~
Sounds to me like Roy is starting to defend himself from criticisms that his England training is dated and too intense.

508~~~
I think we should just quit the Premier League and join a local five-a-side league.

509~~~
4 would get injured and we'd end up playing against a wall before the ball rebounded into our faces and kept us out entirely.

510~~~
We'll have to see if Carrick will be ready for Arsenal or not; however, things don't look too good as physioroom.com and premierinjuries.com both don't have a return date for him. At this stage and age, it might be difficult for Carrick to establish himself in the first team let alone get to his best (given how long he takes to get to his best).

511~~~
Do we have 5 fit players though? I doubt it.

512~~~
He absolutely has to play against arsenal. He  barely ever sprints anyway. He should be fine

513~~~
#visionary

514~~~
This. Even if he's at 90% he has to play, without Blind we don't have anyone else who can play in that role.

515~~~
I'll tell you your future for a fiver

516~~~
he should be given a new contract. sort of player that could play till his late thirties in a deeper midfield role (i.e. the anchor in a 4-3-3).

one of the most under-rated united players, ever.

517~~~
No he shouldn't!!!

He has played against Arsenal (at Old Trafford) last season and was far away from fit.....BOOM.....out for the next 2 months

I know there are never 100% fit players on the field for a match.....but with Blind now out for the next 4-6 weeks.......we're needing Carrick more for the weeks after the Arsenal match then for the Arsenal match

Di Maria - Fellaini - Herrera should be at least on the same level against a poor (at the moment) Arsenal midfield

518~~~
I would think Carrick is needed more vs Arsenal because of Arsenal's midfield's movement. The 'physical aspect pf PL' because of which Fellaini is starting last few games, it is not a threat vs Arsenal. If Carrick is not 100% then yeah, I won't want him to be risked given we have some key fixtures till Blind returns, but if fit, he should start along with Herrera and Di Maria in midfield. This is also a match where we can go back to diamond without worrying too much about opposition utilizing flanks. This depends a bit on who starts for Arsenal though. If Ox and Walcott both start, then we will need to take different approach.

519~~~
Nostradamus <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

520~~~
I love Carrick but he is near non-existent out there. Isn't getting involved at all.

521~~~
Hard for him to get involved when the back 3 are under so much pressure and cant properly pass the ball out from the back.

Its just a ridiculous set up by LVG when we could so easily play a 4-5-1 or 4-3-3 instead. Carrick would be able to dictate the game instead of running around trying to cover 2 or 3 midfielders at once.

522~~~
He needs to come deeper. The back three have no one to pass to.

523~~~
You can see how Blind has brought much more movement and an ability to get the ball of the back quickly.

Carrick has looked so slow.

524~~~
Nothing to do with Blind. This formation is farcical.

525~~~
No suprise, against quality who presses he disappears.

526~~~
He needs a partner, he alone cannot do everything.

527~~~
A boat of calmness in a sea of chaotic shit.

English was never my strongest subject in school.

528~~~
I gave him stick a fortnight ago, but credit where due...he was the man today. Good show!

529~~~
Experienced head and what-not, but invisible when it gets tough.

530~~~
This.

Was anonymous in the first half, but fortunately he turned up to the second. It's clear why Van Gaal was disappointed when he was injured.

531~~~
Our midfield certainly didn't help out our young defenders when they were in possession. Carrick should be demanding the ball off them and then dictating the play. He managed to complete 19 passes out of 24 attempted.

I wasn't impressed at all.

532~~~
Was it Carrick that lost Giroud for the goal?

533~~~
Made the right passes, was in the right positions and most importantly he organized a shitstorm of a defence/midfield into a functioning unit. He was my quiet MoTM today. Oh how we've missed him. It's a shame he has lost every bit of pace he's ever had tho.

534~~~
Like most of the players tonight I thought he was pretty poor but he was better in the second half.

He did make a fantastic block at the very end of the game thought which was pretty much the final action of the game. Hopefully if he stays fit he'll add some calmness to the midfield and we won't miss Blind as much as we all feared.

535~~~
Giroud was initially marked by Carrick then ran into McNair's zone. Both seemed asleep.

536~~~
feck.in.hell.

537~~~
Still coming back from a long injury but I think that was a perfectly reasonable performance. Did things quietly and efficiently.

538~~~
Too much of the central play went through Fellaini, although he, too, was pretty good.

Carrick was indispensable in seeing out the game.

539~~~
Made a couple of good blocks I think. Started slowly but got better I thought. Probably could have done better for their goal but not too bad overall.

540~~~
Put in a good performance, didn't get too much time on the ball which did limit his influence a little but thought he did his job well.

541~~~
Good to have Carra back. He has a settling influence on the midfield and was a good foil for Fellaini's more physical play.

542~~~
Monster block in the end. Such a great player to have infront of a young defense.

543~~~
He went into hiding for most of the first half rather than giving a passing outlet for the defence.

544~~~
Agreed, although this needs to be the last season where we rely in him this heavily IMO.

545~~~
Yeah I thought he was poor in the first half too. But he impressed me in the second, especially with a few big blocks.

546~~~
Grew into the game yesterday. Started off well off the pace but by the end was controlling the game quite nicely.

547~~~
Horseshit on two levels. Was influential against Arsenal yesterday and has been so on many many times against "quality who presses" in the past.

548~~~
Nah. Influential in what way exactly? Completely overshadowed by Fellaini both offensively and defensively. Gave the defense absolutely no outlet when they had the ball in that first half, got the wrong side for Girouds goal.

549~~~
Offered protection for Blacket. Was immense yesterday.

550~~~
Disagree with so much of that there's really no point trying to pick it apart. He put in a decent performance. Struggled with the formation initially (just like everyone else) but did everything we needed from him for the last hour or so. A solid 6 or 7 out of 10. "Disappeared" my hole.

551~~~
That's a wind-up, right? That beggars belief.

552~~~
He disappeared yesterday, but there's not much point having a go at the one midfielder in the team for not being able to be a one man midfield, when there is no player on earth who could possibly do this. Blind hasn't been able to do it and his performances in general have been quite good.

553~~~
I wonder how Blind would have done instead of Carrick yesterday. Blind always offers an option for the defence to pass a ball forward, but Carrick seemed to be struggling to find space. Perhaps Blind would have done no better as Arsenal's game plan was obviously to press us high. The 3 CBs were certainly struggling for forward options at times though. You could see Blackett complaining about it a few times, as he aimlessly lobbed the ball forward while under pressure.

554~~~
Seeing as almost everyone else in the last page or two agrees, it doesn't seem like it! He's always had that flaw in his game. Against a top pressing side, he loses his influence and shies away for large portions of matches.

555~~~
He seems to be the only player that can do feck all and fans will still praise.

556~~~
Nani, Kagawa and many others got praised for similar.....

557~~~
That would have been Kagawa. I seem to recall you being wedged firmly up his backside.

Carrick was decent yesterday. Started poorly like the rest of the team but improved from then on.

558~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

559~~~
I don't think he'd have done too much better as a) we were a mess, and B) despite playing well, he basically hasn't done too much better in previous games. 

It's the system of playing with only one person in midfield while everyone else just runs off that's broken. Not whoever the one player is. If anything in previous games, Blind making himself available has put us under more pressure as he gets the ball, looks round, and there's no one other than Chris Smalling or De Gea to pass it to. Yesterday we were just hoofing it, but that's actually slightly less stupid than repeatedly passing the ball to the opposition midway inside your own half.

I think Carrick's positioning is still better than Blind's too. A couple of times I noticed him in the sense that there was a player in the way of the opposition being able to just run at our centrebacks or get a free shot in, when previously there hasn't been.

560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

561~~~
Didn't think he was particularly good, but appeared to be in the right places when gaps in the back three were opening.

562~~~
With minutes under his belt he will do the role Blind has been doing but better, not having a go at Blind but Carrick is the better midfielder.

563~~~
Don't think Blind would've been any better. With three at the back, their usual position is already occupied so its harder to get on the ball. Plus his positioning and passing is better than Blind's.

564~~~
His positioning is no way better than Blind's.

565~~~
I think he was decent at best, I prefer Blind strongly. Blind seems to be much more involved in the build up.

566~~~
There are similarities between them and Blind is Carricks successor even if the latter is still playing. Good to have 2 players capable playing the no. 6 role in a way LVG likes it. We won't see both on a pitch at the same time too often unless our injury luck continues.

567~~~
Some of his blocks at the end were amazing, one of the interceptions led to the second goal.

568~~~
After the horror-show of the first 20/25 minutes, Carrick was excellent defensively - I'm definitely in the "his positioning is better than Blind's" camp... Blind always seems to be running around, getting into positions to make blocks/interceptions, whilst Carrick just seems to already be there... but then Carrick has always had a brilliant knack for that.

569~~~
Carrick was pretty good after the opening twenty minutes, but Blind offers the same and more. Happy to think of Carrick as capable back-up, though.

570~~~
Blind's passing is nowhere near as incisive as a fully fit Carrick. Whether Carrick will ever reach full fitness is another matter.

571~~~
Against some of the better sides assuming we qualify for Europe next year, I wouldn't be against seeing a double #6 pivot of Carrick and Blind.

Carrick was great for me, and has been hugely missed. I'm a massive fan of Blind (I think he's the most important signing we made in the summer), but Carrick has been the only consistent and arguably the best United midfielder in our best ever period. So under-rated.

572~~~

573~~~
I think that's partly because Carrick is a lot quicker. Doesn't always look it but those long legs really eat up the ground and I think Blind is actually relatively slow (which is why he often looks like he's having to work really hard to get back in position)

574~~~
Stop kidding yourself, Blind is very much as good a passer, as accurate and more forward too, and Blind is very comfortable when pressed,  Carrick suffers when he's pressed.

575~~~
Chinos <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

576~~~
Blind is a lot more attacking minded as well for his role. So a few moments of him popping up on the left wing to deliver a cross or making a late run into the box for a shot are not rare. Carrick does far less of those things so he's always in his zone.

577~~~
I can't believe people are even going to contest their passing ability. Carrick of 12/13 had the best passing range of any player in the league. He ended the season with a 91.5% pass completion rate. I agree he does panic slightly when pressed but Blind does not have the passing range that Carrick has.

578~~~
That and mobility are the biggest advantages Blind has over Carrick. As far as incisive passing, I'll have to see more of Blind to say they're equal. Carrick is pretty incisive, he better be given his natural position as an attacking mid. People forget he began and shone as an attacking mid, and his performances there being the reason we bought him from Spurs.

579~~~
It's up for debate because it's not clear, is it?. What matters is the here and now, not what he did 2 years ago. Carrick is a fine midfielder, with great passing range but Blind is as good a passer, and is far better under pressure. Defensively though, Carrick is stronger [physically and positionally] and is more experienced.

580~~~
Yep I agree with this to be honest. Right now I'd have Blind ahead of Carrick when fit because we have Herrera/Fellaini/Di Maria who can all provide forward passes whilst Blind can do the running and defensive work, however if Carrick does come back to full fitness I'd be tempted to play him in games where we need to take control of the midfield.

581~~~
I like Blind but I've seen very little to suggest he's as good a passer as Carrick. He may be more adventurous as time goes on and the movement around him keeps improving but for now he's keeping it pretty simple and doing his job well.

582~~~
Blind a better passer under pressure? I don't see much to support that claim.

He's lost the ball several times in his short United career, sometimes leading to dangerous situations. Carrick rarely does the same.

583~~~
Carrick under pressure rarely makes a half-turn to attempt a forward pass, he immediately plays it backwards, which encourages the other team to keep pressing and we end up playing hoof-ball from defense. He won't lose the ball but we wont make any progress in the game either.

584~~~
Fair enough, but Blind isn't really different.  The way people talk, you'd imagine Blind is this excellent technical playmaker who glides past a guy or two before sending a killer pass to one of our forwards. I think the praise has been way over the top; he, like Carrick, is too fond of the easy choice, as pointed out by Gary Neville.

585~~~
I rate Blind as the better player at this point. I'd rather play 25 year old Blind who has a fantastic engine and an underrated passing game than Carrick on a game-to-game basis.

586~~~
Brilliant again. He offers us more  on the ball than any of our other central midfielders.

587~~~
His intelligence on the pitch is a blessing. Excellent half.

588~~~
Acres to play in but his passing has been class, just dictating it so easily from deep.

589~~~
He is an amazing player to watch on form. Controls the game from the deep and makes us tick. Has amazing ability to spot the run of the striker and make the jaw dropping pass. 

Glad he is back.

590~~~
Class. The perfect player for van gaals style

591~~~
He's playing a Pirlo type role at the minute. Absolute class.

592~~~
He's better than Blind, less mobile but better positioning and his passing is a lot sharper.

593~~~
Well on his way to 100+ passes for the second home game in a row. Van Gaal will love a player like that.

594~~~
Woof

595~~~
Shame he didn't get an assist. He was immense.

596~~~
The way he dictates the tempo of the passing, picking the moments to quicken the pace and flash the ball forward into one of the strikers...class.

597~~~
Imperious today.Caln and composed on the ball,excellent passing including 3 fantastic long balls forward and didn't put a foot wrong in defense.Such an asset when he's in this kind of form.

598~~~
Shows what have we been missing in the team. His passing was immense. He accelerates the play at will.

599~~~
My MOTM. As soon as Fletcher came on and there was a shuffle you could notice the difference. He is just fantastic at drilling those forward passes between opposition lines.

600~~~
Masterclass.

601~~~
Went back in time a couple of years today, hopefully he can keep injury-free while Blind is out.

602~~~
He had that aura about him today that you used to get when watching Pirlo or Xavi. Just a masterful performance and everyone on the pitch knew it.

603~~~
Excellent once again. Back to his best.
Too many were silly to write him off based on last season. Last season was a freak. I bet even the tea lady had a 'mare.

604~~~
The quiet engine ticks over smoothly.

605~~~
I guess people will realize now what Gary was talking about when he pointed out Blind's deficiencies on MNF. Carrick's passing, positioning and calmness has made a marked difference from the beginning of the season with Blind playing there.

Blind is a very good player, a huge upgrade on Cleverley or Anderson or Fletcher, but he is no Carrick.

606~~~
World class performance. That was a vintage Michael Carrick display. 

Perfect for van Gaal's system if we can avoid further injuries.

607~~~
Michael Carrick went in today. Everything he did was on point. Very pleased to have him back.

608~~~
All of this. 

A few years ago we had Scholes pulling the strings with Hargreaves/Fletcher/Carrick/Cleverley as the more mobile midfielders winning the ball back and giving him time on the ball to spray it about, Carrick fulfilled that role superbly today. The combination for the van Persie header was 12/13 standard from both. I gave him MOTM.

609~~~
Delighted he has come back in his best form. Looks like the player of a few years ago. I was concerned for him after missing pre-season that he would never really get up and running this year.

610~~~
Class. Getting back to his best.

611~~~
That's what he's capable of when he has a bit of time on the ball and good movement ahead of him. Brilliant performance.

612~~~
Blind can learn so much from Carrick. I hope he can keep this up and stay for at least another year.

613~~~
Always felt he'd be better in a holding role, dictating tempo from deep, rather than the midfield 2 Fergie always put him in. World class today, and we've really missed his passing and experience this season.

614~~~
He's better than Blind. Less mobile/energetic but has a better positional sense and his passing is a lot sharper (he fizzes them in with a lot more pace and the same accuracy).

615~~~
Unsurprisingly, he plays very well when at the base of midfield surrounded by energy. He was somewhat shafted last season. We'd sometimes be playing two central defenders dead deep, a flat two man midfield, unsupported by Rooney and Van Persie standing on eachothers' toes with massive gaps all over the park. Surround him with bodies in midfield and a bit of energy and we'll still get a couple of good seasons out of him.

616~~~
MOTM today, still our best midfielder.

617~~~
he was very good today, good distribution and great defensively. He benefits a lot from the diamond and having more midfielders in front of him. Still there is no reason not to buy his replacement as he has 2 years left. Have to add this - It is a true Herrera just makes players around him play much better

618~~~
We already have his replacement in Blind, i think.

619~~~
I agree with all of this but a one or two things Blind has over Carrick is the fact he can play well under pressure, and under this pressure he always seeks to play forward. Maybe it's a Dutch, international 'school-of-football' like thing that is pretty inherent from a young age. If he becomes half as good as Carrick at Carrick's best in the other aspects we'd still have a brilliant footballer.

620~~~
TBH I dont think Blind is the answer. He is a good footballer but his ceiling is not quite high. He is a good fitting player into this philosophy but I believe we will add some more. But if we stick to this and give a chance to youth I will not argue but we need to aspire to be the best club in the world not only premier league.. I don't believe that Blind is anywhere near to for example Modric/Kroos. But they may not be many players of that class available, that is why we went for Blind until we find our targets. If we wanted him so badly we would buy him right after the world cup.. I like the look of that Lucas Silva guy who was connected with us in the summer form cruzeiro. They added a new video of him on YT recently. It is really good to watch but still it is just YT vid

621~~~
Some of the posts at the start of this thread...<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Carricks one of our most important players, he's integral to the balance of the team and his performance today and his performances since coming back into the team have shown that once again. Should be one of the first names on the team-sheet when fit.

622~~~
Not many people thought Carrick was the answer back in 06.

623~~~
for me he wasn't the answer after all these year anyway. Our midfield was for 3 years mid-table level for some reason. Carrick being our best CM says it all,  meanwhile depending on Scholes at 36 when carrick was arguably at his peak... now we have di María, Herrera, quite a difference don't you think? I love Carras has been a decent player but nowhere near the class some people here think he has been. Anyway Blind is still quite young and his potential even is not that high he can do the job for us and hopefully van Gaal will get the best out of him..

624~~~
Best game from him in a good while. I thought a lot of players were good, almost everyone. Smalling, Herrera and Rooney stood out, off the top of my head. But Carrick was the reason we dominated so totally. Surprised not to see him as MotM on here.

Yep, this. Applies to a number of players who didn't shine last season.

Early days, but if he puts in a few more showings like this, he should come back into the England squad. At the moment Henderson is Hodgson's best option as the more defensive partner for Wilshere; clearly playing like this Carrick is a much, much better choice.

625~~~
He was brilliant. Just controlled the match with his excellent passing. If you could combine Blind's energy and mobility with Carrick you would have a superb player. I was one who was unsure about Carrick at the beginning of the season but he shut me up after that performance. Hope it continues.

626~~~
Watched a game for the first time today at OT and his performance really stood out. His passing range and interceptions can be seen on TV but when watching him play he covers the ground to be in the right place because he anticipates so well. He's one of my favourite players so to catch him on a good day like today was an absolute pleasure.

627~~~
LVG's style of play suits him down to the ground. It was vintage Carrick.

628~~~
Whoa.. <a class="username" data-user="5422, @MelvinYeo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/5422/">@MelvinYeo</a> is alive!

629~~~
I remember in LVG's interview way back when Carrick picked up his injury he seemed particularly irritated. There was a definite sense that he'd expected Carrick to be a key part of his plans. Obviously that's not surprising to those who've watched Carrick, but it makes particular sense given how well he's already performing under LVG.

It'll be a pleasure to have him and Blind competing for a place. Genuine depth of quality in that position.

630~~~
And when we're playing a top side, Blind and Carrick at the base of a 2-3-1 would provide a fantastic foundation.

631~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

632~~~
Because everyone lives speculative formations:



Oh god there's so many options I've missed. Just trying to get Mata and Herrera in the same side for total domination.

633~~~
If Carrick wasn't English and had a fancier name, he would have been rated so much higher by everyone. Was poor like everyone last season, but he was being asked to be a box to box player which he isn't. Playing the holding role in a 3 man midfield with mobile and technically good midfielders around him could see him have his best season yet, even at his age. Could be like a second prime if you will, like pirlo started a few years ago or like Scholes, just obviously not as good.

634~~~
Masterclass Michael.

635~~~
He was just fantastic to watch. The English Pirlo.

636~~~
Any match compilations yet? I'd love to get one of Carrick from today.

This pass was just sex

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-6pz0NeDfA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

637~~~
It baffles me how Engkand ignored him for the last 7 years.

Key midfielder in 5 premier league titles, 1 Champions league win and 3 finals. Exactly the cultured water carrier england cry about not having when they fawn over the Pirlo's and Alonso's of this world and they ignored him so they could play Stevie Me and Fat Frank, two attacking midfielders in a midfield two.

638~~~
If we can play to his strengths then there's no way he can't do this for another few years. Get a couple of runners either side of him and do what Juve do with Pirlo.

639~~~
This is exactly why LvG seemed quite concerned when he got injured right at the start of pre season. He was singing his praises right from that moment.

640~~~
because carrick plays with his skills and his brain, he does not pretend himself to be a hard player, run hard tackle hard and die hard, so he's not rated in english football.  if he's playing in continental he can even be a european footballer contender.

641~~~
What a player. Without a doubt, the most underrated midfielder in the league for the past decade. Doesn't pump his glory-hunting chest like Gerrard, doesn't have the goals-coring knack of Lampard, isn't a roving powerhouse like Toure. In a way he's another version of vintage Paul Scholes, who was similarly underestimated by the media and oppo fans for a large part of his career. Goes about his job in almost muted fashion, always willing to pass on the credit to his team-mates, loves to lay it up for the goalscorers instead of having a go himself. A consummate professional and team oriented man. It's a pity that he's only been voted to the team of the year once, though judging by Carrick's demeanor one doubts if he really cares one bit for individual glory.  

As an aside, he would make an excellent manager I reckon. The way he perceives the game from the center of the park will definitely help him gain some traction on the tactical nuances of his training badges.

642~~~
This thread is crying out loud for a Noodlehair pessimistic rant about Carrick.

643~~~
He's such a classy passer. You see all these other players huffing and puffing just to get the ball 40 yards away from them, and he does it with one swift stroke.

644~~~
That pass to RVP <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Yes RVP was offside but still it was great to see.

645~~~

646~~~
Vintage Carrick yesterday. Fantastic performance. He's been very good since coming back from injury.

647~~~
Very much so! Glad someone remembers me, I still lurk around but don't post often anymore. Always good to see a familiar name too!

648~~~
Yeah I just think it's necessary to highlight that Blind is just 24, which is still relatively young for a CM. I know you're not saying anything else Insanity, and I think Raw has a point: I think Carrick's progress since 2005 (when he was 24 himself), when he was already a very tidy and intelligent player, has been huge, and I'm hoping Blind can follow that kind of path and having the tutelage of Carrick is going to be great for him. There's a lot of similarities in their game.

649~~~
In the last 7/8 years, Carrick has often played in a two man midfield and dominated. In a three man midfield, he must find it easy, especially with the combined energy and bite from Fellaini and Herrera. So underrated it unbelievable.

650~~~
Yeah really loved seeing him back on the field. Our midfield looked ace with him in the center pulling the strings. I hope he stays fit now for the rest of the season and we will really have a shot at a top 4 place I feel.

651~~~
It depends on whether he's asked to hold alone with two attacking midfielders, et cetera. He can't hold a midfield by himself, he's not mobile enough. But with a real box to box midfielder he's fine. Of course against Hull he can hold by himself.

In a 3 man midfield with Fletcher it was a bit awkward because neither scored goals with late runs, or really at all.

But with Herrera and someone like di Maria there is plenty of firepower.

652~~~
When he slips back into the team after a lengthy absence you understand how great he is as a player. Massively unsung hero through all our success, because he never really got injured. We struggle without him.

653~~~
was excellent, my MOTM

his ability and confidence to try the ever so slightly more difficult pass is key to how we deal with pressing. we've always liked to knock the ball around at the back but since teams having started pressing us we tend to panic, sink deeper and deeper until we either lump it into the stands or play it to DDG to hump forward and into opposition possession (or worse we give the ball away in a bad area). Carrick playing deep always gives the centre halves an option and one who has the confidence to take the ball under pressure and then play an incisive pass which cuts out the pressing players. 

just as an aside isn't it nice to see so many threads discussing our options in midfield as opposed to the umpteen we usually have bemoaning our lack of! 
i'm still convinced SAF was showing off in the end by winning without having a midfield of any sort, its the only explanation when you see what a massive difference just buying a couple has had on us!

654~~~
He's what England need at their base.

655~~~
I've been really impressed with Blind but it makes a big difference to the shape of the game having someone who can pick a pass like Carrick at the base of our midfield instead of him. Keeps the opposition defenders pinned back and creates space between the lines.

656~~~
Who'd think we'd have a trouble of riches in midfield. From having to field Cleverley and Jones in there to choosing between Carrick, Blind, Herrera, in-form Fellaini, Mata and Di Maria...

Hopefully we'll still get a good mileage out of Carrick. He's 33 so probably doesn't have that much left at the top level but Pirlo is two years older and still manages to perform well so perhaps we could also squeeze extra 2-3 years out of Carrick.

657~~~
Yup. Feels like we're supporting a different team!

658~~~
He was faultless. My eyes were practically fixed on him the entire match, I'd never seen Carrick live before and it just a glorious performance, so clever with his movement and his passing and defensive positioning were unbelievable. A joy to watch.

659~~~
Funnily it always felt like our God awful midfield was carried by strong defence behind them, good wingers on he flanks and good forwards who didn't need midfield support to perform. Now our defence is clearly shaky at least, our wingers have been mostly moved to cover different positions and our strikers, Rooney aside, have been very inconsistent, and it's our midfield that has to carry us - they protect the defence (Blind, Carrick), create (Di Maria, Herrera and Mata), score vital goals (Di Maria and Mata) and dominate possession. I actually think we no longer need another midfielder at all despite all the rumours about Strootman et cetera.

660~~~
He was very good on Saturday and is one of the most underrated players of the last decade, never gets the recognition he deserves and a lot of his good work is not even noticed but we miss him if he isn’t fit or not at his best as was the case last season.

I never understand the criticism he gets, some idiots even tried to blame the poor performances of inferior players like Cleverley, Fellaini and Anderson on him but the truth is we have let him down by giving him the impossible job of holding together a midfield of players well past their best, playing out of position or who were simply nowhere near his level. It’s a shame that it has taken so long to strengthen in midfield that he is now in the latter stages of career by the time we do but there is still hopefully another couple of years left for him.

661~~~
Hopefully we will be able to get a few more seasons out of Carrick due to his lack of international commitments over the years. Its scandalous how he has been disregarded time and time again in England squads

662~~~
Depends how long Carrick can keep performing at the highest level. Blind is a great player to have in the squad but I don't think he's a like for like replacement. We need someone to create our tempo and pull the strings. Right now, I think Carrick is the only one with this sort of game intelligence.

663~~~
A player like Carrick should be able to keep playing into his late 30s without much decline. Much like Pirlo, he's never relied on physical pace, but rather mental pace so you'd imagine if anything that should continue to improve. Obviously you still need some mobility but provided there are other players in the midfield providing that, Carrick's positioning and passing-game are up there among the best in the world. 

Blind has been really good but I don't think we lose much, if anything, with Carrick in there instead.

664~~~
Ander Herrera.

665~~~
Is he that kind of player? Seems to be quite progressive and forward-looking. Not sure he's the type to be a metronome.

666~~~

667~~~
I hope he can be. From what I gather it was his role at Athletic and Zaragoza at times but I might be wrong there.

668~~~
Outstanding game. Loved watching him, such an intelligent player.

670~~~
Good read. Will be interesting to see how long we do offer him.

671~~~
Captain today. His first time? Not quite sure, but happy for him.

672~~~
Nice read, but its wrong in the fact that we did sing his name. I heard it very audibly.

673~~~
Really nice and composed performance. I just don't know how he manages to get some of those passes away. He releases it at the last possible nano-second, and it looks like he's already been tackled. He's constantly several steps ahead.

674~~~
Commentators said that he left Nzonzi for the goal? Is that accurate? Was good otherwise though.

675~~~
I thought he looked a bit leggy tonight, 2 games in 4 days at his age after a long lay off is a big ask.

676~~~
He, and everyone else, got sucked in by the player with the ball, who Smalling was struggling to deal with. In hindsight not a wise move but at the time not an awful error.

I thought his passing was either too safe, or on the rare occasions he attempted something slightly more adventurous, not very good.

677~~~
I thought he played well. Did his job quietly and effectively, as usual.

Imagine if he got injured though... In fact don't do that to yourself. He's vital to us while Blind is out.

678~~~
I don't actually see any comments about him being played as our captain by van Gaal today.. does that sign something? I mean there was Van Persie on the pitch wo wore the armband before.. MAybe van Gaal was prepared to bench Van Persie as his form was awful and is still average.. Carrick did good but needs a lot more of movement around him..

679~~~
I don't think Carrick was available when RVP was captain, otherwise I think it would've been given to him.

680~~~
I know of course but still Van persie was his captain in Holland and third/second choice here.. Carrick was captain maybe 5 times in his career for United if ever was he anywhere else.. Carras is not leader but still a good sign that skipper goes to our long-term serving player..

681~~~
Was good again but definitely looked a tiny bit leggy. Don't forget that he was out for 4 months with an ankle injury, didn't have a pre season, and only recently started to be in the first 11, so you can't expect him to be at the top level every single game just yet, especially as it'll take him longer to recover from injuries because of his age. Adds so much composure though.

Remember reading that Van Gaal was considering making Carrick the club captain but he got injured just at the start for 4 months, so it was risky to give it to him with the uncertainty of how he'll come back. Also Rooney has been very good so it made that easier.

682~~~
i'm happy if he kept on getting snub by the England manager though. the last thing he needs as a 32 year old is international commitment.

got to say we are much better when carrick is pulling all the strings from midfield. hope he can carry on for the next few years at the very least.

683~~~
A Manchester United great, absolutely no doubt.

684~~~

685~~~
About time he got some recognition.

686~~~
Agreed.

Was always a big fan of his before everyone went nuts about him (understandably) during Fergie's last season. But when you take a look at the time he has been at the club and just how good he has been, he really has been great for us. Still has a lot to offer too.

687~~~
The big worry is how we replace him. I'm guessing Van Gaal has his eye on Strootman for exactly that reason.

688~~~
One of my favorite players who are still with the club alongside Rafael, I love everything about the guy and hope he stays at the club for a few more years and hopefully get a role after retierment.

689~~~
We have that debate every time a long serving or top player leaves. It's pointless in my opinion, just bring in new players who can recreate the role, offer their strengths etc.

690~~~
In a first time, it probably will be Blind, and we will assess our options from Blind performances.

691~~~
Not according to those that seem to watch more Roma than me. Carrick is a cultured #6, Strootman was ok in that deeper role for the U21's but apparently has blossomed into LvG's favourite by playing as a box to box CM.

692~~~
I'm being pedantic, but LVG has nothing to do with that, at PSV Strootman was a box to box, but he was also used as a #6 or #10 when needed. He didn't really "blossomed" under LVG, Van Gaal just used him in his natural position.

693~~~
Where is Carras? Not saying he is bad, but needs to control the game for us.

694~~~
I'm a fairly big critic of his but if there was one player I was going to be giving any sort of credit too that half it would be him.

695~~~
Thought he was our best player along with young

696~~~
Not the hardest task is it? He has been okay tbf, but with him, I'd expect us to control the game a bit more. He usually brings calmness in the team, cant see that today. But he isnt bad unlike Fellaini or Mata.

697~~~
My MOTM tonight, in the first half he was the only one we had that could pass it properly and kept digging our CB's out of situations, then he went into the back 3 and somehow guided the woeful Rojo and Jones through that second half.

698~~~

699~~~
We've looked much better as a team with him back in the side.

700~~~
Must have been some performance to guide someone who isn't even fit to play!

701~~~
He was invisible all night. His inability to handle pressing remains a proble and he's very inconsistent. I'll sooner have Blind in the side, a more forward thinking DM.

702~~~
Same vs Arsenal (he just came back from injury tho) but he couldnt handle the pressure I got the feeling, but against smaller sides when we have to break down the defence, he is great. His passing range is world class.

703~~~
Can't play at centre back as he gets to easily exposed down the side of him.

704~~~
Tell you what, if he was invisible then I don't know who it was clearing up every error in possession from Rojo and Evans.

That 'backseat' role was absolutely necessary. If he was in the thick of the action, those two would've gifted Southampton a hatful of goals.

705~~~
Thought he had a great game personally.

706~~~
If we had Rio / Vidic in their prime in defence, I think Carrick wouldnt have to baby sit our defence as much and would be able to actually show of his range of passing going forward. Thought he oozed class first half with the way he made a lot of what he did look simple. Hardly gave the ball away that i can remember.

707~~~
No, we haven't.

708~~~
I didn't think he was as good as others are saying. He went back into defence to give us some composure but it didn't work.

709~~~
If you thought he was invisible then you really just didn't watch the same game. He was class tonight as always. Bailed out both Rojo and Evans countless times in the second half, was the only one who was really composed on the ball apart from Van Persie. We've just looked so much better since he came back as a unit, and it's really understated how big of a loss it was having him out injured for 3-4 months at the start of the season. Still one of our most important players.

710~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> I meant Evans. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

711~~~
I agree. He looked slightly above the poor performances of everyone else in midfield to begin with, but he also struggled with the intensity and pressing of Southampton. Didn't do much better for me at CB.

712~~~
It annoys me too reading how he was 'invisible' in here. Carrick will forever be the player managers love and divide fans opinion. I bet LVG absolutely loves him, a DM that has a great passing range and can slot back in CB. Even more so considering our CB's cant stay fit to save their lives (Rojo apart).

713~~~
People saying he had a poor performance didn't really watch him. For me he was one of our top 3 players of the game. He was the reason we didn't get humiliated today and you really have to pay attention to him when he plays to understand why. I'm glad players like him get the recognition from the players and the manager rather than the fans, and not the other way around.

714~~~
what's wrong with some people?

Blind more forward thinking than Carrick???? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  I like Blind and think he's done well but if there's one area that Carrick is a level above its his ability to spot a forward run and execute a precise pass. Not exactly sure how anyone could honestly dispute that.

Its funny how many times you read shit like Carrick was invisible last night. He puts out fires before they start with interceptions, positioning and anticipation. Not a centre back but trusted by LVG to sort out the mess the was our backline last night.

invisible indeed.....<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

715~~~
One thing's for certain. He's lightening rod for the clueless of redcafe. Always has been, always will be.

716~~~
Wise up, you’re obviously a fan boy. Since his full return we’ve only won 5 games, fair enough we’ve only played 5 games but still.

717~~~
Yeah, we won 5 games because of Carrick. I don't get this at all. Each time the opposition pressed us with him in the team, we suffered. Against Arsenal and last night too. And yesterday he was invisible too.

718~~~
Of course he does, I do think Blind is more forward thinking and handles pressing better, and this second point is not even up for debate. Blind also started at CB for us recently. I like how people translate opinions like mine to "he's shit or not good enough" - he's obviously very good, but he gets way overrated here. We didn't win 5 games in a row because of him, we did that because of the team having more belief and resilience about them.

719~~~
Its spelt Fan Boi I'll have you know <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

720~~~
Noted <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

721~~~
Good little analysis on Carrick since his comeback. For me he has always been a very important player and really under appreciated. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11096/9598303/premier-league-manchester-uniteds-winning-run-since-michael-carrick-returned-to-the-team-is-no-coincidence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...arrick-returned-to-the-team-is-no-coincidence</a>

722~~~
^ good read. Since his return, we only conceded 3 goals in 5 games (compared to 12 in 10 games previous to that). 50% decrease. It might be also the Fellaini's factor. But that stats is just incredible.

723~~~
"Hard to believe its not Scholes..."

724~~~
Let's be honest, he definitely could've done better but in the context of what was happening to his left right and behind, he did a grand job. If he was gung-ho and playing a rushed game, we would've suffered.

Rojo and Evans were the ones who ensured we surrendered possession where possible (along with Fellaini). Even with a 3rd CB in McNair, he was dropping in until he was told to do so. He had to, they were just gifting the ball away.

Same against Arsenal. Plugged them gaps brilliantly. Quite anonymous in the passing side of things, but in the context of what was going on around him you can surely see why. 

I think most accomplished CMs would struggle in those circumstances. If it wasn't for the sole movement of van Persie, we may have been pegged back in that second half.

725~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/diAqSwK.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/diAqSwK.jpg"/>

Definitely need to consider the teams played though. He's been great, but I'm sure those stats would look similar if it had been Blind instead - who averages the same amount of passes at pretty much the same percentage (slightly higher in both).

Him and Blind are fairly similar, but I would be interest in seeing them play together. Could build a very solid base with those 2 to really go on and let the attacking players flourish.

726~~~
I hate how he was dropped into a CB role when McNair came off. Thought he was sorely missed in the midfield to collect the ball from the back which no one else could do or nowhere near as good as Carrick anyway.

727~~~
That being said, he doesn't look out of place when he does drop into that 3 man defence.

728~~~
Oh I agree, I think he is perfectly capable of playing at the back himself but I feel the overall effect on the team is worse off with him out of the midfield. Without him in the midfield the defenders don't have a reliable option to find in the middle and it brings more pressure on them forcing them to panic and make bad decisions. Adding that onto their uneasiness with the back 3 and it is making the backs look awful. He then links well with the attacking players and just helps overall with controlling the midfield. I just find us severely lacking without Carrick or Blind in there between the backs and midfield.

729~~~
I agree. I think a lot of the criticism that Rojo got for losing the ball after carrying it out of defence was because there were no midfielders showing for the ball. Fellaini doesn't seem to have the nous of picking up pockets of space to collect the ball, Herrera can do but he was ineffective at doing so and for some reason Mata was playing deep, and although he did collect the ball occasionally he's so weak physically that it's a danger for him to have the ball in our own half.

730~~~
I love how overrated he is here. He can do the job, his best skill is to stay consistent and that he doesn't do mistakes. He has an eye for the pass and great range of passing but he lacks any mobility to his game, he is an old school player, players at the very top level should be demanded to play the ball while moving.. yes he can read the game well but is not quite strong in tackling and players with pace can get quite comfortably past him, very experienced but very slow player. Such a shame Fletcher got his illness I would take him over Carrick all day long, we lack this hardworking never ending tackling player all over the pitch working his socks off with bags of stamina actually able to press! Herrera is one to watch to play that role but he is better suited to play little bit further. We need to replace Carrick as soon as possible. Blind is only temporary solution as we should aspire to get better players with higher ceiling. Right now we have two decent players who can do the job.. in Carrick and Blind who is younger and can actually run eventhou he is very slow as well but after acquiring two world class players in Angel diMaria and Herrera(arguably) we should try to snatch some payer of the same level to paly the DLP role or more defensive player, I wouldn!t even mind defensive specialist as we have plenty of creativity further the pitch, someone who could provide the real steel to defense. Blind/Carrick are far away from being those guys, I know they are different but still our defense is very shaky due to massive aount of injuries and different line-ups so player of that mould would be pretty much appreciated. I don't know de Jong, Wanyama comes to my mind. that type of player maybe better quality but I am not aware of any available players of that sort. If not getting that kind of player simply buy the better quality Kroos - Modric. They are not what I was suggesting but real do it like that, they couldn't find any defensive specializst but they have two world class playmakers who could do some defending.. Yes I am waiting for some comments which suggest tak Blind is our Modric and Carrick is our Kroos..

731~~~
I can't believe I actually read that. I want that minute of my life back.

732~~~
Catts for me like.

733~~~
Same.

734~~~
I started to read it, realised that it was a load of guff, scrolled down and saw your post and smiled.

735~~~
I find it strange that the media only noticed Carrick now. His form during 2007-2011 is much better IMO, but there are hardly any praise for him from the media

736~~~
Same lol, thanks Joemo.
I've been impressed with Carricks form this season, a lot closer to 2012/13 than last year.
And our midfield / defence look drastically more settled and comfortable since hes come back.

I'd like to see Blind and Carrick in midfield too.
I like Blind a lot, I dont really get the lack of enthusiasm for him when we signed him or since.
Might be a bit defensive and / or lightweight but could be good in europe if nothing else.

737~~~
..

First on my ignore list. Congratulations....

738~~~
This season, Carrick is helped by the fact he has a bit more pace behind him. That allows the defenders to be a little closer and the team to be a little more compact. 

When he was playing ahead of Rio/Vidic last season, he had a lot more running to do to intercept runners. That didn't play to his strengths so he was predictably under par.

739~~~
Why would you mention 2011 specifically? 2012/13 was a majestic season from him.

740~~~
What a complete und utter load of bollox.

741~~~
The English Pirlo without the free kicks. Will be able to play at a high level into his late 30's easily.

742~~~
The warning signs where there... i shouldn't have read that

743~~~
Yeah,  it kinda slipped my mind, maybe because the fact that our football was less than inspiring that season. That 4 years period that I mentioned though, he's easily our best midfielder with Scholes.  Carrick was a big part on why we were one of the top 2 teams in Europe during that period. And yet, media only notice after performances against the likes of Stoke.  It's mental

744~~~
I have had this argument so many times (most when comparing the likes of Scott Parker to Carrick - yes I know!) and it is the classic "Parker gets his shorts dirty, gets stuck in" argument, which is just incredibly flawed. The fundamental difference in Carrick's game is the he doesn't need to run around like a headless chicken because his positioning is that good. I'm surprised we still have these debates/criticisms of Carrick, especially after Gary Neville has highlighted this quality time and time again during his punditry.


Thought I would back up my argument with a video of each style. <b>Zoom to 5.00</b> in this clip - its a video of Scholes' 2nd at Newcastle in 2007, you will see Parker showing his "hard working never ending tackling all over the pitch" as you would put it. But the thing to note is if he had Parker been more clever in his positioning, he would easily had been able to stop Scholes from shooting.

Compare that style to Carrick's below, I won't explain as Neville does it perfectly.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDgAC2dQfqM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

745~~~
Thankfully, I read your post before I saw that piece.

746~~~
There are many hilarious parts in this post, but the one which takes the cake is the argument that we need a better defensive shield than Carrick and then calling Modric / Kroos that shield.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

747~~~
Carrick was pretty poor from 09-11 tbh. He had a great second half of the season in 11-12 and then a great full season in Fergie's last full season and has started to get credit from the media since then really.

748~~~
Yeah, I agree with the part about him linking play from defence and then on to attack. Same with Blind.

749~~~
I think his 2011-2013 spell was definitely his best at the club. He was fairly average for a couple of years, but really came into his own and started to properly control games for us when we needed someone to do so.

750~~~
he is definitely one of the very few in the world who can be consider very pirlo like. and the only englishman of course. 

barring any serious injury he should be able to play well into his 30's

751~~~
I'd just like to gently point out that the guy who came up with the huge wall of rubbish a couple of posts above was rating Zaha's game against us this season in his thread and was not impressed.

752~~~
Wow.

753~~~
That post actually hurt my eyes a little. Didn't know what was going on.

754~~~
I have always loved Carrick.  I really do think that De Gea, Carrick and Rooney are our three most important players.  I don't think ranked against our other central midfielders he has ever had a poor season.  He will always give you 6/7 out of 10 and quite often will be one of our most important players on the park.  He doesn't need to sprint as he reads the game incredibly well.  He sees every pass, he's direct with his long passing at the right time, then at other times he dictates the pace of the game.  He really has benefitted playing with Scholes. 

His natural fitness seems great, I don't see him slowing down in the next 2-3 years and it's a good job as he is our bet player in that position by a clear mile.

755~~~
Carrick's had 2 geniunely poor seasons at the club. Last season and '09-10.

One of the best signings Fergie ever made imo. Not just because he's a brilliant player but his signing signalled that Fergie finally gave up on trying to find another Roy Keane (an impossible task).

756~~~
I actually prefer him at the back if I'm honest, willing to step out of defense when we have it, reads the danger well without, I'm sure that won't be a popular opinion, but most my opinions aren't <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

757~~~
Suits a 3 man midfield perfectly, although I've been saying I think that'd be the case for years. Him and Alonso could go on for another 2-3 years in this type of system and not look out of place in one of the best teams in the world.

Will be interesting when everyone is fit what our system would be, I would really like to see a midfield 3 of Blind, Carrick and Herrera behind Di Maria, Mata/Rooney & any of Falcao/RVP/Rooney up front.

758~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Stopped half way through. Just awful

759~~~
It took Carrick a very long time to win me over but since 2010/11 he's been quality. You need to actually watch him play then come back and rewrite a piece on him and hope that people on the caf forgive you <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

760~~~
My screen is too small - I didn't seen your post before I read that. My oh my.

Blind can never be Modric btw. Modric is much, much quicker and more of a dribbler than Blind. More similar to Herrera in that respect - obviously better of course. Kroos and Carrick are more similar, but Kroos is actually slower than Carrick. Carrick being slow is a myth. Just because he doesn't run around like a headless chicken doesn't mean he is slow. He takes a couple of yards to get going, but it's not a great concern.

761~~~
Watching Carrick live gives you a deeper appreciation of the job he does. Highlights never pick up the real guts of the work he gets through in a match.

762~~~
Completely agree. His movement is really underrated. During my last visit to old trafford, carricks movement was one of few things that surprised me most. The other was vidics strength, the way he dominated the strikers he was marking was phenomenal.

763~~~
Same for a lot of players.
I've been criticising van persie a fair bit recently but he could be making a dozen brilliant runs out of camera shot every game for all i know.

764~~~
Can he do a Pirlo and reinvent himself in new position 'cause he's been brilliant in defence so far!

765~~~
Impeccable. MOTM so far in for me.

It's ours and his curse that he's so good at CB.

766~~~
Zen master. Calming like whale song.

767~~~
Fantastic. Majestic.

Michael Carrick.

768~~~
Calmest man on the pitch

769~~~
Only player who can seem to find that forward pass to strikers or Mata. That's where we miss Blind if we got Carrick as CB.

770~~~
God like. 

He is everything Gerrard wishes he could be and more.

771~~~
We all cried out for the club to buy defenders so we no longer have to play Carrick there. Well....we bought defenders, yet Carrick is the only player I have any confidence in in our back line. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

772~~~
Fantastic game so cool calm and composed.

773~~~
What I loved the most about his first half is how he didn't automatically played it back to DDG but tried to find other players when it was easier to pass it back.

774~~~
Where are all the people saying 33 and past it? He can basically play as long as he wants, he's got a genius footballing brain. Looked our best CB, the only one with the passing and composure to play in the back 3 mind, everyone else goes apeshit. No coincidence he's played the last 6, heck we looked better when he came on vs City.

775~~~
I thought he was great. Out of interest, the 1on1 chance for Sterling, was it him who left it?

776~~~
I have a little thing for footballers who play with brains, and he's probably our best player at that.

777~~~
I might be being a bit hyperbolic, but for me, that was one of the best central defensive performances from a United player I can remember in years. Probably since the Vidic/Ferdinand heydays.

I honestly don't think he put a foot wrong. Every pass, every tackle was just spot on. I don't think he'd work in a defensive two, but as part of a three he's almost perfect.

778~~~
For a player who isn't a centre back, fair fecks to the guy. Made some excellent interceptions and eased us through some periods where we could have easily caved in.

779~~~
Our best CB this season.

780~~~
His ability to read and intercept play is quite ridiculous.

781~~~
Class act.

782~~~
If he were available since the season started, we might be in a point or so behind Chelsea. 

Bah..

783~~~
Was he really that great, tidied up nicely but they did have about 10 fecking one-on-ones.

784~~~
Yeah and those mistakes came from the left and right sides. Jones let Sterling run in behind him before first goal and turn him too easily for the second chance. 

Evans fell alsleep a few times and did his customary backpass.

785~~~
fantastic. hope he stays healthy and fit for years to come.

786~~~
He was absolutely fantastic again today. Always seemed to come out with the ball when he needed to, didn't see him put a foot wrong.

787~~~
The only reason he's not MotM was because DeGea decided not to concede a goal today

788~~~
The idea of the middle cb is to cover?? Also I need a gif of the backpass because I think Carrick fell asleep on that one.

789~~~
Brilliant once again. Amazing how well he has slot in as a sweeper. Brings so much calmness passing from the back too

790~~~
Carrickbauer

Cliche time: He can play this position for years to come because it doesn't require much pace.

791~~~
Was class but I will always prefer him more as the holding midfielder, which he is genuinely top class at. Can get on the ball a lot more but we missed him so much at the start of the season, cannot be said enough.

792~~~
If not for Big Dave he'd be MOTM, his reading, calmness and passing were class, cleaned up after the two sloppy joes either side of him on more than one occasion.

793~~~
I said it before and I'll say it again, I prefer him at CB than in midfield, if LVG persists with this formation then he's a definite as the middle centre back for me, looking class there.

794~~~
We missed him badly in midfield today

795~~~
Carrick is such a class act. I just love the guy. Defender or midfielder, he makes it look effortless. Top performance.

796~~~
Top player.

797~~~
Getting better with age!

798~~~
I love the position he is taking up for us in this new team. Like an advanced Centrehalf or a libero type player. Classy player, I doubted him seriously after last season but when the team is clicking he comes alive.

799~~~
His anticipation is always several steps ahead of everyone on the pitch. It's quite unbelievable really. He just doesn't get the credit he deserves as he just makes it look so effortless.

800~~~
true. He s vastly underestimated, even over here

801~~~
A centre midfielder by trade is proving to be our calming influence at the back. He's really taken to his role of becoming one of the senior players in the team.

802~~~
When Blind is back it will be interesting to see if blind will become the CDM and Carrick will play in some sort of back 3 maybe with Rafael and Shaw on the wingback position?

And oh, is he our on-field vice captain now besides fletch?

803~~~
Who said that Carrick was too slow to play as a CB? He had Sterling in his pocket today, for most of the match, and he didn't give Balotelli much either. Great defensively, and his composure on the ball is reminiscent of Rio at the back. In fact, he reminds me a little of Rio in his last good season with us - not great pace, but still quick enough, terrific on the ball and reads the game so well! Second best player alongside Valencia today.

804~~~
He's been a rock and I think he could play as part of a back four besides Smalling, with Shaw and Rafael as full backs. He has been an absolute rock these past few weeks.

805~~~
He was brilliant today. Fair play to him.

806~~~
Is there a gif of the back heel when he was surrounded by Liverpool players? That was class.

807~~~
He's returned to the side and United has won six straight.

RVP praised Carrick's calm on the ball in his post-match interview.

For me he is one of the most important players whether at the base of midfield or in the middle of a back three.

808~~~
Good to see he's back to his best. Some people had doubts about him after that injury, but he's just a class act.

Definitely not a coincidence that we're back to winning since hes been back in the side.

809~~~
Carrick looked so comfortable in possession it was like watching Rio in his pomp on the ball. But don't forget we gave away half a dozen great chances. Imo we Need much better than Carrick at centre back as he is susceptible to movement and balls down either side of him. Great stop gap when we are struggling though and done well yesterday.

810~~~
He good in the centre of a back 3 if he has a couple of fast players, like Smalling/Jones or Rojo, on either side to track the runs of the pacy forwards. Not sure if he suits playing in a back 4.

811~~~
We need him in midfield as good as he has been at the back. No other midfielder comes deep to get the ball and therefore our defenders scramble looking for options.

He really is an amazing player though. Even the Canadian pundits giving him credit and saying if he was Italian or Spanish he would be praised much more. 

Too bad about his England career. I blame Capello.

812~~~
He is probably our best outfield player in the 3-5-2, it's a shame for him that it doesn't work for most of the others though. I'd like to see him back in midfield so Fellaini doesn't have to play the CDM role.

813~~~
He was a cut above yesterday. A real classy footballer.

814~~~
Pretty much the only calming influence in our side, Van Gaal must be so thankful he's back.

815~~~
the way he passes from the back is pure class. Such an important player and that role between the defenders in 3-man defense seems tailored for him. 

With 2 defenders besides him he doesn't need to win headers where he is weak but he reads the game so well which is great help those around him.

816~~~
He's an incredibly intelligent player and his composure and positional awareness is just a class above.

817~~~
Absolute star yesterday. Brought composure to our defending, and general play. Our unsung hero

Great to see Jones & Evans back too - two actual defenders in defence - wondered when I'd see that again!

818~~~
It would be nice to copy his brain and put it in the head of Jones and Rojo. His intelligence is just superb.

819~~~
He's an E-Type, Carrick. Elegant and beautiful. For some reason he's my favourite player.

820~~~
He's such an important player for us when he's on form and we missed him badly last season be it through his injuries or lack of form. He's the kind of player that makes the team as a whole play better and it will be interesting to see how van Gaal chooses to use him when Blind is back. Carrick is certainly an upgrade on Blind as a midfielder but I suspect van Gaal might try to find a way to play them both.

821~~~
Wonderful player, why offer one of our most intelligent players? Blind and Carrick should start, maybe Carrick as CB, as he is sound defensively, brings the calm, offers the link up from defence to midfield, has a beautiful cross pass, while Blind is more mobile, offers more attackingly and is better with linking up the defence/midfield/attack. Or a midfield with Blind and Carrick as CDM's, and Herrera/Mata and di Maria as other midfielders, that would be balanced with stability, intelligence, box to box players, speed, directness, creativity.

822~~~
People are going to realise, when he retires, that England missed an absolute trick.

Considering all he has achieved with United it's absolute madness he was over looked.

823~~~
Makes me wonder what Moyes was doing last season which made Carrick so poor

824~~~
One of the most influential figures in the club's recent success. Will always want him at holding midfield rather than centre back regardless of how excellent he is there too. Without him in the middle we had to revert to sideways balls to young and valencia on repeat which is what we've been trying to move away from. Scholesy said it best, the guy is a rolls royce.

825~~~
He made 1 appearance in 08 for England when United at the time were the best team in the world. (Scholes wasn't even in the England squad)

Absolutely awful management.

826~~~
But but but but they had Gerrard and Lampard!!!!!

827~~~
I have never been a big fan of Carrick but his return has definitely made a difference with respect to our success. I guess his understated manner makes him overlooked by many including England. It is no coincidence that his return also signalled RVP's regain in confidence.
I now am a big fan. Better late than never.

828~~~
I have loved Carrick as a player since he was at West Ham. In the right system he's as good as anyone. I think his lack of England caps is symptomatic as to why England get in so wrong at international level.

829~~~
I'm not English myself but I can't think of any other national team that would of done the same. Although there's been lot's of moaning about the youth setup in this country(There are clearly problems in it) it still produces a amazing amount of talent(I would kill to have someone of the talent like James Wilson to be Irish)and always thought that England's failure is more down to piss poor management and the FA than anything else.

830~~~
Still doesnt explain why Capello overlooked him, everyone thought of all people he would appreciate Carrick's qualities.

831~~~
A good analysis of Carrick by bbc 

Carrick 'catalyst for Man Utd form' - BBC Sport
<a class="externalLink" href="http://m.bbc.com/sport/football/30472067" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://m.bbc.com/sport/football/30472067</a>

832~~~
G Neville when doing an early season analysis on our side suggested he could be the perfect CB in the middle of a 3 man. Not sure he's as suited to a CB as a back 4 though as its very different. 

As I'd personally like us to go back to 4 at the back I'd like to see him in CM again. But if LVG is to pursue with 3 at the back then hes potentially the best suited.

833~~~
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/114551901" width="500"></iframe>

834~~~
He was absolutely sublime yesterday. Would have been my man of the match. Was reading the game absolutely brilliantly, always at the right spot, always calm. Superb stuff. Even read and intercepted the shite young back pass <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This 3-5-2 formation would have been sensational if we actually had 2 Carricks. 1 playing at CB and the other as part of the middle 2. Our biggest issue with the formation currently is the lack of someone in midfield who can pass it like Carrick can.

835~~~
Either as part of a 3 in defence in a 3-5-2 formation or part of a midfield 3, 3 together suits him very well. I actually like 3-5-2 unlike many people here and Carrick at the middle of the 3 CBs is ideal for this formation. Blind ahead of him in midfield supported by Di Maria and Herrera, then have Rafa and Shaw as the wing backs then you'll love this formation.

836~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Articles/b6rd_y5-feetp51f-rbgka/Show/Player-Focus-Underrated-Carrick-Key-to-Upturn-in-United-Form" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Articles/b...derrated-Carrick-Key-to-Upturn-in-United-Form</a>

837~~~
It's quite clear how highly regarded he is in the United team when you've got van Persie and DDG sounding him out for praise in their post-match interviews. He's such a classy player. Just a shame he isn't heralded as such by the national team or media alike.

838~~~
This applies to most of our players.
Just to note that all the players who started against Liverpool yesterday and won 3-0 were available to Moyes, in the same fixture last year, which we lost 0-3.
Moyes had the ability to make the best players look bad. His man-magement must be atrocious.

Carrick has high footballing intelligence and  when you have high intelligence, it allows you to read the game and requires you to run less. as you can position yourself better.
Teddy Sherringham was exactly the same. An older player who was able to make fantastic contributions, despite his lack of youth/speed. For England (together with Shearer), he was lethal.

I remember the same goes for Laurent Blanc. We bought him to Old Trafford, despite him being around 36 yrs of age (and slow), he did well for us.

The same applies to Frank Lampard - I wish we had got him when he was dropped from Chelsea. He'd be brilliant as a super sub, as he is proving for Man City, right now. Not young by any means, but has the ability to read the game and make up for his lack of speed, with high quality positional play.

839~~~
It's absolutely idiotic really. 
Everyone could see that ball retention is England biggest problem, and yet, England managers refused to play Carrick whose best quality is.. ball retention

840~~~
I thought he was finished after last season. well I was fecking wrong. it is worrying we dont have anyone else in the squad who can slot into that role, i don't think blind is the same player. (in terms of skillset not quality)

841~~~
In Moyes' defence, that was a very different Liverpool team to the one we played last year.

842~~~
I agree with that. Which is why I really think the two of them can and should play together, maybe not all the time but certainly in games where we want extra protection. I disagree in the sense that I think they can both play in the same position but they bring different qualities to the role and I reckon they would complement each other pretty well.

843~~~
People keep saying that. And if it was just the Liverpool game youd be right, it wouldnt make sense to base too much on it. But it isnt. We've held our own against Chelsea this season as well and did well against City. We have put together a decent winning run and while the naysayers keep decrying the quality of the football, you get to a point in the end where you say this doesnt look like luck anymore, or at least not undeserved, unearned luck. We are making our own luck and grinding out results in some very difficult circumstances. So no, I dont really accept the idea that the result was all down to Liverpool being worse than last year. Even if they werent, the form of De Gea and our results against other good teams tells me we would have had a very good chance against Liverpool anyway. I reckon we would still have beaten them, maybe not by much but even Suarez wouldnt have found a way past De Gea in that form.

844~~~
What i would say is, fast forward a few years, and carricks unable to play the 90 week in week out, or maybe he moves on elsewhere or something hypothetical, slotting in blind for him wont have the same effect as he has on games. we wont have anyone in the squad who can sit deep and completely control the tempo of the game and im aware these players are hard to come by. If you look at every majorly successful side over the past 10 years, at the heart of the midfield they have had a player of this skillset, (scholes/carrick for us, Xavi and to a degree busquets for barca, Pirlo for juve/milan, Alonso for Pool and madrid and now modric and shweinsteger and martinez for bayern although they are a little less specialised than the others they still fill the job description etc etc)

Maybe somebody like Veratti could be an option a little bit down the line? whose allways been highly rated as the "next best" of this type of player.

845~~~
Whilst your right, what I would say is don't judge Blind too quickly. Hes only really been playing in midfield recently and he is still learning the game.
He actually has the intelligence and knowledge of the game to develop this skill IMO he definately has the passing range and temprament.
Anyway I'm pretty sure we'll get another CM in the summer too anyway

846~~~
OK <a class="username" data-user="88917, @Oo0AahCantona" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88917/">@Oo0AahCantona</a>, that sounds reasonable but what the years trying to replace Keane taught me was this: there is no point trying to find like-for-like replacements for great players. Sometimes you have someone who is special and can do things that others cant do. You can either bang your head against a brick wall trying to find someone who slots in and does the same thing, or you can accept that you probably wont find such a player and give the job to someone with different qualities. The character of the team and the style of play will change but that is probably inevitable and who knows, even if the replacement isnt as good as the guy departing, the overall team might be better. Carrick is no Keane - but the most successful period in our history was arguably after Keane left.

I reckon Carrick has a couple more years left in him and who knows what will happen in that time. But for me, here and now, if you told me Blind will end up replacing Carrick I would have no real problem with that, he seems up to the job. But time will tell, if he isnt then we'll find some other solution. Things never work out quite how you expect them, I think in all honesty the whole Carrick-to-Blind succession story is a bit too neat, the chances are things will pan out differently. Just like Anderson never become the new Scholes, Nani never became the new Giggs and Smalling and Jones probably wont become the new Rio and Vidic.

848~~~
he's started the last 6, and we've won them all.
That's not a bad stat for the lad

849~~~
hope england and roy continue to ignore carrick. selfish it may sound but i want carrick to play for us for some more years. not playing for his country should prolong his club career.

850~~~
Blind does it even more than Carrick. If anything he looks even better at that part of the game than Carrick. Carrick i think is better at playing the ball forward from deep though, Blind most likely needs another midfielder to help him with that, at least on what hes done for us so far.

851~~~
Blind is nowhere near as good as carrick, other than mobility. I like Blind and have warmed a lot towards him, but he's no Carrick.

852~~~
Noone is saying he is a better player than Carrick. He is better at keeping the ball moving between defence and midfield though. Some of that is down to mobility but i think its quite obvious watching him play which academy Blind came through.

Anyway, this is a Carrick thread. My ideal is that they play alongside each other.

853~~~
Why can't all of our defenders be as composed as carrick on the ball?

854~~~
With LVG in charge all our defenders will be so composed eventually.

855~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/michael-carrick--unsung-genius-or-mediocre-midfielder-161526752.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blog...-genius-or-mediocre-midfielder-161526752.html</a>

I just thought that's an article that sums up his standing and the reasons for it in English football quite well.

856~~~
It had crossed my mind that this may be one of the many reasons LVG likes Carrick at the back. It can only help our other center backs playing alongside him,  to pick up some of his attributes. Namely his composure and eye for a pass.

857~~~
Mainly because the training of the british defender relies on other qualities. British defenders are required to get rid of danger and minimum risk when being pressed. Nothing that can't be improved with coaching and practice though and we have already been seeing signs of that from Smalling and McNair.

858~~~
Lvg will most probably convert him into a sweeper.

859~~~
Like a chimney sweep?

I just had a vision of Carrick dancing around on the roofs of Manchester like Dick Van Dyke.

860~~~
I would say Blind's movement into areas to receive the ball from defense is maybe a little better, but Carricks passing range and pace is definitely better. 

If LVG is insistent on contuining with 3-5-2 then Carrick as a cb and blind in the base of midfield could work nicely, pair that with Di Maria and Herrera in midfield with Rvp and Rooney up top and we could have quite a decent base there.

861~~~
Hopefully once we get the back 4 settled Carrick returns to playing as a #6 and with two box to box CM's in front of him I think he'll continue on at this level for the next couple of seasons at least, playing in a proper 3 man midfield is ideal for his game.

862~~~
Indeed. Still waiting to see if Suresh has gotten out of prison

863~~~
I noticed that there is a discussion about Blind here also, si I decided to post that here too:
I made some comparison for Blind vs Carrick debate. Daley played in 8 games while Carrick played in 7 so far. <b>Bolded</b> games are wins.

Daley Blind:
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/qqqh7yo.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/qqqh7yo.png"/>
Michael Carrick:
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/b8UseFh.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/b8UseFh.png"/>


·  With Blind in midfield average is <b>15</b> United shots/per game vs 11,9 when Carrick plays
·  <b>12,1</b> shots of rivals when Blind plays vs 12,7 when Carrick plays.

Obviously, Carrick had to deal with much better opponents but it’s worth mention that in most games he had Fellaini beside him- while Blind was holding the midfield all by himself (in most cases) with many different midfield partners in Herrera, Mata, Di Maria and Valencia.

Looking at those stats I don’t think Carrick made us better defensively. He is a calming presence for the defenders but it will be very interesting to see what van Gaal does once Blind is back. The 6 wins in a row is a combination of luck, De Gea, and strikers hitting the form.

I see Carrick as a better passer but his influence is very reduced in this system we’ve been using lately (3-5-2 and Michael at the back). IMO Carrick is the one we want to use against teams like Hull or QPR. He will not be pressed intensively and will be able to dictate the game from the deep. In other cases I’m of the opinion that Blind is the better option.

864~~~
Makes no sense at all playing our best midfielder and one of the best deep lying midfielders in the league at CB. We had McNair and Blackett on the bench there was no reason for him to play in defense today.

865~~~
He was magnificent again.

866~~~
We need to clone Carrick, one for defence and one for midfield, he's so good, he never looks rushed and always looks for the forward ball. One of the best players in the league let alone our team, he's Scholes like in how he plays now, you can see that influence, it show players peak at different times, over the last three years we have seen the best of Carrick and hopefully that will continue on for a while longer.

867~~~
Didn't think he was at his best today. A lot of loose touches. Still better then our other midfielders and defenders but he's usually better.

868~~~
If anyone even suggests moving him out of central midfield for no good reason they should be fined a month's wage. Can't wait for Afro, ADM and Ander or Blind to play in a midfield diamond with him at its base. Was always looking up and taking the responsibility to play the incisive over the top ball today and to thread balls forward.

869~~~
I thought he was a solid six out of ten. Probably more to do with how highly I rate him and what I come to expect of him, but I think describing his performance today as 'magnificent' is a bit much.

870~~~
Wasted in a back 3, if we have to play that wing back system then start Blackett there and have him further up instead of Fletcher. Rooney was the only other central player even looking for the runs of the forwards. The difference in the 2nd half was clear.

871~~~
Did his job today but too many in front of him were poor once he dispatched the ball.

872~~~
Don't understand the need for him to be playing in a back 3 as a CB or playing with a back 3 in midfield, cut out the middle man and play him as a deep lying midfielder and get more bodies forward. That way you have 3 at the back when needed and a midfield anchor when needed. Evans was a waste of body when Carrick moved into midfield, could have done with that extra body upfront.

873~~~
Kingpin.

874~~~
A-flipping-men. Starting him in defence - and not in midfield - probably cost us points today.

875~~~
We need him in midfield.

876~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1WxIDmv-Ak?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This shows why we need him in midfield. He may not be the flashiest of passers but in terms of getting the ball into the strikers feet from deep and bypassing the opposition midfield then he is one of the best. Also he only needs 1-2 touches while some of our midfielders are too slow and cumbersome on the ball, we get pressed and they either give it away or have to revert back to the defence. With Carrick, he can take the ball of the defence and play it round the corner first time into the striker's feet or another midfielder.

I can't wait to see how we play when we sort our defence and he's back in midfield. If we play 4-3-3, we would be even better going forward.

877~~~
I agree, the longer England ignore him the bigger benefit to us.

878~~~
The difference he made in the second half of that match was noticeable after 30 seconds.

879~~~
The comparison is useful and informative, but there is one caveat that must be highlighted. 
Carrick played a majority of the time in defence. Blind in midfield.

880~~~
You are right. The point I was trying to prove is that there is no evidence that Carrick made us better in terms of team performance, or individual performance (compared to Blind). Daley has better stats but his role was a bit different.
In my opinion we can’t say either of them is better as long as we see them performing in the same role with similar players around.

I don’t think playing Carrick so deep is a good idea anyway.

881~~~
Stats are nice but don't tell the whole story.

Carrick makes more difficult passes than Blind and takes fewer touches before releasing the ball.

Blind does more closing down in midfield which gives the other team second thoughts about leaving their position to make runs into the box.

The two are about even in terms of effectiveness, but go about their jobs in different ways. I'm actually an advocate for starting Carrick in defence and Blind in midfield, but for that to happen we'd need both to be fit at once.

882~~~
I definately don't see Carrick and Blind competing for the same position, they should both be playing. I can't wait to see them both lining up together.

883~~~
I wish people would stop advocating for Carrick playing in defense, that means 3-5-2 and we all know how much we hate 3-5-2. He's a midfielder, he's 33 and I think its far too late in his career to convert him to a centerback, he hasn't actually got any REAL experience there like other defensive players, he was always a makeshift. Play him in midfield, and midfield only.

884~~~
Think it was <a class="username" data-user="66599, @LR7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66599/">@LR7</a> who said it. The shackles have been removed. I don't think it's a coincidence that we have been better since he returned from injury.

885~~~
Steady Eddie, nice to see him have less to do today as we'll need him at full tilt against Spurs.

886~~~
We're ten times better when he's in midfield pulling the strings.

887~~~
Yeah I remember banging that drum a fair bit. I refused to accept that he just turned shit last season, as the general consensus on here seemed to suggest. I love Carrick. Brings a calmness and confidence to our midfield. He's playing just as well now as he did in Fergie's final season which suggests the tactics/style of play suits him (and the team) better. 

With Blind out I think LvG was right to sub him off today as we have no cover for him. When fit, I'd quite like to see him and Blind in midfield three together (with Rooney, or if Rooney is further forward Herrera or Fellaini) though at some point as I think they'd provide solidity and protection in front of our brittle injury prone defence.

888~~~
The OP was right.

889~~~
Glad the game was won so we could get him off and rest him. Gives us something that no one else in the squad (except <i>maybe </i>Blind<i>) </i>is capable of.

890~~~
Agreed. He played well yesterday and subbing him was a great call.

891~~~
Think we notably lost some control when he came off

892~~~
Our most important player?

893~~~
In a shout..  Great player.

894~~~
It's quite worrying to see how much he improves us considering his age. I hope he helps Blind in becoming that sort of player, or we bring in someone similar.

895~~~
The other options for his role are Fellaini and Fletcher, now that Blind's out. 

Playing either of them at the heart of our midfield is handicapping ourselves severely, sadly.

Blind himself has been at the heart of a couple of very good performances even if he lacks the physique and passing range of Carrick at this moment in time. Even so, playing him in that role is miles better than playing Fellaini/Fletcher.

896~~~
The midfield version of Teddy Sheringham. Not blessed with great pace, but his reading of the game, his movement off the ball, his passing and coolness under pressure makes him our most important player, imo. If he stays injury free, we can get a few more years out of him.

897~~~
Unless Blind suddenly improves massively in that regard, he's never going to come close to having Carrick's passing range.

898~~~
Carrick is easily the much better passer. His range is comfortably better than Blind. Dont really need to see them perform the same role etc to see that.

Carrick's the superior player without doubt for me. Has everything Blind has and more.

899~~~
Just realized he will be up against his former team tomorrow. Will he be booed by the home fans?

Young got booed in the previous away game

900~~~
Surely not. He joined us ages ago. Has been so very important to us this season.

901~~~
Because he dived against them earlier, not because he left.

On Carrick: no, he won't be.

902~~~
I thought he was done after last season but he's proven me wrong. As someone mentioned, he's playing as well as he was playing in fergie's final year. I'd love to see him and di maria as 2 of the 3 midfield. I think carrick would find so much room for di maria to exploit.

903~~~
The list of people looking to write him off after last season because he was turning 33 was incredibly stupid. Midfielders with his intelligence can play until their late 30s. The likes of Scholes and Pirlo have actually <i>peaked </i>rather than getting worse at this age. Someone like Lampard is still going strong at 36 at the top level too.

904~~~
This. All we need to do is make sure we have energy around him and we'll be fine.

905~~~
His contract is up in June, right? Hope we get him to sign a new one ASAP.

906~~~
I don't think we need to worry.

907~~~
Poorest game since his comeback, looked very tired which is understandable.

908~~~
He did not get enough of the ball to influence the game.

909~~~
Although he uncharacteristically lost the ball a few times I still thought he looked decent. The ball that put RVP in for example was absolutely class and deserved an assist.

910~~~
In the last couple of games, Van Gaal has played Rooney a lot higher up with Mata, which means that when teams counter us, Carrick can be sometimes left on his own, especially if Rooney's made a run in behind, and Mata has to track back. This is why I think, as good as Mata has been in the couple of games, if we're going to play with one holding midfielder, we need two box to box players ahead of Carrick, otherwise we'll be too open. We struggled against Newcastle in the first 15-20 minutes too.

Having said that, apart from when the ball was intercepted from Kane, I felt Carrick was good as usual on the ball. The passes he made to Van Persie and Mata were fantastic.

911~~~
He looked knackered in the second half, which is a worry. He needs some rest and can't be expected to play three games in a week like he used to. The problem is our other options are injured again.

912~~~
He'll be 34 in July so we shouldn't be expecting any more than a bit-part role for him when everyone else is fit.

913~~~
Or maybe, just maybe playing 2 PL games in 48 hours was just a bit too much. I wouldn't call it a bit-part role. He'll easily be able to start 30 odd games a season. It's just having the luxury of a player who can step in for him...something we just don't have at the moment.

914~~~
The Ohly thing worse than swing Carrick having one of those days is seeing Fletcher coming on as a sub - so today was a good day!

915~~~
Was knackered in the second half. One of the reasons we weren't great as he dropped off.

Really needed Blind during this period.

916~~~
Van Gaal is building a new team - surely common sense tells us he's not going to be building it round a 34 year old?

917~~~
Well yes, because Blind is injured.

918~~~
Until we have a player with the passing range he offers from deeper areas, I'd guess that we are building the team around him.

Players with that passing range and general influence aren't easy to pick up. I like Blind, but in Carrick's absence he showed us that we lack a penetrative passer when Carrick isn't there.

919~~~
At present yes, but not for the future. LVG will know himself he needs a replacement sooner rather than later. Carrick has one more season after this in him at the top level.

920~~~
Ideally, we would not have had to play Carrick today (age), but injuries have forced Louis to play players who needed the rest today.

In January, we have to at least try to bring in a proper box to box man.  We can't ride Carrick forever and Blind can only do so much.

921~~~
His endurance seemed to fall off a cliff midway through the 2nd. We were clearly lacking depth there today.

922~~~
In an ideal world he'd play once a week, we just have no cover for him atm.
Perhaps a tad controversial, but he should probably consider retiring from International football too.

923~~~
It's amazing how much we still depend of his performance, he was class in the first half and we were dominating, but as soon as he slowed down we looked much worse.

924~~~
Really need Blind to be fit so he can be rotated with Carrick and allow him a rest. Was a little slow on the ball a few times as he got fatigued. Still probably deserved an assist though, that ball to RvP was quality.

925~~~
Hit a couple of excellent passes over the top, which is a good sign. Agreed that getting Blind back and having them rotate will be good for him.

926~~~
Not sure if it can all be attributed to him but Eriksen totally pulled a Cleverley.

927~~~
He should have stuck the fingers up to England and Hodgson years ago. Ridiculous he couldn't get in over Gareth Barry et al.

928~~~
Agree completely.

929~~~
Could be wrong but I thought he didn't play well after that tackle, its unlike him to stay down and he was down for about 30 seconds and after that he went missing.

930~~~
his lack of pace and mobility drives me crazy, his positioning and crisp passing is good but his movement oh god.. The midfield didn't exist for another time and it was only poor Tottenham side. I know we played twice in 48 hours but so did others.. We can cope with him this season and Blind but I expect we buy someone better to this very important position and finally make the MOSt important replecement of all replacement after some years as I always thought we need mainly defensive minded midfielder.. Give carrick his 20matches per season where he is fully fit and he will excell. I think he would also be killer if he played as CB against some low table sides but I doubt starting him against high pressing teams such as Soton and other world class teams in midfield would be wise. When you see Matic in that blue shirt you are thinking about replacement because it is unreal how good he is, how much better he is than Blind and Carrick who should be backups for the top club which wants to win champions league one day soon.

931~~~
Bizarre post. Have you forgotten the times we reached (and won) the UCL with that man Carrick in the side? Just because Blind and Carrick aren't as strong or crunching as Matic doesn't make them poor players. They're two of the very best holding midfielders in the league. Matic is currently wank-fest flavour of the month, but there's nothing he's doing at the minute that Carrick at his best would do. I don't know why people are disillusioned with this view that your defensive midfielder must be a massive unit who solely tackles and imposes himself. Intercepting, reading and recycling play are just as important, and the two we have are the very best at it in the league. Plus, they fit the philosophy, so if you're not happy with them, you better be ready for a player in the same ilk to replace.

932~~~
I thought Carrick mobility is an huge issue, but now I’ve changed my mind. With right players around him, and better movement (surely we’ve already improved in that regard) he will blossom.

Comparing Matic to Carrick of old makes no sense at all though, he’s 34 now and we can’t expect him to do the same amount of running as he used to do in our glory days. That’s a mistake Moyes did IMO, and that’s why Carrick looked so shit last year- too much was demanded from him.

933~~~
Yeah, I guess that part of my post was a bit suspect. But still, I retain that he and Blind are good enough for competing. We're quite far from UCL challenging but there's quite a few position that need amendments first.

934~~~
this is what Matic does also and I would say that he is even better at this than Carrick. You are living in the past.. Shall we play Fletcher than who sadly missed out on the final but helped hugely to get there? I only say to keep our standards high not okay which both players are - OKAY. I say it again midfield has been the biggest problem for us past 3 years or more and Carrick being the best midfielder says it all. Not all the players need to be world class of course. but we have too many pllyers that rely on other players to supplement them. Blind is suddenly someone extraordinary, yes comparing him to Anderson, Cleverley or Gibson yes he is, but to the top bracket... Which of top teams around the world does have worse holding midfielders than us? None.. Look at Arsenal they have got Flamini, Arteta, similar bracket to Blind/Carrick and they play for fourth year after year. Not that this is their only problem but surely they need to strenghten at this position more than anywhere else.. We are really not 2008 mate .-)

935~~~
Are you seriously stating that Carrick and Blind aren't better than Flamini and Arteta? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
I'd take Carrick and Blind over Fernando too.

936~~~
they are quite the same level, Flamini is really underated , I think I've seen a lot of Arsenal games this year and he isn't that bad. Arteta didn't have the best season last campaign but neither had carrcik who really highlight season came the last fergies season two season before that he was quite average but yeah everybody will claim that he was in the shadow of Scholes.. And Arteta was brilliant from the time he arrived there, after all he is the captain now.. Well maybe it is time get back to reality, time to burst that United bubble and look out of the box a little, don't you think? or maybe this <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/> is better I know.. Fernando is completely different player from both of them but I think he does the job really well so does fernandinho and their game seems pretty much faster and secure at the back due to their anchoring, but they have different approach to this.. do you really not have any other examples to compare? but maybe don't even try, I guess we are done here then.. good day and at least think about it .-)

937~~~
Ah the new flavour of the month - Nemanja Matić..

938~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1. Blind and Carrick vs Flamini and Arteta is a no contest
2. Fernandinho has been shite for the majority of the season

939~~~
actually no they are only overrated by their fans(United) and it goes the same within the other clubs. I believe you didn't even watched them play(the other players) and live in this United bubble. The emoticon you used actually tells a lot about you and your stance where you don't even accept the possibility of being wrong or think about other options but for some people life is easier like that and I think I would waste my time explaining you anything while you wouldn't be even listening. But I was almost like that when I was younger so don't worry it will change..

940~~~
No he is not, hes fecking shite!

941~~~
Yeah, Flamini's gash. Was quite good in his first stint with Arsenal but piss poor this season. Something even die-hard gooners would agree with.

942~~~
Can't believe people are saying that Carrick is on the level with Flamini. The Flamini from the 07-08 season?

Flamini's more mobile and puts himself about but he's fecking gash on the ball and a liability.

943~~~
If you say so mate.

944~~~
Oh come on, stop being so patronising, you're the guy who said that Zaha's performance against us this season was shit.

945~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Even Arsenal fans would laugh at you for saying that.

946~~~
Should have said the same about Cleverley and maybe I shall say this about Keane too once we play Burnley and then maybe it will take a couple of weeks and some people will get it, come on it's so obvious, you don't mean it right? :-)

btw I am not being any sarcastic in my posts in this thread

947~~~
I believe your reaction was dedicated to me as I mentioned Flamini and Carrick in one post but never compared the two between themselves. I rather compared Falmini to Blind who is obviously Pirlo sright away here... and Carrick to Arteta even they are very different players they mean about the same to their teams in terms of performances. I gave an example of Arsenal because I think they are one of the "big teams who doesn't sorted out their holding midfielder position, That is what their fans are calling for some time after Song's departure even he wasn't really a holding midfielder. I didn't say by no means that Carrick is worse than Flamini, they are completely different players, but both do their jobs right for their teams. Maybe that is why Flamini played the most minutes for the team from all midfielders. Maybe they don't have any more players for the position but neither we have... 

Blind + Carrick = Arteta + Flamini, more or less in terms of performance and neither couple is good enough for the very top club which wants to win the champions league. I don't believe Real Madrid would play or depend on 34 old carrick or Blind who is really overrated here. Neither would Bayern or Barcelona depend on them and pick them as their NO1 option. I believe we bought blind as there were no other options in the market that's why he came in so late. Carrick should play like 20-25 games a season to give his everything not to start every game. Both could do the right job with the right players around them but I would rather find someone who we want to build on and who will get the players around him better.. Flamini is doing pretty good job considering their defense is shite and he is the only defensive minded player in their midfield and as you stated he is mobile, can stuck in, but I don't agree he is liability on the ball. It's called dirty job and not everyone can see this or rate this, and every player is quite different in this particular position as holding/deep laying midfielder..

but I guess this is all useless as I am on Michael Carrick's fanpage where everyone can only see him doing it right and the way it is <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

948~~~
There is a very good reason why most Arsneal fans have been calling for Wenger to sign a real DM for a few seasons.

949~~~
Can you tell me which Flamini you're watching? Flamini is an useless midfielder, he's rash, has no tactical awareness, can do nothing with the ball and in top matches, he is never competent enough to do the job, how the heck can you compare him with Carrick? Arsenal are screaming for a new DM for years, that's not just a coincidence.

950~~~
I wouldn't bother bringing Flamini to Old Trafford, if offered that option, even as a squad man.  He's just not the same player he once was and for Arsenal us as much a liability as an asset.

To in any way equate Flamini and Carrick is ridiculous.

Carrick has been worked pretty hard and needs some rest.  Ideally, we'd bring in a solid box to box man in January who can give us that option.  I'm good with Blind, but he's not where Carrick is just yet.

951~~~
Looked tired again. Really hope we see Blind soon.

952~~~
He was average today, and that was probably because of fatigue. Hope we can have some Blind return so we can give him some rest.

953~~~
I thought so as well, it's difficult at his age to be thrown in at the deep end immediately after an injury at the busiest time of the season, he didn't get a chance to ease back into the team with Blind's injury and then all the other CM's getting injured around him.

954~~~
Thought he looked tired and average too. Wish Blind was back.

955~~~
It's not easy being the only midfielder in the starting line-up.

956~~~
He's just so laboured in possession at times. Far too slow.

957~~~
I'd rather we played them both to be fair, though I agree Carrick does need a rest.

958~~~
Thats got to be the worst he's played in years. I can't ever remember his passing being so off.

Was crap for the goal too.

959~~~
Was terrible today. Misplaced a lot of passes.

960~~~
He was very poor today but I don't think it helps him having to fill one for one of our 3 centre backs every time they run down a blind alley. It's a waste of our best passer.

961~~~
Hasnt been perticularly good in all the top matches so far except Liverpool , twice vs Southampton, off vs Spurs and off the pace vs Arsenal.

962~~~
He was definitely off today. I can't help but wonder if he could use a short break, particularly given how important he will be later in the season.

963~~~
Agreed and with Blind back he should be given some time off to rest. He has been playing a lot since coming back from injury and he isn't getting any younger so some time off will do him good.

964~~~
Didnt play badly but he slows us down.

965~~~
I think his presence this season has been overstated. He's not playing badly but I haven't been all too impressed. I think his return and our unbeaten run was actually something of a small coincidence, something that could have been achieved had, let's say, Blind played ahead of him all that time instead.

With that said, he's played reasonably well this season in a horrible formation. If he had some pace ahead of him and some players to link up with then I think he would be even better. Blind, Herrera and Di Maria could build good relationships with him if Van Gaal allowed it to happen.

966~~~
Hasn't looked right the last few games, very lethargic and not really getting into the games much.

967~~~
Needs a bit of rest. He has played every minute since his injury comeback besides a 30 minute break against Newcastle.

968~~~
Did okay, but looks tired. With Blind back, I hope he gets a rest soon.

969~~~
This 3-5-2 is pathetic for him, he can play the central defender but it makes no sense to have 3 defenders behind him because he is not young enough to be pressing from the front. We end up playing incredibly deep rather than putting pressure on the other team

970~~~
It's verging on pointless having Carrick sit in front of 3 centre backs.

Sure, he appears when Evans et al go missing but it doesn't allow for the passing he is capable of because we are literally just knocking it about with little purpose. And trying to play balls into Di Maria's feet with his back to goal against bigger and stronger players, again verging on pointless.

971~~~
Very dissapointed with him today. Cold and windy night against a lower league side who gives 100%...THESE are the games your veteran players should grab by the neck and take control over. Except one good pass, he did nothing else besides pass it sideways and hide from the ball.

972~~~
I'd like to see Blind returned to the #6 role next game and just see how we do with a more urgent player at the base.

973~~~
Don't think Carrick could do much more tonight. Movement in front of him was very poor and centre midfielders played way too high up. Blind wouldn't have done anything different.

974~~~
He's been average this season. He looks pretty much the same as he did last season. 

He's good at those drilled balls along the ground to the front men, a few more wouldn't go a miss. Show Jones and Rojo what a ball over the top is supposed to looks like. He can do more than he is when we're camped outside the oppositions half like tonight.

975~~~
I would really appreciate if Mr Consistency was used as squad player ffs, not as the key player who he is not for a long time and never was apart the last fergies season where he was brilliant and deserved that chant with Scholeses name included, I admit..

but I strongly suggest we finally invest some money in great defensive midfielder or use the ones we have in a more defensive shape, Real doesn't need one also, why shouldn't we try to play with Herrera (he looks much more solid and accurate in his tackles than Fellaini) and di maria in midfield, Blind is about okay but still no world class defensive minded midfielder in club like Manchester United. I am very sceptical about it.. That Lucas Silva is a bargain imo, we will see soon, Schneiderlin, Strootman, even Wanyama would improve us massively.

 But well maybe there was really no one availible on the market in the summer considering we bought another future back up option in Blind in last few days of the window, maybe we are waiting for strootman but I don't think it is good enough state right now.. It is as big problem as our ageing overrated attack or our unstable error prone and injury prone defense. Hopefully we will asses this soon because I can't imagine us outplaying any of the big teams atm  let alone clubs like Soton which are dozens around the world... with what we lined up today - 34 yo legless Carrick included..

976~~~
The worst I've seen Carrick in a few years. Weird, his worst performance came against Cambridge United. He was obviously not fit. After 3-4 horrible first touches and passes (!!) by him he lost courage and wouldn't come for the ball or make himself available, causing Jones and Rojo having to bomb forward. He should have been subbed, but simply because he didn't look sharp to me. Having said that, his one pass almost won us the game...

977~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> That ball for Falcao.

Didn't have his best day but he was marked hard and crowded out. Cambridge left Jones open to bring the ball out so Carrick couldn't get on it. He just couldn't get the space to turn and look up the field. Poor day but credit to Cambridge for marking him out of the match and leaving Jones free to try start attacks which didn't work for us and worked for them.

978~~~
But Carrick is better than all of those players...

979~~~
on this forum and in this particular thread, of course, overrated player by united fans at the end of his playing days. Some people will never wake up

980~~~
He'll go down as one of our club's best ever midfielders, certainly one of the most decorated. A mainstay in our team during the most successful period in our history. I suggest you are the one that needs to wake up.

981~~~
I don't say he had a bad career at United, not at all he was great. He was consistent, professional long-serving midfielder, I just don't think he was never even close to world-class say Scholes brackett in terms of ability (and I know he was a different type of player), in terms of personality and career he will definitely be there, I don't argue with you but I just don't rate him as footballer as highly as other united fans which are simply biased. And all I wanted to say is that we shouldn't consider him as the player who we build a new-era team around. Next year when we should be competing for the premier league title and good run in the champions league. He will be 35 and the next season 36 and not even now he is up to the tempo of mid table clubs like Soton. We should have a replacement for him a long time ago, that is all.

982~~~
While he may have dropped off he is certainly better than Wanyama. Probably needs a squad role though. I'd like to see Blind get another go in that position.

983~~~
He's had a few poor games, it can happen to everyone. And he's certainly been one of our best players over the past decade and one of Fersuson's most successful signings ever, there's no need to start that debate again.

First things first, he will always have my respect because he was thrown in at the deep end by Sir Alex from day one. He was chosen to replace a player with completely different skills and attributes who could cover a lot of yards on the pitch with his running and stamina. Carrick, while not mobile or physical enough, was asked to cover the same areas on the pitch as Keane and he quickly adopted to that role. He was an integral part of our 2006-07 team that played some fantastic football in England and in Europe. It's really a shame that he had to wait till 2013 to finally get some recognition among United fans when it was obvious that he was trying to hold our midfield together all by himself.

There's no point comparing him to Wanyama or Schneiderlin either because they are different players who can offer different things on the pitch. In a possession based football team the best role for a holding midfielder like Carrick is at the base of a reverted triangle (or diamond) with two box to box midfielders slightly ahead of him. Two midfielders who, during the build up phase, are comfortable enough to get on the ball in deeper positions and carry it forwards but also able to push opposition players away from our half with their off the ball movement.

Unfortunately, we don't have the players who can operate as deep lying play makers. The closest we have to that is Herrera, who is quick and quite physical, but he hasn't become familiar with the role yet. He used to play in more advanced positions in the midfield and you can see that he's still feeling nervous whenever he gets on the ball in front of our box. His first though is always to pass the ball and not keep it and run with it in order to open up spaces in the midfield. The same thing could be said about Di Maria, he had a more or less free role at RM in front of Modric and Alonso and now we're trying to turn him into Modric. And i don't even want to discuss Rooney being utilized in that role

In yesterday's game the box to box midfielders where Januzaj and Fellaini. Neither of them is a ball carrier and that resulted to Januzaj staying up and away from the midfield battle and Fellaini staying deep (but away from the ball) to provide cover. We actually had Carrick-Fellaini in front of the back four with Januzaj and Di Maria ahead of them in an awkward 4-2-2-2 that made us look static and unimaginative.

Now, one can say that Carrick had a bad game yesterday because he saw a lot of the ball and he was provided with enough space to pick the right pass and all we can remember is that forward pass towards Falcao. Imo we must take into consideration that we had Januzaj, Di Maria, Valencia and Blind to do that. All they managed to achieve is a good pass for van Persie's chance (from AdM) and a nice one two between Januzaj and Blind.

My point is that you can't expect Carrick to play the superman role. He is a good distributor of the ball with exceptional positional awareness which means that he provides cover for the others to move forwards and can pick the right pass that will initiate an attacking play, but that's it. Yesterday, after the 30th minute we pretty much controlled the tempo, we had zero problems at the back and we could get our creative players on the ball in the attacking third. Of course Carrick won't get praise for that because it was only Cambridge but it's certainly not his fault that our WBs and CMs couldn't get past their markers or/and link well with the forwards.

We're pretty much covered in the holding CM position with Blind and Carrick, we just need to sign that one player who will be able to carry the ball and connect the lines.

984~~~
we've won some ugly matches with him back in the team. but we've not played great football.

985~~~
This exactly, his comeback (whilst hes been good) has been so overhyped. Hes also had some poor games himself.

986~~~
he hasn't been a force of change for attacking football. we've won and gained points but the footballs been dire. we as supporters don't get medals or trophies we get entertainment. which isn't happening. we are a bore fest and he's not the problem nor the solution so far. the dipper's game is an example. we scored 3 but DDG was MOTM because he had to stand on his head , if the had an in form striker we would have been beaten.

987~~~
I don't think he will. Most decorated yes, but not one of the best. I think he will go down as the best of a bunch of players who were never quite the replacements for Scholes and Keane the club hoped they were.

Right now however I agree with others that is being overrated heavily on here. He is no longer capable of being the deep lying midfielder on his own.

988~~~
I could of sworn his contract is up in the summer, can anyone confirm?

989~~~
It is true. But i'm pretty sure LvG wants to give him a new one.

990~~~
Needs to do it pretty soon!!

991~~~
This.  People need to understand that having a great career doesn't mean you are a great player.  Carrick was a decent player but at the moment he is being massively overrated by us, United fans.  Of course receiving praise by SAF will always bolster your reputation but SAF was sometimes, especially towards the end too loyal to his players even to a fault.

992~~~
Pretty sure we can just trigger an extension, and he can do the same.

993~~~
For me there's not much in between Carrick and Xabi Alonso in terms of quality. Now if you would say the same about Xabi, I would perhaps agree with you.

994~~~
I think you underestimate the type of player that Carrick is. There is nothing deluded about saying he is a great player. Together with RvP he carried us to win the League in 12/13.

995~~~
How long a contract will he be given? I doubt he's got more left in him than one more season at this level. Used to be extremely underrated and went to become quite overrated (SAF the latest example), I jumped on both bandwagons. He's a clever player with a great passing range. But like anyone at his age, he's getting on a bit and we could do with more dynamism in our midfield next season. A great option off the bench for next season and maybe that's it..

996~~~
Our policy for players over 30 is to give them a 1 year contract. I agree he is starting to loose the last bit of mobility, but he is a great player to have in the squad.

997~~~
Considering Blind is coming back from a knee injury, and Carrick himself is not long back from an injury, i'm surprised they have both played so many minutes recently. I'd prefer them to share the minutes at the base of the midfield.

998~~~
Don't get me wrong, I believe Carrick is a good player but he is not a top or great player.  Most of Carrick's and the rest of the players' performances in 12/13 were down to Fergie.  He is a centre midfielder and he hasn't created much in the last couple of seasons-yes he has had some good moments especially against Chelsea in the CL but there were so many times our midfield our midfield was overrun and non-existant.  It wasn't entirely his fault but he wasn't the type of player who would pull the strings either.  And he is not a defensive midfielder, just remember all those times we moaned when Fergie used him in that role and begged for a real defensive midfielder.

999~~~
Agree on this one. He is fine midfielder, with his limitations. Looks suberb when his role is to slow down play. Doesn’t look that good when we are trying to quicken things. But this year and last year we were asking him to do too much. It’s bizzare that he plays there on his own.

1000~~~
I pretty much disagree with all that. I guess we just see football different <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1001~~~
Now that we have Blind back, can we not move him to the middle of a back 3?

1002~~~

1003~~~
Take discussions of Carrick's injury to this thread please: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/carrick-out-for-one-single-month-soz-david-mcdonnell-sucks.400862/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/carrick-out-for-one-single-month-soz-david-mcdonnell-sucks.400862/</a>

1004~~~
Very important we get him tied down for a year more at least, and i don't doubt it will be done.

Fantastic player, with his style of playing maybe he could go on till he is 38, maybe not all the years for us, but he doesn't have to take a step down in terms of league i think.

He should be in the England team tbh, what that team needs is a holding-midfielder like Carrick, Wilshere doesn't cut it yet.

Glad we have him!

1005~~~
He has the remarkable trait of suddenly becoming world class when he is not on the pitch

1006~~~
The way Blind was getting forward yesterday I wonder if LvG might consider a 4-3-3 with Carrick holding and Blind & Herrera as the 2 more advanced CM's.

1007~~~
Funny, because when he returned to fitness earlier in the season and we went on a run winning of 6 out of 7 games with him at the heart of it, you had a certain someone saying this about him:

<i>"I think Michael's the best central midfielder in English football," Ferguson told BT Sport. "I think he's the best English player in the game."</i>

1008~~~
Definitely a good option for tough games and I think Herrera is probably better the higher he is up the pitch. For most games we probably only need 2 of the 3, although I think those 3 with ADM when back on form, Rooney and Januzaj has potential.

1009~~~
If LvG wants to control games from midfield I'd play all 3 regular, Blind is more creative than most of us thought IMO. The front 3 of Young/Rooney/Di Maria or Januzaj would be my choice.

1010~~~
He also thought Anderson, Cleverley, Kleberson, Veron etc. were world class too, I hate it when people think quoting someone like Fergie ends the argument (no doubt I've done it in the past too). He could equally point towards Carrick's continuous overview by several noteable England manager as weight to his point, but its bollocks.

1011~~~
Hopefully he starts vs Newcastle. His composure and extra bit of defensive quality and height will potentially be vital in the coming weeks... Will be interesting to see both Carrick and Blind in midfield together, think the most they've played together was a couple of games with Blind as part of the defence. Blind, Carrick and Herrera can be an excellent midfield IMO, at least on paper it is.

1012~~~
Well Veron was World Class just not when he played here(or after).

1013~~~
the same man said Valencia is better than Bale and that Jones would become the best United player ever.. 

Carrick is maybe underrated from outside of club but really just overrated from within the club. Hope we finally realize that he's not the perspective player we should build on and use him as squad player for the rest of the season and the following one at most. I like his passing range, consistency and maturity but he links the play too slow for what we should aim for, he's simply out of legs and high pressing game giving him hard time picking players or marking when defending. 

And I don't think Blind is the answer either if you asked me, I expect summer spending on this position as if we want to win the champions league (or play at the highest level) we need to strengthen in this position. Hargreaves is the last defensive minded midfielder we bought and it's been good long 8 years, so I get all this excitement about Blind and Carrick raise of form in Fergie's last season for what he earned well deserved praise. But since that we are getting carried away perhaps little bit too much with Mr. consistency.

1014~~~
No, he didn't. I'm sure he thought Verón was world class but when he was one of the top 3 playmakers in the strongest league in the world at a time when Zidane, Rui Costa and co. were playing there, that wasn't exactly a controversial opinion. I didn't say it ended the argument. I just said he was highly rated when he was last playing too - back when we were winning games consistently, and that was undoubtedly in part thanks to his form.

1015~~~
Did you take that from the one post before yours? This seems to be one of the few cases where a missing player hasn't been over hyped on here.

Anyway I'm glad he's nearly back. I still favour him to Blind, but rate them both highly. Would be interested to see them play together in the middle.

1016~~~
This kind of posts are one of the most annoying things in United forum, there is always at least one poster that says this for every one of our players.

1017~~~
I'm a bit skeptical over him and Blind in midfield together. Not sure it would work. Glad he is back though, want him to get some minutes against Newcastle.

1018~~~
I think its worth a go, Blind and Carrick. I'm anxious to see it actually, just to see how it affects us on both sides of the ball.

1019~~~
Got to be worth checking out ahead of the big games against top 4 teams we have coming up.

1020~~~
He's still a few levels above Blind for me. Best midfielder we have.

1021~~~
Kind of true though.

1022~~~
Think in big games, along with Herrera for the energy, creativity and overall attacking quality, it would be great. In smaller games it probably wouldn't be necessary. Though Blind can develop his attacking game more as he did against Sunderland then it'd be fine. The three of them together has great passing from all of them, but Carrick has the range, Blind always makes himself available and can pass the ball on, and then Herrera adds the pace and incisiveness and creativity. Defensively it's fine as well I think.

1023~~~
Easily

1024~~~
Fergie was too loyal to his players towards the end of his tenure and the fact that Carrick was a player he got on with so well due to his character was a significant factor in SAF saying that, not to mention his many bizarre comments on Beckham, Gerrard and Lampard.

I'm not Carrick's biggest fan but I acknowledge what he has given to the club.  However I won't overrate him as a player.  He was good not top class and in the biggest games it was shown.

1025~~~
Nah, it's bollox.

His reputation was established by what he's done on the pitch, not in his absence.

Apart from anything else, up until this season he's been fairly resistant to injuries.

1026~~~
Good to see him get on, hopefully he might get an hour in against Arsenal in the cup.

1027~~~
Really want to see a Blind/Carrick midfield base.

1028~~~
Just watched this videos sen be a newbie:

Defensively a class apart from Blind imo while still having a great range.

Really want to see Blind play as a box to box CM and Carrick slightly deeper.

1029~~~
With some tough upcoming games, i'm so glad he's back. When fit, he should be definitely start, in my opinion. No one has the ability to play penetrative balls through to the attacking players when he doesn't play.

1030~~~
I'm glad he's back but I'm not expecting the world. He wasn't that amazing when he played this season and it takes him time to get going after not playing.

1031~~~
Has to start vs Arsenal !

1032~~~
Without Carrick we always look like getting caught out on the break.

Probably because Carrick pretty much stays just ahead of the back 4 all game hardly getting forward. I'm all for playing Carrick and Blind together. We need that stability and Carrick can provide effective passing from deep.

1033~~~
Lol box to box? Are you serious Blind runs slower than Gareth Barry!

1034~~~
Why the feck with 3 mins on the clock and putting Carrick on was he getting all the low downs on tactics?? (Baffling)

1035~~~
I think because Carrick will more find a forward pass over Blind. We had control but were lacking that killer ball from deep. Carrick has a better range of passing that could get the ball further up quicker than blind. Thats my guess. 

other options were falcao who is useless at the moment and only there if rooney had to come off injured. I dont suppose you rather he had put on Jones? or Mcnair? or maybe Lindegaard? It made sense to take off a defender and put on a more forward thinking player. Plus blind has some fantastic crosses from out wide unlike rojo.

1036~~~
Know it's just a highlight video, but it is amazing how many times he is perfectly positioned to rectify a mistake by one of his teammates.  This team needs someone like that more than ever.  His absence almost makes it so that Fellani is undroppable.  Hopefully that changes soon

1037~~~
You don't need to be quick to play box to box. He's fairly decent defensively without being exceptional and his passing and ability to shoot and get forward suits a box to box role a lot more than the current DM role. A midfield 3 of Carrick, Blind and Herrera sounds very good to me.

1038~~~
His form in the last 10 games could be the key in deciding whether we'll finish in the top 4 or not. I am glad he is back; hopefully fully recovered and with his early season form (after he came back from injury) back. There will lot of backs to wall defending in the remaining games and I feel much more secure with Carrick than I do with Blind holding.

1039~~~
Think you missed my point Chaddy! I don't disagree with what your saying, what I'm saying with 3 mins to go and needing a goal, Carrick is stood at the sideline getting instructions from the sheets (set pieces etc) we have 3 mins to go for feck sake. The instructions should be simple get on and make something happen. Pick up Rojo man at corners! Simple!

1040~~~
Blind is a good player but Carrick is several levels above. Delighted he's back.

1041~~~
Perhaps that is why you aren't a professional coach and they are. Football isn't that simple, you don't just throw tactics out the window because there are only 3 minutes left. For all we know Carrick could have relayed instructions on the pitch that led to the goal.

1042~~~
Who would you play with Carrick and Blind? Herrera/Mata in front of them in a 4-2-3-1? I'd prefer that to that pairing as a midfield two.

1043~~~
Carrick/Blind/Herrera for me. Plan B - Bring on Fellaini.

1044~~~
Really you believe that? In three minutes there is not enough time to have a tactical input. Carrick touched the ball what once? I'm not saying a sub can't have an impact but I wouldn't be bogging them down with tactics with that short time left. I'd just be getting him on and saying something short like get forward or sit and cover x y z. And by the way football is that simple at that stage in the game. Don't make it out that coaches are some special humans that have special insight that no one else but them have. We all see and read the game the way we want to read it.

1045~~~
Agreed, with ADM and Young on the wings and Rooney upfront. However, Carrick's been out for a some time and wasnt in good form prior to his injury so lets hope he picks up form right away

1046~~~
Oh well that I agree with. I aswell was like wtf kinda set play instructions do you need. Pick up whoever Rojo was picking up and go help us nick a goal. Apologies for the mix up

1047~~~
Thought he did well. As a 34 year old thrown in at half time against the pacey Arsenal players to shield the defence, he added a sense of diversity to our passing with more long range switches, he seemed sharp and alert to intercept a few chances.

A positive among quite a few negatives today.

1048~~~
Thought he was absolute garbage tonight for the first 20-30 minutes of the game and the decision to bring him on for Herrara cost us the game.

Understable, given that it was his first game back and he never should have been thrown into that.

1049~~~
Did well. Some excellent passes and defensive contribution. The sending off fecked us not Carrick or the sub

1050~~~
Thought he was solid. Didn't really influence the match though. Although with the sending off it was gonna be tough.

1051~~~
Can get Blind's place, his passing range with both feet is absurd.

1052~~~
Did well when he came on. A couple of levels above Blind IMO. Blind is a decent player but he is in poor form and isn't suited to being a box to box player and Carrick is just a better player all around. Put him next to Herrera and we'll be much better off for it.

1053~~~
You only realise how limited and slow on the ball Blind is when Carrick is on the pitch. And I quite like Blind. Easily our best player in the second half.

1054~~~
He absolutely should - just not for Herrera, either Blind should have come off or gone to Left Back.

He was our best player in the second half by a mile for virtue of a) being able to pass to a team-mate quickly and accurately and b) not absolutely shitting himself under pressure.

1055~~~
It's poor that an unfit 33 year old Carrick is so much quicker and mobile than Blind who is 9 years younger than him.

1056~~~
His passing emphasized how little Blind and Herrera had done on the ball most of the game, but a midfield of Carrick/Blind/Fellaini may be the slowest, least athletic every to grace a top level club.

1057~~~
Milan threw out aging facsimiles of Gattuso, Ambrosini and Van Bommel a few years ago. Seedorf was old, too, though still technically Clarence Seedorf.

1058~~~
Played well. I still have no idea why he doesn't have over 100 caps. England have no DM's and apart from one serious swoon (and even guys like Scholes and Giggs had those) he's basically been a 7.5/10 for over 10 years now, since his final 2 years at Spurs.

1059~~~
His passing with his left foot is amazing. He will be able to play until 40.

1060~~~
I want a gif of that pass where he received the ball and then in one movement proceeded to play a sublime pass to Young with his left foot. That was brilliant.

1061~~~
He is 10 times the player that Blind ever will be. 

Our downfall has coincided with him being more injured in the last two seasons. Our most important outfielder.

1062~~~
It was a shame Van Gaal decided to hook Herrera off rather than Blind, we then had two very similar players in the second half. Herrera's dynamic contribution would've been better served had he had Carrick's passing to find him between the lines. Wrong sub imo, Carrick did nothing wrong but it was just the wrong combination in midfield. 

And yeah that left footed pass to Young was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1063~~~
He was absurdly good. Emphasized how much we miss him- and Blind is not his replacement.

1064~~~
By some distance our best midfielder, and that's been the case far too long.

We should of signed someone better than him in the summer, but instead he's still our best option. Not that this is a bad thing, but he's 33.

Blind will never be as good as Michael Carrick.

1065~~~
Glad to have him back and his range of passing is sublime, but its no coincidence our game slowed right down after he came on. We need to find his genuine replacement soon because he's going to drop off a cliff in a year or two i reckon.

1066~~~
Carrick was the only one not spending an age on the ball deciding who to pass too (then not pass too, then think I probably should pass to that person, then pass to them)...

We slowed down simply because our midfield had no legs in it, and we went even more direct.

1067~~~
In isolation it looks that way, but last time he came back from injury we also started playing at a crawl again after a decent few games. I dont think its a coincidence. Something ive noticed for a while with Carrick is if he doesnt fancy the ball, he'll hide behind people. That doesnt help passing fluidity when your key CM doesnt want the ball.

1068~~~
Carrick made more passes last night in one half of football then all but 4 of the rest of our team did for the full 90. He wasn't hiding at all last night, he's the only fecker that was remotely competent on the ball in the second half.

1069~~~
If Blind and Carrick are the players we build our future team on than we will not win anything. Both are good squad options against lesser oppositions, defensively, physically and mobility wise they are out of their depth for modern top football, one is almost 34 and the second is playing at his best now. Let alone we need completely different player there.. It's also beyond me how so called very experienced manager can play both in one team. 

I think Jack Colback and many others in the league would do the better job for us in the middle of the park than the two (Mccarthy, Wanyama, Schneiderlin, Sandro, Bentaleb, Coquelin, Matic, Ramirez, Henderson, N'zonzi... and that is only from EPL, certainly not all of them better passers than Carrick or Blind but would do BETTER JOB there. I think Van Gaal seems out of his depth when using the word balance

I don't know how that happened but how we can't have really good holding/defensive midfielder for years is really sad, Manchester United once the best club in the world..

1070~~~
Jack Colback...<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1071~~~
Needs to start our key games coming up. In fact he would be perfect to drop and make it a back three when needed.

He distributes the ball well and can find our wingers directly which Blind cant (Blind passes to the left back or right back to find the wingers). Maybe part of the less risk policy of LVG?

1072~~~
Random question - Is this the first time Carrick and Blind have been fit at the same time this season?

1073~~~
His passing was bang on point. But why bother playing him if you're hoofing to Fellaini?

1074~~~
And then there were some who said Blind is much better than Carrick and has better vision as well...

1075~~~
Agreed. Blind was having difficulty concentrating, or so it seemed to me.

1076~~~
Watch him get pressed and once again struggle. That Spurs CM is his idea of hell. They're not great players but they're mobile, have huge stamina and work their arses off.

I wouldn't play him. Not his type of game.

1077~~~
What a player!

1078~~~
Excellent so far. Well-timed assist and nice header for the goal.

1079~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1080~~~
An assist and a goal, the second captain is doing his job alright.

1081~~~
Back to being our best player. Form is temporary and all that blah di blah.

1082~~~
Brilliant!

With the genius back, we'll get top four. I feel reassured.

1083~~~
Didn't they both play in the loss at Etihad?

1084~~~
They also played together during the second half against Arsenal.

1085~~~
That's when he asked the question I think.

1086~~~
A wonderful footballer!

Love him.

1087~~~
Carrick/Herrera CM is dominating. Herrera adds pace and the ability to drive forward. Hopefully LVG sticks with that combination from now on.

1088~~~
You only need to go back 3-4 pages to get all the typical nonsense sprouted about him.

1089~~~
Possibly the most under rated player of the last decade.

1090~~~
MOTM so far. Bossing it

1091~~~
Legend

1092~~~
Taking the piss.

1093~~~
Been great so far, beautiful pass for Fellaini and great goal. Fantastic so far.

1094~~~
Outstanding first half from him.

1095~~~
One of the best individual halves of the season.

1096~~~
Majestic

1097~~~
That header was fantastic.

1098~~~
What a huge fecking difference he makes to the team when he is fit and on song.

To this day still so underrated. How on earth are we going to replace him. Tall order for us this Summer.

1099~~~
"hard to believe its not Scholes..."

1100~~~
That start to the half from Carrick reminded me of his start to the 7-1 Roma game back in the 06-07 season.

Steps forward from his position and makes it happen further up the pitch, fans get behind the team and we go on to have a great half.

I've always seen that 7-1 game as the turning point for that United side... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1101~~~
What was his celebration all about?

1102~~~
Said it all along (with many in here), Blind still has a long way to prove he's capable of replacing Carrick. Although Blind is starting to win me over.

1103~~~
Yeah, it's quite obvious that he's our main man in midfield, and it's no coincidence that our fortunes this season started to change when he made his way back into our lineup after injury.

Class player.

1104~~~
Him back as the lone #6 with two #8's in front of him and we look a much better side, no argument there.

1105~~~
What was Pochettino thinking coming into OT without a plan for Carrick and then affording him all that time and space on the ball? There's only one result after that. Kind of a similar pattern to the game at WHL except they survived a draw that time.

1106~~~
Some player. Not having an alternative to him for so long has been an issue.

Incisive passing is goes unnoticed. Sets him apart from the others.

1107~~~
Just edged out Rooney for MOTM for me, absolutely class and set the table for the performance and win.

1108~~~
Can be delighted with his contribution today. Glad to see he's still got some of his best football in him.

1109~~~
I wish he was ten years younger.

1110~~~
Kept the whole side ticking with his forward passing. Fit and in form he is still one of the best midfielders in the PL.

1111~~~
Brilliant performance. When he's not being over played and has legs next to him he's still first class

1112~~~
I don't think it's a coincidence that we were back to our best today. Having Carrick in our midfield takes us to a different level, in my opinion.

1113~~~
He's very good isn't he?

He needs to be managed carefully over the next few seasons to prolong his career. Players like him don't come around every day.

1114~~~
Great player!

1115~~~
Let's hope he stays fit and on form. He's just so important to us when on form

1116~~~
Performances like that make you think he's underachieved during his career. Amazing stuff.

1117~~~
Jesus when he retires it's almost going to be as bad of a predicament as trying to find another Scholes.

1118~~~
Absolutely spot on. 

He's an exquisite blend of experience, composure, technical skill and physical stature - the last one in particular is ever so crucial in this league and reminiscent of a certain Redondo at times. If Rio Ferdinand was the Rolls Royce of English defenders then Michael is the equivalent version for central midfielders. There's a stark difference in our performance when he's on the field acting as the puppeteer behind our possession play.

That said, as good as Carrick is I just hope we get a suitable young player to gain some experience under him for a couple of seasons as his understudy and take up his mantle after the physical decline inevitably sets in. We prolonged that process for Scholes as he approached his mid 30s and ended up with a massive downgrade after he hung up his boots. It's imperative that we get Carrick's long term successor right.

1119~~~
He definitely inherited Scholes' Sat Nav. Some times his awareness is unreal. It's exactly what Van Gaal wants. Whereas everyone else seems to find De Gea with 2 men pressing them, he just nonchalantly turns a couple of times and chips the ball into the space one of our players is running into.

It's the difference between having to pass it back and forth for a while or catching the opposition out of shape.

I also love the confidence in some of his cross field passes. They seem almost sloppy as they drift pass the foot of two attacking players to the opposite fullback but it's pin point perfection.


Anyway, enough blowing smoke up his arse, I've got a wedding tape to watch.

1120~~~
No coincidence that performance came on the back of him being fresh and not having played much football. Sadly, I don't think he can maintain those sort of levels over the course of a season anymore.

1121~~~

1122~~~
We look much better with him in the starting 11. His experience will be vital during the run in.

1123~~~

1124~~~
Funny, the people who doubt him have disappeared. Carrick has once again proved his class, he's a wonderful player. As a team, we're so much better when he plays.

1125~~~
Well he's not the player he used to be, which is really no surprise given his age. I think what we should now realize is that during his prime, he was regularly putting in displays like this. A gem of a player.

1126~~~
Agree with that. He's still good enough when we put runners alongside him, like Herrera today. They were excellent, they gave nothing away.

1127~~~
We looked more solid and in greater control of proceedings with a three of him, Herrera and Fellaini. Just goes to show how crucial he is to our designs.

1128~~~
We desperately need to find his replacement in the summer or else we're in big, big trouble if his level drops next season.

1129~~~
To be fair he wasn't good just before his injury, I think that we need to find a player in his mould (defensively) ASAP.

1130~~~
He has returned at a crucial time, makes  me more confident of the upcoming tough games.

1131~~~
At the start of the season, Carrick-Herrera is what I had thought would be the natural CM choice. 8 drab months later, wow!!!

1132~~~
When does his contract expire? Has he signed an extention yet? 

Can easily go on to play for a couple of more years if managed carefully and afforded some rest.

My MoM, very talented player who has been extremely underrated while being our 1-man-midfield for a few years.

1133~~~
Most important player in the side. Still cannot understand how people rate Daley Blind as better than him.

1134~~~
Yeh defo !
Could someone put points won with carrick holding against points won with blind holding this season ?
That's no pop at blind by the way as I thought he was excellent today at left back

1135~~~
What is he lacking, compared to what he used to be? He's perhaps a bit rusty after being out with an injury for a while, but I didn't notice anything else. He has never been a player to spend a lot of energy running around the pitch. He has decent to good top speed which sees him chase down players, but he has always been very slow to turn, and thus he has always had to have nippy players around him.

Imo, there is no doubt that he can still be as pivotal to us as he has been the last couple of seasons - not much has changed in his game. Ultimately it will, but not much yet, if he can stay fit, that is. Currently, he is an upgrade on Blind.

1136~~~
This, pretty much.

1137~~~
Perhaps just not as consistent - he had a bit of a rough spell about a month (perhaps due to nagging injuries, themselves perhaps an indicator of advancing years.) I guess what I was mostly stressing is that today's performance was pretty common for him back in the day, and I'm not sure we all properly appreciated him at the time (I know I didn't.)

1138~~~
Class. 

Aside from his passing, we really miss his composure in the middle when he's not there, especially off the ball. He always just sits in the gap and snuffs out danger. All our other midfielders are too eager to push up and chase the ball, leaving massive space in the midfield for the opposition to charge through. 

Only once did he mess up and that was when Mason did him with a little dummy. That was the only time I remember Smalling and Jones being exposed. They won't have had an easier afternoon all season.

1139~~~

1140~~~
Let's hope Strootman fully recovers from injury and gets back to his best. Ideal replacement.

1141~~~
I honestly do see Blind having the potential to be Carrick's replacement given that he has shown promise in playing such a role, but he just needs to be less aggressive and play more to his strengths rather than to his weaknesses.

Anyways, back to Carrick. It's so great to see him put in another vintage performance. His composure in midfield was key in turning Spurs' pressing game against them. His passing, awareness, vision, and quick thinking was there to see for everyone, and it's great to see that, even if he is physically declining, he still has those qualities in his game to keep him going for a few more years. The positions he took in midfield were very good and forced both Eriksen and Kane to drop deeper into the second half just to keep more of the ball.

He still needs some energy around him in midfield for him to play his game, but with Herrera and Fellaini/Rooney (later on when Falcao came in), he has the platform to play at his best, and he definitely did that.

Now only if Blind played more like Carrick does...

1142~~~
dont know if it would be smart to go for him after he had 2 big injuries in one year.

1143~~~
He hates James Wilson <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Loved watching his performance. Also his header really was Scholes-esque.

1144~~~
I hope Carrick gets the recognition he deserves when he hangs up his boots. Yes, his form wavered from '09-'11, but he has been one of our most important signings from the latter third of Fergie's reign, 'til now. His contribution to our success in that period is immeasurable.

1145~~~
Was a majestic performance. Just controlled everything very nicely. He got my vote for MoTM and with him back and playing well I think we will get top four. Still such an underrated player (even I had forgotten how good he can be). He will be tough to replace when he goes.

1146~~~
Some say Willo still has his arm out waiting for a high five.

1147~~~
People do forget he was a one man midfield for about three-four years. If he had a competent midfielder next to him the last few years, I think it would have freed him immensely to perform. A lot of people said he was the master of sideways passing at one point and that he was a "coward" but lets be honest, some of the times if he had ventured forward, his covering for our defence would have suffered.

Do really wish Fergie would have bought a midfielder to compliment him. Might have helped us in Europe.

1148~~~
1 injury which needed additional surgery to correct. If he can get back to his best we should go for him, there's not many players out there that can fit that mould. Give Carrick another year and Strootman a chance to fully recover over a season, then if all good go for him

1149~~~
Next season will be his tenth at the club. United legend?

1150~~~
It is as if time stood still when he has the ball.  The pass to Fellaini was so well weighted.

1151~~~
Yes

1152~~~
How time flies! Next season will be his 10th and he has been one of the most inspired signings by Fergie. Continues to receieve flak from the fans and pundits when we do not perform but he continues to deliever sublime performances. A professional footballer with a no-nonsense style of play. Absolutely love him. What is the deal with his contract? Hope we can have him for at least one more year and like stated before, we need to sign his replacement so that he can do the necessary handover to him before he retires ( my professional lingo just wanted to get out there! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> )

1153~~~
It was madness from Spurs.  They should have started with someone assigned solely to deny him the ball and force our CB's to do something with it instead of giving him an absurd amount of space.  It would have allowed them to press fairly effectively, instead they couldn't get near us due to Carrick always being available.

1154~~~
Yeah, one Scholes' legs started to go, we should have bought another CM to fight with Fletcher for a spot next to Carrick (with Scholes and Giggs figuring in 3 man midfields mainly), but instead we kept thinking Anderson would come good, and Fletcher became ill. 

We just did a draft of players born after 1980 and the number of solid CM's was surprising. Lots of depth there, and we ended up with very little of it. Some 8 with energy like Javi Martinez, Khedira, Marchisio, Asamoah, Matuidi or Cabaye would have done well here next to Carrick the last 4-5 years, in all likelihood, and they each moved during that time save for Marchisio (who was probably available at some point). A star like Modric or Vidal would have been ideal, and they also moved during that period of time.

1155~~~
Absolutely if you ask me.

1156~~~
It was an unusual Carrick performance, setting up a goal with a good pass and scoring himself. But other than his impact on the opposition goal (which usually he doesnt have) he was outshone by Ander. Carrick made less passes, was far less accurate with them and only 1 tackle, 0 interceptions. 

The goal and assist made the performance a good one, if he didnt get them he wouldnt have had a good day

1157~~~
Ah, but he also had 42 calmness on the ball, 97% being in the right place to disrupt Spurs attacks and protect our defence, 94% choosing the correct pass and using the ball effectively and 52 moving the ball quickly and with purpose, and bringing others into play and getting them to also play sharper, quicker passes.

Basically, you can tell a lot with stats, but you don't need them to see that Carrick was great yesterday, and his goal/assist just added to that.

1158~~~
He radiates calm. We've missed him.

1159~~~
I dread the day when he retires.. He's so bloody good.

1160~~~
He never gets any space to operate at Anfield. Hopefully that changes on Sunday, as we'll bloody need him.

1161~~~
He's just so damn classy.

He's a Rolls Royce of a player.

1162~~~
Anyone know what his goal celebration was about? Five two?

1163~~~
Daughters 7 year old birthday I believe.

1164~~~
Yep! Without doubt!

1165~~~
The Quiet Legend.

1166~~~
Yesterday you could see that he's exactly what we needed. He plays the ball forward, brings everyone into play and with our movement we had yesterday, it allows him to bring the best out of him. Long may it continue but we surely need to think about a potential successor

1167~~~
Im imagining Liverpool will sit Lucas or somebody on him next week and this thread will be full of "he should retire", "coward", "what does he do?" rofl

1168~~~
I have respected his ability more this season than any other. He seems to be the only midfielder we have that looks for and can deliver a killer through pass.
He may well be integral in our regaining a top 4 position at the end of the season.

1169~~~
Think its best to play Di Maria in the inside left channel if Carrick is getting closed down. Fellaini playing the position he did yesterday would be a recipe for disaster against a pressing team like Liverpool.

1170~~~

That header.

hard to believe its not scholes <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1172~~~
He's world class if you stand off him. Can't think of many better holding midfielders when that's the case.

1173~~~
Excellent player. Amazing how he has found another level (in a slightly different role) at this age. A little like Giggs in 2009, though not quite as old. We are half the team when he isn't on the pitch. He and Herrera are brilliant together.

1174~~~
Imperative that we keep him fit for the run in. He really is the key to us playing good football. There is no replacement for him in the team. Daley Blind is industrious but his range of passing doesn't even come close to Carrick's.

I honestly dread how we are going to attempt to replace him in our midfield. A successor will need to be identified this summer. Somehow I doubt we will find a like for like replacement.

1175~~~
In fairness Spurs have been one of the best pressing teams in the league this year, even if they didnt manage to get their game going yesterday.

1176~~~
I don't know if it was Ericksen's job to press Carrick and he just gave up but no one was within a 10 yard radius of Carrick until the score was 3-0, the first goal was a clear indication for things to come when Carrick of all people got released by Blind to further release Fellaini, those are the 3 slowest players on the pitch. Rodgers is a far more competent manager to let that happen.

1177~~~
That made me smile!
What do you mean? I think he's actually very good under pressure, even yesterday and on Monday I seem to recall he got out of some tricky positions with his immaculate technique.

Bentley of a player. The car, not the crock.

1178~~~
He can get out of situations with technique, occasionally pulls off a brilliant roulette too but I've said multiple times that he becomes a bit of a coward against high pressing teams, particularly in his passing. Sometimes it just feels like he's hiding, shying from the ball instead of constantly wanting it in those games. And his passing is far less progressive. 

When teams let us play though he is absolutely fantastic. Which is a lot of the time thankfully.

1179~~~
I still think he slows down play too much at times but he was undoubtedly superb yesterday, and my MOTM. Guaranteed starter alongside Herrera at Anfield hopefully.

1180~~~
When the opposition makes him the focal point of their defensive organization, there's no way for him to play other than as a decoy. It just depends on someone else taking the baton and stepping between the defenders to collect and distribute the ball.

1181~~~
It's a fair point. That was always the reprieve for him really that he was the only one. Having 2 of Mata, Herrera and Blind in the side should help that a lot in the future as all are willing to collect and move it on if needed.

1182~~~
I gotta say that the points of teams pressing him and shutting him down miss a key point... he is one of eleven.

When we play people like Mata, Herrera, Blind, Rooney, and Carrick it creates acres of space because you have all of them moving off the ball creating space and angles.  Carrick has far too long been the only true quality midfielder in the team.  Put some quality around him and he shines.

1183~~~
That's another reason to have Blind as LB. He's capable of stepping up as deep playmaker when Carrick was pressed tight.

1184~~~
They did an alright job of it in our third. De Gea had to boot it many times. They just weren't winning aerial balls or the 2nd balls, their pressure was all in vain. Whenever United got past that line of pressing it was smooth sailing.

1185~~~
This!

1186~~~
Very well managed to get him on the pitch at absolute 100% fitness. Carricks last 2-3 games before getting injured were just a shadow of himself. Great to see him firing on all cylinders, he really gives this team a whole new dimension.

1187~~~
Our attackers all play better with him on the field. 

For one, he unleashes them quicker than any one else and spreads the play with far more purpose than Rooney ever did. 

Secondly, the defense feels more solid with him and that gives a foundation of confidence. It also allows our attackers to carry the ball out and Carrick sits in which pull their midfield out of shape.

1188~~~
Think you are spot on Rob

1189~~~
The most underrated player in the Premier League of the last 10 years IMO. What an asset he's been and still is to the club.

1190~~~
He's been excellent. Helps the whole team with his eye for incisive forward passes and showed up with a fine header too. Absolutely class.

1191~~~
Carrick vs Tottenham. Class act.

1192~~~
New 1 year contract!

1193~~~
Brilliant news!

1194~~~
Good news. Hopefully he stay fit and doesn't decline too quickly with increasing age, he's an important player for us.

1195~~~
Great news, he's definitely got at least 1 more year in his legs, maybe even 2 the way he plays.

1196~~~
Great news! Masterclass performance vs. Spurs. It's so important for our top 4 push that he stays healthy.

1197~~~
Great news and well deserved too!

1198~~~
Yes we look a much better team with him in it as the win percentage clearly shows .

1199~~~
He's got a great shot on him. He should shoot more!

(Dreaming of the Roma game and the shot vs. Liverpool)

1200~~~
A fit and healthy Carrick just takes us to another level. The way he shields our defence and controls the tempo is amazing.

Its clearly filtered down to Smalling and Jones too as they both look so much more composed with Carrick leading them.

1201~~~
He damn near cost United a goal by not tracking the only player in his zone.

1202~~~
Needs to settle down and run the show.

1203~~~
Then gives the ball away for the goal. Been atrocious.

1204~~~
Atrocious?! Bar one or two moments he was grand... especially in that first half.

1205~~~
He just admitted his mistake and praised the little magician for scoring those goals.

1206~~~
I thought he was chief culprit for relaxing too much after we went 2-0 up, emphasised by him losing the ball for their goal.

1207~~~
It's one of those games where I am sure the stats will show more of what Carrick did, things were moving so quickly and Herrera and Fellaini were so in charge in midfield that I didn't notice him much.

1208~~~
Was disappointed with him today. He was great in the first 30 minutes but I thought he was sloppy after that, became complacent and gave a goal away. Fellaini was more composed on the ball. The weak link in a very strong midfield today.

1209~~~
Had a good first half but became a bit complacent and sloppy after halftime. All ended well but could have been different. Still, I appreciate how much calmness he brings to the squad, not only in his play but also extended towards to the defenders and such.

1210~~~
First half was as good as any this season. Far too passive in the second but seems to have acknowledged that.

1211~~~
General play under par, doesn't do much defensively these days and not getting on the ball and making as many passes as he used to.

1212~~~
Agree with others here that I expected much more influence in the 2nd half and it was a stupid mistake to give the ball away for their goal.

1213~~~
Wasn't very good. Anyone see him in the post match interview? He sounded like he was sick or something, which wouldn't surprise me. Didn't look at his sharpest.

1214~~~
The position he plays at is the most occupied in terms of pressing when up against Liverpool, i don't think he was bad and his calmness is much needed in such games.

1215~~~
Didn't have a great game today. Almost put Smalling in a shitter as well in the first half with a bad pass and Sturridge on him. He did well to get out of it.

1216~~~
I just wish he wouldnt wait that long to release the ball. For the 2nd goal he made a very good forward pass to Herrera, which ended up later in the Mata wonder goal. But for the Liverpool goal, he just got pressed and dithered around, which cost us and not just this time, but every now and again. 

Overall, i thought he was decent, bar 2-3 moments, where he just didnt pay enough attention what was happening around him.

1217~~~
First half he had as much to do with how ineffective Liverpool were as anyone else - he positioned himself in ways to make it impossible for Lallana and Coutinho into the game. Because it wasn't blood and thunder, it went unnoticed. Made the mistake for their goal but, the so called dithering, last week he was doing the same and got out of tight situations. Whole team dropped off in the second half, Carrick could have maybe demanded the ball more but, we were very sloppy and were not getting him involved.

He wasn't great but, he did a decent enough job today to blunt what is a pretty good attacking unit to nothing.

1218~~~
Another good game, for the most part. Faded a bit in the second half, and of course the dallying that gave Liverpool their equaliser was atrocious, but again he looked adventurous in his passing, was calm and relieved pressure with providing passing options and switching play around, and just generally was being Carrick. So important to us.

Had a pass in the first half to Rooney who was off-side, where he was facing completely the wrong way, and smashed the ball to bend it in around the defence for Rooney to run onto. The most stunning passing range in the EPL on his day.

Surprised with the amount of negativity he's earned on here after this match.

1219~~~
I think people are disappointed because they expected him to control the game more after the red card and show more leadership, especially with Rooney having an off day

1220~~~
Good piece from Michael Cox praising his first half performance:

1221~~~
Not a great game for him but very interesting article in the Guardian.  He seems to be pretty important for our team...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/23/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/23/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend</a>


<span style="font-size: 18px"><b>1) Carrick revels in mastery of the understated</b></span>
Even as low key, understated midfield janitorial performances go, it was a low key understated showing from Michael Carrick at Anfield. Carrick rarely broke into a run, made no tackles, blocked no shots, completed a routinely excellent 86% of his passes and was robbed by a hard-pressing Liverpool midfield in the buildup to Daniel Sturridge’s goal. And yet Carrick was still a crucial part of United’s win against a quicker, younger fluid<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Liverpool</a>team that played with great spirt but found itself picked off by opponents who won the big points and who had, in Carrick, still the most effective deep-lying English playmaker of his generation and a slow-burn craftsman who simply makes his teams work.
It is unsurprising given his own love of the conductor-midfielder type that Carrick has been a feature of Louis van Gaal’s more settled teams of late. He has been a low-fi favourite of each of all three of his United managers and a finely-grooved component of all the best teams of his time at the club. Plus, Carrick is of course a distinctly Van Gaal-ish kind of player: an expert, unhurried manipulator of the ball, whose brain has always ticked over at a higher rate of revs than his legs. United have now lost seven times this season, only one of those when Carrick has started. With him in the team they average 2.3 points per game; without him that falls to 1.6. His role is simple: pass and move (slowly) take the ball in tight areas and keep it moving, and cover diligently in defence. The only real issue with Carrick is whether he can keep moving (just) long enough to play through that one-year<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/20/michael-carrick-manchester-united-contract-extension" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">contract extension</a>and help the process trainer bed in his rhythms and methods. Sixteen years, 13 major honours and 31 England caps (fewer than Shaun Wright-Phillips) on from his debut for West Ham, Carrick remains a significant low-fi force.<b>Barney Ronay</b>

1222~~~
Does anyone really think it's a coincidence that Carrick coming back into the side before our last cluster of games against "top four" opponents was the first time we looked like a quality team under Van Gaal and we're looking good all over again since he got back into the starting XI this time round?

Lost track of the amount of times he nipped in ahead of Liverpool players trying to get a break going and snuffed out their attack at source. Such an important player, defensively.

1223~~~
Speaking of stuff that isn't a coincidence, that's a good stat from Barney Ronay.
Wouldn't be surprised at all, if those games including Carrick were against harder opposition than those without him. Pretty sure he's played the majority of our toughest games this season.

1224~~~
I wonder if anyone will ever appreciate just how good he is and was.

1225~~~
Certainly not. You could see how highly LVG rated Carrick the second he stepped into the club as our manager. Remember him talking him up big time during pre-season when he was out injured. It'll be interesting who Van Gaal now sees as his replacement, be it at the club, or a potential target. I reckon we'll get two or three more seasons out of him yet though.

1226~~~
I hope so. Although the recurrent injuries this season are a bit of a red flag.

Strootman seems like a similar player, though. So you can see why Van Gaal is interested.

1227~~~

1228~~~

1229~~~
Well said TalkSport... best just ignore the fact that one of those people was Stan Collymore before the game on your very own Radio Station...

1230~~~
We'd be challenging for the title this season if he stayed fit all year IMO. His influence on the team is huge. Knew he missed a lot but had no idea that he missed half of our season so far. Crazy really.

1231~~~
The influence he has on the defenders is there to be seen. I think most recently we've benefited from playing with one out and out forward and a 'proper' 4-3-3, but take nothing away from Carrick, he's obviously had an impact too.

Some of his passing is ridiculous. The one to Young yesterday was so standard for him, yet no one else on the pitch could hit that first time into a runner's stride.

1232~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1233~~~
Wow if only he was available for our 1st 6 games

1234~~~
He'll be key for us, he's just been fit but already so good. With him, we stand a chance vs Chelsea/City/Arsenal. Defensively so smart, needs to cut out brainfarts like that.

1235~~~
To add a bit more to the stats above - we have yet to lose an away game in which Carrick has started this season, and we have only won one away game when he has not started (that being the win against Newcastle).

He really is vital. It's hard to put my finger on what he does better than Blind, but he just seems to bring an added calmness and composure to the side. I'd hazard a guess it's to do with his leadership - van Gaal labelled him along the lines of a 'coach on the pitch' and he does seem to give more direction to our inexperienced back line, which is even more crucial when playing away from home.

1236~~~
I'm loving how highly Van Gaal seems to think of him. Think it's a big compliment to Carrick that Van Gaal sees him more as a 'trainer/coach'. Van Gaal doesn't strike me as the type to give out compliments willy nilly, so Carrick in his quiet way seems to have good leadership qualities. He's just not demonstrative. Keeps his head down and gets on with it.

He will have brain farts now and then, he's getting older - athletes in all sports tend to lose a bit of concentration as they get older. It unfortunately comes with the territory… sigh

1237~~~
He played his part rather well on Sunday. He protected the space in front of the defense and he was always there to assist the CBs deal with Sturridge, Liverpool couldn't find any space down the central channels. He also dropped deeper in the CB position whenever Jones was forced out of position to cover Blind and in the few occasions Smalling or Jones rushed into the midfield either to close down the first attackers and slow the down the attacking plays (something i'd like to see more often cause i think it could help us) or to get the ball out of the defense.

I believe he will be crucial next season, if he manages to stay healthy. It seems that we'll be playing with a three men midfield and that he will have the chance to play the holding midfielder role in the way it suits him best. If Herrera and Fellaini keep improving their defensive game and allow him to focus on protecting the CBs, we'll be absolutely rock solid at the back. 

I believe he's still excellent at controlling the tempo and reading the opponent's game. And i simply love the way he spots a good run into space from a teammate and then calmly finds him with an accurate long ball. There was one towards Young on Sunday which was absolute class. Everyone does mistakes now and then but thankfully Carrick's mistake didn't cost us. And his mistakes are rare which is very important for his role on the pitch if you consider the pace and the intensity of the modern game. LvG trusts him and thinks he's vital and i can understand why.

1238~~~
As much as I like Blind, he's nowhere near Carrick. Everyone early on in the season went on about Blind now being better than Carrick.

Carrick, I wouldn't swap him for any midfielder in the league. Amazing player, and has been since he signed. The only constant in midfield in the most successful United period.

1239~~~
Scholes.

1240~~~
Scholes was not first choice some of those years.

1241~~~
One year Giggs shared time in midfield with him, fair enough.

1242~~~
Once again, Carrick was key in keeping our team composed throughout the match, though with the whole team dropping off, it just had to be him making the mistake for Liverpool's goal. However, he didn't drop his head, and he continued to play his game, making it tough for Liverpool to pass the ball through and forcing them to mostly try and play long balls to Sturridge or Balotelli. His positioning and discipline in midfield has been immaculate, and even if his energy levels are declining, his intelligence is more than making up for that.

I still think he shouldn't be played too regularly so that we can move on from Carrick, eventually, but he's too reliable to be dropped from the first 11. Maybe if Blind would play with less aggression, we can see Carrick start to get phased out, but I'd rather see Carrick play there more often than Blind at the moment.

1243~~~
He was definitely a piano on Sunday. 

I enjoyed this <a class="externalLink" href="http://t.co/XQRHESOswF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://t.co/XQRHESOswF</a> - nice to know what Carrick thought of that Neville quote. Henry Winter asks good questions which help make a more interesting interview/article.

1244~~~
<span style="font-size: 18px"><b>Paul Scholes: It's amazing Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has so few caps for England</b></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px">I expect Michael Carrick to play for England against Lithuania tonight. He is back in favour for his club and it will probably follow that he plays for his country too. He should have played more for England than the 31 caps he has so far. It is incredible to think that he has one fewer than Danny Welbeck on 32.

As I have said before in this column, no one appreciated Michael more than the midfielders who played alongside him at United. He is not a flash footballer. He doesn’t hit Hollywood passes. He doesn’t score lots of goals. But I loved playing alongside him. He was always in the right place. He gave me licence to play.

At 33, Michael is still easily capable of doing that for the other players in this current England team. He gives any attacking midfielder alongside him lots of the ball and also the licence to go forward without worrying about leaving their defence exposed. He would have been  the perfect England midfield partner for Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard, but most of the time it was those two who played together.

I don’t think he has ever been given a proper run in the England team. As soon as the team has had a bad result, it is Michael who has paid the price. He made his debut in 2001 but he has played just one tournament game, against Ecuador in the 2006 World Cup finals. He should have played more at international level, and had he been Spanish or German he probably would have done.

It is not for nothing that Michael has been the linchpin for United for so long. He has just never had the faith of the England managers he has played under.

</span>

1245~~~
Back in favour for his club? What's Paul wittering on about now?

1246~~~
Scholes himself was hardly appreciated by England. Had Gerrard and Lampard not retired, Carrick would still be out in the cold.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2015%2f3%2fCarrick-Top-Image.jpg" src="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2015%2f3%2fCarrick-Top-Image.jpg"/>



Two strangely similar stats clashed at Anfield on Sunday. Since Liverpool had switched to a 3-4-2-1 formation against United at Old Trafford in December, they had picked up 2.36 points per game as opposed to 1.6 in matches before that. And, before kick-off, in league games in which <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Players/2115/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Carrick</a> had played an hour or more this season, Manchester United had picked up 2.31 points per game as opposed to 1.63 points when he had not. As it was, it was the Carrick factor that won out, even though he himself didn’t have his best game.

So why is Carrick so important to United, so obviously so that, having been left out of the 2014 World Cup squad, he is back in Roy Hodgson’s England squad? There are probably a range of factors at play, not least his experience: in a defence that, partly for tactical reasons and partly because of injury and suspension, has rarely been settled this season, the presence of the 33-year old brings a sense of composure and authority.



<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Players/2115/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2015%2f3%2fCarrick-Characters.png" src="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2015%2f3%2fCarrick-Characters.png"/></a>



But he also seems a particularly good fit for Louis van Gaal, who has described him as being “a coach on the pitch”, a player who organizes and cajoles. Van Gaal has always liked a deep-lying playmaker in his sides, whether a centre-back who steps out from a back four as Frank Rijkaard did at Ajax or a player who sits just in front of the defensive line as, say, Stijn Schaars did at AZ Alkmaar. With the possible exception of Daley Blind, who is still adjusting to English football, Carrick is the only player in the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/32/Show/-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">United</a> squad with both the positional awareness and the range of passing to take that role.

Of the players at United who can operate as a central defender, or as a very deep-lying midfielder, Carrick, at 89%, has the best pass completion rate – although it’s intriguing that Chris Smalling, a player who seems to have blossomed under Van Gaal since his sending off in the Manchester derby, should be second at 88.5%.


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2015%2f3%2fCarrick1.jpg" src="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2015%2f3%2fCarrick1.jpg"/>



But it’s more than that. A lot of players that pick up the ball so deep end up with good pass completion rates because they never look to do more than shuffling the ball 10 yards on to another defender or a midfielder who then attempts something more difficult. Carrick, though, averages 5.7 long balls per game, more than any other United outfielder (of 114 long passes he’s attempted this season, 91 have found their target). Often those are exquisitely weighted passes into the path of an on-rushing team-mate; against Tottenham, for instance, he played one floated pass into the box for Juan Mata to run onto, creating a shooting opportunity. It was a ball that required an extraordinarily precise trajectory so that it dropped almost onto a moving player’s foot. Carrick is registering good pass completion rates despite playing difficult passes.

Slightly surprisingly, Carrick doesn’t score that well in terms of ball-winning. He only averages 1.4 tackles per game, the 12th highest figure at United this season (although it is more than Smalling) and 1.4 interceptions per game, also the 12th highest figure. The 0.8 aerial duels he wins per game, meanwhile, leaves him only 17th. That, perhaps, suggests why he is better deployed as a central midfielder or as one of three central defenders than in a defensive pair. And there is also something to be said for his positional sense; just by taking up the right position, Carrick can stymy attacks, forcing opponents to change their angle of approach or to attempt riskier passes.

It’s little wonder that Van Gaal was so keen to get Carrick to sign the contract extension he agreed last week. He’s a player who seems always to have had to fight for recognition in England – and it is true that he was badly spooked when United lost to Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League final. But it’s also true that when Carrick has played an hour or more in the league this season, United have lost only once. At the moment, he feels a vital part of the Van Gaal project and if his form continues, he may yet become central to England’s plans for Euro 2016.

From whoscored.com

1248~~~
We have these 2 year cycles where Carrick suddenly becomes very much in vogue as far as England are concerned. He will get praise from all quarters. After the cycle ends he starts getting criticized again.

1249~~~
I don't actually think England deserve him after how much he has been overlooked.

1250~~~
Coach on the pitch? Maybe he should be the one who takes over as manager after Van Gaal has gone. I bet Giggs would love that.

1251~~~
Should have happend a long time ago especially given England's lack of quality central midfielders in recent years. Nothing surprising about him being ignored though. Scholes should have been the heart of the midifeld given his talent but was sidelined for attacking midfielders pretending to be central midfielders

1252~~~
Fact is had he been given a long run in his position instead of other players not playing their natural roles, England may well have been able to stand up and play football.

We all know Gerrard and Lampard were better individually, but where was the glue that held it together when shit hit the fan? When Owen Hargreaves played in a holding role, there was a lot of excitement surrounding England. Also at that time Carrick probably put in the best midfield display an England player has managed in years (though opposition was terrible).

The need for two forwards (whether it was Rooney and Heskey???? Or Rooney and Carroll????? Or Rooney and Wele) has always led to midfield being severely lacking in a legit holding player. Gerrard and Lampard were too gung ho to go toe-to-toe with the best, and it showed. They needed a player behind them pulling the strings.

Carrick was that guy.

1253~~~
Is a disgrace he doesn't have more England caps to be brutally honest.

1254~~~
When I first saw that, I thought he was referring to time we beat Spurs 5-2, when Carrick won us a penalty <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1255~~~
lol, lampard/gerrard failed for over 10 years yet in the same time period Scholes and Carrick were both available yet hardly used in the right way by England.

Guess the England managers know more than Fergie eh? :P

1256~~~
How'd he do for England? I missed the game unfortunately.

1257~~~
Had nothing to do really as England were on the attack for most of the game.

1258~~~
It was the media picking the team. Lampard and Gerrard always had such hype around them, friends in the media championing their cause to a point they were both undroppable. The grief the manager would get by dropping one wasn't worth the benefits in their eyes IMO. 

Meanwhile, Scholes and Carrick lead United to 3 UCL finals and a semi final in four years as well as 4 league title in 5 years. 

For me it would be like Spain ignoring Xavi and Iniesta because Silva and Fabregas are media darlings who score and assist much more.

1259~~~
Not too happy about Carrick starting for England now, especially at his age, its a worry for injuries, especially as hes the cog in our team, that makes us click and play far better than when hes absent

1260~~~
He is finally getting recognition from the other fans, i don't see why a 33 year old Carrick is still playing for England though.

1261~~~
Carrick, at the moment, is the best deep-lying playmaker in the world.

Come at me.

1262~~~
Why not? Pirlo was still playing at a similar age for Italy.

1263~~~
Amen sista.

1264~~~
He doesn't do as much work for Italy as Carrick does for England, there are a lot of technical players on the Italian National team.

1265~~~
Me neither. He has become more injury prone since the start of the 2013-14 season. Before that I don't remember him being ever out long due to injury spells. He can give us another 2-3 quality seasons if used properly. England and Roy's new found love for him is worrying from the perspective of a United fan. Though I think Carrick is desperate to represent England in one of the major tournaments as a starter.

1266~~~
From what I saw, Delph did his running. Definitely not a particularly taxing match.

It's just the fact he'll play against Italy too which bugs me. Should've been 45-60 today and the full 90 against Italy.

But at the same time he's hardly played this season...not far off about 15 games for us right?

1267~~~
Problem is, he's at the age now where he should be retiring from International football, in order to prolong his career, not restart it!

1268~~~
I'd imagine that Van Gaal advocates the way he has been played.

90 against Lithuania 5 days after Liverpool followed by 45/60 4 days later so he's fresh for Villa 4 days after that. 

That sort of game time is perfect for his match fitness and rythum right now.

1269~~~

1270~~~
These sorts of articles piss me off. I, along with others, have been saying this for the last 8 years yet no journalists were prepared to campaign for him because of the media clout Lampard and Gerrard carried.

If any journalist had the balls to write an article stating that either Gerrard or Lampard should be dropped in favour of Carrick they'd have been heckled by the likes of Hansen, Lawrenson, Lineker, Shearer, Redknapp as well as numerous other "journalists" and none had the balls or intelligence to do that. 

Yet Carrick is the one central to a team that won 5 Premier Leagues in his time here and reached 3 UCL finals in 4 years. It was no coincidence. As I said in this (or another) thread just this week, ignoring the Carrick and Scholes partnership from 06-12 is the equivalent of Spain choosing to go with Fabregas and Silva over Xavi and Iniesta.

1271~~~
Couldn't agree more. Sticking with the Lampard/Gerrard association for so long cost England quite dearly. Not that I care that much (though I support England), but it's just a shame for Carrick and Scholes.

1272~~~
Well said!!!!!!!

But

1273~~~
Agree. I don't understand why he doesn't just tell them where to go. He's 33 now, why he's suddenly going to become a massive part of the team. Drop out the squad and extend his club playing career where he's appreciated.

1274~~~
The strange part is that your managers never really seemed to consider playing all three of them in a 4-3-3 in the center. Didn't even Barry get games ahead of him?

1275~~~
Rodwell and Scott Parker had games ahead of him.

1276~~~
Who can forget Parker eh?

FA player of the year! Let that sink in<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1277~~~
This. He should tell England to feck off.

1278~~~
Totally forgot about that. Totally foking mental.

1279~~~
A lot of English United supporters must have cried watching them start ahead of Carrick.. Hope he retires from international football though,not like England team is strong enough to win anything in the recent future.. Needs to get through the match versus Italy without any injury..

1280~~~
England and all these journo's can feck off. Now all joining the Carrick wandbagon, just about 8 years too late. Wankers.

1281~~~
Carrick Holding, Gerrard Box to Box and Lampard as the furthest forward of the three made so much sense yet was never ever tried by any English manager as far as I know.

1282~~~
When England fail at the Euros, it'll be because Carrick is not Gerrard or Lampard... <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Didn't Hodgeson suggest before the last game that Carrick is just filling in till Wilshire gets back. Something along lines of, he thinks Carrick can come in and "do a job" at DM in Wilshire's absence

1283~~~
That was my understanding as well. Im sure I read something to that effect just in the last few days. Carrick still isnt first choice for England. Actually I can see point of this more now than I could in the past if they were able to keep Wilshere fit - which is a massive if. But I do like the idea of consistently picking a young England team that can stay together for the next few tournaments.

1284~~~
Watching that World Cup with Barry and Upson in the side (2010) getting ripped to pieces by Germany made me cry.

Edit: James fecking Milner too

1285~~~
To be honest, it is better for us if Carrick is not first choice. He's not young anymore and he can play a big role in us winning silverware. Roy Hodgson is just the latest in a number of criminally incompetent England managers.

1286~~~
Ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

England don't deserve Carrick, just like they didn't deserve Scholes.

1287~~~
The best bit about that whole debacle was the German team man marking every England player except Upson, who then didn't know what to do when in possession and resorted to long balls up to Defoe <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1288~~~
Yep, he said he thinks Carrick can do a similar job to Wilshere... Which is completely idiotic in so many ways. He actually thinks that they are similar players first of all, and he thinks Wilshere is a better player then him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fecking madness really.

1289~~~
Changed the course of the game for England tonight.

1290~~~
He is the best English midfielder about currently. It is a weak field but the fact remains.

1291~~~
Hes had one world cup game. England won that game. 

I think Adrian Durham of talksport is one of the few who have said he should be playing more for quite a long time, but considering his WUM status, nobody took him seriously. Rest of the media preferred Lampard/Gerrard because...

1292~~~
The game completely changed once he was on the pitch. And England were even better once Henderson and Delph went off.

A clear gulf in intelligence between him and the other central midfielders on show tonight.

1293~~~
Been one of the best midfielders in the league every year since he's joined United really, bar the one bad year last season (and a bit after the loss against Barca where he was out of sorts for a couple of months).

1294~~~
When Gerrard, Scholes and Lampard were in their pomp is was easy to make the argument that he wasn't the best though.

1295~~~
Well yeah but even when they were at their best, he really should have been a starter for England, to sit at the base of the midfield and then play Scholes and one of Gerrard/Lampard in front of them. He's the type of player England has always needed there but constantly ignored. Might not be individually as good as Gerrard or Lampard at their best but he should have played all the same IMO.

1296~~~
Totally agree. It was the case of sacrificing a superstar for the good of the team. No England manager of that era could bring themselves to do it unfortunately. In that era both Gerrard and Lampard were voted into the top 3 of the Ballon D'Or, it was difficult.

1297~~~
While Scholes and Carrick were building the platform for one of United's most successful period's ever, winning PL's and the CL, one had already retired from the NT because of the constant misuses, and the other couldn't get a look in. All to accommodate media darlings Lampard and Gerrard, who proved game after game couldn't play together. 

Its an utter joke. If both had been Italian/Spanish/French etc etc they'd have had the team built around them for years. All this talk about Carrick 'doing a job' or whatever while Wilshire is out, is an insult too. That little shite has nothing on Carrick.

1298~~~
It's even more sad when you realize Spain dominated world football with a Busquets/Xabi Alonso axis, while some of the most talented attacking midfielders in the world out were left out of their starting 11.

1299~~~
How the likes of Barry and Parker used to get games ahead of him. Mental.

1300~~~
I'm actually sad that England has a sudden "Come to Jesus" moment and starting to selecting him when United would prefer he'd rest when not playing for the club.

1301~~~
Everyone keeps pointing out that he's underrated, so surely it's reached a point that he's no longer underrated..

1302~~~
Rooney having to point out it was Carrick who was the game changer when asked about the impact of Townsend and Barkeley in the itv post match interview... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1303~~~
It's quite sad how his international career has gone. He could have been a huge part of a good England team if he had been picked.

1304~~~
This, maddens me how Scholes was basically marginalised by two inferior players due to him being shy as a player #irony that he's a bobby bastard since becoming involved in the media

1305~~~
Agreed. 

Completely ignored Carrick until now - and his introduction today showed how important he now is. There's no replacement for his role available for us at this moment. If Woy thinks Wilshere can play that game then he's in for a shock.

1306~~~
The ship has sailed for Carrick to be honest. If England wanted him to have an Pirlo-esque impact to the national team, the team has to be tailored to him. That means retooling the midfield to get the best out of Carrick. Italy did that by having De Rossi for his physicality, and more than willing runners in Marchisio and Veratta. And those three have decent techniques and passing ability. That's not gonna happened for two reason, Hodgson would never have the balls to do it, and England also doesn't have anybody close to De Rossi, Marchisio and Veratta. 

Carrick best chance was during 2008. He was at the peak of his game. I never understand why England never play Carrick-Scholes and Gerrard in midfield. Scholes and Carrick calming influence and discipline would balance out with Gerrard's weakness and bring out the best in those three

1307~~~
I've always found it funny that Scholes and Carrick, who were starting midfielders in Prem and CL winning teams back in 08, get ignored for Gerrard and Lampard in the 06 and 2010 World Cups. I know Scholes had retired by then, and I rate Lampard in a proper setup but it was just a funny quirk, in hindsight. All the better for us, to be honest. 

I actually thought Capello would've rated Carrick as a deep lying playmaker, similar to how Van Gaal rates him now. But Capello's a successful manager and I'm not, so what do I know eh?

1308~~~
Didn't Carrick pull out of an England game and capello then refused  to select him?

1309~~~
Unfortunately for England, the mentality of Woy and others is that the player needs to be in the mold of players like Wilshere - with all kinds of angst and outward emotion to be a proper England player. Perhaps true in some sense that players like that in the PL make a difference but, on the international and European stage, players like Carrick are exactly what England and clubs need to succeed at the highest levels.

Good job by Rooney to make sure Carras got the right plaudits even if the media were inclined to go with the likes of Barkley and the "hero" Townsend.

1310~~~
I don't know what people expect Hodgson to do in fairness. Carricks  England career isn't going to last past Euro '16 I doubt and we have no other holding midfielders on the horizon. I'm sure he's aware that Carrick is better than Wilshere, but Jack is our only hope of having anyone slightly good playing there for the National Team in the foreseeable future.

1311~~~
What kind of moron starts Jones in midfield when you have Carrick on the bench?

1312~~~
A pragmatic sensible moron that realises Carrick is 34 and played 90 minutes the other night and probably had a loose arrangement with clubs about running players into the ground on international duty?

1313~~~
Hmm. Didn't know he played against Lithuania. But I'd have thought playing Carrick against Italy would make more sense than him jogging around against the might of Lithuania.

1314~~~
Meh, the less time he played for his country probably increased the time he played for us. Was never burnt out with International football. Also doesn't have an ego so it would never effect him.

1315~~~
I for one am thankful he hasnt had the distraction of international football but its insulting a player whos been a mainstay in our teams and played a vital part in one of our best ever sides hasnt made any impact on the national side. Will be this eras Le Tissier in regards to England calls ups...

Also how did Barry play more times for the country than him?! Shocking in its own right

1316~~~
Would you play a full back at centreback because all your other centrebacks are too old? No, because of the knock on effect it will have on the rest of team (OK, thats a more extreme example).

Ultimately Wilshire is not going to cut it at DM against top opposition and by playing him out of position, you are stunting his progress. He's not going to become an adequate DM in the few occasions he meets up with the England team.

IMO, its would be better to play Carrick there for the foreseeable and allow him to build a platform for the rest to play before he is too old. You'd hope by then that there is enough cohesion in the midfield for someone to come in and settle at DM.

and I'd rather Carrick retired from England.

1317~~~
You're not stunting anyone's progress. The National side play a handful of games a season, that's not going to affect the way he develops with Arsenal who he trains with 4 times a week and can play up to 50 matches a season with (hypothetically of course in Wilshere's case). If anything, spells at DM may aid his development as it limits the amount he can drive from deep, meaning he has to be more opportunistic and make better decisions. 

Like it or not, we've got no players who can play deep and our best option is Wilshere long term currently. He's good under pressure, can carry the ball when needed and has an excellent passing range. Many Arsenal fans actually argue that might even be a better role for him in midfield. It's not as if he's asking Hart to play striker.

1318~~~
You're forgetting this is England. You could have Paul 'F*cking' Scholes in there and the manager would still play two attacking midfielders in central midfield. 

Oh wait, that actually happened! 

Get ready for 10 years of Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana in central midfield.

1319~~~
Capello is the worst thing to happen to England in recent times. He was worse than Sven and that is saying something. He didnt select Richards as well when he was doing well for City.

1320~~~
Capello played Heskey upfront with Rooney at a world cup. Enough said.

1321~~~
Capello was pretty much hoping that scholes would play that was his entire plan in 2010.

1322~~~
I can't help but feel it's a pointless experiment. A year/18 months from now, I can see everyone and Lee Dixon saying "I don't know why Wilshire's playing DM. He's a CM, he's never been a DM..."

I can't see him ever being useful as a DM against top opposition so what is the point. Aside from a negligible benefit of him experiencing a new position. Lampard has also played DM for England and I don't remember it doing much for his game.

It's this kind of thinking that has kept Carrick out the side for the last 8 years, whilst we tried to fit a system around all the popular players. But in this case swap popular for young. It's square pegs in round holes.

I get the future planning side of the argument, but putting Carrick at the heart of it would provide some stability for the youngsters around him to grow into the England fold. The England team might be in a better position in a couple of years time to address DM.

But right now Carrick is the only one who can truly play that position and bring the best out of those around him.

1323~~~
if only we had someone to play the Michael Carrick role at the world cup, instead of insisting Gerrard could

1324~~~
Michael is vital for us and England, got to keep him fit then it will be onwards and upwards. Replacing him with the right player will also be vital.

1325~~~
Reading all these journo's suddenly jumping on the wagon, writing articles about how its such a crime that Carrick never got a look in for England etc etc makes me sick. I don't remember these same people crying out for Carrick at any point over the past 8 years. Don't pretend you always thought Carrick was the answer just because its now 'fashionable' to rate him. Tossers.

1326~~~
To be fair Adrian Durham on Talksport has always banged the Carrick drum and now his opinion has been justified.

1327~~~
It's not to fit the popular players in, I'd much rather be playing Wilshere ahead of Carrick and not having to deal with Delph in midfield. The difference is that we don't have anyone else, nothing to do with popularity.

We go to France a year on, another year on the clock for an ageing Carrick who's become quite susceptible to injuries recently, do we really think he can play every single game in a major tournament? Against the best sides I'm in complete agreement, Wilshere isn't good enough, but who else is? There's literally no one else that could do a better job in the absence of Carrick.

We're going to have to have a contingency plan, and Wilshere is not only the next best we have, but subsequently our only real option for when Carrick retires from international football, where there's no guarantee we'll have produced the next Michael Carrick by that stage. Taking that into consideration, it's much more beneficial for us to play Wilshere in a slightly unfamiliar position and create a plan B for the time being than be left utterly confused of what to do if Carrick isn't available.

1328~~~
He brought Heskey to south Africa and started him. All you need to know really.

1329~~~
Didn't Heskey injure Rio out there and we lost him for the tournament as well?

1330~~~
I think so. What a terrible tournament besides Germany and Forlan.

1331~~~
Delph is no better than Noble, Cleverly, Cattermole. Henderson is a little bit better as he can play a bit but none of them compare to Carrick. England better hope they find a gem of a player before he retires, otherwise they'll have to rely on the latter. Its all down to Southampton now lol.

1332~~~
What I hate about this whole scenario, is that the media is now forcing the hand of the England manager to pick Carrick. If these managers couldn't see the value of Carrick then they will just pick the next "hyped up" player.

Carrick deserves the plaudits as most United fans would agree, but our media is so fickle that next month it will be someone else again.

1333~~~
I honestly think Carrick won't end up getting picked for the Euro's... it seems like the England/Carrick thing to happen.

1334~~~
Its been said millions of times now but in Italy Carrick would be regarded as one of the best midfielders to ever grace Seria A.

1335~~~
Or in Spain. He'd of been viewed as up there with Alonso, Busquets etc as a top top #6

1336~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/utd-sign-carrick.121630/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/utd-sign-carrick.121630/</a> stumbled upon this thread from when we were about to sign him ,good fun.

1337~~~
yes mr 440 posts many on here had some push back. i thought we waited too long and paid too much when he was available for a fraction of the price from wham. but never thought he was good enough to replace keane , which is not true the way football has chg'd. but then again do you even know who roy keane is or ever saw him play? because bringingup old posts is how you say - cun7ish.

1338~~~
This is the perfect post for hindsight. His fee was well worth it.

1339~~~
didn't spurs pay 3-4m for him? arsed.

1340~~~
What an idiotic post that is , how is the number of posts I have made relevant here . I didn't tag anyone or any post but just posted the whole thread about how people reacted when he was signed .

1341~~~
we already knew that. there are differing opinions on everyone signed by the club , this place would need a special forum for signings and opinions , oh right the transfer forum.. what's next berba? RVP?
fuc4ing childish.

1342~~~
I posted the Carrick/Wilshere comments from Hodgson before the last game, but I didn't realise he reiterated it after the game: 

“You [the media] made <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/jack-wilshere" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jack Wilshere</a> our best man in our matches in the autumn and I am sure he will have something to say but I have always been an admirer of Michael’s and am delighted to see him back. If both of them are fit I might have to a) find some way of tweaking the formations, or b) pick one of them. That would be tough.”

It's astonishing. They're completely different players. and shouldn't be competing for the same spot (if so it's a competition Carrick should win). I hope Carrick retires from England soon. They don't deserve him.

1343~~~
how many call ups did bruce and pally get in their pomp when the club was winning it all. then engerlund playing scholes out wide. ffs , england mgrs nedd to be vetted better.

1344~~~
I wonder if LvG will rest him against Villa.

Woy can't be that dense. Basically play Carrick as the holder and Henderson and Wilshire as the box to box CM's, it doesn't take a tactical genius to figure this out.

1345~~~
Agree, his comments are baffling. Wilshere's biggest asset is his ability to run with the ball but it's also what makes him completely unsuitable for the holding position. Beats 5 men, runs out of ideas and gets tackled high up the pitch which is basically suicide.

1346~~~
It's so weird that he thinks they play the same position.

1347~~~
Well technically they do play the same position as Jack has always been playing as the deepest midfielder for England lately. The obvious solution is to push Jack forward into Delph's spot which it sounds like he might just do as he says it would be tough to pick just one of them.

1348~~~
Saw Collymore say that Carrick still has a lot to prove. 

If anyone ever happens to see Stan.

1349~~~
It won't really matter with Wilshere cause he'll be injured anyway.

Collymore can feck off.

1350~~~
The glue of the team, it's going to be almost impossible to replace him <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1351~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what a tool.

1352~~~
No surprise Collymore making a tit out of himself.

1353~~~
Wilshere should pretty much just be taking Delph's position. It's not hard, but I guess Roy isn't the sharpest cucumber in the vegetable patch.

1354~~~
That's what I'd be looking to if I was England manager at the moment.

1355~~~
It's amazing how something so simple seems to be alluding him, I mean on top of that surely he's realized that Delph isn't good enough.

Young has had a solid season but I'd have Sterling on the left and either OX or Welbeck on the right.

1356~~~
Young over the Euro 2016 quali top goalscorer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1357~~~
"Carrick over Gerrard or Lampard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>"

I'm picking a system I think would be effective with the players I think would be best played in said system. Shoehorning the best players into a side isn't always the best route to winning matches. 

I'd rather Rooney up front to Welbeck and I'd rather Young on the left wing to Welbeck. I think the job Young does on that wing is completely underrated, he sticks to the touch line much better and actually plays from wide and provides service. That width is key to letting Wilshere and Henderson find space. 

I'd have Welbeck competing with Rooney centrally or Sterling on the right.

1358~~~
The hilarious thing about Carrick's current high rating in relation to England is that he'll be jettisoned as soon as an inferior player like Wilshere becomes available.

Carrick's opportunity to feature as a key player for England has been and gone. It's a joke that he's been overlooked, but we all know that those involved in the international scene are idiots.

Feck England.

1359~~~
First i agree "Shoehorning the best players into a side isn't always the best route". That's the reason why Sturridge or Kane will only have a place on the bench for England.

But i think Welbeck can play very good in a 4-3-3......Welbeck on the wing in a 4-2-3-1 would get a "no" from me. And like said Welbeck scores plenty of goals for England in that position.
I've always liked Young and he plays very well this season but i want goals and assists from my players in a 4-3-3. Young deserves a place at the moment in the Manchester United team but rather sooner than later he must have more goals and assists or Di Maria will be back in the team.
If you take out Welbeck for Young in the England team then you have only Rooney as goalscorer......Sterling has scored his first England goal against Lithuania and the midfield trio Henderson/Carrick/Wilshere has scored 0 goals in 79 games for England.

1360~~~
Imagine if England had been smart enough to play:


Who would be the 2006 wingers?

Anyway, that team would have been amazing.

1361~~~
Beckham and Joe Cole

1362~~~
I meant to mention Joe Cole.

So yeah, throw those two in there, you've got one hell of a team. 

Or Lampard for Gerrard, either way.

1363~~~
Sorry in 2006....Hargreaves over Carrick

Actually I liked Hargo on the right wing better than central midfield. 

Hargo didn't have anything like Carrick's ability to control a game.

1365~~~
He's been excellent.

1366~~~
Carrick got much better at controlling games after 2006.

1368~~~
Imperious.

1369~~~
Not having his best game I see. Quite a few under hit passes, so unlike him - fortunately for us, it's Villa.

1370~~~
He was crap.

1371~~~
He was ok today, I think playing so soon after the 2 internationals was probably something LvG would have avoided had Shaw or Smalling been fit to play.

1372~~~
I thought he was our best player in the first half. He faded in second though.

1373~~~
As great as Blind has been, he's got nothing on Carrick. Please stay fit, Carrick!

1374~~~
A few uncharacteristic moments but generally fine. Calmed things down when Villa were getting a little feisty.

1375~~~
Such high expectations have been set for Carrick, that when he gives the ball away, despite completing 92 of his 98 passes, people say he's crap. Probably wasn't at his sparkling best today, but he was far from crap.

1376~~~
A few sloppy passes but decent overall. Hodgson doesn't deserve him.

1377~~~
He's still a valuable outlet for us, but does anyone here think he's falling a touch behind on getting 50-50s?  There were a few open balls in the midfield where he was just a moment behind getting control of them.  Might only be one game but he is 33 now and we don't need him getting any slower.  Didn't think it was humanly possible.

1378~~~
I thought he was. Gave the ball away quite a few times in dangerous areas and seemed sluggish. Didn't really do much apart from help the ball go from left to right or vice versa.

1379~~~
That's your opinion, but I feel Carrick's been pivotal to us playing well in the last few games.

1380~~~
Last few games he's been excellent, I agree.

1381~~~
The only game I remember England playing Carrick with both Gerrard and Lampard was in the 06 WC against Ecuador. England played:

My memory of the game is that it didn't work particularly well. Beckham wasn't overly suited to this formation, and nor was Rooney at the time - he hadn't really played as a lead the line striker, let alone as a lone striker at that point. Rooney was also recovering from his injury do he was incredibly isolated. Gerrard at that time was still playing predominantly as a CM rather than as an AM.

Later, say between 08-11, I think it would have made a lot of sense to play a 433 something like:

1382~~~
First half I thought he was a little sloppy and not quite up to the pace of things. Got better as things went on.

1383~~~
that's just what he does he's solid, he's solid as Valencia at RB. You don't need to have the team full of stars or top performers to win the champions league but I'd like to see us improved on some positions. 6,7/10 players are good but when you look at Herrera lad, he's literally carrying our midfield, even if he didn't score the two goals today he would deserve 8/10. The passing was scholes-esque, 96%passing accuracy and a lot of creative passes too, crisp one-two-es. if anyone he's controlling midfield not Carrick. And Herrera mostly have better even defensive stats which is funny if we consider Carrick the more defensive minded player of the two.

I'd like to see Carrick being replaced by someone of ability to have his standard higher than 7/10. I believe Schneiderlin would be insane signing as he would complement with Herrera totally, one of the best tacklers and stronger guys in the league with not bad passing at all. He's as close to Matic as you can be from the players in the league.

Using Carrick as a squad player 20-25 games next year is still a good option considering his age. He always has his best games after longer rest..

1384~~~
Thought Carrick was good today, kept the ball constantly moving in Villa's half so that they posed no threat for most of the game. Could have used a higher tempo to the passing but then the whole team was a bit sluggish in that regard and I always felt we could up the pace if needed.

1385~~~
That should have been our midfield now. Hargreaves was immense, better than scott parker for me. To be honest Hargreaves could play the rwb role just as good central midfield so to get them both in the team I would leave Carrick in midfield.

1386~~~
Hargreaves and Carrick would certainly have been a silk and steel midfield. 

Except Paul Scholes was better than either by a country mile, so that wasn't going to be our midfield till he retired.

1387~~~
I thought he perhaps showed the effects of the games and travelling with England. Not quite at his sharpest. Still easily good enough.

1388~~~
Forgot to mention that. Would have Scholes in the 11 all day long.

1389~~~
if his slight drop in performance was related to England duty then it underlines the fact we need to bring in a similar playmaker midfielder

at 33 Carrick probably wants to play at a major finals but we are so reliant on him at the minute its important we bring someone in

he's never been a player to rely on pace so i see him having a key role, even in a rotational basis, for the next 2/3 years

1390~~~
Will Hughes at Derby might be a good choice. Though he is no way near defensively as good as Carrick but I could see him playing that role once he physically develops. I think also having Carrick as a mentor to him would only further his development.

1391~~~
Hilarious how Milner was man marking for the first few minutes, and then gave up for the last 80 or so minutes. Really hope that injury isn't bad.

1392~~~
Magnificent today. 

Hope he's OK.

1393~~~
Hope his injury isn't bad, we need him badly.

1394~~~
Really really hope his injury doesn't keep him out against Chelsea. He's essential.

1395~~~
Brilliant player, absolutely class. Have you ever played with friends and you play against one of those who used to be REALLY good in their youth, but they've gone fat and lost all forms of physical attributes, but they are still head and shoulders above the rest? Carrick is like that, only that he still has fairly decent physical attributes. He does look like he is playing in slow motion without players being able to touch him.

1396~~~
Controlled that game. The midfield is so fluent now. Him and Herrera are a joy to watch.

1397~~~
I'm going to sacrifice my best goat that he's fine.

1398~~~
He was great today.  When we started passing it backwards, then he just switched it up and nailed a straight pass all the way to the edge of their box <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1399~~~
Fluent midfield.. Wow, can't remember when i saw a fluent United midfield in recent years!

1400~~~
Shielded the ball so well. Tracked back. Probably third best player on the pitch today after Young and Mata.

1401~~~
Feck me, he was immense, especially in the second half. You could see he grew in confidence; when he's not doubting himself, he's as good as it gets.

1402~~~
I didn't think he was that great to be honest. Second Half he was much better as he had a lot more time but a lot of our success in the First Half was by bypassing him and going to Fellaini, also he was piss poor on the first City goal. His role is critical to how we play though, was worried after 10mins that we'd be fecked if he got nullified by Milner, our first goal was so crucial.

1403~~~
One of the most underrated players (outside of the club) in the prem, he's brilliant.

1404~~~
How bad is the injury?

1405~~~
Just got home from watching at the pub... God I hope nothing serious. 

Any word?

Not sure I agree... Mata was the one who let Silva make the run and get the assist...

1406~~~
To rip off the quote made about Pirlo

He might not be the best but he is one of the most important.

1407~~~
They both watched him, for someone who reads the game so well however Carrick has to do so much better than that.

1408~~~
He was majestic today, I hope that injury is nothing serious, vital for us.

1409~~~
my only concern other than his injury is he appears to be crucial to everything we do. if he's out for any period i can see our form really suffering.

1410~~~

1411~~~
Yeah but Silva started in the middle, ran away from the goal, then went out to the wing near mata... 

At that point he is Mata's responsibility, especially when you play a single central holding mid.  Carrick is most definitely *not* suppose to vacate that central space right infront of the back line.  Maybe I am missing something else but that is what i remember from watching the replays at the pub.

1412~~~
Is Shaw close to being fit if Blind has to replace Carrick?  Our attacking play suffers if we have to stick Rojo in there, and we've been so good down the left lately...

1413~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> if only

1414~~~

1415~~~
Did his job again today, such a shame he couldn't tuck away that chance in the 2nd half.

1416~~~
He ran straight past Carrick and caught him on his heels. He was there but didn't anticipate the run even though he was right in front of him.

1417~~~
Came to post this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1418~~~
Lots of sideways passes <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1419~~~
Yeah, we are incredibly reliant on him, that's obvious. We need to start looking for a replacement now and not get ourselves into the sorry of situation we did with Scholes again.

1420~~~
Really hope he isn't badly injured. Different side without him, which is concerning.

1421~~~
Why wasn't LvG asked what his injury is?

1422~~~
I think he deserved a little bit of criticism for the first half but in the second oh man he was so good, best half from him despite his early departure.

The thing about him is that if he's pressed hard and the tempo is too high like it was in the begining of the game he struggles but when they backed off and we gained time and confidence he was great. Hope it's nothing serious but I am all for giving Blind a chance and seeing Andy Pereira on the bench :-)

1423~~~
Really stepped it up after the first fifteen minutes. That second half performance was majestic.

1424~~~
Because the sports journalists in this country are feckin' morons.

1425~~~
One of the greatest midfielders in world football.

1426~~~
Let's hope he's ok cause we still have some very difficult games ahead of us and not just the visit to Stamford Bridge next Saturday. Carrick's been absolutely vital in LvG's 4-3-3 (or 4-1-4-1).  As Louis has stated, he has a 'football brain' and with our current tactical plan, in which the CBs often have to move out of position, he's the perfect choice to shield the central channels, drop deeper when necessary and cover the two CBs.

As for today's game, once Pellegrini replaced Milner with Nasri and 'offered' Carrick enough time on the ball, it was really game over for City. He completely dominated the tempo of the game and picked quite a few neat passes and initiated plenty interesting attacking plays.

1427~~~
Just rewatched it... You have a point that Carrick is near Silva but you are off in the priorities for each player.

Carrick is the shield, Mata needs to track, and if Mata is on his man as he should be then all is well.  Because any player anywhere on the pitch if given the choice of facing up to the man with the ball and shielding the center of the pitch, or tracking a man without the ball need to choose the man with the ball.  That is exactly what Carrick does here and what he should do.  And the point is he can not shield the center and track Silva; he can not do both he has to choose one.  As he is goal side he chose correctly and protected the center of the field.

It looks bad, but this is a team game and when one team mate does not do their duties the whole team can look bad.

And to be honest I see this as typical for Carrick, he does exactly what he is suppose to do, and he still gets blamed <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>.

1428~~~
What is he shielding? The play is broken, Smalling is at RB so Carrick has to look after that inside right space that Smalling has just left which Silva glides into. Carrick, Mata and Valencia are all fault but Carrick should do better with his defensive nous. Carrick has to drop into CB there. It all happens very quickly but I expect better from Carrick.

1429~~~

1430~~~
The center of the pitch mate.  He knows Smalling is not there.  He can not let a ball into the center.

1431~~~
He has to drop in at RCB, let Fellaini or whoever protect the centre, everyone has to come across because of Valencia getting caught up the pitch. Carrick is not purely at fault admittedly but he can do better. You are right about other people not doing their job making things look worse than they are.

1432~~~
He made at least one or two goal saving interceptions around the box today, something that actually lacked this year in his play. Hopefully he will be OK.

1433~~~
Thought he got a Red for a second. Walked away for a bit and came back to the pundit saying "he went straight to the tunnel, didn't wait to see the result." Hope he's alright, we need him.

1434~~~
It didn't look that bad. He'll start against the renties.

1435~~~
I really hope it's not bad, we'll need him for Saturday. He was brilliant today and deserves just as much praise as Young, Fellaini and Mata have got today.

1436~~~
Yep. As soon as Milner went off I was fairly confident we were about to utterly dominate the midfield (as opposed to only 'slightly dominating' before), and that's exactly what happened until we scored our 4th and took our foot off the pedal.

Hope Carrick's ok.

1437~~~
One word: Maestro.

1438~~~
It's only taken for him to reach 33(?) for him to be universally recognized as England's best midfielder

RAN
THE
SHOW!!

1439~~~
The goal conceded was kind of similar to the one at arsenal actually. Different players but tracking runs from the right wing gets pretty messy.

I don't know who's responsibility it is. Expecting mata or di maria to track runs that deep into our box seems a bit counterproductive to be honest.
I'd hope smalling and valencia would deal with it tbh and carrick or blind covers as necessary. Honestly carrick has always been a bit too reluctant to make a tackle.
Overall i'd just say its something we need to work on in training. Maybe pull hererra back a few yards.
It wasn't a badly worked goal in fairness.

Hope hes ok for Chelsea. Wouldn't object to giving him a week out if he needs it though.
Bad timing but getting him back fit and 100% for a good pre season and hopefully keep him fit and available for more of next season would be my priority at this point.

1440~~~
Football seems to be really easy for him at the moment. A joy to watch.

1441~~~
Important player. Has carried our midfield since 2009 pretty much on his own despite the stopgap partners hes had to deal with. Finally with a ball player like Herrera, we are seeing more freedom for him and what he can do. 

Excellent game, and his return twice this season has seen us go on two great runs.

1442~~~
When he's on form, he's peerless. No coincidence that we've been a far better team since he's come back in the side.

1443~~~
So damn good, such a classy player. Does the simple things so well. Really hoping the injury is nothing serious, we'll need him for Chelsea.

1444~~~
Yyy well we played 11 vs 10....


Troll face <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1445~~~
He was brilliant today and was the heartbeat of then team.

1446~~~

1447~~~
I'm not too concerned. Blind was equally as good in that role earlier in the season IMHO.

1448~~~
Milner was supposed to do a job on him but the way he created space for himself by maneuvering the ball with passes was brilliant. He wasn't doing this a couple seasons ago.

1449~~~
Blind did fine (mostly) - but Carrick is a level above.

1450~~~
The issue is that Mata was too far behind to ever make a play. In a perfect world Carrick would have seen that and switched on to Silva leaving Mata in the "shielding the centre" role. Maybe next time.

1451~~~
Just wanted to come back to this post from the 1st March. Since then we've won all 4 league games he's started: Spurs, Liverpool, Villa and City.

Overall in the Premier League this season his record is:

P18 W13 D3 L2

<b>Average points per game:</b> <b>2.3</b>

(and that includes the loss against City, his first match of the season when he was subbed on to play CB)

Without him our record is:

P14 W6 D5 L3

<b>Average points per game: 1.6</b>

I'm amazed there are still people out there that can't see Carrick is one of our most important players and one of the best players in the league.

1452~~~
He was so so so good defensively - read everything as soon a second before it happened. Unadventorous but flawless in possession. 8.5/10.

EDIT: Missed the 1st 30 mins, seems he screwed up for the 1st goal. Seems impossible having seen the rest of his game today!

1453~~~
Me too.

1454~~~
Keane levels of influence. Arguably the most important signing post treble, maybe Ronaldo edging that.

1455~~~
This summer should be all about finding a way to phase him out and find a world class replacement. Even more vital than purchasing a defender IMO

1456~~~
ffs that's overreaction.

1457~~~
You don't have to charge around the pitch ranting and raving to have an influence.

Our general play with him in the side and without is night and day, as is our points difference.

1458~~~
I like that his ball control and skill is actually pretty good, he just doesnt (need to) use it often. He does some lovely turns and often seems to be able to beat a man when he actually needs to.

1459~~~
I loved that moment where we were breaking from a City corner and Carrick faced up to Toure on the edge of our box, that body feint. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1460~~~
Ya I know all that and I have stood by Carrick when he was made fun of. My point was regarding fishy claiming him to be most important signing bar Ronaldo post treble. We have had quite a lot of influential and important players in those 16 years for Carrick to be regarded 2nd most important. He has been great signing, 16M now look bargain and has been a key player for us but that's it. Not 2nd most important in last 16 years. I would have Rooney, Rio, Vidic above him in 'important signings' post treble. Maybe VdS and Evra too.

1461~~~
Yep, I'll agree with that.

1462~~~
Just like Herrera somewhat replacing what Scholes offered us, we don't have to find a direct replacement. Despite the comparisons Herrera is a lot different, and Carrick's replacement doesn't have to mirror him either. There's also every chance that Blind could improve and be that man.

1463~~~
Yeah I got a bit carried away. But i'd say he's above Evra and Vidic at least. Rooney, Rio and maybe Ronaldo edging Carrick.

1464~~~
At the beginning that had me worried that he could find the space and start our attacks. Well, I shouldn't have been worried about our Michael

1465~~~
It is marginal between him and Vidic/Evra. I rank them important because we really needed stability in their positions. Carrick was important too but at least we had some good cover in that area. It would be interesting to have a thread ranking our signings post treble, top 5 at least.

1466~~~
The only thing I find more surprising than how much carrick is underrated is how our own fans seem to think this season will be his last as this level. We could get 3-4 more like this ala Pirlo! If there was ever a player in Europe built to last its Carrick and his game.

1467~~~
God, I just love him. He just doesn't get enough credit for what he's done for the club since he's been here. What a player!

1468~~~
Is he okay then? Any word?

1469~~~
When fit, there is no sign whatsoever of his performance level dropping. This seems a ridiculous suggestion.
He should be one of the first names on the team-sheet at the start of next season and fully deservedly!

1470~~~
Exceptional  (again ) today. We will need him at The Bridge, hope he's good.

1471~~~
Especially in a 3 man midfield, we can use runners around him. He was made to play this position, only now are we really getting to see him there!

1472~~~
Agree 100% with this. He is a class act.

1473~~~
This, keep coming back here for news. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1474~~~
He's the difference between us passing sideways just to keep possession and having thrust going forward.

Every now and then he'll just deliver the most perfect pass into the feet of an attacker and suddenly we've got the opposition on the back foot and that's something Blind doesn't do in the same role. Doesn't get enough credit for those sorts of passes.

1475~~~
Proud to say that I liked and rated Michael Carrick 5 years ago, when it wasn't fashionable to.

His importance to the way we played was always obvious. Great at reading the game and making interceptions, great passer, and so calm under pressure.

And to think, Scott Parker - and i've nothing really against Scott Parker - is an FWA and England Player of the Year, when the most decorated English midfielder of his generation never will be.

1476~~~
Carrick has been exceptional for us this season, player of the season is between him and de gea for me.

The way he plays his game, i think he could still play at this level for us for another couple of years at least.

1477~~~
You can't argue with the pattern of results with and without him.

You have to wonder if we'd have accumulated a few more points in the early stages of the season had he been fit...

1478~~~
When we're defending, his anticipation is as good as any other holding midfielder in the world. 

When we're attacking, his passing is equally as good. 

The only thing he's ever lacked was a yard of pace to press the ball, or else we'd talk about him as one of the best midfielders in the last 30 years. Having said that, I think that not being overly quick may have forced his hand to become a positionally aware anchor man. I'm not sure if he could have been any more effective if he were the type of player who buzzed around the middle third for 90 minutes.

1479~~~
I've absolutely no doubt about that, he's an intelligent player and van gal clearly rates him highly, he didn't need any time to understand what van gaal wanted while others needed months.

1480~~~
Just hope he isn't injured. Is absolutely vital to our team and will be extremely difficult to replace.

1481~~~
IS HE OKAY?

Seriously, I woke up and that's the second thought in my head. (First was the result, of course.)

1482~~~
Well, according to physioroom.com, Carrick does have a calf/shin injury, and so far, they haven't placed a return date for him. Judging by how Carrick walked off, it's most likely an injury on his calf, which isn't good as that means that he'll definitely miss the Chelsea match and possibly the match against Everton.

1483~~~
Can someone explain to me more about his role defensively today? It seemed like Smalling would drift out wide to the right and Carrick would drop back as a center back. This is what happened before their first goal but Carrick didn't really seem to be marking effectively. This was done to allow Valencia to get forward, or just as makeshift cover when he was out of position?

1484~~~
Carrick sits in the opposition's hole and with that he was supposed to pick up Silva early in the first half. Milner and Silva interchanged positions and it took our team by surprise before the first goal and I think that's why it gave city a bit of an upperhand. As for the first goal, it was a combination of uncertainty in marking because of that interchange and Valencia being completely out of position, behind both Milner and Clichy in their attack.

1485~~~
Carrick would always fill in for a central defender who'd drift out wide to the flank, regardless of whether it was Smalling or Jones. When Valencia would push up and press Clichy/Milner off the ball, Smalling would drift out to the right to cover for him, and Carrick is supposed to drop back to central defence with Herrera filling up his area in midfield.

1486~~~
<a class="username" data-user="44835, @WR10" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44835/">@WR10</a> & <a class="username" data-user="80898, @mazhar13" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80898/">@mazhar13</a> thanks for the explanation. I always thought of Carrick as very solid defensively but it got messy a few times today - City made some great passes and quick moves.

1487~~~
Just rewatched he game. It looked like he was feeling his right hamstring. It's obviously not too serious, so I would guess anything up to 2 weeks. Probably less.

1488~~~
Hopefully it is the hamstring and not the calf/shin as Physioroom.com mentioned. Calf/shin injuries can take up to a month to recover from.

1489~~~
I got it wrong! It was actually a 'stiff calf'. The fact it's just stiff rather than strained is good news. A bit of a rest and some massage should do the trick.

1490~~~
What a relief! I'm glad he went off in time then; otherwise, that could have been much worse.

1491~~~
I suppose if he isn't ready for Chelsea, it's Blind for him and Shaw at left back.

... Jeez, suddenly it feels like we're stacked for quality players.

1492~~~
He's our most important (outfield) player, that's some achievement given the talent at the Club.

1493~~~
Carrick has done wonders for your midfield when available this season. It's not even because of his ability, per se. He's a great player obviously, but his real strength is his ability to read the game and to position himself accordingly. United are a whole different animal defensively when he plays.

You should call him Pritt Stick because he is the glue which keeps the team together. Without him, you look flimsy and naive. With him, the opposite.

1494~~~
He reminds me of Modrić with his reading of the game and positioning. Or better say Modrić reminds me of Carrick. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

Carrick reads the game so well, always knows where to be, weather it is for a pass to organise our play, to settle down the tempo, or defensively to snuff out the danger if not by tackling than with good closing down.

1495~~~
So any updates... seriously I want him healthy for Chelsea!!

1496~~~
Barney Ronay - as usual - nails it. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/13/michael-carrick-manchester-united-barney-ronay-louis-van-gaal-manchester-city-midfield-blog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...-louis-van-gaal-manchester-city-midfield-blog</a>

1497~~~
All very well from Barney, but Carrick's 33, good old Grauniad.

1498~~~
"United brought to mind an expert hard court tennis player, moving an opponent from side to side, feeling for a weak spot, ganging up on one wing and setting City up for the big switch to that feeble wide backhand (also known as Gaël Clichy)." 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Great article. My favourite part though had absolutely nothing to do with Carrick. The term 'quicki-taka' optimises our new system perfectly!

Yes!

We need to nurse him through the Chelsea game and give him a break if he needs until the Arsenal game at OT. The second name on the team sheet by default after De Gea

1503~~~
Hopefully he's already hooked on Giggsy's yoga plan.

By far the most intelligent footballer in the team... yes, even more than Blind or Mata.

1504~~~
Haha Coincidentally read ronay's piece about 20 mins before coming on here and seeing it had been posted and was equally enamoured with quickie-taka

1505~~~
He had a great game particularly the second half so well deserved praise but so had Fellani, Herrera, Young Mata, Valencia, we have been playing good as team recently that's when Carrick's very useful player :-)

anyway the fifa rating still tells me he's a bit overrated 
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ffffff">not</span></span>

1506~~~
Loving this sort of comment after being shit for the first half of the season.

Goes to show how important it is to be patient with a manager and the philosophy he is trying to instill. The players are the same, the difficult part is making them perform as a team.

1507~~~
Indeed, good as Blind is as cover I'm loving him at LB.

1508~~~
Why doesn't he take corners? Surely he could assist 10 times more than he'd ever score from one.

1509~~~
It's amazing to think that people on this very forum thought that he was "past it" and not our preferred DM option earlier this season...

1510~~~
What's our stats with him in the team?

I think we only lost one league game when he's started and that was against Southampton.

1511~~~
-

1512~~~
We're way too reliant on him, at the moment. Despite his brilliance, he's bound to trail off sooner than later and I feel we could potentially witness that as early as next season. We need to get a replacement for him ASAP.

1513~~~
I don't see how him performing well means were are 'way too reliant' on him. Every team needs their players, especially their best players playing well. It's why you pay them a lot of money.

1514~~~
His good performances have coincided with us going on a good run. You can't deny the fact that he brings our team together in such a way that we function better as a unit. Our performances during his absence are a proof of that.

1515~~~
I was the biggest advocate for bringing Carrick in over Blind (as good as Blind was doing there) but I don't think we are too reliant on Carrick. Whenever a player is playing well, fans are quick to label it as that, too reliant etc. I understand the thought but I don't think we will turn to shit when Carrick leaves, we always evolve.

1516~~~
Any update on his injury?

1517~~~
It's not that bad. van Gaal confirmed after the match that Carrick had a stiff calf, which is not that bad and means that he'll be fully match fit and ready for the match against Chelsea.

1518~~~
LVG was speculating unless there is some quotes I am unfamiliar with.

1519~~~
Thank god,we need him badly for rest of the season,least against Chelsea,Everton &Arsenal.

1521~~~
Personally wouldn't mind Jones in DCM with Rojo in CB or the other way around while Blind stays at LB.

1522~~~
Good to know he's on the Yoga... he'll be playing for years to come!

1523~~~
He is not world class whatever you say, we are playing well because everyone is working hard on the pitch.  Carrick is a very good player but he's not at the level of Keane, Scholes, Lampard, Xavi etc 
It's a bit similar to how Mata has been playing so well recently, because everyone around them has been working hard and has a better understanding of van Gaal's philosophy.

1524~~~
Carrick is one of the few midfielders in the PL that brings out the best in those around him. He's a very good player playing great football. Mata is a world class player. Twice Chelsea player of the year and now repeating similar form for us!

1525~~~
One of the most likeable players in the world for me. Really glad he plays for United and hope he can give us another 2 or 3 seasons of top quality, while being properly phased out.

1526~~~
Depends on your definition of world class... based on the fact that are very, very few footballers in the world who can play in and do what Carrick does in his position as well as him, then you can certainly argue that he is a World Class DM.

1527~~~
He's actually rather good at winning a lot of front post headers, so I guess that's why we keep him there.

1528~~~
According to PhysioRoom, Carrick should be available this weekend.

Erm no, Jones isnt great on the ball. He will ruin our possession game.

1530~~~
And Shaw is great at possession in LB?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/luke_shaw/126/126/747/38/p|premier_league/2014/2015/daley_blind/126/126/7674/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/phil_jones/126/126/89/0/p#defence_score/interceptions/pass_completion/key_passes#total" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...nterceptions/pass_completion/key_passes#total</a>

Jones has played DCM and so I would rather he play there and keep our attacking options strong on the right side with Blind.

1531~~~
Are you being serious? Did you watch England v Italy?

1532~~~
People thinking like that are why England's midfield has been so sh1t for the last decade .... <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

1533~~~
A crying shame really.

1534~~~
That's proper mental. Jones playing the Carrick role. 

If Carrick playing football is like someone playing the Piano, Jones playing football is like someone using a steel brush as a plectrum on an electric guitar cranked up to 12.

1535~~~
No I didn't but as I said, if Carrick is unavailable, I would rather have someone else play DCM than have Blind move from LB. If it's Jones then so be it, if not then someone else but I wouldn't want to move Blind now when he has report with Young and Fellaini on the right where as if Shaw had to come in, I just don't have confidence that Shaw could do the same with those two.

Jones in the meantime has played in the DCM position so it's why I can see him play there, if Carrick is unavailable of course.

1536~~~
Maybe you aren't following the story line here. If Carrick is unavailable, would you rather have Blind play in Carrick's position or at LB where he is doing the damage?

1537~~~
In Carrick's position, obviously. There's no way Jones should play as the #6 for us.

1538~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> is that even a question? In Carricks position every day of the week.

1539~~~
Well that's your opinion and what I said was mine.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1540~~~
Shaw is an infinitely better LB than Jones is a DM. 
Blind is an infinitely better DM than Jones is. 


That's pretty much all their is to it.

1541~~~
There cant be many people who would prefer to play Jones in Carrick's place over and above Blind, surely? Blind has shown he can do that job very well and we have at least two good options at LB in Blind's place: Rojo and Shaw.

1542~~~
Oh I understand that Adebesi, it's just I don't believe either Rojo or Shaw will be able to do the same job as Blind does at LB. Neither has displayed close to the same performance as Blind has the past four weeks in that position attacking wise. 

That said, I am glad Carrick should be playing Saturday so we won't have to find out either way.

1543~~~
Problem is. you think Jones can replicate Carrick?.

Id even have Young at LB with ADM in front of him it means Blind can deputise for Carrick.

1544~~~
Yeah but I still can't see Young at LB with ADM in front of him clicking like Blind, Young and Fellaini does. They cause so much havoc at the moment at the left side it's quite funny. 

Having Di Maria on the LW will just mean that he maraud's forward like he usually does and while being sometime effective, it's Chelsea we are playing and I can't see him being as effective as say the three I mentioned above. I would then rather have Rojo or Shaw play LB than Young as defence would be a priority, not that Young couldn't do the job. I am sure he probably could.

1545~~~
Obviously with Carrick out we take a big hit, that is inevitable. But i think in terms of damage limitation, Blind in Carrick's spot and Shaw covering for Blind is less of a step down than Jones covering for Carrick.

1546~~~
I honestly feel like the the Chelsea game will be decided on Carricks fitness. If he is fit and starts I am confident we we will win and even more confident we wont lose. If he isn't fit its a draw or a loss for us I think. I know Blind can do a "job" there in DM but that's just the thing, he just does a job, he does ok but he doesn't control the play and dedicate our tempo or protect the defence the way Carrick does.

Really hope hes fit and we can show Chelsea what they are in for next season.

1547~~~
Carrick wouldn't have made the difference. Perhaps the midfield might have been more balanced with Carrick, but I think generally England as a team is a bit hopeless (with or without Carrick). Just like Gerrard and Lampard couldn't replicate their club performances neither would Carrick and any other English player.

1548~~~
Unfit for Chelsea, lets hope he'll be all right for Everton.

1549~~~
That is a massive blow. Just when I thought we could give Chelsea a shock and smash them. I think it will be a draw now.

1550~~~
Influence bold and underlined. Hopefully he's back soon so we can attempt some kind of run for 2nd (assuming Chelsea beat Arsenal).

1551~~~
He is so vital for our squad balance. Every game he is missing you just feel it that something isn't right, we look unstable at the back and missing structure when attacking. 

It will be such a hard task to replace this guy. I just hope he has at lest 2-3 more years at this level left in him which doesn't seem too impossible given that he isn't a very physical player but of course it would be the best if we find someone who can do his job as well as he does it as soon as possible.

1552~~~
So is there another Carrick out there? Maybe not. But today proved how much we need a true alternative to him.

He's our most important player, and it's not good enough that we are in a position where our most important player will be 34 soon.

1553~~~
Don't think he would have made any difference today.

1554~~~
That's a bizaare statement considering he would have allowed Herrera to play where's he better, and we would have had Rooney up front, not Falcao...

1555~~~
Carrick being out meant we had to drop Rooney back, essentially this weakens two important areas in the team, it could have made all the difference.

1556~~~
Well yeah Rooney and Herrera could have made a difference playing in their proper positions. But that could have happened if Blind was fit as well. Carrick himself playing in midfield wouldn't have done much to influence the game though with Chelsea's bus in front of him.

1557~~~
OK, you've just admitted that Carrick being fit would have made a difference. Thanks.

1558~~~
Carrick would have made a huge difference for us, without anyone closing him down he would have the freedom to completely orchestrate how we play with trios on the side being able to do the damage.

1559~~~
I don't think some appreciate his contribution. He's been under appreciated in this way all his career. It may not have made a difference to the result, but we would have undoubtedly played better with Carrick.

1560~~~
The amount of changes we had to make to cover for his loss showed. Rooney, Herrera being played out position. The chemistry among Mata-Herrera-Valencia being broken all contributed to us creating only 2 shots on goals. He commands respect from the opposition.

1561~~~
He's our most important player.

1562~~~
We need to find a proper replacement for him and FAST. We are making the same mistake we did with replacing Scholes.

1563~~~
I can understand why is this thread bumped but let's not get Carricked away. We were missing Herrera in midfield as no8 not much Carrick as no6. He has done fantastic job as no6, apart one mistake which will obviously cloud someone's opinion. But to keep Chelsea at 21% possesion at home delitign Fabregas and co at STamford Bridge is fecking fantastic. Say what you want, Carrick wouldn't do a better job today.. It was Herera's neverending movement which made it very difficult for them to close him down. His deffensive stats are impressive as his passing acc 95%. I will copy it from other thread
5 interceptions (most on the pitch)
3 tackles
110 touches (most on the pitch)
95% pass accuracy (most on the pitch)
93 passes (most on the pitch, and more than Fábregas, Matic and Zouma combined)  
he also won couple of freekickes and got their player booked

So no need for Carrick, just for another expansive creative midfielder as no8. Shame Rooney wasn't up to it, too tidy. If Blind and Carrick aren't fit for the next game I want to see diMaria instead of Rooney and him up front..

1564~~~
We missed Carrick cause Herrera was a nr. 6 instead of him and with Carrick he'd be a nr. 8, much more closer to the goal and thus more dangerous. 

With Di Maria in midfield instead of Rooney in the next game I think we'd be too open.

1565~~~
I'd say you're wrong for a few reasons. People like to throw the passing stat up as an indication that someone's done a job comparable to an in-form Carrick - they did it with Blind earlier in the season too - but with Carrick, it's not just the sheer amount of passes he makes, it's the choice of pass, and the quickness of thought that makes him stand apart. 99 times out of a 100, Carrick will pick the right pass... and not only that, he knows exactly which pass he is going to play and the perfect time too play it, often even before he has the ball at his feet. It's that quickness of thought and intelligence and elligance on the ball that makes him stand apart, it is not just a number. Also, there is a huge physiological benefit to having Carrick on the pitch that has been fairly evident over the past few weeks - when he's around, everyone else is a lot calmer in possession and more assured on the ball and in their pass - as if they always know that Carrick is behind them in case things go wrong... that is why we play better football when he's around.

Also, from simply looking at the game - Carrick wouldn't have let Hazard go anywhere near as easily as Herrera... nor would he have given the ball away to create the chance that Hazard hit the post from - thus Chelsea wouldn't have created their two biggest chances in the game. 

This isn't to criticise Herrera - at all... he did a very good, admirable job in a position he doesn't play in, and to not be able to do it to the level of someone like Carrick is hardly a criticism.

1566~~~
Yeah I am in agreement with that, we simply missed another midfielder of ander quality as no8 but he himself did the job as no6 really well so my statement was rather about the fact that I am delighted that we found another player who can make a brilliant job as no6 hence once we enter the market we may want to look for another b2b than strictly defensive minded/deep lying playmaker. With more muscles would be fine..
And yeah you're perhaps right but IMO it would be better to play two players in their natural positions, Rooney up front and diMaria in the side as b2b than next to useless and leaving Falcao up front and average Rooney in midfield. But yeah we need balance..

1567~~~
We need a mid who can play both nr. 6 and nr. 8 and play it good. not strictly def. midfielder but b2b who is good also defensively. Basically I think we think similar on the subject. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1568~~~
Maybe this is why LVG wants to sign Strootman. He would be ideal.

1569~~~
If Hazard ran past Carrick, Carrick wouldn't be able to do a thing.
Overall I agree we missed Carrick, but Herrera did a great job, what we missed more than Carrick at 6 was Herrera at 8.

1570~~~
Carrick wouldn't have let him run past him as he probably would have been a few yards deeper to give himself a better chance of matching the run - either way, he probably would have been more alert/aware of Hazard because he's more defensively inclined.

1571~~~
First of all I am not in disagreement with what you say mostly. I feel the same about Carrick picking the right passes, well he's experienced player and should be doing that, he also played that positions for several years. So here he's surely ahead of Herrera who played there for us for the first time as back up and I am not sure how much he spent playing as no6 at Bilbao or Zaragoza before.

One think why Carrick looks so good recently is the fact that he has Herrera infront of him, he massively helps him to make space with his clever and neverending movement, quick one twos... On the other hand Herrera for the first time as no6 had to cope with Rooney infront of him and cut off Fellaini, Rooney is at times very immobile player in terms of ball control, he just simply can't do what Herrera does for Carrick. Fellaini was out of the game man-marked by Zouma and the center of the pitch was hard to get through, also the wide spaces were doubled a lot so he didn't really had so much space to pick some sublime passes. With the quickness of thought I think they are on the same level. But again that's carrick's natural position, Herrera is just discovering that perspective, the more he would play there the quicker he would think about the possible passes and the game.

Another thing is the pass consistency.. I agree that Carrick is up there with the top and isn't that error prone as Herrera, but everybody can make a mistake and with 95% pass acc, it will always be very few.. The thing Herrera is destroying Carrick is his touch and movement, he can receive the ball under pressure, can very easily turn around player and is always availible, our play is much quicker how he links the both sides of the pitch.

You are pointing out that wouldn't have let Hazard go anywhere near as easily as Herrera, that's wrong imo, everyone has it's own ways how to shield the ball and get away from player, Carrick does it with his body strength really well but Herrera's quick feet and skill to get away from players is invaluable in some situations. I remember how Carrick lost the ball against Liverpool and we conceded goal to dramatize the game, it was his inability to get away from these situations.. But it can happen.

Carrick is a great player and one of his strongest assets is his experience and passing consistency but I believe it won't take that long to Herrera surpass him even at Carrick's prefered position as he is simply world class talent which to me players show for instance by quickly adjusting to unfamiliar roles on the pitch. I also don't think that Carrick would have better game alongside Rooney and man-marked Fellaini. Haven't seen him being as dominant in such away fixture tbh. 

And one more thing why I think Herrera could master this positions quite quickly is that his defensive contribution is on different level to Carrick. But Herrera's basically pressing all game. 5 interceptions, 3 tackles, 5 clearances, getting two players booked only this is fantastic display for purely defensive player who is in the team just to clear the danger and pass the ball to his team mates - but as we all know Herrera can add much more to that. One last question is: Can he prove me right that he can soon be our no1 player there? I am not sure as he will always be preferred as no8 but if we somehow got mad and bought someone like Pogba I would really like him to orchestrate the game from the deeper role like he did against Chelsea. We will see.

1572~~~
Thats the thing though, I agree in principle, but Herrera was actually aware of Hazard, he moved to where he was to an aggressive position because he anticipated a pass from Fab to Hazard rather than to Oscar (that was his mistake) after that pass went to Oscar Hazard ran off him, tbh Herrera should have been more aware at this point, but even then he was fecked already. That kind of thing can and does happen to Carrick too although less often, uusally too Carrick is smart enough to commit the foul.

1575~~~
goddamn..

1576~~~
Can't have Rooney in midfield again, we need Carrick fit for the Everton match.

1577~~~
If he's not fit, Blind will jump in.

1578~~~
Didn't realise Blind is back, we desperately need him in CM and Rooney back up front.

1579~~~
If he's not fit, Blind is fit and will play CM. Its Everton, let's not act as if we don't have a team good enough to beat them without Carrick. We'll need to sign a replacement for him, as he has started picking up injuries frequently, and I think this trend will continue due to his age. There are quite a number of good players out there we should be looking at as replacement.

1580~~~
As I heard he should be back for sunday.

1581~~~
No Carrick. No points.

I miss the smooth, handsome, rugged bastard.

1582~~~
This

I don't think with his discipline Everton would have scored the goals they did today.

1583~~~
Save our season, Carrick.

1584~~~
Shows how utterly important he is. We are a different side when he plays.

1585~~~
He is our most important player without doubt...

1586~~~
When is he back?!

1587~~~
Absolutely imperative we find apt replacement for the future, also. Blind is just not that.

1588~~~
We're fecked next season if we don't get our midfield signing right.

1589~~~
Sounds about right...

1590~~~
We need him badly

1591~~~
Embarassing how bad we look when we can't play him.

I still can't believe people think Blind is anywhere near remotely as good as him.

1592~~~
Badly missed. Hope he's back for next week.

1593~~~
Yep. The priority signing has to be a Carrick replacement. He is just so, so crucial to us.

1594~~~
Bloody hell, no Carrick, no points

1595~~~
I guess he's still a couple of weeks away? Maybe have him for Palace away?

1596~~~
Coming in to say the same thing. Soon as he gets injured, we go back to slow, predictable football. Our most important player.

1597~~~
When will he be back?

1598~~~
Not only that. He brings calmness to our defence rather than Blind who goes charging up.

1599~~~
Fecking invisible today, might as well retire. <span style="color: #ffffff">Ok ok, I'll stop..</span>

1600~~~
Just saw a statistic that we won 72% with Carrick and 32% without him. 

Probably our most important player at this time, Blind is doing a decent job, but he still has a lot to learn.

1601~~~
Confirmation bias

1602~~~
Definitely missed him today, we would have used the ball so much better with him in the team. Blind disappointed me today.

1603~~~
We need Carrick back desperately, its crazy how much we miss him in the side. Blind is not good enough. Its no coincidence when it Blind instead of Carrick we are always poor.

1604~~~
I would do everything to get him back for our next match.

1605~~~
It's amazing that people still massively underestimate his importance to the team. Both in terms of shielding the back four and starting off significant attacks. He's calm, authoritative and dictates the play for us.

1606~~~
This is exactly how England feel after every major tourney... only they stand around and have no idea how to fix their issues.  

We on the other hand know we just need Carrick healthy.

1607~~~
Carried our midfield since 2009. Just a shame we never bought a proper midfield partner that Carrick deserved. Herrera and him are good together as they can both use both feet.

Carrick along with his passing has great positional play. The Chelsea goal last week and the first goal this week doesnt happen if Carrick is there. He plugs holes. Hes not a tackler and doesnt need to be as he reads the game. Need him back for the final four games.

1608~~~
I really hope he can keep playing into his mid-late 30s.

1609~~~
Carrick is always in the box for corners so he wouldn't have even been back there if he was playing.

1610~~~
The Legend that is Michael Carrick needs to work his magic  to clinch this top 4 finish.

1611~~~
I can't remember..what was his injury again?

1612~~~
Spent over one hundred millions on players and still can't properly replace him. Shame he cannot be 25 years old again.

1613~~~
I honestly look forward to the challenge LVG faces when he has to find a player who can replace Carrick. Incredible how important he is to us.

1614~~~
Thing is, Carrick's style isnt a particularly demanding one in that he could probably play for another 3-4 years at the same level. The concern lately is more about fitness than age, for me. If he can stay fit then we shouldnt need to replace him for at least another couple of years.

1615~~~
Although it has come at the detriment of the team at times, it's nice to see that Carrick's legacy is really being enhanced as his career winds up. Hopefully he can get back ASAP, top four is a certainty with him fit.

1616~~~
The team looks clueless when he's not on the pitch, just look at what happened when get went off against City as well, everybody's heads just dropped. I would worry about us not beating Palace and Arsenal without him in the team, even West Brom because the way we are playing right now will mean teams can just counter attack us easily/

1617~~~
We need him back badly and need to buy a player who can properly replace him

1618~~~

1619~~~
Is he healthy for this weekend?  Any word...

1620~~~
Guess we will hear from LvG in the press conference today. Hopefully he's fit for Arsenal at least.

1621~~~
Is he even more important than we thought?

1622~~~
Yes. Though at the same time it shows how tactically limited van Gaal is when he relies so much on a single player. 

Just because Carrick is out should not mean that the team turns to utter garbage. Though that's unfortunately been the case, as we are far too reliant on him to get results. It's a bit disheartening.

1623~~~
I think another reason why we are so crippled attacking wise if he isn't playing is also the fact that Herrera needs to play much more defensive and we are missing his creative input going forward. Rooney just isn't good enough in this role especially not at the level he is playing at right now.

1624~~~
He is very important. However, these performances have been abysmal and have nothing to do with Carricks absence. We shouldn't be that reliant on one player...

1625~~~
Have we even won a game this season when he hasn't played?

Have we even lost a game when he has?

Doesn't feel like it is would be my answer to both

1626~~~
Wouldn't blame someone for believing that. Simply put, we're far better with him on the pitch than we are without him.

1627~~~
How long is he out for? Already feels like an eternity.

1628~~~
Should be our priority this summer finding his replacement, forget flirting with the idea of Bale. He's such an important  player for us, we seem lost without him in the middle.

1629~~~
LvG initially though he'd be back for today's game so it's anybody's guess.

1630~~~
Forget spending 100m or whatever it is on Bale. Spend that money and get in two proper central midfielders to replace Carrick.

1631~~~
Physioroom has him listed as "no return date". <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1632~~~
Any chance of him being back next week?

1633~~~
Don't waste your time. They know feck all.

1634~~~
Well they probably only know what the club tells the press. But if we haven't given out a return date it doesn't sound too good. I just hope he will be back until the Arsenal game.

1635~~~
Yes, that's true. In short, a simple google search will reveal the same information as what Physioroom publish. They basically just aggregate information from Twitter and club pressers/interviews much like we did in the Injuries/Suspensions thread in the United forum.

1636~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">Van Gaal is not optimistic that the influential Michael Carrick will be fit in time to return at Palace next Saturday The absence of the injured midfielder has clearly been felt and has stopped United's momentum in its tracks.</span>

1637~~~
Damn. It looked such a little niggle at the time.

1638~~~
Match rhythm is over-rated. If he has been training with the first team for a while, he should be match fit. I mean they are proper athletes who don't simply lose their sharpness in just a few weeks. And he has brought the likes of Blind straight back in

1639~~~
He must have missed more than 50% of the games in the last two seasons. Time to get a proper starter for his position or this will become like our search for the next Keane or Scholes.

1640~~~
In my opinion, it depends. If it was a minor injury or the player was out for a very short while and continued to train with the rest of the team, then match rhythm matches with the second tier might not be essential.

If the injury was serious or the player was out of training for a long time, I imagine that this would be necessary to prevent further injuries and get the player back up to speed.

1641~~~
To replace him has to be the top priority. It's incredible how much we struggle without him

1642~~~

Lvg doesn't think Carrick will be available for Palace. Please not Rooney again in midfield. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1643~~~
How can he not see this does not work <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>?

Please just play Pereira <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>!!

1644~~~
I'd agree, play Pereira, but instead of Fellaini.

1645~~~
I don't watch many youth/reserve games but from what I've see Pereira is not a holding mid in any way, shape or form.
How will that help with the lack of a holding mid problem?!

1646~~~
It doesn't, but having players who are comfortable in possession and comfortable with the ball at receiving the ball from the defence at their feet is better than what Fellaini offers.

1647~~~
It was only a few games ago that Fellaini was one of our best players in those attributes. He hasn't suddenly forgotten how. Teams recognise him as a threat now, which at the very least occupies them with keeping him quiet. 
I doubt throwing Pereira in at the deep end will offer anything near what Fellaini can. That's the sort of wishful thinking fans showed before the likes of Zaha and Fabio disappointed us. 
And by the way this isn't a criticism of Pereira. Just that it's too soon for him and too much pressure.

1648~~~
Fellaini has never been comfortable receiving the ball at feet and playing it forward. That's just not his game.

1649~~~
I  am not saying play Pereira for an injured Carrick at DCM. We have issues there whoever we play unless Carrick is healthy.

I am saying play Pereira ahead of Rooney as one of our two other CMs.

Not saying it is guaranteed to work, but I am tired of watching strikers play as CMs.

That make sense now?

1650~~~
And I am back....

Any word?

1651~~~
Nice read on Carrick

1652~~~
That diagram they have comparing Ajax '95 vs MU '15 is short of 1 MU player. 

No wonder we keep losing. We've been playing while a man short. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1657~~~
Don't think some people realise how important he is to our side when they put Schneiderlein ahead of him as a #6 in hypothetical line ups.

However, if Carrick has a less injury hit season (which is likely, as apart from last year he isn't exactly an injury prone player), I think it could be one of his best years yet. It's clear Van Gaal absolutely loves him as a #6, and him complimented with Schneiderlein and Herrera is as good as any midfield in the league.

1658~~~
typical example of utility and indifference curve

1659~~~
Coming towards the end of his career now so how would people rank him amongst the all time Premier League midfielders... Just in the tier below the likes of Keane, Scholes, Vieira etc ?

1660~~~
It's gonna be fun and interesting if despite signing Schneiderlin and Schweini, Carrick will send them right from the start on the bench with his typical above intelligent performances.

Don't be surprised if injuries won't f*ck him up.

1661~~~
Didn't he won the same if not bigger amount of trophies than Vieira ?

He's not a huge type of character in the dressing room but I still think he's close there. He offered everything what was needed to conquer England and Europe.

1662~~~
He'll be appreciated a lot more when he's finished.

1663~~~
IMO carrick wont be a big name in the all time greatest midfielders unless you ask a united fan.  However  this is exactly the reason why i deem him to be one of the best.  He always played for the team first and foremost.  Even the likes of pirlo and cleverely who focus on passing have streaks of arrogance in their play style that carrick never had. 

Fantastic player and one of the best players to play for united ever.  How the likes of scholes &  carrick never regularly appeared for england is beyond me.

1664~~~
that answers surely

1665~~~
He'll never be rated on their level as he was never as obviously imposing or gung-ho.

I don't think some United fans will really appreciate him until he's gone. I think we were lucky to watch Ronaldo and him together, it was a great match at the time. We just don't and haven't had a player to release the ball to in that fashion since.

1666~~~
Most United fans have an appreciation for Carrick and know what he brings to the table. I also noticed alot of pundits and commentators have finally caught on to how important he is for us and he's been getting his due the last few years. I don't think he'll be raved about and put in teams of the decade because he wasn't a prolific midfielder like Lampard or a real character like a Keane or Vieira. In a way he's alot like how Xabi Alonso in that regard where he's a top player but his impact isn't measurable by statistics.

Of course you'll have the "fans" who don't watch games, play Fifa and will be all over Twitter who'll be saying good riddance and beg us to sign Pogba or a midfielder with pace like Castro or Junuzovic.

1667~~~
He'll never be rated as among the best because he wasn't as good as the best. Very good midfielder, just not one of the best.

1668~~~
To think he'd have actually been a lot better besides a real central midfield partner in those years of midfield wilderness.

1669~~~
let's see how the President of France is going to be an upgrade on him

1670~~~
Agreed. Underrated for a lot of his career, but second tier not first. To be fair, in my opinion that puts him alongside the likes of Gerrard and Lampard. Scholes is the only Englishman in the ranks of this generation's true midfield greats.

1671~~~
Schweini shits all over Carrick.

1672~~~
As a Box-to-Box? yes, but as a holding midfielder i think Carrick are way better.

1673~~~
That is to be determined in United where everything is possible. Juan Sebastian Veron used to shit all over everybody in Europe but in English league ? Not so much but as for now Schweini is better and more of a complete footballer indeed.

1674~~~
The reason carrick isn't up there with the likes of scholes and schweinsteiger is maybe down to his lack of ability but i put it dowm to his upbringing. 

Looking at van gaals tactics alone; you wonder what he coukd have achieved in the world if he had a manager who developed players like van gaal did with schweinsteiger.  
SAF is a great manager to improve your ability but maybe not a manager to completely maneuver a decent player to a position in a system where they become critical. 

If van gaal was here from the start(not saying i want him to)  its just as possible he would have started off as a CB/CDM hybrid we have seen only at the latter part of his career.

1675~~~
Carrick's best football came under Alex Ferguson so I doubt he'd have been any better.

1676~~~
Yep.

1677~~~
if Carrick manages to sustain a healthy career ahead, the best is yet to come from him
I'm afraid some fans will never appreciate him to the level he deserves

1678~~~
I agree with this.

1679~~~
supposedly the biggest loser, as in the case of every midfield shake-up

1680~~~
He's 34, was always going to happen. Will still play plenty of games and rotate with bastian, but he's not first choice anymore. Great squad option to have though, considering he's a better player then any other midfielder bar fabregas and matic in the league (and those starting in front at United).

1681~~~
Carrick at CB next to Smalling anyone? I think we should at least give it a try

1682~~~
who?

1683~~~
the last person you want to maintain a high line is Michael Carrick

1684~~~
I'll have whatever you're on mate.

1685~~~
Louie loves Carrick. I'd imagine he'll play a lot of games if he stays fit. He just won't be automatically first choice anymore. Nor should he be at 34 years of age.

1686~~~
Major flaw in Carrick that doesn't put him in top tier is that he didn't stand up and be counted when the going is getting tough. He's just not a big enough personality to put his stamp on a final the way the best of the best did. So I rank him tier 3.

Tier 1 being absolute maestros Xavi, Iniesta, Pirlo 
Tier 2 being your Scholes Gerrard and Lampards

1687~~~
I'd probably have Schole, Keane and Vieira as the absolutely top top tier...
Then Yaya, Lampard, Gerrard, Beckham, Fabregas just behind...
Then follow closely by Carrick, Alonso, Matic, Essien etc

1688~~~
you can say that, but I don't think his job is for those moments. like you don't expect to have Busquets to do that urging in the team. the whole respected Juventus midfield (all of Pogba, Pirlo, Vidal, Marchisio mind you) could not do much in the last UCL final against Barca, let along a much inferior United midfield against Barca's midfield in their prime

actually when things got tough, he was the only remaining stable midfielder, he confidently responded to SAF's appeal. That's enough for me

1689~~~
I don't expect a blustering Roy Keane Turin 99 performance and i'm not even looking at the Barca finals because he was playing against two tier 1 midfielders(and another to probably cement his place there as well) in their prime.  I just felt his game suffered when we came under pressure in particular against Liverpool and Chelsea. We would start well, maybe grab a lead and then there would be inevitable pressure and instead of being a quietly influential platform he would be wasteful in possession like the rest of the team.

1690~~~
Second tier with the likes of Gerrard.

Top tier being Scholes, Keane, Viera, Zidane etc. and Xavi being out on his own in front of the lot.

He was never quite capable of exerting himself against the very best, probably down to his personality/mentality more than his ability. He will also never be mentioned in these comparisons in 10 years time because of that.

1691~~~
I really want all of our CM's playing at once <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Will be difficult to leave players out.

1692~~~
I think he played well against Chelsea most of the time. against Liverpool with everything thrown out of the window, with the end to end football we played then, wouldn't be a surprise. heck even Vidic would lose almost all of his cool there

1693~~~
Herrera, Schweinsteiger and now schneiderlin? Though I don't even think schneiderlin is better then him, but he has a different skill set. We definitely have the best crop of midfielders in the league though, and none of city's or arsenals and definitely not Liverpools apart from cazorla from arse would get much of a look in.

1694~~~
will give you Schweini, definitely not the others

1695~~~
Still of the opinion despite our new signings he's our best midfielder.

Having genuine rotation options should help Carrick as well, since we won't completely rely on him.

1696~~~
Would love to see a midfield trio of Carrick-Schweini-Herrera with Bastian helping to create space for the other two to operate in, but obviously Carrick is 33-34 and he is most likely to begin in the very important fixtures rather than be a standard choice week in week out.  Then comes Schneiderlin, still only 24 and bound to improve especially under lVG's guidance.

1697~~~
I'm with you on that one. Obviously only because of question marks about what Schweinsteiger we are getting but as things stand he's the first player on the team sheet for me when fit.

1698~~~
He'll be looking around the plane at Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Herrera and thinking "Finally".

1699~~~
