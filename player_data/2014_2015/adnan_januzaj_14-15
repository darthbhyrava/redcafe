The brightest homegrown prospect since the Class of '92 in many people's opinion, this is going to be a huge season for our young Belgian.

He has the skills, he needs the consistency and van Gaal is a fantastic manager for bringing through such a player.

He may well already be our best winger, so even if we bring in someone else to play out wide I think he'll be a mainstay.

It will be interesting to see if van Gaal plays him out wide in a 433, he will certainly have more opportunities to attack under our new manager no matter the formation.

2~~~
I think more than just his style of play LvG will love his speed of thought, the way he can see and pull off the risky pass and his general fearlessness. I'm excited to see how he continues to develop.

3~~~
Too bad he won't get a preseason in with the lads... I hope that won't affect his rhythm in terms of getting into the swing of things.

4~~~
I hope we can see him play against Valencia at Old Trafford. Will he be back from his vacation by that time? Did all the other players get 3 weeks like RVP?

5~~~
I feel like he changed his game a lot throughout the season last year, and not necessarily for the better. At first he seemed like a very intelligent, creative, finesse type #10 player playing out wide, but as the year went on he became more of just a dribbler and crosser out wide. Hardly surprising given moyes' tactics, but I'm not sure if that improved him much or for the better. 

We'll see how he is this season, I'm looking forward to it, I just hope he doesn't try and become a bale/Ronaldo type winger because he has too much natural ability and finesse to his game and it would be wasted.

6~~~
He was the only bright spark for us last year. With Van Gaals reputation for developing young players I'm genuinely excited about how he can develop next season.

The lad is potentially world class.

7~~~
Has it been announced that he won't play any part in the preseason?

8~~~
Not per se, but he won't be going to the States at all. I'm guessing he'll be available in time for the friendly against Valencia.

9~~~
keep thinking "second season syndrome" might come to pass.

Let's hope not!

10~~~
I think he may have a slight blip this season but next season, he will come alive and fulfill his potential. Similar to Sterling I suppose. IMO he is more talented than Sterling but it's hard for youngsters to keep up their consistency and the opposition become more aware of them. 

Also you would expect LvG to develop him even further with his reputation.

11~~~
He hasn't made it yet! and I hope that his head has not over grown his talent...otherwise LVG will take if off. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12~~~
Potentially our most talented player. Hopefully he kicks on more next year in terms of goals/assists.

13~~~
Hopefully he will have a big role to play next season but at the same time we can´t expect too much from him he´s a young lad and is still developing his game.

14~~~
He'll play probably play a game for the reserves too if he trains just at Carrington (before the other lads are coming back)

15~~~
I felt the same way too. I think a large part of that stems from him playing on the left and also seeing less of the ball. He used to move towards the ball at every opportunity, but started to wait on the sideline hoping the ball came to him as the season progressed. The Sevilla pre season match is a great example of how he used to play for the reserves no matter if he was on the wing or behind the striker or as the 9.

16~~~
I hope he ends up as a striker.

17~~~
I wasn't sure if I just imagined things or remembered his first half of the season wrong. I agree though, before he always drifted inwards and would effortlessly drift past players not so much using speed of foot, more just speed of thought. Moyes seemed to try and turn him into a bale type kick and run winger, hugging the touchline and not so much drifting inside like he did at first.

Thankfully he's gone and Van Gaal can properly develop him now. Just hope januzaj keeps his head on his shoulders and doesn't think he's a star already.

18~~~
To be honest I thought he was fairly brilliant playing either way.

19~~~
He's a good player but I'm not expecting too much of him. He's still lacking in pace a little bit and because of this, I see him more as a #10. I feel Nani, Valencia and Mata are more effective than him on the wing. And without turning this into a comparison thread, I'd rather play Zaha on the wing as I feel he's a natural winger who has more to offer in that position.

Januzaj would rather pass it through than cross. I don't think he can accelerate past players either.

20~~~
Did you watch us at all last season? Januzaj was well able to beat a player and was probably our most efficient crosser as it actually reached one of our players.. He is miles ahead of Zaha and probably all our wingers at the moment. Not every winger relies on pace in order to be effective.

21~~~
He did really well either way I'm not saying he was poor (though he was more quiet after January for sure), but for future development I think he'd have more potential and room to grow if he played like he did at the start.

22~~~
Don't mind me, fixed your post a little bit because I sometimes forget to add some vital things to my posts too.

23~~~
The Januzaj doesnt has pace thing is made up by ignorant people, if you dont believe it just watch Youtube, simple. The way he beats players and dashes past them, the assists for Hernandez vs Aston Villa for example is a good one. He doesnt rely on pace, that doesnt mean that he doesnt have it.

24~~~
My favourite kind of wingers are pacey. Everyone else strikes me as a CAM playing out of position. Januzaj can beat a player with the dribbling but I've never seen him accelerate away. 

I like Adnan as much as anybody but he has flaws in his game. Lets not act like he's perfect. He's still young but he's not better than Nani or Valencia IMO.

25~~~
I hope he's kept and developed as a top winger and not converted to a #10. The game is littered with #10s at the moment and it'll be great to have a truely amazing wide player at OT once again.

26~~~
No chance mate!

27~~~
I'm defending him, what are you attacking me for? I said he does not rely on pace, I never said he did not possess it but it's certainly not his main attribute. Zaha is probably quicker but is far from the player Januzaj is.

28~~~
He is a lot better than Nani and Valencia at the moment, does not mean he is perfect which nobody claims here by the way. He was extremely consistent for his age and was by far our most productive player out wide. If Valencia and Nani are so called better, well then it's time they regain their form and actually start playing like they feckin belong here, cause they are seriously annoying me with their below average performances.

29~~~
Sorry mate, it was supposed to be a reply for Jason.

30~~~
Januzaj looked so good cause our side looked so crap. And that was due to David Moyes and his poor tactics and motivation. Januzaj doesn't know what its like to play under anyone else, so he shined. 

Nani and Valencia have much more in their arsenal than Januzaj does. Januzaj can also lose possession and give the ball away easily and that's down to inexperience.

31~~~
Terrible assessment!

32~~~
They do ya <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Valencia is probably known as the most predictable winger in the premier league.

I also forgot, Nani never loses possession, thanks for reminding me. Oh no wait he does.. A lot actually. I have a sneaky feeling you don't watch a lot of our football because your opinions and claims are bizarre to say the least.

33~~~
Ya mean the whole world.

34~~~
Nani and Valencia were <b>shit</b> under Fergie for his last 1.5 or 2 seasons.

At that moment, only traits that Valencia ( doesn't apply to Nani ) has over Januzaj is pace and maybe defensive workrate. That's all. Januzaj's got better everything else. Same applies for Nani. On top of that, he's got bags of potential and those two wingers we're talking about are simply old compared to him.

35~~~
I really do hope you're trying to be funny.

36~~~
Yet you think Bebe is potentially world class?  That's right, I read up on  some of your history and some of your posts are quite bizarre to say the least!  But everyone is entitled to their opinion...you're wrong though! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

37~~~
Then I'm sorry but you're just not watching carefully enough. He accelerated past people loads of times last season. He's very pacy when he turns it on.

38~~~
Valencia also has better crossing and better strength. Nani also has better crossing and plenty more tricks up his sleeve AND a better shot on him. 

Januzaj can develop into a good winger but he's only young. To say he is one of our best players already is a little insulting IMO and it makes us look a bit shite. He is only 18 afterall. What does that say about our team if an 18 year old boy can walk in and be better than everyone else? Besides that, it's just not true. I get the hype and everything about him, but he's not one of our best players. Not <b>yet</b>.

39~~~
If we can keep Januzaj fit he will hurt teams this year. I have no doubt that we have a special player at the club. I felt the same when I seen Cristiano's debut against Bolton. It's a very exciting time in my opinion. Januzaj has shown as much promise if not more in his first season. I think LVG will develop him further this year. Obviously it takes a long time to reach the level of CR7. Some of the comments about lacking pace is mind blowing. I wonder sometimes if people watch the games or just match of the day. Signing Mata and getting his contract renewed were the only positive things about last season. Adnan is only 19 and is going to bring the club some special moments, wait and see<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

40~~~
I'm still waiting on your excuse for stating in another thread that you thought Bebe had the potential to be world class, yet you heap so much criticism on Adnan...please elaborate because I don't think people are taking you seriously and maybe thinking you are wumming.

41~~~
There will never be another Cristiano. As much as the fans and media want there to be. Most of Januzaj's hype comes from Ronaldo's hype and I don't agree with it at all. There is almost no similarities in the two besides their age and birthday. Two completely different players.

42~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgI56dEUmxo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He goes past players like they're not even there but yet he lacks pace. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Januzaj's worst performance last season was most likely better than what Nani, Young and Valencia produced week in week out.

43~~~
I honestly think Jason is winding us up. Every post of his is bizarre to say the least. Absolutely nobody would agree with him on most of the stuff he comes up with, namely "valencia has more in his arsenal than Januzaj". Positively bonkers.

44~~~
Adnan is praised on the regular where-as Bebe is not. I think Adnan can become a good player but I'm not expecting him to be the next Ronaldo like some people are. 

Bebe has potential to atleast be on the same level as Hulk and become a starter for Portugal. Infact, I think he can be better than Hulk if he fulfills his potential. I gaurantee he will go for more than we sell him for this season, in a few years time.

45~~~
Read his history..Bebe has the potential to be world class is a classic of his...Serious or idiot?

46~~~
I don't want to be a dick, but... this 2014 intake... <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

47~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Feck off!!!!

48~~~
A good challenge for him will be to replicate the same kind of form that Sterling displayed over the course of last season. Both were very impressive in the early stages, but Januzaj tailed off as the season progressed and Sterling went on an upward trajectory towards the end and was frequently a better performer than any of his Liverpool teammates - Suarez included. Our wonderkid needs to add consistency and some aspects of his game are extremely progressive, even if he still quite raw. I do think his improvement could be immense next season, but a lot may depend of which system LVG decides to deploy.

49~~~
Januzaj only looked good because the others were bad, Nani and Valencia are both better players than Januzaj, Valencia has better crossing than Januzaj and Bebe will become world class. feck me.

50~~~
If Januzaj is so good then why did Valencia start over him in the big games last season? I also suspect that LVG will think the same and play Nani, Valencia and Mata over Januzaj on the wings.

51~~~
No, I think he's a world class troll. Ive caught him contradicting himself constantly... He loves the attention.

52~~~
No, Valencia doesn't have better crossing for good two or three years now, his 'crossing' nowadays is about slamming it at opponent's legs with a 'low cross'. Agree about strength but for love of God, we're not Manchester Lifting United but a fecking football club so what's the use of strength when the skill is close to none?

Same applies for Nani, he's <b>had</b> a better shot, tricks and crossing about him. Those skills disappeared under Ferguson and were non-existant under Moyes as well. Is Januzaj one of our best players? No idea, there are players better than him but it was him who shined last season while Nani and Valencia kept burying their chances. Januzaj, as for now, is easily our best winger. What is says about current state of our wingers is another thing, it's a well known fact that we're incredibly poor in that department too.

53~~~
If you're really that dense to ask something like that then no matter what answer I give you, you wont have the ability to understand it anyway.

54~~~
Comedy Gold on Saturday Night <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

55~~~
That is the same argument that scousers use to say that Gerrard was better than Scholes, i.e. that because Scholes was pushed onto the wing for England (by an ignorant manager), whereas Gerrard started at CM, Gerrard MUST have been better...

What you are saying is that, because <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>David </b></span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Moyes</span></b> played Valencia over Januzaj in the big matches (which is not even true), he must have been better.

It is poor logic.

56~~~
If you ask any top manager in the world "Who would you rather play against Bayern Munich or Barcelona - Valencia or Januzaj?", I gaurantee they would pick Valencia. You're basing your opinion off pure hype and not actual football. Valencia has more to his game than Januzaj does, anyone with a tactical footballing brain can see that. 

Januzaj is all potential, he hasn't fully developed yet. Valencia hasn't had the best of seasons but he's much more secure and the things he excels in, Januzaj hasn't got...

57~~~
God he's good. You forget when you haven't watched him play for a while.

I know it's fashionable to expect that LVG is going to do absolutely everything better than Moyes, but I actually think Januzaj is the one thing that Moyes got just right last season. Firstly, he convinced him to sign the contract. Then he got him plenty of football without overplaying him or letting the hype get too out of control. He got him playing with confidence, freedom and individuality. He made a fuss about the rough treatment Adnan was getting and the lack of protection from the referees (whether it changed anything is hard to say, but it's exactly what Fergie would have done.) He played him in a range of different roles, which showed off how many different things he is excellent at.

It does make you a bit paranoid that something will go wrong, having a youngster that good. A horror injury or a falling-out with Van Gaal or not fitting into his system or whatever. Because if he can avoid those things I really do think he has what it takes to be amongst the world's best one day.

EDIT: Just ignore jason93, lads. He's either WUMming or so dense that there's no point arguing.

58~~~
There never will be a CR7 fair enough, he achieved incredible heights with the club. However, to say there are no similarities with Januzaj is just ridiculous. I completely disagree with you. Ronaldo developed his game over the years, especially his heading ability on goal. Adnan has had better end product in his first year compared to CR7. If we are comparing there break through seasons, Januzaj has been more impressive imo. Cristiano worked hard to be the unstoppable machine he is today. There is no reason why Adnan can't be the best around in 5 years. The media do like hype but in such a difficult season he left a big impression, it's well deserved. He will shine at Old Trafford this year.

59~~~
Januzaj last season was not better than Ronaldo in his first season. No way. Stats don't mean anything when it's obvious who the better player was. Ronaldo was much more exciting and unpredictable to watch. The entire stadium got on their feet when he was on the ball.

60~~~
He's a natural #10 and has been for most of his life until last season. He's still great on the wing though and will play there for a couple of more years.

61~~~
If there's one united youngster capable of thriving under the new manger, surely it's this lad. His favoured position is No 10, but where do we see him long term?  (Not Madrid).

62~~~
I kinda forget about Januzaj, he was barely used at the WC. Can't wait to see him in the upcoming season, he's going to be world class one day.

63~~~
Well that's your opinion man. I'm not convinced how well you remember it though? Considering you were 10 at the time. How many performances did you see fully that year. There is really no argument here. I love Cristiano, he's in my top 3 players of all time at the club. Januzaj was as good as CR7 was in his the first year, end of.

64~~~
I remember it fondly and I can still look back and admire the talent of Ronaldo in his first season. He set the Premier League alight with his style of play and trickery. Januzaj hasn't done that. End of.

65~~~
I love this kid but I felt like he got more and more careless with the ball as last season wore on. It's a fine line between fearless and reckless. That's one area I think he can really improve, hopefully our midfield and coaching upgrades will help him accomplish that.

66~~~
A better comparison with Januzaj would be Kaka rather than Cristiano Ronaldo. The way he glides pasts players reminds me so much of Kaka and also his balance and poise while running at full speed is eerily similar to Kaka. Januzaj has the vision that Ronaldo never had. If he becomes anywhere as good as Kaka was, I would be happy. Hope Van Gaal bloods him in and he can have a breakout season similar to Muller's 09/10 season at Bayern. Januzaj is also more versatile than most of our attackers, he can play behind the striker and on both the flanks so I hope he gets utilized more the likes of Young and Valencia.

I would rather see him on the flanks rather than the no 10 position for certain reasons. You need to be more tactically accomplished to play the No 10 role with the ability to consistently find pockets of space and always making yourself available for a pass, ala David Silva. I don't think Januzaj has the experience or the tactical nous to do it just yet. While he has brilliant vision and creativity, he doesn't seem to do it consistently enough. He has good pace and is a great dribbler, so it would make sense to use him out wide given the horrendous state of our wingers. I would prefer to see either Mata or Kagawa in the No 10 role for now though.

Remember this pass anyone? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/77288527" width="500"></iframe>

67~~~
I'm actually worried for Adnan this season. If United stays with the 3-4-3 as we saw it against LA, then Mata will have the 10 spot and Adnan will be coming off the bench or starting League Cup matches surely. Was hoping he'd be a sure starter this year.

68~~~
Wouldn't be worried about Adnan at all. If anything, I think he'll relish the increased competition and work harder to win a spot.  Plus injuries and dips in form are inevitable. He's far more talented than many in our current squad and we know LVG loves young players+wants a squad size reduction. I don't think we'll see him play quite as much as last year (fewer games to go around) but I think he will get that chance to shine

69~~~
When is he scheduled to return from his holidays?

70~~~
I believe he will be utilized like how Van Gaal utilized Depay for Holland if we go with the 1-3-4-3/1-5-3-2 system. His gametime might not be as much if most of our players are fit. I expect a season where he will be very impactful coming of the bench.

71~~~
Wouldn't be surprised if he gets a couple of games next to RVP/Rooney up front to be honest.

72~~~
He can play as one of the forwards in the same way Robben and RVP play with Sneijder behind them.

73~~~
Should be deputy to Mata this season. I'd love to see him be primarily used as a 10, as that's his real position. Him and Herrera could produce some outstanding football in the coming season when played together. As good a player mata is I still think signing him while we have him coming through wasn't the best of decisions.

74~~~
Does he have the vision, composure and technique to pull off the passes and link up play required in the number 10 role? So far we've seen him bomb up and down the wing without much end product.

75~~~
If that's all you saw you weren't paying enough attention.

76~~~
Primarily yes. Didn't see nearly enough from him to convince me he's a backup number 10 to fecking Mata.

77~~~
Yes. If anything that was his major asset in the reserves. Before he grew recently he relied on his passing a lot, only recently has he started trying to take people on more regularly IMO.

78~~~
The answer is yes for me, and I'm sure many others. I don't think he's the type of player who "bombs up and down the wing". There may have been a hint of that in his play when his form dipped towards the end but before that he was one of the most composed teenagers I've ever seen. His technique is probably one of the best in the squad. And I've seen enough of his vision to not have any worries about that either tbh.

79~~~
Those are his strengths. He's probably the best technician we have in the team. Bombing up and down the wing just isn't his game, ofcourse he did a good job out there but the norwich match should've showed everyone what he's really about.

80~~~
Who would be back up then? Kagawa?

81~~~
If anything I see more Zidane in Januzaj than Ronaldo.

82~~~
Yes, followed by Adnan. Kagawa, like Mata will be far more effective in their best position, number 10.

83~~~
That's what his game used to be about for the youth team. It wasn't until the first team and the start of last season's few reserve matches where he really started to go after defenders. He would still do some dribbles occasionally before then, but most of his impressive play came from his creativity, composure, and technique.

This is from the u21 final 2013
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/i4qcU6AeTRiWE.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/i4qcU6AeTRiWE.gif"/>

He did a very similar pass against the Spurs last season as well which ended up as an assist. It's a shame his entire performance in that final wasn't uploaded on youtube. He was really class that day.

You already saw a glimpse of what he could do behind the striker in the Cup match against Norwich. He was really good that day.

84~~~
The point remains that coming inside from a wing position, he can do both things. In any given moment, he can come inside and do what a #10 would do, or bomb down the outside and do what a winger would do. Given that he is excellent at both things, that approach makes him a much more unpredictable and dangerous player.

85~~~
His assist to RvP in his first (I think?) game was another beautifully weighted/timed pass. His most obvious quality has always been his ability to pick a pass in and around the box. He's basically the complete opposite of a kick and run merchant with no end product.

86~~~
any idea when he's joining up with the rest of the team? i imagine at the same time as fellaini, but i don't know when that is either, and frankly, nobody cares about fellaini.

87~~~
januzaj and fellaini trained at carrington today.

neither will be joining the others on tour. hopefully this delayed holiday won't hurt adnan's chances to impress the new boss.

88~~~
I'm sure Januzaj will get at least 45 minutes of football on our last pre-season game against Valencia.

89~~~
In this system, Adnan should be a backup forward along with Welbeck, he shouldn't get ahead of Shinji as a backup for Mata right.

Besides I'm sick of every talented young kid saying they are a number 10. It's the fashionable position to be good at, then it takes managers years to convince the player that they are actually a striker or a winger etc.

90~~~
Agreed. He's a decent as a #10 but best as a wide AM/winger. Shame this system doesn't actually have wingers.

91~~~
Januzaj will be a shoe in for the number 10, especially when counter attacking. He's more dynamic than Mata and he has a good eye for pass. For now though he can play the forward role if necessary, but I think Welbeck will be 3rd choice for that.

92~~~
I guarantee that those who say Adnan isn't a good number ten haven't seen him play in that role for more than 45 minutes. Because for United, he hasn't.

93~~~
He has a few times (and done excellently).

94~~~
Alright if i think long hard about it... Most of the Capital One Cup match against Norwich, 45 minutes against Swansea... And a few minutes against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Maybe as a 10 against Sunderland in first leg of COC?

Those were actually mostly good performances too.

95~~~
I don't think anyone in their right mind would say he's not a good #10. But personally I think he's twice as dangerous from a wide starting position. Because that way he can still choose to come inside with the ball and do anything a #10 would do, but he <i>also</i> has the option of dribbling past his man like a winger. Makes him so much harder to defend against.

And just to fend off the potential 'have you even watched him do X, Y and Z', I've watched every minute he's played for the club since we signed him.

96~~~
Hasn't he played there against Norwich in the League Cup??

I think his best position is 100% as No.10

97~~~
I pretty much agree with that too.

98~~~
Yup, i redacted.

99~~~
I thought he played as a 10 for longer against both Swansea and Chelsea. As I said whenever he has played as a 10 for us he has shone so I can't understand how people can't see that it's his best position and where he will end up playing for most of his career.

100~~~
Even on the strength of three full games I'd be wary about saying its where he'll finish his career.

I think part of the problem for me was that he doesn't fit the mould of number 10s right now, so doesn't fit into the preconceived ideas I have for a number 10. I very much think of Mata/Ozil/Fabregas when I think of number 10s. However Pogue mentioned last season that Kaka was a good example of a a much more direct, upright number 10 whose strength was running with the ball, shooting and crossing rather than lots of dinky one-twos on the edge of the D. That kind of helped things click for me, albeit I still need to see him do it on a regular basis to make my mind up.

101~~~
I think he'd be fine at #10, and even as a second striker upfront. He could play similar to how Robben did at the world cup when partnering RvP.

102~~~
Ozil and Kaka are the two number 10's he reminds me most of. With Ozil it is probably a lot to do with both players being left footed and they also have a similar ability to pick a pass in tight situations. He reminds me of Kaka with his acceleration and ability to beat a player, something Ozil lacks.

103~~~
I would agree with this only if he played on the right. I thought he was always better on the right wing for the reserves. The rw and the #10 make better use of his reliance on his left foot than the left wing unless you want crosses.

104~~~
I like him on either side, I just think it depends on what you want from him in that particular match. He's so two-footed that he's almost as good at beating a man and getting to the byline on the right as he is on the left. The one thing he does better from the left is those wicked crosses, so if you're looking for him to provide real width, then he should be on the left. But he offers pretty much the whole package from the right, so for the majority of matches I agree that should be his wing.

This is his real strength though, which not enough people recognise. He's good at pretty much <i>everything. </i>Lovely passer, brilliant dribbler, pacy, good crosser, clever in tight spaces, can kick and run if you give him the space to do it in, can assist and finish. That's why I think #10 limits him too much - a wide starting position gives him more of a free role, to do whatever he wants with.

105~~~
I'm not saying he's not good there, I'm saying it's not his best position.

106~~~
I feel like in his absence on tour people have quietly forgotten just how good he was last season, and stopped factoring him into their expectations/hopes for this season a little. To remedy that:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEtzCL6e4co?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6pKBDPHtZw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Now this is at risk of becoming my tagline, but for me he's not simply a #10. It's indicative of how uniquely gifted he is that he's probably amongst the top three young #10s in the world. But he's also probably amongst the top three young wingers too.

And if a player can do <i>both</i> things that well, you start them from a wide position. That's a no-brainer, because it's the only way to give him the chance to use all aspects of his game in any given situation. If you receive the ball in a central position, you have to use it from a central position. But if you receive the ball out wide, you can <i>choose</i> to either take a run at your fullback, <i>or</i> to come inside and do what a #10 would do. When you have a young player who is one of the best in the world at both things, you want him to be able to do either, because that's what will make him not just world-class, but a world-beater. Which Januzaj definitely has the potential to be.

So for me, there's no place for him in the 3412, and that's a problem. As I say, you're wasting half of his ability if you just view him as a standard #10, and besides he's not going to get in there ahead of perhaps the league's best specialised #10, Mata. I've heard some people suggesting he could be one of the two strikers, playing a role a little like Welbeck has been so far. It's a decent suggestion, but again you risk limiting him badly. Yes, he could probably do that as well as most players, and his finishing is another very strong part of his game. But it's going to keep him away from the areas where he can do the most damage, those in-between spots where #10s and wide AMs play and are so hard to mark.

Call it an overreaction, but for me the fact that Januzaj doesn't have a place in the 3412 is enough reason on its own for us to try and change to something else as soon as possible. You could argue that Rooney was the outfield player who made the biggest contribution for us last season, but in terms of value added per minute on the pitch, Januzaj was <i>leagues</i> ahead of everyone else. And this was an 18-year-old on his debut season in a side in near-meltdown. I see no reason why getting him in his best position shouldn't be just as important as getting Mata, Rooney and RVP in theirs.

Anyway, feel free to ignore my rambling and just bask in the sheer awesomeness of those highlights.

107~~~
Van Gaal will probably play him as a 7 in a 4231 plenty this season.

108~~~
He's never once said we'll play that way though.

109~~~
Someone asked him recently if we were going to play 352 all pre-season and he said we would because he wanted the team to get used to it. But iirc there was the implication that 352 wouldn't be the only formation we're using, otherwise he would have just said 'that's the formation and all we will play' rather than suggesting we'd only see that formation in pre-season for the sake of familiarity.

110~~~
The top tree wingers in the whole world? Man United? Top 3 young wingers? Januzaj one of the best at both things? He was really good as a winger but I dont think he was one of the best with doing things from a central position. Agree with you for the rest.

111~~~
he ideally wants to play 4-3-3 if he has the personnel, but he's never mentioned playing 4-2-3-1 i don't think.

112~~~
Not advocating his claim, but who are generally considered the biggest wing-talents these days? (U21)

113~~~
Sterling and Januzaj?

114~~~
where would he play in a 352, i cant see him starting unless theres injuries. would he take a forward slot as a sub?

115~~~
Sterling, Januzaj, Depay, Berardi (different type of wide player)

116~~~
Sterling, Januzaj, Chamberlain, Draxler, Heung ming Son, Depay, Fischer, Deulofeu, Jese Rodriguez, Lucas, Bruma, Shaarawy, Iturbe.

117~~~
Jese, Draxler.

118~~~
<a class="username" data-user="68962, @Brightonian" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/68962/">@Brightonian</a> It's not <i>necessarily</i> true that he wouldn't be able to use his full range of skills in the middle. There's this from a few years ago (none of the pictures seem to work now, unfortunately): <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/12/03/introducing-the-central-winger/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/12/03/introducing-the-central-winger/</a>

119~~~
We are just a top CM and a CB away from being able to play van gaal's 4-3-3, probably. 
 Anyway i beleive adnan is going to benefit playing under van gaal,regardless of any role he is given.van gaal loves talented young players and adnan should join the illustrious names that progress under van gaal.

120~~~
We'd need a winger more IMO. Van Gaal specified when he talked about that in a recent interview that he'd need to buy a winger pretty much by saying that there, his specialist players are the wingers so he'd need to buy players. We only have Januzaj who is adept as an attacking winger these days, and he's only 19.

121~~~
Some people have been claiming that his 433 is just a 4231, sorry for the confusion, whichever.

122~~~
........wtf
Come on guys. He is better then all your wingers, Mata, and so on already? I get stick for it on a United forum but I just cant believe how many long loving and smart football fans are getting carried away here.
Are there any other places in the world then United ones where he is talked about like this?
The English media need new superstars as fast as they can get them. And so they made much more buzz about a "savior" kid then it deserved for his first season(hell,after 10 games he got hyped up).
Sorry guys; that he got more money in his last month as a 18year old then Ronaldo and Messi(18 years old in 2004/06;since then a step up with the money in world football) means nothing in the money buried PL of 2013.
He is great and could become a monster but if you look at the numbers; he is close to 20 and what did he do till today? Lets see what he does this season.

123~~~
It seems you fail to comprehend the difference between comparing a player's skill-set to another player and actually claiming he is at the same level. He meant he plays <b>like </b>Zidane, doesn't mean he is at the same level which nobody would dare to claim. Of course he feckin isn't, would be daft to even suggest that.

124~~~
He's a better player than Young, Nani and Valencia, yes. Nothing over the top about that statement. Mata, no. Obviously.

125~~~
Coming from the guy who a month ago was claiming Gotze is the best player in the world and maybe eventually all time greatest.

126~~~
Of course he's better than all of our wingers. He can dribble better than them, is better at passing, provides better set pieces, and so on. Mata is a number 10 and will play there so I'm not including him.

He still has 6 months until he's 20 years old, and about 3 months was the off season. What was he supposed to accomplish in the 3 months as a 19 year old? The fact that he did what he did at 18 years old under Moyes, the guy who made almost every player on the team have their worst seasons in their career is impressive. Take any young player right now and play them under Moyes and I fail to see how they have a better season under him than whoever was their coach this past season.

127~~~
It is always good to offer a different opinion, I too think the hype has gotten out of control a little.

128~~~
Yep. He is better than all our wingers. 

And the "buzz" was made because he's actually that talented.

I personally don't see much difference between him and Ronaldo when he was a teenager. I'm talking about level and not style of course. 

That doesn't mean he'll become as good. Ronaldo was a freak and I doubt a United player will match him for possibly decades.

129~~~
Who has been hyping him to "out of control" levels? Did you think the guy who made the Zidane comment was talking about the level of performances, or type of footballer?

130~~~
We'll be lucky if we ever have a player better than Ronaldo, any team will.

131~~~
Agree.

132~~~
WTF ?

1st Bolded Part :

There are other places in the world where he's talked about like this. Gazetta dello Sport made their annual list of the best teenage talents in Europe and Januzaj came in at #1. Over Marquinhos and Deulofeu and Bakkali and Berardi. So it's not just United fans/ English media going over the top and hyping players. I understand it's a very hip argument but if you look at the last few years - many European connoisseurs of football didn't rate Bale or Modric and they're among the best in the world now. Hell a United reserve from 2 seasons ago is one of the if not the best midfield talent of his generation despite having the same questions asked of him. Also back in the day Ronaldo faced the same criticisms (not as good as Figo, one trick pony, overhyped by United fans). Look how that turned out.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://api.ning.com/files/OQbVc*b-KB86RnSqBAfNN2lc0EgPlFBNw04LiiGvTU74Fq25kX-EcIcAVn3Zeox*t-taDkm7oWwO6VdfR6MvGXwmxZw-okic/gazzettajanuzaj.PNG" src="http://api.ning.com/files/OQbVc*b-KB86RnSqBAfNN2lc0EgPlFBNw04LiiGvTU74Fq25kX-EcIcAVn3Zeox*t-taDkm7oWwO6VdfR6MvGXwmxZw-okic/gazzettajanuzaj.PNG"/>

2nd Bolded Part :

Who claimed him earning more matters ? Why make up absurd arguments ? No one claimed he's better because he's earning more.

3rd Bolded Part :

We are making projections of how he may turn out based on the data and eye-test we have till now. Is that not allowed ?

By the dame adage what was Zidane doing when he was Januzaj's age ? He's not 20. He's 19 and all we're going is speculation. No one is claiming he'll end up being exactly like Zidane but you look at players of his age group and he's right up there :

In 26 league appearances (12 as sub) Januzaj scored 4 and assisted 4 despite playing through our worst patches of form under a terrible manager who didn't know to fully utilize attacking talents, playing all over the midfield as a 10, 7, 11, in an attacking wide forward 3 and showed quality in each position, and also he was shunned from January to April by the manager that led to voided months.

In 25 league appearances (15 as a sub) Deulofeu scored 3 and assisted 3 despite playing for a much better manager (atleast in an attacking sense) and a club in much better form. This is probably the best U-21 attacking talent in Spain right now and Januzaj was superior to him in the same league. Januzaj created more chances per 90 minutes and made more key passes than Gerard too.

In 30 league appearances (9 as a sub) Meyer (compared by many to be a talent almost equal to anchan darling Gotze) scored 6 and assisted 3 in a weaker league and playing mostly though the centre where it's easier to get involved in the play.

These are his peers and Adnan is as good if not better despite the previous manager's poor tactics and the general negativity surrounding United. And it's not just statistics. If you look closely at United's matches from last season he was the best attacking outlet for large parts of the season, his decision making was extremely mature for a player his age and he made so many important passes leading up to goals.

133~~~
it was a shame he didn't get much opportunity at the world cup. 

we kind of forget what a special talent adnan is. most of the time when he was playing for us last season, he was regurlary one of our best performer. if there is a young player that could benefit from having LVG as the manager, i think adnan is the one.

it is easy to compare him to cristiano because of this united connection but i kind of agree there is more of a kaka in adnan than cristiano. cannot wait to see how he develops under van gaal.

134~~~
The 'Zidane' comment was pretty obvious to follow so no worries.

But IMO the media and some fans went overboard with praise for Januzaj last season.

Simple!

135~~~
Top three young wingers, obviously.

136~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

He got hyped after ten games because he ripped apart every defence put in front of him in those ten games, despite being an 18-year-old debutant in a struggling team, with world class players like Rooney and Van Persie struggling to have the sort of impact Januzaj did. Which also answers your point about him 'not having done anything'. He's done a good deal more than almost any other 19-year-old I can think of at a top club.

He's not on that much money, and what would that have to do with it anyway?

United fans rate him because United fans have watched him play. It's that simple. Obviously whoever posted the Zidane comment was talking (wrongly, for me) about his style of play, not his level of ability. Keep up.

137~~~
The whole 'English fans and the English media hype people out of proportion' line is absurdly tired. Anyone with eyes in their head can see that Januzaj is one of the best players of his age in world football at the moment. Plenty of foreign pundits and media have rated him very highly.

138~~~
I have no clue where he is supposed to play in the 5-3-2 system. I guess as the second striker. He will have to improve immensively I fear if he is going to get a chance there.
If we switch back to 4-3-3 he can get easily in but with that new system things will get hard for him.

139~~~
He is a great talent, but didnt do enough to be Nr 1 there. They just went with the new hyped name.
Max Meyer played in the Cl with 17, had nearly a full great year under his belt and is 27? And a guy who played a bit here and there is Nr 1?
This list is just for show. Look, I dont hate him, I dont hate United. Its just too much in my eyes.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I never ever said that he is the greatest. He could become the best ever, yes.
Is 22 for the next season and look at his career so far. 
What he did with 18/19, that was and would be worth such a hype. But a great talent who got a bit game time here and there? 
No.

Im out. Just dont put so much pressure on him. Its getting way overboard.

140~~~
Gotze might be the most overrated and overhyped player of all time, although he's the German sweetheart at the moment so they won't allow you to say anything negative about him. Also, he's calling us out for Januzaj but it is <i>nothing </i>compared to what the Munich fans say about Mario, it's so cringy.

141~~~
In our 2012/2013 U21 league winning team Januzaj played a large chunk of the season up top, sort of as a false 9. Van Gaal might see this as a way of getting him in he team as well as a no. 10. Obviously there is a lot of competition for the striker positions.

142~~~
Are you really comparing a guy who won 8! trophies(3 international ones, a world cup!!), was one of the leading players on the way to a CL final(most Cl assists that season of ANYONE) and the MVP of the eventually German champion for the second part of the season with 18! in one of the best leagues on the planet with one who had 1! season where he got a bit of game time?
I understand anyone who goes crazy about Mario. You should look at his scorer numbers, which are better then Messis age 18 to 20 and so on.
Oh no. Im out here. Its getting stupid.

143~~~
Meyer got to play so much because he didn't have Mata and Rooney to compete against. Once Mata came to United, Januzaj's minutes died. I agree that the list's rankings aren't well put though. Sterling should be ranked #1.

144~~~
Just curious. Have you watched him consistently over the past season where he outperformed many of his more experienced and seasoned players (with plenty of caps and trophies) who couldn't take games by the scruff of the neck like he did. He is one of the greatest talents in the EPL let alone the world and I am not over-hyping him up. We have seen plenty of youngsters over the years and he really is special. The very fact that he is unfazed and can take on the responsibility of being a key player for a big team shows his mentality. His technique and quality is in no doubt as well, he really will have a great future unless he experiences injury troubles or due to other circumstantial factors.

145~~~
He's going to be sat on the bench a lot this season. Mata's backup or an option from the bench when we switch formation.
Bit of a shame really but not being overplayed may do the youngster good.

146~~~
Your love for Gotze is apparent but take a chill pill, he's not comparing the two. Gotze had very good early years at Dortmund, bar his WC final goal he's been fairly shite for both Bayern and Germany this year, in fact had Reus not been injured he probably wouldn't have got a game.

147~~~
Why is that relevant ? So Meyer played in the CL at 17 ? Is that some kind of grand achievement ? It's much much harder to break into United's squad (now just to be clear United isn't a mid-table team or a Top 4 team even). With Fergie our aim was always the #1 league spot so the competition for places was intense. That's why it takes longer for players to break into our starting XI or even get on the fringes compared to clubs like Schalke. It speaks volumes that he was on the bench at 18 for Fergie's last game. As I pointed out before, even Pogba (World Cup best young player winner, Golden boy winner, U-20 World Cup golden ball winner) made just 7 sub appearances before his 19th birthday. That definitely shows how tough it is to even start at United.

And you gotta help me out on the 27 and full great year part.. It doesn't make much sense to me.

Look at Adnan's matches closely and it becomes clear why he's so highly rated. The lists aren't just for show. They must've put some thought into into it...

148~~~
Yeah. Crazy strong United team last season. Where did they finish?
And to Meyer; I assumed that the paper came out at the end of the 2013/14 season(if not Adnan place would be even crazier) and so Meyer, who was in his first full season, was nearly a full year in the top level. And I just saw your little ranking of their assists and goals.
Nice one. Meyer is much more then that. He builts up play on the 10.
He rocked the U17 euros with 16 in 2012, was crazy good in the youth leagues in West Germany. Those are the best of the country,which is praised for its youth work and so on. Meyer is also younger then Adnan.

That is a nice myth. He has around the same scorers for Bayern as Neymar had for Barca. And with injury problems, Bayerns team depth and the fact that he had big pressure with 21 years 30 scorers are fine with me.
Played the 120 minutes in the German cup final against Dortmund.
And bad for Germany? Made scorers in the few games in the second part of 2013,then he scored 3 or 4 goals in the games before the WC, the winner against the great Chile side. Then he had a great group stage(Kicker, who are way to negative on German players gave him high marks).
He was very bad against Algeria, I agree. That cost him 2 games. But who cares. Everyone has a bad game, specially a 22 year old at a WC.
He won the final and everyone will remember that.

His last season was good overall. I take that in a new team, with injuries and a coach, who is a bit crazy sometimes.
But back to Adnan in this thread.

149~~~
Germany were always going to win the world cup, their squad was miles better than anyone's from every 11 spot to the bench and they would've won without Gotze, he only played 90 minutes once and was a sub for the rest. As for Bayern he was pretty much invisible against tough opposition in Europe and in the German league Bayern could've won it with 10 men, grant it I didn't watch one of their league games I'm not going to rate him in a league Bayern won several weeks before hand, Anderson could've came out of that team with similar stats. 

Don't get me wrong though I'm not saying he's shite, he's clearly young and talented he's just no where near as good as some people make him out to be.

150~~~
Ok, Im finally out now. This post is as wrong, onesided and <i>accidentally</i> funny as a haters post can be.

151~~~
Well he keeps saying that SAF played a 4-3-3, so maybe he does mean 4-2-3-1, because SAF very rarely played a 4-3-3.

152~~~
I don't hate him at all <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> , he's probably the most likeable German &  he's the first player I buy in Fifa <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

153~~~
This pretty much sums up exactly what I was talking about. Bless you.

154~~~
Who did Meyer compete against to play behind the striker at Schalke? Boateng? Certainly no one as good as Rooney or Mata? He would be benched at United or would have to play on the wing. Whether United came in 7th or not, United have a far superior attack to Schalke. Youth level? Are you suggesting Januzaj didn't dominate at youth level?

155~~~
Doubt he is better than Sterling, AOC, Jese, Chamberlain, Lucas, Iturbe, Son

156~~~
Haha. Ok sorry mate. But your opinion are way too harsh imo. The league is great, he did fine and so on. But ok, everyone his (at least a bit realistic) pov.

157~~~
He is better than Chamberlain despite being younger & less experienced.

Iturbe (2 years older than Januzaj) had a great season in Italy this year but was not under the spotlight that Adnan was - of course, one could argue it was harder for Iturbe as he was playing with inferior players. However, outside of this one good season, Iturbe has not impressed since he was playing in Argentina. They are fairly even, but i'd still say Januzaj is the bigger prospect. Debatable one, I think Iturbe may be a great player should he develop properly. 

Lucas, who is 2 years older, still cannot justify a place in PSG's first choice team - a not-so-in-form Cavani will always start ahead of him in the right forward spot. A great prospect for sure, but they are very different players. Lucas is all about dribbling at speed, with great strength on the ball. Januzaj is much more creative & a little less direct. I think Januzaj will end up the better player, though. He has more natural talent, but that is just my opinion. Perhaps I am being harsh on Lucas as he isn't really being given much freedom at PSG - we can judge better next season.

Son, who is 3 years older & has been playing first team football for almost four years, is very good. More effective/productive than Januzaj right now, but I feel Januzaj has a higher ceiling.

Jese Rodriguez and Sterling are excellent players. Jese Rodriguez, at this current point in time, is a better player (in my opinion, many may disagree) - I can see him becoming a huge star. Sterling too - he has been extremely productive over the last year, with undeniable talent. I think these two (with Lucas) are on the same level as Januzaj, while AOC, Son & Iturbe a tier below. 

Anything can change in the future, but if you really don't think he's up there with the very best of the young wingers and attacking midfielders (the single best is a different issue, but to be in that tier, I mean), then you haven't watched him enough.

158~~~
I am not talking about ceiling, but how good they are now, the players I named above are atm better imo, but I think Sterling and Januzaj will be the 2 best eventually.

159~~~
Perhaps that's why he think Rooney can play midfield, because for him he has been playing that in a 433.

If you play the 433 with two back in midfield it's pretty darned similar to a 4231.

160~~~
Of those, only Sterling is still a teenager, like Januzaj. The rest are already 20, 21, 22.

Also, by Son do you mean Son Min Heung at Leverkusen? I reckon Januzaj is already better, and besides he's not a winger. He's an AM/support striker. 22, anyway.

So why start an argument in the first place if you basically agree? it's just nitpicking.

161~~~
What a smug post.. This isn't a dick measuring competition bro.. If you want it to be one then I guess might as well play along :

1. Nice argument and totally expected TBF. It seems the United outsiders and ABUs are failing to differentiate between United's apparent "decline" last season and the tactics of a backward coach that inhibited the attacking prowess of his squad.

2. Again why does this matter in any way or form ? Some players make early debuts. Does it mean they're going to be better than those who're 6 months late ? Scholes was a first team player at 19 like Januzaj. Iniesta wasn't a full first team regular until 20. Does it mean midfielders who started playing regular top level football at 17 or 18 were better than them ?

3. And Januzaj is just a purely a finisher I gather ? He doesn't build up play and is never involved in the lead-up to goals.. Nice one indeed.

4. Januzaj chose not to play international football until he got the call up to Belgium's senior team so there is absolutely no comparison here. Also if you want to compare Januzaj's international success in the future to player XYZ then we have to consider that it's only Belgium... And a coach like Wilmots under whom one of the Top 3 young attackers in the game Hazard looked a shadow of himself and failed to register a single goal..

<span style="font-size: 12px">5. Again players have different progression rates and potential cannot be judged solely by their performances or clinical exploits in junior age groups</span><span style="font-size: 15px">. </span><span style="font-size: 12px">Januzaj is still quite raw and physically weak so others might be more efficient in their style of play. A lot of times last season he showed traits of being a misguided virtuoso, trying to do things by himself. With time these flaws will be ironed out and from purely a technical point of view you can't find even one fault in his game. We are talking about pure talent, not how other players did better in their clubs. Yes Meyer is a very good player and barely 6 months older than Januzaj but is that conclusive evidence ?

6. A bit of a distorted comparison but you look at Podolski and Ronaldo when they were Januzaj's age. One had scored 40 goals for Cologne by the time he was 20, the other only 15 and not even considered among the best players in the league.. One was the best young player in the World Cup. The other was sent off and ridiculed to no end. Which one had a better career ? A two time Ballon D'Or winner and 4 time runner up (who was a one trick pony, "overrated" by United fans and certain quarters of the English media, would never be as good as Figo, played for a team that got dominated by Chelsea during Mourinho's first tenure) or the one who was better and more efficient at a young age ?</span>

<span style="font-size: 12px">Again we're talking about projections, not only how good they are right now but how they'll turn out to be in the future based on their skillset and ability to grow further. If you want to disagree by all means do so. But with the same measure there are loads of people who're of the opinion that he'll turn out to be a special player. You want to claim Meyer is a great talent, fine we might even agree with the assessment. But don't make ridiculous arguments that Januzaj has been overrated by United fans and English media and Gazetta or how he's only played for a team that finish 7th when he was the best U-20 player in the league last season alongwith Sterling and Shaw (another overrated United player)..</span>

162~~~
Trophies are the measurement of a good team, not an individual player

163~~~
Ye, I suppose it is pretty similar, except, in an orthodox 4-3-3, you don't really have an out and out attacking or defensive midfielder - similar to how Germany played in the WC with Khedira, Schweinsteiger and Kroos, who were always interchanging. You have a midfielder that probably does the most attacking, but not someone who will play in front of two defensive midfielders. That said, Van Gaal must just interpret it as, if you have 3 midfielders, whether they be a defensive or attacking, it's still classed as a 4-3-3.

For example:


Would all probably interpreted as a 4-3-3 by Van Gaal as there's 3 midfielders and 3 forwards.

164~~~
Fair enough, perhaps I misunderstood slightly. I still think that the likes of Son, AOC & Iturbe are not as good as Januzaj at this very moment, but I understand if some people find them better right now.

165~~~
No you said he was in the top three young wingers, not with the top 3 most talented young wingers, thats quite a difference.

166~~~
Ok... so you've still only named Sterling who's actually in the same age group as him. That's what I meant by 'young', not just any player under the age of 23.

167~~~
The original post a couple of pages back was asking about wingers under 21, so 20 or less.  Januzaj is one of the top players in that group.

168~~~
You could be right, I hope not but it is hard to see him playing that much in the 3-5-2 we've been using. On the other hand, Van Gaal has quite possibly not even met him yet, let alone see him train or actually have him available to pick. Van Gaal's inclination and ability to play and develop young players suggests he will absolutely love Januzaj, and he will also have no trouble benching bigger name players if Januzaj's form is better. We also don't know how the 3-5-2 is going to pan out, if we're going to get new signings etc. At the moment I still think there's a good chance he'll play a lot this season

169~~~
Don't think we should be worried about Januzaj. Van Gaal is wise and will find room for him.

170~~~
A tad concerned about where  he will fit in to this team given the formation we now play. In an ideal world he is part of our first choice starting XI but I wouldn't know where to slot him into this team. Competing for the number ten role with Mata or Kagawa? Or one of the front two with RvP, Rooney and Welbeck? I don't really see him as a wing back. I think he would be fine getting forward but he would have to spend a lot of time defending too which could be risky (not that he shirks his defensive responsibility, just that there would be more of an onus on defending than he's used to).

171~~~
He gets rotated and can play in any one of the front 3 positions in our current formation. At 19 that is a brilliant situation for him as I feel that last season although Moyes actually did a good job of protecting him from too many games there were still times when he looked a little jaded or slightly out of his depth. A season playing more of a supporting role will do him a world of good.

172~~~
To quote myself from the other thread.

Ofcourse he would get more game time if we played 4-3-3 but i am not worried about him even in this formation given his quality and flexibility and he's still pretty young.

173~~~
We're basically playing with a number ten, a number nine and then another player up top who has more of a free role.

Januzaj can play two of those roles really well so I'm not worried. He'll get plenty of gametime.

174~~~
Sucks that he's not learning from LVG at this very moment. Would love to see the improvement on the pitch already.

175~~~
Can't wait to see him under LvG. Our new playing style will suit him just perfectly.

176~~~
Yeah, in hindsight i wish he didnt get chosen to go to the world cup. They barely used him out there too. He willl be about 2/3 weeks behing in development compared to the rest of the team when they come back.

177~~~
I think he's going to shine under LVG. He's stepped up and answered the call at each step so far and I think he will adjust to the new style. It's tailored to players using their intelligence and he's one of the smartest we have. Not sure he can do the wingback thing quite yet but I expect him to take on that challenge. From what he know about his dad, Adnan should do well under an authoritarian like LVG

178~~~
Has he returned to training yet?

179~~~
Yes.

180~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgI56dEUmxo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Just watched this video..  this kid will be immense this year.. think he and Welbeck will rotate for the same position..

181~~~
Where can he play in LVG's system?

I don't think he'll be much of a wingback. If anything I think he'll succeed playing alongside a striker (like Robben for the Dutch), or perhaps as the #10.

182~~~
He'll end up as a striker. His career is similar to early Messi's imo.

183~~~
I've been wondering a similar thing, and someone quite convincingly pointed out that if you watch what Welbeck's been doing on the tour so far, it's not at all far from the sort of positions and contribution we'd expect from Januzaj. So I expect he could probably slot in quite nicely as the more free-ranging of the two forwards.

184~~~
I don't understand why he needed as much time off after the WC as those who played every game. Is it just because the players are entitled to a holiday? Surely he couldn't have been that physically drained, just from training and the little game time he did get. I wonder if he could he have cut his holiday time short by choice, like Shaw did?

185~~~
Absolutely. I highly doubt we'll see him as a wing back but a number of people have said he'll end up playing centrally anyway in the long-term so this could even accelerate that. I don't think he'd have any trouble playing in those attacking central roles and though he won't start the season in the side, I'm sure he'll see plenty of game time.

186~~~
19 year old kid off the back of his first season in the United first team, then the World Cup, I personally think it's best he took the holiday.

What Shaw did was admirable to come back early, but firstly Belgium went further than England so were out there longer and secondly United's season involved quite a few more games than Southampton's did. That's before we even talk about the intensity of those games.

He needed a break. It'll do him good in the long run.

187~~~
He'll get plenty of games, I'm not even remotely worried about that.

The early indications are that van Gaal wants a very balanced, streamlined squad with two players for each position. We will probably play with the 3-5-2 ninety percent of the time, so it's a question of having sufficient back-up for the forward positions. I think our wingers' futures are more in jeopardy than any other position and they will have to either convert to a new role or they're off.

I think that is what we will ultimately be looking at next season, or something along those lines. It allows van Gaal to retain and play of our most talented players in Kagawa and Januzaj with regularity still, while culling the squad accordingly and having a strong, core squad. That system should actually allow Januzaj just as much game-time as any other with RVP and Rooney often picking up injuries and our option to revert to a 4-3-3 where Januzaj will be key.

188~~~
Exactly what I was thinking. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

189~~~
the new CB will almost certainly be Vermaelen, we aren't signing a new CM so Fletcher will be first choice there with Cleverley as back up.

190~~~
LVG always liked talented young players. So I'm not worried at all about him. Once we go 4-3-3, he could also play the Robben position

191~~~
Oh, thanks for the clarification. Just the defender then Louis? Shame, I expected more.

192~~~
Fantastic post mate. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Posting this here since more people will view it than if it was in the Fellaini thread.

Not sure if this has already been discussed/shown, but here are a few snippits of interviews conducted by the Belgium team during the WC. Some of the videos are with Fellaini-Januzaj, these have mostly captioned in English. I'll just post a link to the playlist though. Ignore video 1, just an introduction, in dutch unfortunately.

Aww, look at them both, it's as if they're brothers. Which makes sence since they're both Muslim

194~~~
The Bromance is real.

195~~~
I'm not sure if there's any truth to this but it seems to be picking up pace on Twitter.

196~~~
Nailed on to get the #11?

197~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> That's like signing a life-time contract.

198~~~
I hope it's Januzaj #11.

199~~~
Shame that. Am I the only one who would have preferred him as #44?

200~~~
#7 or #11

no pressure Adnan <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

but I can't see Adnan giving the number back which ever he gets

201~~~
The #11 shirt doesn't bring much pressure compared to the #7 shirt. I hope he gets the 7 shirt, but I think he's nailed on as the #11 shirt.

202~~~
Not much of a surprise if he does get a new number, he is a first team player now. I reckon he'll get 11.

203~~~
11 is perfect. 7 for a new signing.

204~~~
Yeah, I struggle to think of who has even worn it in recent years... definitely no players of note in the grand scheme of things.

205~~~
In all seriousness, it's going to be weird seeing <i>anybody </i>else wearing that shirt.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

206~~~
Want him to get the #7

207~~~
Yeah I'd like him to stay 44 for at least 1 more season just so I could get a kit of his with 44 on it.

208~~~
And yet deep down you know it doesn't bring the same pressure as the 7 shirt. There's a reason why people want to give the 7 shirt to a marquee signing.

209~~~
Personally I really don't like seeing numbers like that on first team players. Obviously means nothing, but just looks a bit dumb. #11 or 7 look so much better and is made for him, 44 feels like something they just gave him because there was nothing else at the time, same with 47 for Wilson.

210~~~
Probably because the #11 shirt wasn't available to give to anyone for oh say the last 20 years - so it's not even been an option.

211~~~
That doesn't really matter though does it? The fact is that the 7 shirt is largely seen as the most famous United number.

212~~~
Same here. Really think academy graduates should keep their first senior squad numbers. Kind of like Bayern : Schweinsteiger 31, Lahm 21, Alaba 27, Badstuber 28, Muller 25 etc. There's just a certain charm to it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

213~~~
both would suit him, would prefer #7 myself to be honest though. I think he can deliver the goods that the #7 "demands".

214~~~
Would have been nice to see him make 44 his own and his own piece of history at the club, but not to fussed if he changes to 11 or 7 if he wants. He should be able to live up to either number

215~~~
I want him to be 11 so make it happen Man Utd.

216~~~
Would be disappointed to see him get anything else than no.7.

217~~~
I want him to get 7. He just fits the bill and he's someone who went from the u21 to the first team which makes us even more proud.

218~~~
I think 11 would be a great shirt for Januzaj. Nice for one of our own to get it after Giggsy had it all those years. People also associate the number 7 shirt with George Best but I think he wore 11 more (?). 

Also Januzaj strikes me as a player who won't wilt under the pressure of a shirt (if any such pressure exists), I reckon he's own it straight away and it'd elevate him even. He's spoken so many times about how he looks up to Giggsy and goes to him for advice etc so it's nice.

219~~~
I would love Januzaj to get the number 7 shirt. After watching Valencia desecrate that number, we need someone like Januzaj to exorcise the nightmares associated with that number.

220~~~
Adnan Januzaj #11
Arturo Vidal #7

221~~~
Yes that's why I like it. Players who make these unusual numbers there own is a fantastic thing. For example, they make it there own number. Also Kroos had 39. When I seen it on him, it looks awesome. Ballotelli at club level has 45 his own identity number. Tevez has 32. Are there any other examples of unusual numbers? 

Yeah, or perhaps get last seasons and customise it so that it says Januzaj #44 instead? 

I think it's about building there own identity, going away from the norm. Wilson 47 looks weird, but that is because I haven't seen him perform in that jersey consecutively. There's a certain charm of Januzaj #44, it's his break through number. Perhaps 10 years ago, this would have been weird. Look at Ronaldo at Sporting Lisbon, was the #28, but now he's made #7 his identity. This could be just due to temporal thing, that back then it was slightly weird to have these less used numbers.

222~~~
How will he cope taking over the number 7 shirt?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/04/article-2287977-186E7F84000005DC-384_634x504.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/04/article-2287977-186E7F84000005DC-384_634x504.jpg"/>

223~~~
Hopefully he'll get a lot of play time if he gets #11 or #7, too weird to have a number like that just sit on the bench.

224~~~
Anelka 39 
Terry 26

I agree with your views. Ronaldo was 7 from the start, Cantona, Best (though that was positional based), Robson etc. These players were brought to the club and were given the shirt number from the start. That's the way I like it.

225~~~
No idea how Valencia invalidates what Ronaldo, Cantona, etc.. did in the 7 shirt. There have been comments on here that Vidal, arguably the best midfielder on the planet, should get the 7 shirt and there have been comments that Adnan shouldn't get the 7 shirt because of the pressure it brings. It seems obvious to anyone that the 7 shirt holds the most prestige and pressure. At the same time, it's still just a number. A number won't make or break Adnan, but relative to the discussion, the 7 shirt does hold the most pressure in the eyes of most United fans.

Adnan getting either the 7 or 11 shirt would be fine by all United fans.

Not in the case of Becks

226~~~
With Becks, did he initially get 23? If so, that number looked nice on him rather than 7

227~~~
Yeah I like the comment of them players being bought and given that shirt from the start. We had #7 from the start. Some players develop a sort of psychological attachment to a number, in this case it could be #44, as this signals his breakthrough. 

What I like is that, we have both #7 & #9 available. In the norm of Football that is weird. Bit abnormal. That these common numbers are vacant. I would prefer if RvP also kept #20, just for the fact he helped get title #20. 

In Seira A, it's great to see different number jerseys being worn. ie, we see the likes of 97, 96, 92, 88. If I was to have a weird number, it would be 96, simply because of the year I was born. Some people have it like that, we see it with usernames.

228~~~
He got 24 IIRC, then 10, then 7 went Cantona retired.

229~~~
Yes. 

69 - Bixente Lizarazu (Bayern)
77 - Francesco Coco (Milan)
99 - Vitor Baia (Porto)

230~~~
Isn't 23 a popular "unusual number"

Becks, Arshavin, Carragher, Clint Dempsey and our own Jonny Evans all got this number. Total coincidence? Or are they all Michael Jordan fans?

231~~~
You stated the number 11 shirt doesn't bring much pressure when compared to the number 7 shirt, so if the number 7 is so prestigious why was it handed to Valencia? 

I think you are underestimating what status our assistant manager has given to the 11 shirt. As of now, both shirts will bring great pressure and one will not bring considerably more pressure than the other.

232~~~
Good point. Giggs has changed what the 11 shirt will mean for this club forever.

233~~~
Would it be wrong to use it jokingly in reference to number of wives shagged or ... ?

234~~~
Isn't it Cleverley with his TC23 nonsense brand and all.

EDIT: Yup our very own Cleverley
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00204/91947407_p5_204194c.jpg" src="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00204/91947407_p5_204194c.jpg"/>

235~~~
The Brazilian Ronaldo also had 99 when he was at Milan because someone else had the 9 I think

236~~~
Acceptable but you'd probably have to express it as X to the 11th power for it to be realistic.

237~~~
It's also Valencia with the AV25 nonsense brand and all.

238~~~
He'll wear it well.

239~~~
So you moved on from being Adnan'd to being Aporkalypsed now...

240~~~
He didn't have it embeded properly when I posted that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

241~~~
You are joking right? I googled the AV25 brand and all I got was internal hard drives  <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

242~~~
I reckon he'd be the last player in our squad to "brand" himself, so that does seem very unlikely. Didn't he do away with his agent a year or two back?

243~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/07/adnan-januzaj-manchester-united-paris-saint-germain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/07/adnan-januzaj-manchester-united-paris-saint-germain</a>

Agent Dirk De Vries apparently. I reckon he'll develop a brand sooner or later. Marketable face playing for the biggest football club commercially, and talented to boot. Teenage girls will flock to him. Just as long as he doesn't trademark a stupid celebration.

244~~~
Well, he's already got the stereotypical dodgy as f*ck hairstyle that those players do.

245~~~
Because of Giggs' longevity obviously, but what an honour.

Before anyone goes off on one, think before you rant. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

246~~~
Meaning players didn't have their names on the shirt until the advent of the Premier League?

* Sorry OOT JCL Glory Hunter, here.

247~~~
Thankfully I have bought his shirt yet. Now would be the time to buy.

248~~~
Sol Campbell too

249~~~
Yeah only 2 names have been above the 11 Giggs and Januzaj (if true of course), when I first read it quickly I thought "what about the others who wore it?" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

250~~~
Januzaj 11 now trending on Twitter!

251~~~
Can't find it either, but I remember it crystal clear that there was speculation as on why he requested the #25 and many people accused him of ditching the number to push his AV25 label.

Januzaj #11 is brilliant IMO.

252~~~
Was talking about our current number 25.

I reckon the Januzaj "brand" will be huge, soon enough, no matter what number he wears.

253~~~
I hope we see him in the starting line-up with his #11 jersey <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Fully deserves it.

254~~~
Immense honor for the kid, I think he'll prove worthy of it.

255~~~
Valencia was arguably our best player in 2012. Most people were in favor of him receiving the number after the season he just had. You should have used Owen as an example.

256~~~
My excitement for Januzaj has been totally rejuvenated, can't believe I managed to forget so much about him. The perfect player to get the #11 shirt.

257~~~
Wow what an honour and the kid is only 19....and people say a shirt number means nothing, this is HUGE news as will it be when we find out who the No.7 is.

258~~~
Congratulations to Adnan! A great honour.

259~~~
1anuza1 Is that funny or clever??

260~~~
Easily the biggest number to fill for our club so far, and yes i am including #7 in that equation.

261~~~
Just gonna throw this in because it's linked to Ronaldo.

When he joined Inter, they already had Ivan Zamorano who had the #9, Zamorano didn't want to change number but they made him in the end, he took #18 but had a little + in between the numbers to add up to 9.

262~~~
No, Valencia confirms my point, Owen is not necessary. 

All you have to do is <i>arguably</i> be our best player for one season and the 7 shirt is yours, it isn't that much more prestigious than taking over the number 11 shirt, a shirt worn by an absolute club legend measured by his longevity at the top and his prolific nature in terms of medals, that same man will be watching from the dugout as assistant manager whilst this kid is running down the wing with his shirt on his back, that is a lot of pressure.

If he under performs then the cameras don't have to go far to compare him to the man who once wore that shirt.

The number 7 really is not that much more pressure than the 11 shirt in this coming season.

263~~~
"All you have to do is arguably be our best player for one season." That's really hard to do and I'm not sure why you're underselling that. The whole point of giving him the shirt was to continue his dominant form in that shirt. To be the next magnificent 7. It didn't work out. That's football.

I suppose I view the 11 shirt in the same vein as 18. Giggs is the slightly more decorated player, but it's his number. They're both prestigious numbers, but more because of how attached to the numbers they are. The 7 shirt to me is the star of the team.

264~~~
I wonder how much of an influence Giggs himself had here.

265~~~
Really hope we see some of Adnan tonight.

266~~~
Didn't have alot of time but was still able to show a few glimpses of genius. Impressive.

267~~~
Robben role of the top suits him perfectly. 

Showed some moments of class today.

268~~~
Wow, have to correct another fool. There is no TC23 brand. It was a one off thing for charity.

269~~~
Did great despite the small amount of minutes.

270~~~
He was 28 before 24.

Already got a Carrick home and Lawrence away. May just get a second home in long sleeve or something.

271~~~
By far the most exciting player in our squad.

272~~~
He's so positive compared to everyone else, always looking to pass or drive forward. Incredibly comfortable on the ball too.

273~~~
That through ball was just lovely. 

He needs to start. I don't care if he isn't totally fit, just let him play 60 minutes.

Rooney Januzaj

274~~~
This is what leads to long term chronic injury problems. He's still growing into his body and has done a lot of strengthening work over the past year. Just let him recuperate fully, no need to take risks when it comes to fitness.

275~~~
Yup he clearly created the TC23 brand and planned on launching his merchandise range, after 5 appearances for United, for charity purposes. Wow, you are truly the enlightened one aren't you.

When Tom Cleverley was on the brink of the Manchester United first team, he asked us to create a bespoke brand for him. Tom was aware that in this modern world his ‘off field’ brand identity had to perform as well as he did on the pitch. With that in mind, Tom asked us to create a logo, brand and <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tomcleverley23.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> for him.

Judging by how his sports management agency has gone into administration and how his website has ceased to exist, he got the part about his off-field brand identity performing as well as he did on the pitch.

Hold on I have just the thing for you.

276~~~
He's one of the few players in our team who can actually beat a man, this combined with his immense talent means he should start a lot of games this season.

277~~~
There is no TC23 brand. There was no merchandise range, as can even be seen in the pics you link to that there is no section on their to buy this so called merchandise range. He has said himself that there is no TC23 brand and it was a one off for charity. So he made a site? It is the same as a twitter/facebook/blog.

Who is asked US to create a logo, brand and website for him? He has also said before that his sponsorship with Adidas is the reason he had his site as they told him to make it.

I'd rather believe the words of Tom himself than some shite article from football365 trying to be funny.

This has nothing to do with Adnan so I'll leave you to live in your dreamland filled with hate for Tom.

278~~~
Do you have quotes to back that up?

The 'US' is the creative spark design agency.

There was a TC23 brand but it failed miserably. You are acting as though it never existed...

Have you wondered why he closed his twitter and his website? Do you wonder why they haven't released his merchandise despite planning for it? Have you realised his sports management agency has gone into administration which would have affected his merchandise release?

So yeah he just randomly woke up one day, decided to create a TC23 brand and merchandise release as a one time event for charity purposes. Right.....
If you really think he created his TC23 brand and his failed merchandise release for charity reasons and then just shut it down completely, then there is nothing I can say really.

279~~~
should've given him the no7

280~~~
I think the number 11 suits him more than the 7 at this point, as for some reason I associate him more with Giggs than our past number 7's, though that could just be because we haven't had anyone wearing 7 performing well in recent years.

Though for me it doesn't really matters as it is just a number. Adnan was going to be compared to our past greats regardless of sharing a number with them.

281~~~
You seem to miss the point, I did not say the 7 shirt is not more pressure than the 11 but it is not that much more pressure. You were suggesting the pressure of it is on another level however now you seem to be changing your opinion, it is not as you claim that much more pressure than the 11 shirt when you consider the man wearing it will be at every game.

283~~~
Adnan and Fellaini seem like good friends. This kid looks like the real deal

284~~~
Loved that pass in to Rooney on the edge of the box. Not one United player had looked capable of something like that until he came on.

285~~~
He just pings the ball around the place with little effort and glides around the pitch. He's brilliant to watch.

286~~~
I'm worried he won't get enough game time this season. For me he should be one of the first names on the team sheet...

287~~~
He'll get time, LVG loves young talent. Januzaj is as talented as they come.

288~~~
I would rather Januzaj get game time than us buying Di Maria in a season where we are not in Europe anyway. I know i'm crazy right! But i really believe Adnan can take his game to another level this season.

289~~~
I think he still lacks the consistency (which is only natural for a young player) to be one of the first names of the sheet but I've no doubt he'll still get lots of game time.

290~~~
Herrera is very similar, and both were arguably our top performers on the night. (Disregarding the back three minus Keane, they did great.)

291~~~
How the feck are we going to fit Rooney, RVP, Mata, Januzaj and Di Maria on at the same time? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

292~~~
Lovely to see him play again, such an elegant player on the ball. Looking forward to seeing how LvG develops him, I'm sure he'll love the youngster!

293~~~
What level do you guys expect from him coming season?

294~~~
Some said that he has Kaka's style, but I still maintain the notion that those grit and determination make him closer to Best's.

295~~~
I'm probably the only one to think that way but i would say that RVP will lose this battle.

296~~~
Makes sense doesn't it? Maybe not this season, but in a season's time.


That's just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

297~~~
Given his great vision and intelligence on the pitch I seriously doubt that we have to fear about his playing time. LVG will fine one way or another to squeeze him in.

298~~~
Looked sharp. Great ball into Rooney. His vision and weight of pass are wonderful for one so young.

299~~~
He'll be one of the front 3. I think he will prove way to good to leave out. His array of talents is almost too good to be true for his age. He's like your favourite jinky winger and scheming number 10 rolled into one. Once he starts scoring regularly he'll be frightening

300~~~
Was in the megastore yesterday morning and saw januzaj's kit with 11 on it. There's a picture hovering on twitter I think. Great if true!

301~~~
One of RvP or Rooney has to go. Play one striker.

302~~~
depends on his game time, if he plays a lot I fully expect him to be in the top20 players in the league by the end of the season

303~~~

304~~~
That's the one! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> So does that mean it's confirmed or just a mistake?

305~~~
Looked very sharp when he came on last night.

306~~~
United's first new #11 in 20+ years.  I don't remember when Giggs was given the number.  

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wh6PwL0JMks?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

307~~~
So glad he's been given the number 11 shirt. Hopefully this will take him to another level, and if he goes onto have half the career Giggsy had, I'll be happy. 

Congrats, Adnan.

308~~~
Confirmed as the #11 now.. What a huge confidence boost the boy will receive from that..

Going to be a bit weird not seeing Giggsy in it on Saturday though.

309~~~
Giving him #11 is like giving Ronaldo #7. Here's hoping he tackles the challenge like Ronnie did, and not like Tony.

310~~~
Glad he got it, the natural successor to Giggs IMO. At first when he made his debut and his first few games I thought he was destined to be a #10 but he's looked like a winger more and more. He'll only be a squad player this season but next season I can see him really kick on and become first choice, or whenever we switch mainly to a 4-3-3.

311~~~
Posted this in the 3-5-2 thread but it didn't get much of an answer and I'm genuinely interested to hear what people would think of it so I'm going to try here:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.footballuser.com/formations/2014/08/1070667_Manchester_United.jpg" src="http://www.footballuser.com/formations/2014/08/1070667_Manchester_United.jpg"/> 

Ancelotti proved last season that there's nothing wrong with an asymmetrical formation if it lets you use every player in the position where they can do their best work for the team. Here you sacrifice a wing-back in order to get Januzaj on the pitch in his best position, as a winger/wide AM/inside forward (whatever you want to call that free role from a wide starting position). His defensive work-rate is decent, but really it's down to Fletcher and Jones to provide the energy and defensive nous to cover that vacated area.

This way, you can get Januzaj into the starting line-up (and Welbeck would also be a superb fit there). You add pace and unpredictability into the attack, and also strengthen the threat from the wide areas. You add in a type of player that has been central to Van Gaal's formations since Alkmaar - an unpredictable, pacy wide attacker. He used El Hamdaoui at AZ, and Robben at Bayern and for the Netherlands. Januzaj fits that role like a glove.

Yes, it's <i>slightly</i> more defensively open. But it's not as if Ashley Young, the current alternative, is exactly a defensive guarantee as a wingback. Jones is already stepping up into those areas regularly, and Fletcher is the sort of experienced midfielder who can more than cope with covering a little more of the field defensively. The 3-man back line allows for exactly this sort of adjustment, because if Jones has to step out, he still leaves an intact pair of CBs to cover the central areas.

312~~~
Actually think its brilliant, if you work it well and Shaw gets fit, when the opponent attacks you could have 4 at the back with Jones and Shaws as the backs, and Evans,Smalling in centrum. It could work.

313~~~
If we sign Di Maria, Januzaj is the player who would probably be affected the most.

314~~~
If we sign Di Maria, I feel we'll revert back to a 4231. I mean, where would Di Maria play in a 3-5-2? Van Gaal has alreayd identified him as one of the best wingers in the world, so I doubt he'd play him anywhere else.

315~~~
Would be the same problem, dont think LVG is looking forward to benching Mata or Rooney.

316~~~
The only reason why we're not using 4-3-3 is because LVG feels we don't have great wingers. If Di Maria came, you could use both on the wing.

317~~~
True.

318~~~
He would soon realise that we have 2 great wingers if Di Maria came. Januzaj is potentially even better than Di Maria in my eyes.

319~~~
i would say Mata and Kagawa would be benched, unless LvG benches one of Rooney or RvP ( i cant see that)

320~~~
I would rather one of Mata and Kagawa be the #10 over Rooney. Rooney is a brilliant striker.

321~~~
It's pretty safe to assume that when they're all fit and available to play, van Gaal would never sit Rooney, Mata, or van Perise.

322~~~
Depends on the opposition as well though.

323~~~
me too, but i would be surprised especially after being announced captain, which indicates that LvG rates him and Mata couldnt really make himself irreplaceable in the preseason. We have Welbeck too, Di Maria would complicate things further. I would prefer Vidal, we need him more.

324~~~
Na, just play him as one of the front 3, absolve him of defensive responsibility and watch him torment teams.

325~~~
For the short spell he had last night he still proved he has the ability to start for us.. Picked the ball up in so many dangerous positions, linked the play great and he's the only player we have that has the pace and technique to beat any number of players. He's a special talent.

326~~~
He no doubt has the ability to start for us, but it's not as simple as that with young players at times. It still remains to be seen if he can do it more consistently and in the big games.

327~~~
Kagawa? really?

Rooney offers so much more than him as a number 10, including buckets of assists and goals for a start.

328~~~
I prefer them because they have more of a consistent touch and they link the midfield and attack better. Rooney does offer more goals and assists though. No arguing that.

329~~~
But my way we don't have to bench one of Mata, RVP or Rooney. We can play all of them <i>and</i> Januzaj.

330~~~
Really hope that eleven is a sign of him getting plenty of games. We're more exciting to watch with him.

331~~~
I can't see Januzaj starting many games this year barring a couple of injuries.

332~~~
He simply must find a way to play regularly. We clearly have a truly special talent on our hands.

333~~~
I'm sure he'll play a fair amount of games. 
It's not easy for him to get into the team with the attacking options we have and the current formation, but I'm confident he'll play a lot.

We're talking about a young talent who has played as a striker, central attacking midfielder and on both wings during the last 2 years. It's not that he doesn't fit the formation, it's just that now he's competing in an area we have top players, instead of out wide. 
He's one of the few players we have that can actually dribble past an opposition player and create fear with his unpredictability, they'll find a place for him. 

At the very least he will be the one the manager will bring on during the game when we have to force something. 
From then on, it's his responsibility. Van Gaal has proven at his previous clubs that age or status doesn't really matter that much to him. It's the way you play and behave when you get your chance, that will decide whether you get another one or even a starting spot. 
Knowing our club, injuries will sadly play a big part too...

He's the closest we have to Robben, don't think Van Gaal had any problem fitting him in his 352.

334~~~
Mata does, I agree. However Kagawa isn't a better option than Rooney there if his United career so far is anything to go by.

335~~~
Kagawa has rarely played in the 10 spot with United. He's mostly been played on the wing. I also think he would do much better under LVG.

336~~~
I disagree purely based on evidence. Plus, surely Kagawa would have gotten more opportunities there if he's as good as some people think he is in his natural position? Rooney assists and scores goals there, Kagawa has been shockingly unproductive since his arrival. Mata already has more goals and assists.

337~~~
Kagawa is the single most over-rated player in the league, mostly by fans on this website. #lockupshinji

Furthermore, this is a Januzaj thread. United gave him the 11 shirt, Kagawa is still at 26. It doesn't mean everything, but it certainly means something and perhaps it would be best for Kagawa's career if he found a new employer.

338~~~
Januzaj was the most logical choice given his traits where we got him from (working through the youth team) and where he is now. Unless we got an almighty huge player someone like Reus it was always going to be a youngster coming through and as a fan I am proud of that. He must feel 10ft tall now that he is new legendary No.11 of Manchester United. It will go down in history and I couldnt be happier for the lad.

339~~~
Hope to see him feature in some way against Swansea. Maybe off the bench in a forward role.

340~~~
All 3 don't have to play. He offers a mix of attributes that none of the others posess. Were a better team when he's in the side.

I don't think your formation is balanced enough and I very much doubt if van gaal would consider it for that reason. 

While on this topic, why the obsession with playing Rooney, RVP and Mata? There's no pace. None of them can beat a man. We will need to mix in Welbeck and Januzaj into the equation to be at our most dangerous. I would never pick the 3 together personally.

341~~~
Transformation of our new #11
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/CBMTffa.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/CBMTffa.jpg"/>

342~~~
Make the 3-5-2 a 3-6-1 with Mata and Januzaj roaming about behind Rooney. They can stretch defences their movement and let Wayne tap them in.

343~~~
If anything, it would be

---CM------CM----Di Maria---
-----Mata--------Januzaj----
-----------Rooney-----------

Di Maria has excelled as a central midfielder (the left-most midfielder of a midfield three) for both club & country over the last season or so. He was beyond excellent in midfield for Madrid this year & has not played any significant game-time on the wing since the 12/13 season. Not that I don't think your formation is wrong or anything - it would probably work well, I just feel Di Maria is better in midfield (where has has earned all his plaudits & gone from a good player to a top class one) while Mata is better around the hole.

Sorry to make a mountain of a molehill <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

344~~~
Gary Neville: "This is a big season for Januzaj.At this stage of his physical development u would not expect him to deliver 20 gls a season"

Gary Neville : "But in 2 or 3 years I think he(Januzaj) will(score 20+ gls a season), because he has the attributes of a world-class player"

345~~~
reckon he will play tomorrow at some point at least

346~~~
He might start I recon. He looked good when he came on against Valencia and liked up much better with Rooney than Hernandez did.

347~~~
Feck 3-5-2, he's too good to be left out.

348~~~
And today's lesson Louis, is that Januszaj will always need to play when fit.

349~~~
He was decent today, but poor decision making in the box.

350~~~
It won't be long until we're playing a more traditional system and Januzaj will be key. 

Final ball and decision making will come as the season progresses and his understanding with the likes of Mata, Rooney and van Persie develops. He's just breezes past opponents at ease.

The only true positive of what was an abysmal display for me...and even he was a bit of a let down!

351~~~
Needs to play in Mata's position.

352~~~
Disappeared when they moved him to the left. Saw less of the ball and didn't run past anyone when he did get it. No idea why they went away from him. Needs to work on his decision making once he goes past a player.

353~~~
He is a bit selfish, he tries too much these Robben type shots from the right wing.

354~~~
He's got a bit of a rubbish strike. Needs to sort that out first if he's ever going to become a top player.

355~~~
Makes a massive difference, he's not always going to make the right decision but he makes things happen because he's willing to have a go, he'll either open it up or draw a foul in a good area.

356~~~
He was poor today, took on player for fun, but managed to feck up the final ball every single time.

357~~~
This plus I don't know why we always isolate our wingers because you need someone, preferably Mata, moving laterally to offer support. To overload the wings and help draw out defenders.

358~~~
The move over to the left didn't help him and I thought he tried to do too much at times, but he offered the only real excitement and is the only really tricky attacker we have, for me we need a system that allows him to start regularly.

359~~~
In the first half he was isolated, leaving him no choice, but to go past players (which he did) due to Chicha always making the run to the far post. I think Rooney did the same, but I can't say for sure. They need to offer him more help.

He hasn't had a pre season so I thought it was a good first game all things considered.

360~~~
Should have started up top instead of Cheech.

Guess he wasn't seen as fit enough by LVG.

361~~~
He must start every week. And not at right-back.

362~~~
Needs to play pretty much every game when fit

363~~~
He did brilliantly to get away from the fullback only to go for goal from an impossible position. As talented as he is, it really showed his immaturity.

364~~~
Some really nice work with the ball at his feet, but I'm not sure any of his final balls or decisions were right today. Needs to improve in that area in the next match, because once he does that, with the ease he goes past players he will cause problems for every team

365~~~
Was great for a period - looked absolutely deadly. After Swansea changed thee right back eh was no here as effective. Really needs better decision making and to pass it around more.

366~~~
He looks to have matured over the summer. Will be top class and I agree, should start every week.

367~~~
Matured?
He made the wrong decision nearly every time he got past his marker. He had the winger and LB in his pocket yet failed to make much out of it.

368~~~
Our best player - but like everyone else in our side - needs to do better/you expect more from him.

369~~~
I meant physically. Doesn't look like a skinny kid anymore.

370~~~
With our current options he should be in one of the three front positions.  

If Welbeck and RVP are not ready for the next game I hope he starts.

371~~~
This shows what a good, direct player can do. Adnan is not pacy, but when you're driving at defenders the only things they can do is double up on you, or put a foot in at which point a player as talented as Januzaj will glide past them. 

The same can be said of Welbeck. He drives the ball forward, but I don't think he has the dribbling ability of Adnan.

372~~~
He looked a lot fitter, bulkier, not as scrawny as last year. I like that. Doesn't need to overdo it of course but I think if he's given a first team place he can do brilliantly.

373~~~
Decision making was woeful but he has the confidence to beat a man.

374~~~
He played well when he came on. Made one or two wrong choices and took the shot on instead of playing a teammate in but apart from that he was good.

375~~~
Was clearly trying to impress, and hence the wrong calls. He now looks to have the physique to play week in week out. Certainly the most exciting player in the squad.

376~~~
Looked like the most dangerous attacker when he came on. Van Gaal needs to find a way to start him in most matches.

377~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HbqwfCslceQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

378~~~
He needs to make better decisions because he is the only one actually capable of positive play right now. The rest of our attackers can only dream of having his ability to cause problems for the opposition at this current point in time.

379~~~
Watching that video again and though a bright spark he was bit unlike himself today as in too selfish.

When he plays on the right should use his right foot to cross more as well when cutting in. Has done it for the U21s and even the first team in the past so he can but don't know why he is so reluctant at times to do so.

Still showed so many bright sparks. Dunno, why he was shifted wide left after the formation change.

380~~~
Selfish or not - the guy is incredible on the ball. Tell every wide/forward player in our squad to do or play like this kid. Anywhere between the half way line and the byline have two free wingers to play forward and just give them the ball and send them on their way toward goal. Have your insides support.

He single handedly got Taylor booked, then hooked and set up the first goal with his ability on the ball. He is going to be some player. 

Selfishness aside of course. Just another kid in the big city trying to make it.

381~~~
The bit of footwork to lose a defender was impressive. Also thought he made a great long pass to Rooney who should have done better with it.

382~~~
feck 3 5 2 van persie isnt even fit. go 433 and play januzaj.

383~~~
if he managed 70mins today he can certainly be ready next week to play the whole match. Give him the free robben role off striker..the lad will be as important for us as last year. He looks stronger and as confident as ever..

384~~~
His final ball was inconsistent but he looked so dangerous throughout, a reminder to many who may have forgotten what he could bring. Definitely bulked up a bit, not too much that he loses agility or something, and could do with more, but enough to not get bullied out of games occasionally. Seems quicker as well. Think he'll go on to have a great season, as long as we switch to a formation that makes him first choice (a 4-3-3, as long as we buy players for it as well).

385~~~
He should start upfront with Rooney next week if RVP and welbeck are not fit.

386~~~
He is looking in great shape.

387~~~
I agree with you, he can hold his own more than last season. Thats the biggest positive from the game. He still made bad decisions at times tho.

388~~~
He's too selfish. Needs to start making the right decisions when in the final third instead of trying to be a Ronaldo.

389~~~
Improved decision making will come with age. He's just 19. If we curb his individuality at this stage, it'll only limit his overall potential as a player.

390~~~
Our best attacker in the game yesterday. I can see why Gary Neville and several others have tipped him to greatness. The boy is excellent. The decision making as Invictus says will come with maturity. After Ronaldo, this is the first time I have felt that we have a player who could get the crowd off their seats. A joy to watch him play. What I love most about his play is how eases past his opponents with minimal fuss.

391~~~
Yesterday was a good example of the difference between Sterling & Januzaj, Sterling very often stays calm in the final third, while Januzaj doesnt, it ends up with a bad pass or with an useless shot, if he works on that he will soon be one of the best wingers around.

392~~~
Watched it back but where is the selfishness some are talking about? The only selfish decision he made was the 2:50 attempt, the other one was a good position for a shot.

393~~~
You're spot on there mate. But to be fair to Januzaj he's more than a year behind Sterling in the maturation process. I remember this time last year Liverpool fans were equally dismayed with Sterling's poor choices both on and off the field. But he had a quantum leap in terms of performance in the season gone by. IMO Adnan will follow a similar trajectory and have a breakout year, or atleast that's what most of us are hoping for. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

394~~~
Our best attacking player yesterday by some distance, which says something about his ability, but also how terrible the others were. Still a little rash when it comes to decisions on the ball, but i'm confident that LvG will improve that area of his game.

It's still early to say, but i honestly don't see how he could fit in as a wingback in a 352 system. He could surely do a job as a no.10, but we already have that area well stocked.

395~~~
He was selfish but he looks a level above the rest of our attackers in terms of pure ability. Rooney and mata need to show some similar class.

396~~~
I think he could play in the front two as a second striker or sorts. Or if mata continues being a passenger then maybe as the number 10.

397~~~
Players with his ability will always have that element of selfishness about them and that is what makes them stand out above the rest. It's good that he's trying to cut inside and score on his left foot like Robben does. If he had a better shot  in him, he might have scored a couple yesterday.

398~~~
I agree with everyone saying he's got to play, I was thinking exactly the same thing during the match yesterday. He was a bit more wasteful than usual, but he really is the only player in our team who can beat his man. He also seems to see different passes to everyone else. For so long we've been used to the same shitty sideways passing, I love it when he makes those direct passes into Rooney (so long as he can control it) as it take 2-3 defenders out instantly.

399~~~
He isn't normally selfish at all though. He hasn't had a preseason so doesn't have many games under his belt going into this season - before yesterday he'd only played the 30mins or so against Valencia. His decision making will improve as his mental and physical sharpness improves through playing more games.

He is currently the only player in our team who gets you off the edge of your seat. He's such an exciting player to watch because he is such a positive player and his first instinct is to get the ball, turn and run at defenders. He's the only player who actually tries to make things happen at the moment. I think he needs to be starting every game as we just look far more dangerous with him in the side as he puts the opposition on the back foot. He's not afraid to take people on.

400~~~
There were quite a few games last season when he carried us or looked the only potent threat. Hope we don't go into this season with Januzaj being the only player who can pose a genuine attacking threat with his pace/trickery. Every other team has at least 3 attacking players who are of a similar ilk and we have Young, Nani and Valencia FFS. It would also be criminal to rely on a 19 year old to come up with the goods consistently. The way he glides past players effortlessly is so eerily reminiscent of Kaka and he has the potential to become one of the best in a few years.

401~~~
Sterling is also a season ahead in his playing development though. I agree with the point, but Januzaj will grow into his decision making as time passes.

402~~~
I hope so, because if he doesn't we'll have another Nani in the squad.  Btw we seem to have no player that can actually cross... worrying

403~~~
Nani is just plain inconsistent, nothing to do with decision making. Januzaj is just showing a bid of greed, trying to do something special on his own to impress the new manager. He's shown good consistency over the last season in a very bad team.

404~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Typical Redcafe reactionary bollocks. He's played next to no football and it showed with his final ball and decision making. That's all. The lad's quality.

405~~~
Absolutely this.

406~~~
He should pass more when the opportunity arises , will improve with age. Hardly bollocks in saying this.

407~~~
Wouldnt like to pass to Rooney and Mata these times, they do feck all when they get the ball.

408~~~
Want him and Welbeck to be permanent starters in our squad very soon. Rooney, RvP and Mata can fight it out for what is left

409~~~
Januzaj hasn't yet played in a confident United team, unlike Sterling at Liverpool. We've been on our knees ever since he broke into the first team. There was a stage last season around the Sunderland semi final when he was pretty much carrying us on his own, which can't be good.

I've never quite understood comparisons about who is better, they're pointless. But Januzaj has the potential to be top quality. I just hope we can keep his development going this season and more pace and quality on the other flank (as well as elsewhere in the team) wouldn't go amiss.

410~~~
His all round play is very good for his age, and under LVG he is bound to improve but what strikes me with him and most of the squad is that no one can perform that killer pass and find the strikers and we rarely do decent crosses in the box.

411~~~
Sorry but I have to violently disagree with you on that one. Before yesterday his crossing and through balls were perhaps the finest on the team, at least if you look at last season. He'd played 20 minutes of football this season before yesterday and still played at a decent level. I wouldnt draw any negative conclussions on that front just yet.

412~~~
Are some posters really complaining about the decision making of a 19 year old in his second senior season that has been training for 2 weeks?

413~~~
Yes. Yes they are.

414~~~
You could make a very long bloopers reel of incredibly poor shots from distance in his short United career, in fairness, and that's either down to poor technique (and selfishness) or a lack of composure in key moments. That's something you could say about him in plenty of games, not just this one.

415~~~
This place is slowly becoming unbearable. I'm frustrated as well as have been in a shit mood since yesterday but come on!

416~~~
I can't believe people are complaining about the only positive thing from yesterday's game.

417~~~
Yeah he does have a really poor shot from range. Or at least, when he's running with the ball he tends to miss hit it more often then not, as he did once or twice yesterday. Think it's more to do with a lack of composure when he gets within range, he wants to just have a pop at goal rather then focus on getting good contact or making the right decision.

418~~~
However you have to agree that our crossing has been dreadful in the past year with Fulham at home being the most appropriate example of that.  I agree that Januzaj has been far more creative than any of the other players but is he going to be a regular starter this season?  He isn't a proper wing back and he could cost us at times, mostly against top 7 opposition.  Getting back to the topic, I have to say that I don't really remember how many good crosses he delivered against teams in the top half of the table...

419~~~
The way he just gluides past fullbacks is pure elgence. He makes it look so silky and smooth.
For every shot he whistles wide and every cross that floats into the keepers grasp, there is one of a 19 year old Zidane also.
How people can moan i don't understand. He is our shinning light at the end of this looooong dark tunnel of watching space.

420~~~
Januzaj is probably the best crosser the team has, but he isn't always going to cross it in. He also likes to use his left foot to cross, so he will cross more often from the left wing than the right wing. He's not like Valencia who will always look to cross so you won't see him crossing it in all the time.

Here is the bit of footwork he used to get the foul.

Here is a great pass that Rooney failed to control.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/ix7y43pouAmdB.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/ix7y43pouAmdB.gif"/>

I thought Januzaj improved on his long range shooting last season compared to his time in the reserves. He used to scuff his shot more often in 2013. I hope he continues to improve in that regard, because some of his shots are really bad.

421~~~
Damn. Especially that first clip is just fantastic.

422~~~
I agree with the people saying play him up front. I don't want to see him as a wing back again in his career!

423~~~
We should try to find a way how to get the best out of this guy. Not playing him in wingback.

424~~~
I was shocked when he was being played at wing back. Talk about wasting our best dribbler

425~~~
If Mata continues to be indifferent, I'd play Januzaj as the #10. His pace and dribbling would commit defenders, and free up space for the front 2. It'd be especially useful when RvP is playing because then at least we'd have someone with pace in the front 3.

426~~~
Same, but I doubt LVG is the type of guy who'd make such a decision without thinking it through.. it was probably a good test to see how diligent Januzaj could be in an unfamiliar position or whether he'd throw a sulk. It is a credit to Adnan he could look rather menacing in a position where most his dribbles were starting from the halfway line.

427~~~
Adnan is great and his enthusiam will make him play with a fresh attitude no matter the position, we're just so weak at the moment without certain players that Adnan is one of our best players, we should utilize him better.

428~~~
I've been saying for ages he needs to be playing at number 10. It is his long term position and we kind of need him tbh as the other number 10's are desperately underwhelming at the moment. People rave about Ross Barkley.. but Januzaj is potentially better in that role, we just need to see it in action.

429~~~
In fairness to LvG he obviously spotted this and switched the system to 4-4-1-1 so that Januzaj was playing on the wing in the start of the second half with Jones at RB.

430~~~
Yes he fortunately did and hopefully we won't see it happening in next matches.

431~~~
We are missing pace, so why not play him as teh second striker till RvP gets back, then play him in the 10 over Mata. I think Rooney and RvP could work if they have Adnan behind them to inject pace, allowing Rooney and Adnan to switch continually.

432~~~
What's truly amazing is how he's played so few games as a no 10.

433~~~
Has to start against Sunderland, not as wing-back though.

434~~~
I wouldn't say it's truly amazing when he is a teenager who has Rooney, Kagawa and Mata all in that role while he himself does so well out wide.

435~~~
I'd rather have him up top next to Rooney over Hernandez tbh.

436~~~
Too selfish lol.. He's a flair player, you don't give him orders to pass the ball at every given chance, doing so will just stop him making those insane runs he does.

437~~~
Januzaj should be given a firm run in the team. Sterling is showing how a little trust and patience is paying off and Ronaldo was kept in the team despite some awful form and performances early on in his united career. This lad should be starting for me.

438~~~
I think we need to anyways to adda  bit of pace in the spot.

439~~~
we've played a lot of matches that didn't matter much and he could've been given a chance in the position.

440~~~
I think he has to play. He has the excitement factor that Ronaldo had when he was first coming through.

441~~~
I've just checked and Januzaj won 60 freekicks in 15 starts! The next highest was Mata with 41 in 25 starts. Welbeck was third with 31 in 15 again.

This kid commits players and that's what we need to open up space in the congested central areas of a 3-5-2.

442~~~
We should go back to 433. (We would need to sign a quality winger like Di Maria and a CM).

Play a front three with Januzaj, Di Maria and a striker. The sort of movement and ability to run at defenders would soon sort out our static nature at OT. It would leave us with lots of problems in terms of personnel. What to do with Mata,Kagawa and whichever of Rooney/Van Persie doesn't play. Maybe one of Mata/Kagawa could play in a three man midfield.

443~~~
Where was Cleverley? I'd have expected him to have an even better ratio than Mata than Welbeck, he wins freekicks for us all the time. He's actually very good at nipping in and getting a touch to the ball when it's bouncing around in our own half and is a little loose. He use to give us rest bite quite a lot under Ferguson.

444~~~
30 in 18, which is pretty good too.

445~~~
I think Van Gaal will start him vs Sunderland. Januzaj always gives us something different and is the one player we have who can consistently beat his opposite man. For me, he's the best young talent in Europe. he really needs a regular position in the first 11.

446~~~
I've been of the opinion that he's fine as a regular sub considering his age, but watching him last weekend swayed me towards thinking he needs a bigger role than that.  

He offers something no one else on the squad really can, especially with Nani gone.

447~~~
He has to play every game he can. Obviously not every single game because you'd burn him out, but he should be one of the first names on the team sheet - considering how indifferent most of our other players look on the pitch. He's easily one of our best players.

448~~~
At the start of the video any idea who Adnan is pointing to ? Moyes perhaps

449~~~
agreed fully. this is a no-brainer.

450~~~
i thought i read somewhere that he had family(dad)/friends in the stands behind the bench.

451~~~
Fair enough, would have great if it was Moyes since it was his first home goal at OT. In some daily mirror article it said it was towards Moyes. Anybody else share any further knowledge from there memory? I wasn't around when it happened.

452~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBD-eLLOzok?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Nominated Pogba. Aparently he was a huge help for Adnan when he arrived in manchester

453~~~
Welbeck is always the guy with the bucket.

454~~~
Imagine him and Di Maria on the wings! My god it gets the juices flowing

455~~~
Might be old news but just read he is with Doyen sports on a commercial basis, yup the same guys who caused the Rojo saga. Never knew that till now. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.doyensports.com/en/stars_adnan.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.doyensports.com/en/stars_adnan.html</a>

456~~~
Would really bring the excitement back watching our wingers fly down the wing.

457~~~
I think most on here are underestimating his potential importance this season.

458~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

459~~~
I see that as a good thing. The less pressure on him, the better in my opinion. Last year we depended on him too much at times, this year, he can just slot in and play his game without thinking he is the only outlet.

460~~~
Januzaj would have somebody to learn things from too, see how he is in training. He had giggs but it's different learning from somebody who is in their prime right now like di Maria.

461~~~
Imagine him being unhappy with few play time and forcing a move out.. We have to sell RVP after this season, or bench him.

462~~~
Why? I'm hoping that with the addition of Di Maria, Van Gaal will start to use a 4231, using Januzaj on the wing.

463~~~
Calm down. I think us giving him the #11 shirt us evidence enough that he will get a lot of game time, especially if we go to a 433 if ADM comes.

On a side note, surely he must play a big role vs Sunderland. He was very good when he came on, though was a bit rusty.

464~~~
Im afraid LVG isnt willing to bench RVP/Roo/Mata, when thats the case there is no place for Januzaj in the first XI.

465~~~
LVG would have to take that call at some point and keep Januzaj happy.  Really hope he doesn't think too short term.

466~~~
Yeah, that's why I hope he'll do it after coming season, doubt Januzaj is willing to sit on the bench for two seasons in a row.

467~~~
Yeah, I can see the formats we use as 4-3-3 or 4-1-3-2 and Januzaj will be used loosely opposite Di Maria on the wings as both can use both feet well enough I understand.

468~~~
I wouldn't sell RvP if he has a big season which is likely. If not then yes.

469~~~
That's never been a problem with Van Gaal. I wouldn't worry about Januzaj under Van Gaal. He's only 19 so he can't expect to be starting every week yet but I'd imagine he'll play loads anyways. Basically our first choice back up for any of the front 4 positions, and both Rooney and RVP are injury prone.

470~~~
I would, we dont need RVP as we have Roo. Welbz (If he stays) could be our second striker and we could have Wilson as the third option.

471~~~
Except RvP has oodles of talent and is a proven goalscorer and this already puts him ahead of Welbeck. . If he scores a lot this season then I can't see LvG selling him. However if he gets injured a lot or doesn't score much, I can see LvG doing something about it i.e.  dropping RvP.

472~~~
Except RvP is the best striker we have, Welbeck is a poor finisher and not good enough to be our number 1 striker and James Wilson is yet to consistently be involved in the first team squad.

Seriously, some United fans need to calm down with Januzaj. He's an excellent young player, with great potential but he isn't owed a starting spot. He needs to develop and fight for his place. If he's deserving of a spot in the team he'll get one. If you know anything about LvG it's that he doesn't care about stars and keeping them happy. If Januzaj is the best player then he'll play, simple as.

473~~~
Nobody says Welbeck should be our first striker? You forgot our captain? Welbeck as 2nd choice is no problem. Yeah, he doesnt care about stars and keeping him happy, forgot the reason why we play 352? To fit in our stars in their favourite position lol. Just wouldnt be surprised if he isnt a starter for this 2 coming seasons, the lad will want to go. How bad is it for you development to have a massive setback from playing a lot in your first season to not being a starter in the 2 following one.

474~~~
I can't see how anyone can disagree. You risk stagnating talent like Adnan by not giving him that responsibility at a young age. The greatest players today, your Messi's and Ronaldo's were young superstars, most of the greats of the past were playing week in week out with the occasional rest due to injury. Drip feeding him games is going to kill his potential and his potential > Mata in my opinion as a number 10.

If he doesn't live up to the hype - so be it, but the potential upside of him living up to his potential is huge - literally has abit of everything to his game. LVG is the perfect manager to get the best out of him, if he thinks Adnan is up to the task.. he will bench some big names in order to let give Adnan a key role.

I'd hate to see the likes of Sterling and Barkley leave him behind, due to their managers actually having faith in them and building sides around their talent.. when we possess a player of that ilk, shining in a disjointed team and we're not giving him the freedom he needs to bring the best out of him.

475~~~
He's not playing a 352 just to fit all of our stars. A big part of the reason is that he doesn't feel United have a world class winger, which we don't. Why persist with Young, Valencia, and Nani to create if they weren't producing anything in the past two seasons? He also doesn't feel the defense is up to scratch so he thinks a 352 would help the team become stronger at the back. This is from the Neville article, "Why 3-5-2, or its variations? 'Because it’s more easy to defend. You have to defend the space and the player who is coming into it. When you play like that it’s always less than 15 metres [between the three centre-backs], and then it’s more easy to defend when you communicate good.'"

So he takes into account a lot of things, not just how to best fit Mata, Rooney, and RVP.

476~~~
After all he did last year particularly against Sunderland and clearly being one of our most important players, he is again relegated to the bench.

477~~~
He's 19 years old ffs, what do you expect? Who would you play at full back? James and Valencia? Valencia and Young? Once our fullbacks get back to fitness then maybe we'll switch. We can't with the players we have.

478~~~
You MAKE room for your best. I guarantee before the match is over people will be wishing he was in there because we lack the pace and creativity he provides.

This happens every game, or at the very least people will point out something to the effect of him being our lone bright spot. I can only guess how often that's happened over the past year but it's been a lot.

479~~~
Yes but how would you put him in? His only spot would be for Van Persie with the players we have forcing us to use a 3-5-2. And that's not happening with RvP just coming into full fitness.

480~~~
He might be a useful asset against tired legs in the second half.

481~~~
Yes fair enough. I just don't like any formation that means guys like Valencia and Ashley fecking young get played ahead of januzaj.

482~~~
Can he play in a midfield two?

Not really.

483~~~
He wasnt that bad imo, but he was clearly out of position.

484~~~
Shouldn't be playing that position but he actually beat his man and tried something.

485~~~
He did far better than I thought he would when he came on, but obviously he shouldn't really be playing there.

486~~~
He's wasted in midfield but did show very good discipline positionally.  Didn't go for the Rooney/Gerrard run wherever you damn well please thing.

487~~~
Yeah I wasn't slating his effort, it was just a monumental waste of his attacking threat playing him in such a deep position against a side defending deep who were congesting the central areas.

488~~~
Today was a good reminder that players like Januzaj need to be brought along slowly rather than rubber stamped as potential permanent starting XI players at the expense of the likes of Rooney and others.

489~~~
I'm sorry but that's complete bollocks mate. Nearly every single top class talent throughout the years were playing regular Football at 19, he needs to play to improve his decision making, it isn't going to magically happen on his 21st birthday.

490~~~
Tbf Mata and Rooney should have been playing Cm as senior players and not him.

He still did not do worse than Fletcher tbf.

491~~~
Agreed fully.

492~~~
I didn't say he shouldn't be playing at all, just that he needs to be brought along slowly. Also, his quality is being dangerously inflated by his fans here. He's a good young player with a promising future, nothing more. And his development won't be best served by randomly throwing him into failing situations. Give 20-25 appearances until there's a noticeable improvement that justifies more.

493~~~
And then lose him out like Pogba, and years after everytime we hear his name complain about the fact that we'd let him go? He will be our best winger after di Maria.

494~~~
Justifies more? In the last year, there is at most 3 names who've deserved to be on the pitch more than him.

495~~~
I don't think its doing him any favors to anoint him as a special player like that. He's a talented young footballer who is still developing, nothing more.

496~~~
He's much more than just a 'talent young Footballer'.. I find it pretty insulting you put him in that category, he's one of the most exciting young wingers I've seen since Ronaldo.

497~~~
Its not insulting at all. He's a talented young footballer - full stop. Its utterly laughable to compare him to Ronaldo in any way, as he will never be half the footballer Ronaldo is - not that this would reflect poorly on Januzaj, as anyone half as good as Ronaldo would still be a very good player.

498~~~
He is a special player, he isnt world class yet but he is our most creative, direct, attacking minded player, lets bench him and play pass the ball backwards mata/young.

499~~~
He looked better in midfield then Cleverley or Fletcher did. A 19 year old winger. Funny really.

500~~~
How can you say that lmao? He's better at 19 than Ronaldo was. In fact I can remember people having the same conversation about Ronaldo, and now look where he is.

501~~~
WTF, are we watching the same footballer? Never be half as good as Ronaldo, are you wumming/being sarcastic.

502~~~
Keep repeating how special he is and prepare to be disappointed when you discover he isn't.

503~~~
No, I don't wum.

504~~~
In terms of passing, insight, passing defenders, link up play he is already better than Ronaldo.

505~~~
Should not play in central midfield and looked a bit lost today. Also, his piss poor midfield partners, immobile strikers and very limited wingbacks around him did not help.

506~~~
People who are saying Januzaj is overrated are really getting into your head mate.

507~~~
I'm talking about what Ronaldo has achieved as a player, not Ronaldo at 19. There are quite a few players who were as good or better than Ronaldo at 18/19, but never achieved what he did over a career.

508~~~
When Ronaldo was 19, I didn't think Ronaldo would be half the footballer Ronaldo is right now. Just thought he was a talented young footballer.

509~~~
When Ronaldo was 19, did you know that he would be as good as he is now?

510~~~
I think he's overrated by many on here - don't think he's poor footballer at all - he's very good and will get much better. I just don't buy the hype that he's the chosen one, as it puts an unfair burden of expectation on fans and the player, which if he doesn't live up to it, will be disappointing for everyone involved. Let him develop organically like every other player in the squad. If his quality is there, he will rise to the top and become a permanent starting XI player.

511~~~
No, but the same can be said of 99 other footballers who were hyped at 99, who went on to fail.

512~~~
You say people here overrate him, on which level do people rate him and on which level does he have to be rated? I dont see people calling him Reus, Hazard, di Maria and not even Sterling's level, while IMO he is just behind Sterling (mostly because of his end product).

513~~~
And did you expect Ronaldo to achieve what he has done when he first arrived here? I see you said no to someone asking the same question, which means your current stance on Januzaj is contradictory to your own views. WUM?

514~~~
Is Van Gaal going to 'Dembele' him? I've actually always thought the lad has the right physical attributes to become a midfielder, an attacking Giggs type one mind. Still he has a lot to learn but he's taken to it a lot quicker to some of the shit we have. Actually held position unlike Fellaini et al.

515~~~
You simply dont know how a player will develop, so saying he wont be half the footballer Ronaldo was is quite stupid imo.

516~~~
I don't really think he's ready to play central. He's too lightweight. He needs the space to take on a player one on one.

517~~~
He played in central midfield today because we don't have real midfielders there available. Can't blame him as his game revolve around pacey runs and distribution from the left wing.

518~~~
Just a general sentiment of including him into starting XI formations, comparing him to Ronaldo (which lets face it, even if its comparing him to Ronaldo at 19, tacitly implies he could one day be as good as Ronaldo of today, which is pure fanaticism). Stop hyping this kid, I say. Let him prove his value on the pitch. If he's as good as his hype, he will rise to the top without a brigade of fans promoting him as the next big thing.

519~~~
Still not as lightweight as Mata and Kagawa, actually I'm sure Januzaj won a few challenges and a header in his little stint. Always felt Adnan could be the 3rd midfielder in a 4-3-3 in a Van Gaal system.

520~~~
WTF, he clearly should be in our starting line up, after di Maria he would be our second best winger. If we play a 433 he should start, but I dont think he will because LVG doesnt have the balls to bench one of the three stars. The Ronaldo comparison isnt a strange one, you can see the similarities but you cant say he will be as good as him that day, if people have said that, that's wrong but I havent seen a lot of people say that or imply that, but saying he wont be half as good as Ronaldo is also as wrong as you're doing.

521~~~
Its true we don't, but I'd imagine most people don't think Januzaj will be the greatest player of his generation like Ronaldo has. As i said earlier, half the player Ronaldo is - is in no way an insult to young Adnan. He will have a good career if he achieves that.

522~~~
Looked better than Cleverley at CM, but then again he's United quality.

523~~~
No he shouldn't. And I don't see any Ronaldo similarities at all.

524~~~
I said earlier, i'm not wumming. So stop claiming I am.

525~~~
Still, you cant say that, because you just dont know which development he'll make.

526~~~
Why shouldnt he, what would be your first line-up? Playing Young/Valencia???? No Ronaldo similarities? How can you say this.

527~~~
Probabilistically, I'm comfortable saying he will be a very good player and have a fantastic career, but that he will never  be in the Messi/Ronaldo category with multiple  Ballon d'Ors and be considered one of the two best players on the planet for half a decade on the trot. Even getting to 50% of that mark would still make him a success though.

528~~~
Why come out with a comment like that after he just played in central midfield for the first time? It's clearly not his best position. How is this performance any indication that he shouldn't start? No one is asking for him to start as a central midfielder. Especially on a day where the older attackers didn't look great again.

529~~~
Didn't say he shouldn't be considered for starting XI - just that he shouldn't rubber stamped as a permanent starter. He needs to be brought along gradually, not as some sort of bandage over a bullet wound saviour during our calamitous transition period. And lets agree to stop mentioning Ronaldo. Its beyond embarrassing.

530~~~
Nothing to do with today mate. Thought he was one of our better players today.

531~~~
I think Adnan will reach a very high level to be considered one of the best in his position but I don't think he will reach the level of Messi or Ronaldo. In a few years if he keeps progressing he could be on the same level as Silva, Hazard and Gotze.

532~~~
Im not going to repeat myself again, if you dont think/know he will, its your case.

533~~~
He needs more games to kickstart some momentum and confidence.  It's not like he's sixteen.

534~~~
Do you think Januzaj will be a better player than Aaron Ramsey ?

535~~~
The current Aaron Ramsey, yes, but Aaron still has the time to even impove more. But I cant say it with 100% assurance because I dont know what will happen with the kid. You?

536~~~
I said it before the game, and again now... Any formation that relies on ashley young, Valencia and Cleverley but doesn't have room for Januzaj is ridiculous.

Everyone can see it, except for Raoul whom Im still not certain isn't taking the piss.

Januzaj needs to start games.

537~~~
I rate Ramsey fairly high and think he could wind up as a slightly less prolific version of Lampard in terms of his goal contribution. If young Adnan, despite possibly playing in different position, is able to match that, I'll be quite happy.

538~~~
He could match Lampard's when you count from last season, this season he has had a couple in while his play has been quite bad, he has the knack of scoring goals. If he matches that, it would be OK, but if his potential is up to that I'd rather buy Reus/Depay. Our wings have been better in the past. Or even if he will be a #10 in the future, I would rather go for someone like Meyer. Not saying Ramsey isnt a good player something like that, I think if we have the ambition to be the topclub we once were, we should have wingers like Hazard, Angel, Robben, Ribery, Bale, Neymar (potentially), Reus, if he reaches Ramsey's level imo he would be a bit below that.

539~~~
Agree on Reus and Depay - would love to have either of them, especially if it expedites Young and Valencia moving on.

540~~~
He was a star in a team that reached the Euro finals. And he was not even close to 20. But yeah, this kid is close to that level...not.
He comes across as a nice kid but Im with Raoul on this one. 
You insult Ronaldo and do fan hyping.

541~~~
Oh it's that guy that didn't even watch Adnan for most of the season.

542~~~
On the other side, his stats are slightly worse than Adnan's while he was playing in a far far better team atm. Adnan has shone in our darkest times in years. Nice kid, thats how serious I should take you. Not saying he will be as good as Ronaldo one day, but to already say he wont be half Ronaldo is a bit ridiculous imo.

543~~~
Not being close with 19 doesnt mean never be as good. Reus was nowhere near world class with 21. And look now.
But some talk here like he is already mega special. He is not. He is a good player so far who gets way more attention then he deserves because he is with United. And his scorer numbers are nothing better.
I just think you should put it all in perspective. Look at old threads of Andy Caroll(?) and so much other young players who were hyped up and then didnt do special things.

544~~~
I have had to hear enough bollocks today, cheers. If you cant see Januzaj is a special player/talent, I wonder who is in your opinion.

545~~~
Pretty much this.

546~~~
Think we are the most ordinary club in the world then, if Adnan isnt special no one at this club is special.

547~~~
Or else we would need to articulate the difference between promising and special.

548~~~
You think he is promising? Young talented footballer who is developing you said, same can be said of Townsend and Bolasie. His promise according to you is that he wont ever reach half of Ronaldo, not so promising to me.

549~~~
Think you're wrong regarding Adnan, was our only bright spark last season in a shocking united team at the age of 18-19. Will be special in a few years, not claiming he'll reach ronaldo's level though.

550~~~
Yeah he's definitely promising. Being half the player Ronaldo has become would be a very good career for him. There's a difference between promising and special though. Special should never be used unless a player is in the Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar type mold.

551~~~
How so ? Which past "special" player would you say Adnan's career will match ?

552~~~
Do you mean half of the goal Ronaldo has scored, half of the things Ronaldo has won or half of the qualities Ronaldo has?

553~~~
Do you think none? If you call Neymar special already, I certainly think Adnan can reach the level Neymar has now lol. If I had your opinion about Adnan, he should feck off imo.

554~~~
Same level as Hazard-Reus-Sanchez.

555~~~
We ought to switch to a 4-3-3 and let Januzaj start on one of the wings with Di Maria on the other. I don't ever want to see a starting XI with Rooney and RVP again.

556~~~
Being a devastating world beater for 6-7 years on the trot mainly - a complete fecking footballer - the goals, the FKs, headers, tricks, ability to grab a game by the scruff, make everyone around him better, and ultimately wind up in discussions of the greatest footballers ever.

557~~~
Fair enough - would be impressed if he achieves that level.

558~~~
Ronaldo makes everyone around him better? How? He makes everyone work for him, Messi makes everyone around him better. What was the last time you saw Ronaldo doing a trick? Januzaj doesnt strike me like the score goals type of guy, he is a #10 while Ronaldo is a striker who plays on the wing. Lets do it in numbers, lets say Ronaldo and all his qualities is a 9.6, what do you think Januzaj will be.

559~~~
He didn't do anything wrong today but it felt a waste bringing him on to play as a CM, he's still at his best when drifting in from the wings IMO.

560~~~
Your argument isn't furthered by trying to knock Ronaldo down. The numbers can't be qualified in terms of 1-10 as there are too many variables involved. Lets say that if Adnan winds up as good as Aaron Ramsey is today, he can be considered a success.

561~~~
Then let him feck off, do we need Ramsey level wingers at United? The ambition here is to be the best, so lets sell Januzaj and go buy Reus etc.

562~~~
Or alternatively, allow him to develop and improve without anointing him as some sort of special savior. He has to earn his success as a footballer, and I'm confident he will. The problem with hyping these kids is that it leads to ridiculous expectations, which puts unneeded pressure on the player and creates inevitable disappointment among fans if the hype isn't matched.

563~~~
Really odd that  you'd select a game where he was subbed on in an unfamiliar position because every other option we have there is injured to use as evidence that he shouldn't be starting games. He looked our most threatening player in his natural position last weekend against Swansea (as he did for the majority of last season). And even his his little 20-odd minute cameo today he looked more lively and managed more shots than Rooney and RvP combined all game.

564~~~
So instead lets have very low expectations and be satisfied with every little he does.

565~~~
Today has little to do with my opinion of him - which is quite high, but quite at the level of a deity.

566~~~
Definitely. Why place ridiculous hype on a player if it creates unrealistic expectations he may never be able to live up to.

567~~~
You suggested that today was a reminder that he shouldn't be starting, when all it reminded us was that he's better when playing as an attacker which is hardly surprising.

568~~~
It would be quite ambitionless if we would be satisfied with every little he does, soon we'll be getting our cocks out if he gives an assist.

569~~~
Well that it was. But my concerns of him being overhyped far pre-dated today.

570~~~
I think Van Gaal needs to stop playing players out of position. Simple as that.

571~~~
Every top young talent gets hyped up big time. Happened with Rooney and is happening with Januzaj. I don't see what the issue is.

Also, we need to find a way to start him more frequently. His raw ability is miles ahead of some of our starters.

572~~~
Ambition has nothing to do with it. If he has the quality, he will prove it on the pitch and force his way into a permanent starting XI job, at which point his performances will match his hype.

573~~~
Weird that you'd draw conclusions from his performance today to make your point though when he's unlikely to be playing in CM again anytime soon. His performances on the wing are another issue entirely.

574~~~
Apples and Oranges. Rooney was a Premiership player at 16, bought for a ridiculous fee at 18, scored Champions league hattrick on his debut and was also a full England international. If there was hype, it was justified at the time as well as the career he's since had.

575~~~
It would be ambitionless when we'd accept and be satisfied everytime a player does something little. It was nice having your point of view on him, I'll remember you for if he becomes Ronaldo 3.0

576~~~
What do you expect from an 18/19 year old to be considered special?

These aren't even all his great games (like at home vs Newcastle) or his games where he was better than the rest of his teammates (chelsea). If he's putting in those performances at 18, what do you think he'll be doing in a couple of years from now provided he stays healthy? He has bad games like all senior players do and he has games where he's quiet because he doesn't get many minutes to show what he can do.

It was seriously impressive what he did especially in a side that was awful in attack, with little movement and a below average midfield to back him up.

577~~~
I haven't criticized him for being stuck in CM - that's nothing he can control. In fact my criticisms in this thread have nothing to do with Januzaj - who i rate highly. They're directed at his euphoric fanboy brigade who seem to lose the plot at anyone suggesting he won't wind up a certified world beater.

578~~~
Spoiler your YouTube clips.

579~~~
Rooney was one of the best talents around then. Januzaj is one of the best at talents around now. He at times looked a level above our other players at the age of 18, and was one of our best pleads last season. He scored two brilliant goals to win us a game away from home on his league debut. 

Not sure what Rooneys done since has to do with the hype at the time.

Also while noting the difference in how proven they are/were, you're forgetting to note the difference in hype. Januzaj's hype is nowhere near what Rooneys was. I'm not sure what bothers or surprises you about any of this.

580~~~
High praise indeed. Every young player that gets spoken about in this way it's obviously dependent on them fulfilling the potential they've shown. Januzaj's potential is very high but he has to put the hard work in. I don't see the point in getting irked by people getting excited about him. Very few conclusions can be drawn from today because hes hardly likely to be a regular in CM. If anything, the impression I got was that he should probably be starting wide ahead of Young/Valencia.

581~~~
Rooney was an established player with a massive transfer fee - which justified his expectations. Big difference between that and an emerging youth player.

582~~~
Rooney was also a bigger guy able to handle the older players much better than Adnan. Sterling is the same way despite not looking the part. He can bully defenders with his strength which Januzaj can't do.

583~~~
I more or less agree with what he is saying. He has a tremendous upside.

584~~~
He's not emerging. He was very good last season. He's a good footballer. Rooney was more established and hence more hyped. Like what Rooney has done since was irrelevant, I don't see what Rooney being purchased and Januzaj being coming through the ranks has to do with it.

585~~~
He's still emerging in the sense that he hasn't fully made the transition from being a young player to one in a permanent starting XI role. The Rooney example is deeply flawed for the reasons I stated - Wayne was doing far more at an earlier age 


 which combined with his massive transfer fee for a teenager, created a degree of justified hype. That's entirely different than a kid playing in the reserves impressing after a first team call up.

586~~~
You can compare many kids (that turned out world class) at the same age to Rooney and Rooney comes out on top most times. And Adnan should have been a permanent starting player, but wasn't because everyone was afraid of burning him out. That's the reason why he didn't play much in the 2nd half of the season. Everyone thought we were relying on Januzaj too much. Young, Valencia, and Kagawa certainly weren't better than him last season.

587~~~
Imagine if Moyes had done that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

588~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0kZCa_5JMP8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

First Januzaj match comp of the season.

Increased the contrast, so that should stop it from getting taken down... hopefully.

Only 19 and he's already played as a CM, RWB, LW, RW, #10/SS, and a CF for us. (And not to forget that he had to play as a true winger in the second half of last season.)

589~~~
And the manager - who was without the likes of injured midfielders Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera - told reporters: "It is not usual that we have four injuries in midfield. Every club that has that, has a problem.

"That is why I played Januzaj in midfield, (and) because as a coach I want to win.

"I have said that we need creative passing and I thought Januzaj could provide that. That is the reason."

The Dutchman said: "Kagawa, I have tried to play him in that position in the United States (in pre-season) and he could not fulfil my wishes and my philosophy.

"We have spoken about that and he is more of a 10.

"Juan Mata was playing at 10 and I thought I had to change the other players, which is why I chose to bring on Januzaj.

"It is because of creation. Kagawa can also create, but I asked Adnan to play there because of the lack of midfielders.

"When he played in Belgium, he played in midfield so I asked if he could do it for us. I said to him 'you are on the bench as a midfielder' because I want him to focus.

"He played there and you could see it's not so many times that he's played there. But he did his utmost and I cannot demand more."

590~~~
Pretty ordinary today until last 5 minutes.

Looked *** interested and almost afraid to be hacked.

Invisible and dropping deep as AM and not taking players on out wide.

591~~~
Ordinary you say? ORDINARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That was the worst i've seen the kid play. Nothing he did made sense or came off. The very definition of a rubbish performance.

592~~~
He was invisible because he was shifted to wingback and the midfield + defense weren't able to find our attackers that well. You could see him waiting for the ball on the sideline every time. It made no sense to take Powell off despite him having a bad game. The team needed more possession so Welbeck, Januzaj, and Wilson could see more of the ball.

593~~~
He really dissapointed me tonight. Sure he was surrounded by dross, but he rarely even took a man on, his crossing was poor and just generally looked uninspiring. 

Maybe I have come to expect more from him and shouldn't, but I thought he could turn the match for us. ]

594~~~
No it wasn't. The only thing that didn't come off were his crosses. A ball touch video of his will show you he was positive in trying to advance the ball forward and succeeded most of the time. The only bad thing is that he didn't see enough of the ball.

595~~~
I think Powell wasn't fit to play more than that as it's his first game back. That's the only explanation i can find for that bizarre change.

596~~~
Really uninspiring. Thought he might take the opportunity well playing in as the AM, but cant remember him offering anything there. Went out wide, and was pretty similar

597~~~
Few looked good today and Adnan wasnt an exception. 

Hopefully this loss wont scar the kids. This was an almighty bollocking.

598~~~
Most overated player in the squad, he'll come good in the end though.

599~~~
He really needs to play in a system like Ronaldo did in his first couple of seasons before he really started to shine. Just stay up wide left or right and when we get the ball back look up and hit him. Get him isolated on goal or on the back four up the field and give him the ball and let him go toward goal. Ronaldo never did any defending.. Probably ever at United and every player had an easy outlet pass up to him from everywhere on the pitch.

600~~~
He was poor but it was baffling to see him at RWB.

601~~~
Agreed. RWB is just not a position for him. If we persist with this formation, its hard to see where he'd fit in unless its one of the front three.

602~~~
Today was an off day which is a shame because (on paper) this is the type of game that he could have grabbed by the scruff of the neck. They'd have struggled with Adnan at his best, but unfortunately he wasn't anywhere near it today. Seemed exempt for the first teams malaise before tonight.

603~~~
I thought he played quite well? Not played much football at all this season and it shows but had a decent game. A few really nice, creative passes and that shot which hit the post was an absolute thunderbastard.

604~~~
Didn't really seem to fancy a run at them today. I think he will end up as a more central player one day but not yet. We do need to get him out of wingback though. Waste of his talent there, need to find a way to have him start central but be able to come inside. But thought he wasn't quite as bad as the average today but far from showing what he can do on the pitch today.

605~~~
Just looks a little shell-shocked and lost at the moment, I think he seems confused about where he stands under LVG. He's had to play as a CM, wing back and a number 10, as well as both wings in just a space of weeks. 

Needs to settle down and nail a starting spot in a position he's comfortable with. Number 10 and Left wing.. are his best positions.

606~~~
Lets just agree to disagree. He was apalling and is capable of much, much better.

607~~~
Those 20ish minutes in the first half looked like we were playing with 10 man, he managed to make Powell and Anderson look like they are running. Shit performance.

608~~~
I know it's nearly blasphemy on this forum to criticise Januzaj but I don't think he's anywhere near as talented as you all think. Pretty good young player but I don't get why some of you think it's ridiculous to see him on the bench. Maybe I've just caught the wrong games but so often he makes the wrong decision (usually to shoot when there's an easy pass on).

Would be much better if he was played in his right position mind you.

609~~~
Nobody shoots on our team. The more he shoots the better.

610~~~
Was a bit lost in behind the strikers in the first half, did much better in the second half and almost scored. Will get better but wasn't disappointing today, despite the awful performance.

611~~~
This is a huge problem IMO

612~~~
I was disappointed in him today. Didn't look up for it.

613~~~
It's hard to take anything from individual performances when the whole team is in such a state. How would Ronaldo have developed in this side? It's concerning.

614~~~
He's a fantastic prospect. But he's not set the world alight by any stretch. The hype was also due to the rest of our team being shite last season and him playing rather well. A team of players earning enormous amounts of money, full internationals, big names, who all looked for Januzaj again and again last season when he was on the pitch, as he was the only one capable of taking on players. 

He still needs to build up strength but I expect him to have a much better season than about half our team. 

At fault for the 2nd goal, didn't track back fast enough, no doubt get a telling off by Van Gaal for that.

615~~~
He is very talented but you are not wrong, he is a bit overrated here. As our other wingers are useless it's completely understandable ppl want him to start on the wings. However I find it completely ridiculous that some have suggested he should start ahead of Kagawa in the No 10 (let alone ahead of Mata). His decision making and shooting also need to improve big time, but he hasn't had the best conditions so far: since Moyes' until today he has been in and out of the team, not to mention the team isn't working at the moment so it's not easy for him either.

Oh and he was really bad today, in the first half I can't remember noticing him at all.

616~~~
I think he is one of the only shining lights at the moment in the squad. I think he should be starting most weeks.

617~~~
Not one of Januzaj's better games. Gave the ball away cheaply, at times, as did everyone, but what surprised me that he very rarely tried to take on the full back when he got into a good position.

618~~~
Let's be fair if you're a wingback in this defence, you wouldn't be takin on their fullback either. We need to revert back to using actual wingers with fullbacks so Januzaj has an outlet

619~~~
I'm all for four at the back, but it seems like we'll be playing 352 for a while.

620~~~
OK, so what's happening here? I have been just thinking about him again and something just doesn't seem right. I can see the talent, but I can't see the improvement. And for all his father's bullshite talk last season (when the contract with us wasn't extended yet and when he still had not chosen a nation to play for), about how down to earth and hardworking a d all that he is (as if any parents of a pro footballer would say anything else), I don't see let's say Ronaldo's mentality, attitude, improvement and will to win at all. 

Not even close actually, and I am not talking about today's Ronaldo, but about the time when Ronaldo was between 18 and 20. While Ronaldo helped Portugal to reach the final in 2004 at the same age, Januzaj had a crap game for Belgium in the world cup and there were noises of bad attitude from the Belgium camp (ofc noone knows how true). 

And while Ronaldo more often than not tried to give his all and made sure that if he had failed to impress in the first 80 mins, he still made an impact out of nowhere in the 81st minute and always kept going even at a very young age, I just can't see it with Januzaj. Now I know Ronaldo didn't give his all because he loved United, but rather for himself, but that's not the point. The point is that he tried everything to improve (and our team wasn't much better back then - between 2003-2005). Ofc he had Fergie which was a huge help.

Now I am not writing off Januzaj, but as I have very high hopes for him I hope he reaches close to Ronaldo's level rather than the level of a "good footballer". But based on the last few months I don't see it at all. And Wilson and Pereira who weren't that good eithet yesterday, still looked more ready for the highest level than Januzaj yesterday.

621~~~
No point beating around the bush here. He was bad last night. The whole team was bad, but when he had the ball he looked ordinary last night. 

This formation doesn't suit him, hence why he hasn't started any of our first 3 games so far. The second we move to 4-3-3, and he gets minutes in his best position, he'll solidify a starting berth.

622~~~
Well firstly, I'd urge you to stop comparing him to the best player in the world (or the 2nd best). I know you said not current Ronaldo or whatever but let's be honest, he was something different. It's unfair to compare Adnan to him. I didn't hear anything about bad attitude? I don't even remember him getting any minutes actually?  He will be fine, he just needs to lock down a position for now - which I think should be on the wing.

623~~~
He played their 3rd group game when they had already qualified. Oh and some on this forum have suggested he is at the same level Ronaldo was when he was his age, a few have even suggested he has shown more / is more mature than Ronaldo was at his age.

624~~~
Ah OK then, I missed that game. I think some people over-do the Januzaj hype on here. I wish he wouldn't get compared to Ronaldo but I guess it is inevitable. They are different players though, and personalities. He has potential to be a good player though. He just has to focus on getting a role in the van Gaal squad.

625~~~
this thread is a classic case in point where one bad game and loads of "he's never going to be as good as (ronalda/etc.), he was so shit. I never rated him in the first place, etc."

completely ridiculous. by no means did he have a great game, but he came on as a sub and played a wing back. ... well, he's not a wing back is he? no, he's not. and i'm pretty sure LVG knows that by now and i can't see him playing there again.

but with di maria here, i CAN see us changing the formation where wide players are given more prominence and as such januzaj seems the perfect fit to play on the other side of di maria.

he's a world class talent in the making, one bad game doesn't change that. he's had three sub appearances. let's not jump on a NINETEEN year old's back because he hasn't lit it up yet.

there is one thing that concerns me though, and it has little to do with his play but a lot more to do with our 3-5-2 and the fact we have 10 games between august and november. that's simply not enough game time, and if LVG knows now already that januzaj isn't going to feature a lot this year due to us being only in the premier league and hopefully the FA cup for longer than last year... well, then it might be best to honestly look at loaning him out. there are few bigger fan boys of januzaj than me, but with so few games to go around this year he could potentially see considerably less playing time than he even had last year. needless to say that's not good for his development.

again, i hope he doesn't get loaned out, but LVG better take a long hard look at who he feels he needs this year and if Adnan isn't going to feature at least as much as he did last year, then it might be best to shunt him to another premiership side for the season.

... or am i crazy?

626~~~
1) He has played in too many positions

2) I don't think he's 100% fit at all.....no pre-season with the rest of the team is never good for players

627~~~
Think he looks better playing from out wide than he does centrally

628~~~
Some of you guys overreact too much. We're 3 games into the season and you guys are already questioning his talent as if other talented 19 year olds didn't have bad games. He really wasn't as bad as you guys make him out.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tksCxCVCwLs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This video is missing some of his performance like the great pass to Janko, a couple of other passes, and probably another failed cross. He certainly could have been better, but was far from awful or appalling. If he doesn't impress much throughout the season then I could understand questioning his talent even though I would personally wait a couple of years due to his age.

629~~~
Cant find a place in this team as long as we insist on playing young valencia and even fecking anderson.

630~~~
He's wasted in the middle.  He needs to be out wide to use his quickness and skill, but we have Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum on the wings in this formation.

631~~~

Filed: Sunday, August 31, 2014 at 01:28 UK
Last Updated: Sunday, August 31, 2014 at 03:25 UK

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adnan-januzaj/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Adnan Januzaj</b></a> is worried that he will be offloaded by <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Manchester United</b></a> in the transfer window, according to reports.

The young Belgian attacker played in the Red Devils' humiliating 4-0 defeat at MK Dons on Tuesday and, although the 19-year-old was asked for his shirt at the end of the tie, <i>The People</i> claims that Januzaj didn't was to hand it over, thinking it may be his last game for the club.

It is thought that the teenager is concerned about how he fit into the plans of new boss <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/louis-van-gaal/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Louis van Gaal</b></a>, after impressing at Old Trafford under <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-moyes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>David Moyes</b></a>, last season.

Januzaj featured for just three minutes at Burnley on Saturday, replacing the injured <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/juan-mata/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Juan Mata</b></a> and has reportedly been told that he is only the fourth choice in the number 10 position.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't think he'll go because I've heard quite a few reports that Van Gaal quite likes Januzaj, and I mean, how can you not, especially if Mata continues this poor form Januzaj will get more chances, however one positive is that he's worried about leaving, which means he wants to stay and isn't looking to move onto a club like Real or something.

632~~~
Play him up top next game please. Don't get why he hasn't been tried out there so far but has played every other role.

633~~~
With Mata potentially injured and Kagawa probably being sold then this is his chance to get some games.

634~~~
I know this is just a rumours and it might be a fake. But I'm afraid that this might become a real news in the future. We saw what happen to Welbeck. We have 2 great talent from our academic and LVG decides to suck Mata, Rooney and RVP balls so much just because they are named as a world class. However so far the three world classes haven't show anything good performance. Only Rooney did okay against Swansea.
Januzaj hasn't play as our starting eleven yet this season. This is worrying me.

635~~~
LVG might not be happy with his attitude thus far and is trying to motivate the kid into earning his spot. Find it hard to believe Januzaj won't get a proper shot at starting, especially with the team playing as it is.

636~~~
So we drop Mata to give him time? Or maybe Di Maria? 

Van Gaal is trying a system he believes is beneficial to the players he has available. As the season progresses everyone will get chances. At no point have the club ever indicated Adnan is not part of their long term plans. Dont see why anyone is making a drama out of media crap invented reports! If Van Gaal wasn't impressed with his attitude he'd be on his way out very quickly.

637~~~
Bottom line is he hasnt been handed a start yet, which is absolutely ludicrous.

Only thing more atrocious was Di Maria coming off not for Januzaj... But for fat fecking Anderson. If Januzaj is shown the door this year, Ill be extremely disappointed.

638~~~
The way Mata is playing at the moment yes, obviously he's injured now so he technically can't be dropped, but Mata has been terrible so far this season.

639~~~
Januzaj and Di Maria are our 2 best players. Just switch to 4-3-3 and drop one of the underperfoming Rooney, RVP, Mata.

640~~~
Think we should show LVG the next one then, that would be one dumb decision and we would be throwing our future away by showing Adnan the door. He'll regress if LVG continues like this btw, he isnt ready to play in the middle and he is making just very little minutes.

641~~~
I'm leaning towards this. I think it'd improve us significantly. There would still be issues but I think we could at least be beating Burnley, Swansea etc

642~~~
About time we start building the team around the youngster.

643~~~
If Van Gaal persists with his "philosophy", which Adnan doesn't currently seem to fit into, he could well get fed up and look elsewhere.

644~~~
Doubt he's packing his bag just yet. I'd imagine he has more patience tban the average caftard, thankfully.

645~~~
I'm thinking he doesn't fit into the 3-5-2 formation (which he obviously doesn't). When we switch to 4-3-3, I'm certain he will feature.

646~~~
Don't put words into other people's mouths, I didn't say or infer anything about "packing his bags just yet". I clearly said "if Van Gaal <b><i>persists </i></b>with his "philosophy" - i.e. over the long term - Adnan doesn't fit anywhere into it as it stands and if that situation stays the same <i>over the long term</i> he may well get fed up of sitting on the bench. Over the long term.

647~~~
Well, I hope that switch is sooner rather than later - and not just for Adnan's sake.

648~~~
I'd imagine (hope) it will happen after the international break, we should have a few of our injured players back by then.

649~~~
Januzaj isn't close to being our best player yet.

Di Maria is but he's better in the middle. Playing him wide in a 4-3-3 isn't better for him.

Januzaj does fit into the formation providing he's playing well enough to earn a place. Long term I think he'll end up as a #10 anyway, and right not he could play in one of the front three positions.

In lots of 3-5-2's one of the deeper forwards drifts wide behind a more advanced striker, for example Sanchez and Robben both did this at the World Cup and in the past players like Del Piero did the same. He does fit the system if he can earn a starting spot IMO.

650~~~
Van Gaal's clearly going to persist with his philosophy. Equally, if Januzaj doesn't start any games <i>over the long term </i>he's clearly going to want to leave.<i> 
</i>
Of course the two don't necessarily go hand in hand. Van Gaal's already played Januzaj in three different positions in the only formation he's used so far. He'll have more options when he tries different formations. Don't see the point making long term predictions this early in the season.

651~~~
Anderson had to come on as he was the only midfielder on the bench. Januzaj isn't one and he already played in midfield against Sunderland. It wasn't a success.

652~~~
It's getting more obvious each game. Maybe the system and supporting cast doesn't suit Mata, Rooney, & RVP, but for the past year Januzaj has outperformed all of them and he's only going to get better.

653~~~
We definitely improved after that substitution. No idea why but we did.

654~~~
Tbf, apart of Mata's & Roo's productivity (Mata has like 8 goals in his last 10 matches), they have been bang average and Januzaj has looked better at all the other things for the past year. His touch, vision, skill, penetration, directness, creativity, insight, pace, dribble, and so on.

655~~~
I was very underwhelmed by Januzaj against MK Dons and I would imagine LVG would have been.

He is a long way off nailing down a starting place in my opinion, unless we make the switch to two attacking wingers which I think suits him far better than being asked to play more inside.

656~~~
Can you define the words philosophy and formation for me please? Its just your misusing the former when you clearly mean the latter.

657~~~
This is his first really bad match, if he is a long way off nailing down a starting place Wayne, Mata, RVP should be in the reserves.

658~~~
I never like this rumours, even if they arent true. Ther eis always a possibility that they might be true. I just hope we switch to 4-3-3 and play him on the wing. He is not a wingback or a number 10 at the moment.

659~~~
Do you mean "your" or "you're"? And do you mean "it's" or "its"?

Please don't assume you know I mean something other than what I say. The word "philosophy" was used deliberately because that's what Van Gaal always refers to. If you want to know what it means, ask him not me.

660~~~
One thing is for sure Januzaj's body language has changed.. he looks frightened, which for me is a good thing.. every youngster should be worried that I need to earn my stripes to play for United. Some have compared him to Ronaldo and how the former had this insatiable hunger for the game.. whereas the latter looks abit too pleased with himself. It is normal for young players to think they have made it, i.e. he's got the 11 shirt... Moyes etc really rate him.

Now he's back to being a nobody of sorts, though I feel LVG does like him, he's possibly just testing him. Either way if Januzaj can't break into the side in its current state, then he probably is being rated above what he is truly capable of. He really does have it all going for him with this side... I think he can easily replace Mata, or one of the strikers.. or nail a starting spot in a 4-3-3... he just needs to seize the moment and be a matchwinner, make it impossible for LVG to leave him out.

661~~~
I think i'm right in saying...Januzaj is the only player along with De Gea to appear in every game so far this season, he might not be starting games but he is getting minutes and is usually the first attacking sub so i don't understand the worry about Januzaj not getting games or fitting into the side.

At the moment LVG is just picking a side from the fit players available to him, tactically the selection has not changed at all depending on the opposition, so while LVG gets to know the league i think the senior players will play when fit.

662~~~
The rumours seem to be growing. Realistically speaking, there really isn't a place for Januzaj in our team now. With LVGs open door policy with regard to players leaving, perhaps Januzaj has decided to cut his losses.

663~~~
You clearly mean that Januzaj doesn't fit into the 3-5-2. The idea that he doesn't fit in to Van Gaal's philosophy is utterly absurd.

664~~~
van Gaal's philosophy and 3-5-2 are 2 different things. 3-5-2 is a formation not a philosophy.

665~~~
I wish I agreed with you, but it seems Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia are more vital to LVG's vision than Adnan.

I just died a little.

666~~~
Which is exactly what I'm saying.

667~~~
Having taken the #11 shirt just over two weeks ago and the fact he's been one of the more marketable faces for us over this summer I'd be astounded to see him leave any time soon.

Sure his progress could go down the pan and he can become one of many recently overhyped players from the United ranks but to see him leave now would leave me jaw-dropped.

668~~~
LVG will have to switch to 4-3-3 at some point so Adnan and Di Maria will become two essential players.

669~~~
I really do hope we can switch to 4-3-3, he's so much better out wide right now. Even when we were doing so bad last season, Januzaj was enough to keep me excited throughout the season.

I apologize, I misunderstood your post. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

670~~~
As I've said before, don't be so arrogant as to tell me you know what I mean and I don't.

671~~~
Totally disagree with you on the body language thing. Confidence is so important to every player - HTF can you think its a good thing for a 19 year old to look frightened? Do you honestly think anyone would play better that way? That's absurd and surely you know that.

The rest I agree with so maybe you're not insane after all <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> .

672~~~
Well better explain how Januzaj doesn't fit into the philosophy, and I mean the philosophy. Not the formation, the philosophy. 

Because he so obviously is perfect for what LVG expects that's it's utterly bizarre to argue otherwise, he's just not a natural fit for a 3-5-2.

673~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Thats how I feel everytime I see the teamsheet with the names Young and Valencia on it.

674~~~
I remember Sterling going through the same thing for Liverpool. He burst onto the scene and then Rodgers took him down a peg or two. It done wonders for his game.. short term knock in confidence is fine as long as ultimately it leads to a more resilient, hungry and mature individual.

Obviously continuously dropping him and never playing him will kill the lad, I hope LVG knows how to strike the right balance.

675~~~
I'm not convinced he will. The signing of Blind seems to hint at us sticking with the 3-5-2.

676~~~
Fair point

677~~~
I don't have to explain anything to the likes of you.

678~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Lets be clear, your posts in this thread are along the lines of:

"Januzaj doesn't fit in to the philosophy"

You then agreed with someone saying that he doesn't fit in to the <i>formation </i>and stated you hope the transition to a 4-5-1 happens sooner rather than later and now are going on to the defensive because I stated that I think you've confused the idea of a formation and a philosophy. 

Do you not see why I think your statement of 'Januzaj doesn't fit into the philosophy' requires some actual explaining if you're insistent upon the fact that you didn't mean to say formation?

679~~~
I doubt Adnan is going anywhere. He's certainly our best youth product who has the best chance of nailing down a permanent starting XI role. Luckily, I doubt Van Gaal extends him the "special player" status some of his fanboy brigade on here have anointed him with. All his work is still ahead of him.

680~~~
We'll lose out of him, he can go to all the clubs in the world, every club would be happy to sign him, so why sit on the bench at this United and see how Valencia/Young are being started every week? He knows whats best for him and being in this team, on the bench isnt. While his agemate Sterling is now playing every week and is making progress every week Januzaj is no better than he was last season, and he'll also recognize that soon. I think these rumours are shite but if it goes on for a longer time, I wouldnt be surprised if he left. Our advantage is that we have signed him on a 5 year contract, so if we dont want 2 let go we dont and if we do, we'll get a big fee for him.

681~~~
I doubt Van Gaal cares about any of that. He's been around plenty of talented young players and most recently oversaw the rise of the likes of Kroos and Muller at Bayern. He knows how to bring young players along, so I'm not concerned. Adnan also strikes me as a more stable player than the likes of Pogba, in that he seems to be someone who will stay at one club longer than others.

682~~~
Go talk to a real Bayern fan, and he'll tell you that although LVG gave them their debut, he actually didnt want Alaba / Kroos and if it wasnt for their board Alaba Kroos wouldnt be at Bayern.

683~~~
So what are you saying ? Van Gaal doesn't care about youth ? I'd imagine his career track record might dispute this.

684~~~
No, he does, but lets not act as if because he has promoted much youth their is a guarantee that Adnan will be fine. I think Adnan will look up to his pal Pogba, he left United and it couldnt have gone better since, which club doesnt want him? He is now known as one of the biggest talents around and some call him even of the best midfielders around, wat Pogba has done is far more stable than just sit on the bench and dont get a chance.

685~~~
Well that's true. The priority here isn't Januzaj - its the squad and the system that drives it. If Januzaj exhibits the quality his forum fanboys insist he has, I'm sure Van Gaal will find a way to leverage it in his system. Its what I like about Van Gaal - he seems to care less about the hype of individuals and more about whether or not each individual is a team player. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

686~~~
Like Fergie you mean

687~~~
That's why he has the need to play RVP/Roo/Mata while its clear it doesnt work, about the 352 it will never work and I guarantee you that. Januzaj is not world class, but he is one of the best we have atm. For him to be relegated back to a place on the bench in a system that doesnt suit hem is frustrating, that's why if this continues a lot of people reckon he'll leave. LVG will find a way to leverage it in his system, what do you guys think? He is no God, the last good match he has had was against Spain, he is clearly struggling with this system.

688~~~
Patently not true. If that was the case then why does it appear Mata, Rooney and RVP are undroppable?

689~~~
Spot on.

690~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> We've played 3 league games so far. Hardly conclusive is it ?

691~~~
No, but our formation seems designed in order to accommodate them.

692~~~
Probably because they are. Who is going to displace Mata, a player who has been contributing and manufacturing goals since late last year. Doubt RvP is going anywhere and Rooney is captain.

693~~~
Which isn't wrong, considering the quality of the players in question. However, there's nothing to suggest he'll persist with that formation forever to accomodate them, is there?

694~~~
If that's the case, you've just debunked what you yourself said about putting the team first ahead of individuals.

695~~~
No, you're right. And to be clear, my issue isnt with those three. I love them, actually. My problem is that we need to promote youth and quality, two things that Young and Valencia don't provide on any level.

Im resigned to this system and seeing Young and Valencia as wing backs, so that means Adnan only has a chance of playing as one of he top three.

Not sure if that makes sense...

696~~~
I haven't actually - they are integral parts of the system which makes them undroppable. If they weren't, i'm sure they wouldn't be starting.

697~~~
Incorrect. Our formation is designed to mask the lack of a genuinely world class midfielder (similar to the Netherlands losing Strootman to injury), quality wingers (attested by Van Gaal himself), centre-backs that are prone to lapses in judgement and injured defensive backs. He's also talked of an abundance of #10s of which Shinji has already departed and there might be others in the future. Believe that Van Gaal isn't one for reputations - neither one of Mata, RVP or Wayne are safe if they keep on under performing. There's conclusive evidence of that in Louis' past managerial trysts - Gomez, Toni, Riquelme and the like.

698~~~
You cant have it both ways though. You cant say that we need to have a system which puts the team first, then at the same time say our front three players are undroppable. That's simply not a logical standpoint, as those two statements are contradictory.

699~~~
We don't actually. We need to build a strong team, irrespective of where the players are sourced from. They could all be outside buys or youth players - where they come from is irrelevant. Young and Valencia are obviously not good enough, but still remain decent squad players to keep around to back up the newer signings.

700~~~
Let's just say they are the least likely of all our players to be dropped (excluding our new buys). They are vital to Van Gaal's system (well maybe not so much with Mata, but he is important).

701~~~
If we don't promote youth, the youth system itself will fail. If they cant believe that they'll be given a chance, we will end up with an academy as pointless as City's and Chelsea's.

Nevermind the old United adage of promoting youth, which is something our club's legacy is hugely based on.

702~~~
Hate to break it to you, but our academy is pretty pointless.

We're likely about to sell/loan our two best prospects of the last 7-8 years. Shows it all really.

703~~~
That's the reality of football in the sugar daddy ownership era. Clubs like United are forced to rely more on outside signings than their youth system in order to keep up with other rich clubs who are ostensibly buying their way to success through expensive signings. We failed to invest appropriately over the past five years, and are now suddenly scrambling to play catch up with other big clubs - probably to the detriment of youth players coming through, although we do have a few good youth players other than Januzaj who can make it.

704~~~
I agree that this is likely, but It doesn't mean I have to like it.

Ultimately, everyone will agree that as long as we're winning it doesn't matter where the players come. But when we're not, questions will be raised, even if it only is three games into the season.

Again, I want to make it clear that my gripe is simple: any system that requires Young and Valencia to start and play a full 90 instead of a clearly, CLEARLY better player in Januzaj is messed up.

705~~~
I know, it's true. But at what point does it become insanity to keep doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result?

By this I mean Young and Valencia. It would make far more sense by now to try someone unproven to be given a shot as they cannot possibly do a worse job.

706~~~
I'd be shocked if Young and Valencia are considered as permanent starters. The only reason they are seeing a lot of playing time now is because they had a full summer tour to prepare under Van Gaal's tutelage, whereas Adnan didn't have the same benefit and needs to prove himself to Van Gaal, at which point he will play progressively more. Easy to forget he's still only 19.

707~~~
Januzaj pass <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/iKHwuVT1Af4zL.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/iKHwuVT1Af4zL.gif"/>

708~~~
Januzaj is - or should be - one of the biggest talents in world football. He is on the same level as the likes of Pogba and Sterling, and for me he needs to be playing every week - I don't care where, just get him on the pitch.

If we were to end up losing Januzaj then even for LVG I think the fans would very quickly turn on him - and frankly they would have a point.

709~~~
He does appear that way, but nothing shocks me. He's still just a kid, soon he'll have a complete mind of his own.

710~~~
Is there even any concrete news that Januzaj is leaving?

711~~~
Still better in terms of giving chances and trusting youth players than every other PL club apart from Southampton.

712~~~

713~~~
How reliable is that info?

714~~~
Both of whom have played a shit load of games during successful seasons for the club. So hardly pointless.

715~~~
<i>Pretty </i>pointless.

We're talking about two players out of how many? Neither of whom have ever been anything other than squad players for us and both of whom are now apparently deemed not good enough and fit to move on.

It's not exactly a great advertisement for the quality of our youth setup.

716~~~
We're not talking about just two players though. Evans is another one.

So we've three first team regulars who played a lot of football during title-winning seasons (five if you take into account the games that Giggs and Scholes played during the same period of time) who came from our academy. How many other PL winning clubs can say that? Before those three we had Fletcher, O'Shea and Brown who played a big part in winning the league <b>and</b> the Champion's League (alongside the perennial Giggs and Scholes). Again, how does that compare to other PL clubs?

That's just judging our academy on their influence while still at the club. Looking at the bigger picture, we've produced an awful lot of solid PL players who are having decent careers since leaving United. Who will have earned us a reasonable amount of money, when you add all their transfer fees together.

So, not really "pretty pointless" at all.

717~~~
I didn't count Evans as that's not within a certain timeframe, though. Him and Fletcher were certainly good products of the academy.

Anyway, I wasn't comparing it to other PL clubs, I said it's pretty pointless, by the supposedly huge standards we seem to have with our academy. A poster was complaining that we're not really putting faith into it any more, but why put faith when it can't produce any top players for us? Adnan will hopefully be the exception to that.

You can argue all you want that we've still gotten more games out of academy players than plenty of other PL clubs have, and that's true, but I'm not sure how Tom Cleverley getting lots of games can be construed as good, really. We simply haven't produced an academy product good enough to be a regular first XI player for us in a long time.

718~~~
I don't really see the academy as breeding ground for "stars", though. Not when we're talking about English/Irish players anyway, as they'll only ever be as good as the national team they might end up playing for (i.e. in recent years, not very). If our academy can keep churning out decent squad players that's still a valuable resource. In terms of potential stars, they're more likely to start their career in another academy and move to United when they're a little older. Januzaj and Rafael the most recent examples. Pogba, Rossi and Pique also being relevant. A pity their careers turned out the way they did but still reflects well on our academy that we "produced" them.

This might change if the quality of English player being produced in general is on the up. Liverpool have Sterling and the careers of Wilson, Rothwell, Mitchell and Pearson might follow a similar path. Time will tell.

719~~~
Not sure how reliable he is but he's followed by some high caliber Manchester based Journalists like Mike Keegan.

720~~~
I think Januzaj should be one of the first names on the team sheet.

721~~~
So, assuming we make Falcao our main man, and RVP is our for some time, do you guys see him starting in right winger position? Something like that:
----------Falcao--------

--Rooney--------------Januzaj--

-----Di Maria-----Herrera------

---------------Blind-------------
I think it would be perfect for him and for us.

722~~~
“Indeed, it is speculation. However, I can be very clear. There is no problem with Januzaj at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a>,” he told <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.voetbalnieuws.be/news/136785/Manager_schept_duidelijkheid_over_toekomst_Januzaj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Voetbal Nieuws</a>.

When asked whether <a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/tag/di-maria/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Angel di Maria</a>‘s arrival effects Januzaj’s opportunities, De Vriese said: “Certainly not. Adnan has stitches in his mouth because he has suffered an injury.'

“The club and coach have every confidence in him. He has not been given the No.11 for nothing. The arrival of the new players who are going to play will definitely play no role in his further development.”

<a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/2014/09/01/adnan-januzajs-agent-confirms-staying-manchester-united-52307/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thepeoplesperson.com/2014/09...ent-confirms-staying-manchester-united-52307/</a>

723~~~
Still trying to decide this lads position. I am leaning towards him being a winger who cuts inside from the right but our current formation does not allow him to do that.

724~~~
The sooner we move to 4-3-3 so he can play on the right side of the front 3, the better.

725~~~
I can see him play a similar role like Reus or Ronaldo. Let him get to full fitness and he will thrive under LVG

726~~~
I think he will become more Reus like than Ronaldo, although Reus also scores lots of goals I dont think Januzaj will become a prolific goalscorer, he'll be more of a team player, the question is will he become it here or elsewhere. If we keep him on the bench the coming two years, it will be elsewhere.

727~~~
I was surprised by his goals last season, especially in the beginning. I can see him scoring plenty of goals and it's no wonder some people see him as a striker (I dont but it shows you that he has the ability)

728~~~
Does anyone have an explanation for his apparent lack of energy sometimes?

I'm a big fan of Januzaj, but today again (he played 30 mins for Belgium) I got the impression that he doesn't really seize every chance he gets. 
If he receives the ball, he'll try to make something happen. If he or a teammate loses the ball, he tracks back at speed. If a teammate recovers the ball in midfield, however, he often strolls forward instead of sprinting. 

It's something I don't really understand. A lot of other youngsters in attacking positions will make sure they're always available for a pass and join every counterattack, when they only get 20 or 30 minutes. 

I don't know if he just tries to be disciplined tactically, can't handle the intensity of multiple sprints in a short time or if it's a kind of laziness (would surprise me, given the effort he puts in tracking back sometimes).

Thoughts?

729~~~
I saw his performance too and I can see what you're talking about. He was often too far behind to join the attack after he had tracked the run of Australia's lb/lw.

730~~~
Hmm yeah, that's something he can improve on. Maybe he feels sometimes he doesn't have the speed joining the counter from deep when he's behind others.

Depends also on the tactical set up he is playing tbf.

731~~~
I think he will thrive this season, with space provided by the movement of Falcao, RVP/Rooney and the pace of Di Maria. I think he will cement himself as first choice on the right wing this season IMO.

732~~~
By 'decide' do you mean 'guess'?

Unless you're LvG in which case I apologise <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

733~~~
Am I the only one that thinks he a tad overrated on here?

Don't get me wrong, the kid is hugely talented, and was the shining light in a woeful season last year. But people on here seem to talk as if its a matter of time until he's a first team regular, till he's our best player, and until he's the best player in the world. The 'next Ronaldo' and all that. Yet, has he really shown <i>that </i>much yet? Enough to deserve those kind of comments and comparisons? I mean someone like Sterling for example has shown a lot more, in a better team, and yet most still rate Januzaj over him (United bias and all that). I'm hugely excited for Januzaj's future, and what he might achieve. But I just don't think its quite as clear cut and certain as many believe.

734~~~
Maybe the manager asked him to hang back so he could use his long shooting on any loose balls.

735~~~
You mentioned 4 different categories of assumption there. I don't see many calling him the next Ronaldo or best player in the world etc..but yeah, he should be a first regular given his talent. Don't think that's overrating him at all.

And as for Sterling right now he's gone ahead this season but he is getting playing time regularly with the team sort of structured around him and sturridge right now and it's also his 3rd season. Januzaj has more competition in attacking areas and we've shifted formations this season which has meant him being used as a Sub mostly. 

I'd say most would agree Sterling is better right now. Whose a better talent is up for debate.

736~~~
I expect this season will be more about learning than actually impressing every game for him (when he plays).

Last season he had the 'advantage' that the team was lacking any kind of creativity and flair. When he played, creating was his main goal. If a pass failed, he'd try it again the next minute because the other players and the manager knew he was the one they were looking for to create. He was the man that was capable to provide something they couldn't. In short, he was Utd's main attacking player.

Now it's different. Other, more high-profile and maybe better, players have come in/back and have become the main men. When Januzaj gets his chance, he's just one of the players now, meaning the defensive and tactical part of his game has become a lot more important than it was last season. During the first few games this season he had to adapt to that, it's something that will take time but will be very important for his career.
For his type of player, decision making is key. I'm sure Giggs and Van Gaal will improve that.

The 30 mins today and his cameo as a central midfielder emphasized that. Playing in a different role or with other instructions (Belgium's manager wants defensive stability) he didn't yet find the right balance. 

Playing as a central midfielder that time, most of his passes were safe, even when we needed the 'killer-pass'. It's all part of adapting to new responsibilities and roles. In the end it will help him and he'll be fantastic, but it might limit his playing time this season, knowing the competition.

737~~~
His long range shooting is interesting aspect that has gotten into his game more. 

He is attempting more and more long rangers these days when he barely used to shoot much in the u21 days. Wonder if that's a aspect that has been picked up by the coaches in training and he's been told to do it more as his accuracy still has to improve in match situations and results in him being more selfish almost in a Ronaldo/Bale way which he wasn't earlier or even when he broke through.

738~~~
I rate him a lot higher talent wise as a central attacking midfielder than as a winger. I don't think he has the acceleration, pace and dribbling to be one of the worlds very finest wingers. 

Centrally though his dribbling and drive is already world class and his shooting, vision and playmaking is at a really high level too. The only negative in his game is that he loses the ball a lot(more than Nani) and his defensive work rate is poor. 

Both those things comes with first team experience though. I think he is too good for his own good, United will be scared to sell him and pull a Pogba but he won't get enough game time here either.

739~~~
Depends on the setup and the role he's asked to play really.

Put him in the Liverpool team with Sturridge and Sterling the way they are playing right or like Argentina were playing yesterday in a more fluid interchanging front 3 and he will thrive just like Lamela and Di Maria did yesterday along with Aguero. In this formation playing him as wingback, central midfield sub appearances and such will take time find his role.

Surprised he hasn't been used centrally yet as one of the front though there's lot of competition there. (Though now reduced.)

For essence Di Maria was good against Burnley playing as #8 though sloppy, seeing him in the Argentina setup was just another couple of levels above given a free attacking role.

Match comp is up!

I don't agree with the comments about a lack of energy coming from Januzaj. He came on and did well both offensively and defensively (at tracking runners), plus it's a friendly match so I don't think much should be expected anyway.

741~~~
This boy is an amazing talent no matter what someone says. Barring an injury or huge dip in form he's going to be a worldie.

742~~~
Decent performance. Some good moments and some sloppy touches.

Anyway, i don't get why Belgium with so many fluid and good players in attack and good pacy focal points too always seem to play so rigid.

743~~~
Wilmots just can't get the team to be great in attack. Even Hazard looked neutered under him.

744~~~
I disagree. He showed last season how talented he is and that he can decide games. Sometimes, he was by far our best player being just 18 years old (which didnt speak for the other players).

But, what people need to keep in mind is that it will be up and down with him. He will have games where he will be amazing, but then also games where he looks out of depth - natural process for a young talented player

745~~~
4-3-3 would be ideal for him. Now, can you give us an ideal lineup with Januzaj?

746~~~
He won't be starting yet. He iso only 19, he is behind a lot of world class players and it depends on what formation we use. I think he will end up being a 10 but right now that position has a few players vying for it.

747~~~
Must admit that I started to watch Belgium right after Januzaj joined the squad but I can't understand how they could make the world cup, they are so poor tactically and also individually. Maybe it is harsh to say but looking at their display say last 10 matches they jsut struggle and maybe they should go for another coach, Januzaj never gets the ball soon enough he is cut off the game often. And if you look at the players you can use, some of them are just world class at their positions. Wilmots just couldnt do worse than he did. Just a thought

748~~~
100% agree...Wilmots isn't the right one for this team......like Moyes for Manchester United

749~~~
Even if we start to play 4-3-3 from now on, Adnan won't probably start most matches.

750~~~
Aha. He is only 19, but we had to give him a big contract to keep him away from PSG last season. He's a 19 year old on 60k a week and is one of the highest paid teens in world football. He's in a position to ask for guarantees on game time and he can only point to his agemate Sterling at Liverpool who's arguably in his class and playing week in week out (Sterling is only 2 months older than Januzaj but born in separate years). LVG has a job on his hands as far as what he intends to do with Januzaj given our rich attacking options. Januzaj's agent will probably on the phone with other teams this January, loand, permanent deal proposals etc. I only have confidence that the teams that can unsettle him are dealing with FFP and Chelsea and Real are unlikely to pounce as early as January.
Indeed. If Januzaj plays in 4-3-3 then which other two players join him upfront when we have three or possibly even four others to pick from?

751~~~
The swing in general mood of conversation with regards to young big talents and Ed Woodward bear a lot of similarities. Make of that what you will.

752~~~
Every player sort of is but that would be presumptuous tbh. He (and us as fans too) shouldn't use Sterling as an example, every player follows his own trajectory.
If his agent will create a mess then so be it. There are better players than him at the club, he can only work harder and grab his opportunities.
Adnan has great talent but there has been a lot of players during the start who have never delivered on their initial talent, patience should be used here by us and him.

753~~~
Yes. He is mostly rated very highly by United fans. But hey, thats ok. You want your guy to do well. And some media, even international ones jumped on the bandwagon because he is a United player. So you cant blame fans that much,
specially in the times United is right now.
I stand by the fact that he was good, nothing more till today.
Lets be honest. It isnt helping the kid to push him. Some really should rest heir hype a bit, its only helping if they do.
And stop the paying thing. United takes a risk with him and have the money to overpay for chance. He didnt deserve it by now.

754~~~
Yes, what more do people want at 18 years old ffs?

755~~~
I really liked him but questioned his lack of pace and never thought he'd make it as a top winger.. for him to be an elite player it would have to be as a striker or a number 10. Someone mentioned his lack of energy and it is telling that he doesn't drive at full-backs consistently enough to be a top winger.. compare him to a young Ronaldo/Giggs/Robben and they had so much pace and energy about them. 

Januzaj has games where he seems to be able to run at full backs and then other games where he doesn't look like he can beat his man down the outside.. and I noticed last year especially against Shaw and Flanagan, he was kept in their pocket because they were faster than him.  

On the left wing, he can play more of a Beckham role.. i.e. cross the ball and it is easier for him to run down the outside more. As a 10 his passing ability is fine and you don't need as much pace in that role but you do need energy.. to get on the ball constantly and make things happen, he can't just stand there and wait for the game to come to him.

I don't think he is a nailed on certainty to be a top player, he has to work hard to elevate his game to break through into this United set up in light of more money being spent on talent being brought in. Competing with the likes of Rooney, RVP, Mata is one thing because they're all slow.. but once LVG starts bringing in more energetic high-calibre talent.. Januzaj is going to have to prove he is worthy of a part in this revolution.

756~~~
Ideal? I wouldn't call my line-up ideal but this is what I'd go with from our current team.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s22.postimg.org/l1k6zdp81/Untitled.jpg" src="http://s22.postimg.org/l1k6zdp81/Untitled.jpg"/></a>

757~~~
I would be amazed if this is true. Most reports suggested it's 30 k

758~~~
With our current personnel and knowing Rooney is not going to be dropped, almost exactly the line up I'd like to see except maybe Smalling for Jones. I just don't see LVG giving Januzaj that shot though with RVP and Mata around.

759~~~
Where does this leave a fully fit RVP and Mata?

760~~~
Competing with Falcao, Januzaj and Rooney. At top clubs you should always have strong competition for starting places.

761~~~
Before the season started I'd have went with Smalling as well, but in our first 3 games Jones has been good so for now he'd be my first choice CB, of course Rojo is still very much an unknown quantity, no telling if he can uproot Blackett full time.

762~~~
This is the formations we will likely to play with maybe some players in other places. Di Maria can play on the wing with Mata in midfield, RVP instead Falcao or Mata instead Januzaj. You need good backups from the bench and having quallity players like Mata and RVP on the bench is good thing. And with our luck with injuries everybody will get games sooner rather than later.

763~~~
It is 60k a week. I know there are different figures out there. The Sun reported 45k-50k. The Daily Shit and the Mirror reported 60, Telegraph reported 30. From what I understand, he was initially offered 30k from 1k a week but it was raised through the roof when PSG  made him an offer of even more money than that. This was confirmed by his agent and was reported on Sky sports (other teams not mentioned apparently did too, one rumored to be City). The lucrative offer PSG put on the table forced United to offer twice the original basic salary. United wanted to avoid another Pogba like situation and during the negotiations Moyes played Januzaj a lot (Moyes was given credit for playing the kid but the truth is there were other reasons why he did at the time)

764~~~
This would be our best formation for Januzaj and Di Maria in fact assuming he is given free role -


----------------Falcao------------------
---Di Maria-------Mata---------Januzaj
-------------Blind-----Herrera--------


Falcao a strong, quick focal point and Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj all interchanging in a fluid formation behind.

Can Pigeonhole Rooney there somewhere in a few roles if we have to fit him in as well removing Blind/Mata/Herrera.

765~~~
Its a short season, <i>maximum</i> 42 games (left) if we get to the FA cup final. I expect Januzaj to feature, I just don't know how much time he'll get.

766~~~
Well if true, then he is a bit of a mercenary and won't be here for long as soon as another club can offer either more money or more playing time. I also never had the impression he loves the club as much as a youngster who has been with us for a while should do (and I don't just mean the British players, DDG for example truly loves us) 

* a lot of alerts incoming due to me daring to question anything related to Januzaj *

767~~~
Of course, but when all are fit, I expect Januzaj to get less minutes than our other attacking options, or basically they'll be given more starts and the kid will have to make due with more sub appearances. Now, if Januzaj comes in and shows he's better suited to whatever system LVG has us play, he'll probably push someone out.

768~~~
Well yes, I mean the seniors will get the starts at first and he'll have to push one out, but this formation gives him a much better shot at it than the 3-5-2 IMO.

769~~~
I mentioned this on another forum, about us having to pay more to keep him, and I got a lot of abuse. People need to realise many players see football as a career first and foremost, and their agents will act in ways to get the best deal for their clients and themselves of course. Im not saying the kid is a mercenary, but money talks, if we didn't step up our offer he'd be at PSG. His agent said it wasn't really about the money, and that Januzaj would've resisted the other teams, but lets be realistic, he only said this after United offered more and after the deal was done. Its romantic to say Januzaj would've stayed regardless of what United offered him but its more likely far from the truth. This is what his agent said

Dirk De Vriese told Sport/Voetbal Magazine: "I can only say that he's the best paid youngster in the world. He earns more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi did when they were 19. That means a lot and I'm proud of it.

"We could have waited a little longer and seen how much United wanted him to stay and how much other teams were interested in him.

"All big clubs were knocking on the door, especially PSG.

"Five minutes before we signed a new deal, an advisor of their Qatari chairman called me with an astonishing offer.

"Because Adnan was going to be a free agent at the end of the season, they were ready to offer him anything he wanted, wages and signing on fee.

"But money has never been a deciding factor in his choices. It wasn't important when he chose to join Manchester United. He could have signed a better deal at Anderlecht."

I knew something was up because the PSG rumors were rife before the contract was announced, and the negotiations took longer than expected. Many have forgot.

770~~~
You're right, but I see LVG continuing with 3-5-2 until the players get it. He said it would take three months at least. Ditching it now would suggest admitting failure (which is not necessarily bad) or suggest that he gave up on it early, allowing idiots to question his long term planning, you know how it goes.

771~~~
The thing is 30 k are market value for a talented youngster, already great money, and if he / his father can't resist 10 k -20k more PSG were offering in order to stay at United and not join a much weaker league at his age, then something is really wrong with them.

Offering huge money to established stars is one thing, but if we have to offer ridiculous money to unproven youngsters for them to stay then something is terribly wrong at United.
I mean Rojo, a starter for Argentina won't be on much more, if at all. I doubt Madrid are offering Isco, a much better player, much more. And Barca's Pedro isn't on much more either. This is actually depressing if true. And yes I remember there were long contract talks before Januzaj finally signed, so ofc they were negotiating a lot!

772~~~
Its crazy. I don't care how talented he is, we offered him that much money on the back of 3-4 first team appearances (at the time he signed). Thats the way it is I guess.

773~~~
You are crazy if you think isco and pedro are earning less than 60k a week. And I really think its strange that people hold it against footballers gettting the best deal possible for themselves.

774~~~
No I am not. Maybe they are earning a bit more. I mean you don't even have to leave United for comparison: Carrick/Vidic/Evra were never on more than 80/90 k at United, while Januzaj without doing anything for United is on 60 k. 

I don't care what anyone says but if he is that motivated by money already then I doubt he even has the mentality to reach his potential.

775~~~
He's on 30 to 50k max per week as per reports which is pretty fair. Don't see what the debate is about here.

Probably has a increasing per year wage rate with appearances he makes etc..

776~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://sport.news.am/eng/news/26101/isco-becomes-one-of-reals-lowest-earners.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sport.news.am/eng/news/26101/isco-becomes-one-of-reals-lowest-earners.html</a>

Now I have taken the reported 2 mil € as net (to be on the safe side) and therefore gone with 4 mil € gross: You'll have 76 k € per week, that for a player who was much much more proven when Madrid signed him.

777~~~
Because money as a motivator is a bad thing?

And I can assure you vidic atleast would have been on more than 80k.

778~~~
Young is reportedly on more than £100,000 a week. Enough said.

He scored both our goals on his full debut at the age of 18. I think that counts for something. We had to pay him what he wanted as we couldn't have a repeat of the Pogba incident. Would you have rather we refused to pay what he wanted and lost him on a free? There's a reason all the top clubs in Europe were sniffing around.

If he was motivated by money he could have waited until his contract expired and he would have had a huge signing on bonus and great wages. He isn't motivated by money. Simple as.

779~~~
So earning more than 60k per week? That too when the euro was a lot stronger than the pound.

780~~~
Yep, just like you assured me the Isco salary.

781~~~
Cool!

782~~~
Great response. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

I know I picked apart your argument but you could at least try to back your points up.

783~~~
Well there is not much to discuss with you if you can't see the point. I said in my original post that I doubt Isco would be on much more, I didn't say he was on much less. And I have gone with 4 mil whereas I could have gone with 3.5 or  3.7 mil a year and devided it by 52. 
Anyway, Isco is the much better player, so if Januzaj is earning 60 k, then it would be "fair" for Isco to demand 120 k

784~~~
Maths isnt your strong point, is it? 75k euros are 59.5k pound today, so a year ago when the euro was a lot stronger than isco salary was more than 60k. Should I explain it again? Oh and according to articles his salary has performance clauses in it resulting in a much higher salary once he fulfills those clauses.

785~~~
Nope, you should back up your point as you presented it as fact that he is not motivated by money, whereas the long contract negotiations, Moyes playing him a lot during those negotiations (whereas after that he didn't that much and LvG isn't playing him much) and that interview I just read that he is the best paid youngster in the world and is earning more than Ronaldo/Messi did when they were at his age, at least suggest that he could be mainly motivated by money. And I find this hard to stomach for someone so young who has been with our academy for a while.

If you want to believe what suits you, then fair enough, not my concern!

786~~~
You can read again what I said, I already explained it and won't repeat it.

787~~~
He didn't play much after he signed the contract? He started the first game we played after he signed the new contract (Southampton at home). He was also our most important player at the turn of the year. He was played even more after he signed the contract and that is a fact. LVG is only playing him less now and he can't play many positions in our current formation.

That same interview you mentioned also includes his agent saying that just before he signed the contract with us he was offered an "astonishing" contract from PSG which suggests he turned down more money than we were offering to stay at the club. As I mentioned already he also could have let his contract run down and earned even more by joining a club on a free transfer.

788~~~
<a class="username" data-user="45896, @MJJ" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/45896/">@MJJ</a>
Here's another one for you which states Isco's salary at exactly 60 k £. You'll also see how much other RM youngsters are earning.
Carvajal 35 k
Jesse 30 k

789~~~
Well I doubt we would have played him at all if he had done that. Anyway, good luck to him and his deserved salary.

790~~~

<b>Adnan Januzaj</b> 19 <b>£40K – <b>£</b>50K</b>

<img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/><img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/>

791~~~
If he was motivated by money that wouldn't have bothered him.

792~~~
I think it's a bad thing. Guardiola agrees, saying the best players aren't motivated by money.

793~~~
It really doesn't matter, 50 k is way above market average in Europe for an 18/19 year old who didn't have more than three 1st team appearances behind him.

794~~~
Is that why messi throws a strop over his contract? Ditto for ronaldo? Salary is used as the major basis to see where you stand amongst your competitors.  Since he is better than all our wingers or atleast on par with them, then he should be earning a similar salary regardless of his age.

795~~~
The thing is LvG has a get-out in this case as he has said numerous times that he was only using the system due to his selection choices, where as he prefers 4-3-3, so he can easy say the change is due to him now having the players he needs with the additions to play his favoured system without it looking like he is admitting failure. If we stick with 3-5-2 I don't see Januzaj progressing at all, despite what some say he is not ready to be play as a #10 and is wasted as a wingback.

796~~~
I love this line-up except that our Right side would be a little weak defensively....Januzaj doesn't drop back much, Herrera has been seen to have lapses in that department, Rafael loves to rush onward and forward more than defend and Jones is a Wild Card, can be good on some occasions/disastrous on others.

Unless we bring in Hummels for Jones in Jan along with Strootman for Blind as First Choices!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Of course Wilson and RvP can switch for Falcao, Rooney and Blackett will be Rojo's backup...

797~~~
This was awesome!

798~~~
United_99 doesn't really know much about United. It's obvious he knows nothing of Januzaj. First claiming that he only did well against sunderland and Hull, even though he was our best player in the game right after the Sunderland match. Now he's claiming that Moyes didn't play him much after he signed a new contract. He played 30 more games after he signed a new contract and played just 5 before signing a new contract. How wrong can someone be?

He also makes more than Ronaldo or Messi at the same age because there is more money now in football than back then. Just look at how much more money clubs make now a days compared to 2003-2006. Not to mention that Ronaldo signed a contract with United prior to playing for United as that's how transfers work while Januzaj was on his last year of contract last season. United did not want a repeat of the Pogba situation and Januzaj impressed in the youth teams more than Pogba did. Anybody that payed attention to the youth teams would know that.

799~~~
Yep indeed I don't know much about United. Thank God I have ppl like you to teach me stuff about United and our youth teams.

Btw I was wrong about his appearances, I just checked and now I am actually really shocked because I genuinly don't remember him impressing much apart from those 2 games you mentioned. Of course I know he got minutes here and there in other games, but he actually got much more minutes than I thought / remember.

800~~~
Also excelled vs Norwich at Old Trafford, vs Hull at Old Trafford, vs Aston Vill at Villa Park, vs Fulham at Craven Cottage, vs Stoke at Old Trafford, vs Swansea at Old Trafford, vs Aston Villa at Old Trafford, vs Newcastle at St. James' Park. That's about 10 great performances in his first year of first team football. All this despite not playing much since the turn of the year.

801~~~
Huh? Hull is one of them! Fulham? You mean when he joined the party "crosses to noone"? Come on, that's hardly "excelling". I mean put any youngster / decent footballer on the pitch and they will do something useful once or twice a match at least. But that's really not a high level there.

802~~~
I'm sorry for attacking you, but some of the things you said regarding Januzaj were so wrong that your comments came of as a wum.

Also vs Southampton at Old Trafford, vs Newcastle at Old Trafford (which I believe is one of his best performances), and even in matches where his performance wasn't great, he was our best player. Like vs Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Nobody else was better and that's why everyone on this forum nominated him as motm. That's a great season for a 18 year old who only started in half of his matches. People forget as football is a what have you done for me lately business.

The crossing record was at Old Trafford. The Fulham match he's talking about is the match at Craven Cottage where he had an assist.

803~~~
Oh OK, don't remember him doing much other than being protected by Fellaini (if it even was that match).

804~~~
Jesús of Nazareth !

How about getting the facts right ?

805~~~
He's being deadset underrated by a few on here now because he's been playing wingback and then CM this season in cameo appearances. And then playing with some sort of stitches in his mouth for a game or 2 as his agent confirmed.

Most saying he won't start over Rooney out wide in a 4-3-3 would be moaning in couple of games of Rooney playing there and him coming as a sub for him to start over Rooney.

806~~~
Er.. no need to include the Hull game as I have already said he impressed against Hull. But thanks for the ratings against Fulham which show Valencia as MoM!

807~~~
So what ? Valencia was quite excellent vs Fulham. Which of course you won't remember, since you so clearly don't recall a lot of United's performances from last season and admitted to only noticing Januzaj post Reither's stamp and its after effects at Craven Cottage.

808~~~
Valencia vs Fulham away was one of Valencia's rare performances that you could classify as great. Vidic was also great in that match.

809~~~
Oh just because I don't recall an assist by Januzaj or one great touch or whatever doesn't mean I don't recall our performances. As if you recalled all his assists immediately and didn't have to look up.

810~~~
That was a great performance from him. Should have won a couple of fouls in that match where he clearly beat Fulham defenders, unless you wanted him to score as well to deem it as great. Rooney was really great in that match too.

811~~~
1. What kind of logic is that please ? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> He was unanimously excellent. Don't need to have an Eidetic memory to to arrive at that conclusion.

2. Yes. One doesn't need to look them up. Matter of fact his best "assist" wasn't even an assist. That pass to Rooney vs Stoke that Begovic blocked and Robin subsequently scored from was the best of the lot. None of the stat sites will show his anticipation and weight on the pass. Or his dribbling ability vs Swansea at the halfway line. Or the movement to set himself up vs Newcastle. Or the mesmerising run vs Sevilla in August. Perks of watching matches these are !

812~~~
OK guys, whatever.

Maybe I just have another opinion of a very top talent. Noone said Januzaj is crap, but I just don't call most of what he did last season that impressive that I have to remember it and write about his dribble against Swansea. I mean Ashley Young looked like Messi for 5 seconds only a few days ago when he actually took someone on.
What I call impressive and memorable is for example Sterling's composure and great finish in a high pressure game last season against City. As for dribbling, Sterling does it all the time so I find it a bit strange to write about Januzaj's "dribbling ability against Swansea".
It's a bit like ppl claiming Rooney was our best player last season. Well, yeah he scored and assisted as usual, and I don't remember exactly against who he dribbled, assisted or whatever, but what I remember is that the whole last season he didn't do anything impressive at all for a supposed world class player (apart from against Leverkusen when the whole team played well).
Now Januzaj is no Rooney and 10 years younger, but for me he just didn't have many "wow" moments last season for a supposed world class talent.

813~~~
I do think Rooney was our best outfield player last season. But that's not saying much, he was only decent for what he is capable of.

But I agree on Adnan. If he had replicated Ashley youngs first 6 months with utd he would be heralded as even greater as he is now.  In reality he has a lot to do.

814~~~
Sterling is better. Januzaj did have his wow moments though. There is a difference between saying what you just said and "only impressed against Hull and Sunderland" or "he didn't play much after the contract." It showed that you really didn't pay attention.
I wouldn't. Despite Young's end product, I wanted Januzaj to show the creativity and passing he showed for the youth team. Young didn't do that in 2011 despite the end product. The individual skill Januzaj showed last season is what makes me believe he has big potential. The gifs in the spoiler show passing that I would like to see Adnan replicate in the coming years.

815~~~
I don't understand this line of thought to be fair. Seems highly reactionary on the basis of one season. Sterling is about a year and a quarter bit more experienced than Januzaj who was only in his debut season of top level football. It's September in Adnan's second season right ? Well at this stage last season (i.e. Sterling's sophomore season) he was dropped by Rodgers and a lot Liverpool supporters were at his throats, some even describing him as a wasted talent at such young an age.

Yet one season later - he's to a man the best teenager in the world ? I'd agree he has the edge but it's only for now. Adnan is still adapting while Sterling is into his fourth season. In 2012/ 2013 Sterling scored 2 and assisted just 2 in 19 league starts. Yet Sterling has more composure and finishing ability than Januzaj who scored 4 and assisted 3 in league 15 starts in 2013/ 2014 ?

People talk of Cristiano and it's all really good, but isn't there the benefit of hindsight ? He had scored a similar 4 and assisted 4 in 14 league starts in 2003/ 2004. There were loads of people who didn't rate him at all. A vast number even preferred Quarsema. The vast majority thought Robben and Reyes were better during the early years. You don't even have to look far.

Here's a sample comment from the Caf itself during his early years in rebuttal to Ronaldo's critics :

Here's one leveled at someone who was a Ronaldo fan :

Others posting this :


Concern over his finishing ability :

One talks about how Adnan played well only vs the smaller teams. And Ronaldo himself wasn't very impressive vs the bigger teams at the start. His best debut season performance was vs bloody Milwall. He was subsequently labelled a one trick pony, a diver like Adnan and a good time Charlie who didn't show up vs big teams (especially Europe where he didn't score a goal until his 3rd season). Keane and Neville even openly criticized his play. But the fact of the matter is Moyes didn't play Januzaj in a lot of bigger matches : Didn't play vs Bayern or City, just 15 mins vs Arsenal away and Liverpool at OT. Started just one match against a big 4 opponent vs Chelsea and Stamford Bridge and was simply our best player. The nutmeg of Ivanovic and another instance where he turned Chelsea's defense inside out to set Welbeck up for a goal (which he didn't score) were worthy of highlight reels.

Januzaj showed remarkable poise, great technique and dribbling ability, composure and most importantly the belief - he always showed up when more experienced players went into hiding.

Even someone like Van Persie who is more well placed to comment had this take on Adnan :

He believes Januzaj is the second or even the first most talented player he's ever seen. This coming from someone who played with a young Robben, Sneijder, van der Vaart for Holland, played for Feyenoord when Ibrahimovic was at Ajax; and Cesc, Ramsey, Wilshere, Nasri at Arsenal.

Januzaj need's to get used to his frame first before he really excels IMO. 

Sterling on the other hand has been 5 foot for years, his balance can work well for him. Eventually though Januzaj will become more like a Kaka I feel, he just needs to get used to when to dribble or pass, and when to drop a shoulder and run passed people. At times he chooses to run into blind alleys, or try a pass which was never on. I think by the time he is 22/23 he will be in full flight.

817~~~
Well hopefully that 3 down the right would gel as a unit and we'd not have to worry too much about it, plus with that line-up I'd expect us to be on the front foot more often than not. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Our #9 options are equal to any team in the world for sure, and it will be interesting to see Rojo and Blackett competing for a starting spot.

818~~~
He's very good technically (in all aspects), and has a good brain and vision.
But there's still just that 'something' missing to convince me he's <i>certain </i>to become top level, as some seem to think.

819~~~
Am I the only one who thinks he has barely improved since his debut? He is doing literally the same since his debut, maybe even less.

820~~~
Run of consistent games is all it is IMO. There isn't many his age like him.

821~~~
He lacks maturity and this will come with time. Some players mature in their footballing brain very quickly (Messi the best example currently playing). Adnan has all the technique in the world, he's going to get there (world class level or even) in all likelihood, we just have to be patient.

822~~~
Agreed, we have gotten some shiny new toys this summer and I'm as excited as most about seeing them play for United, but it feels like it's led to some underrating Januzaj and how important it is that we give him the game time to continue progressing.

823~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.givemesport.com/502089-adnan-januzaj-set-for-crucial-talks-over-manchester-united-role" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.givemesport.com/502089-adnan-januzaj-set-for-crucial-talks-over-manchester-united-role</a>

They have the Star as their source so probably is BS. 

But it is a point worth discussing, with the new signings and change in system where does he fit in? I really hope we can get game time for him, i personally would like him start most games.

824~~~
Based on LVG's history with young players, I just cant imagine that Januzaj wont benefit or get games

825~~~
If we change to a 433, he'd get a tonne of chances. He would be in my first XI if we changed to that system.

Can't see him getting as many opportunities in the 352 though.

826~~~
Personally would play him over Mata in the no.10 role if LvG sticks with 352 come hell or high water, I'm glad Kagawa was shipped out, one less cluttering up Januzaj's path to progression.

827~~~
If we lose Januzaj prepare for World War 3 from United fans.

Because shit will get ugly.

828~~~
Bet he will be sold some time within the next 2 seasons. Will join another European gigant and develop like Pogba,eventually surpassing Messi/Ronaldo. We will all cry out loud and regret the fact that another one slipped through our fingers<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

829~~~
The Mata signing was not a good move by the club, I still regard it as a panic buy and a desperate attempt by Moyes and Woodward to show they could sign a big name and it has meant less opportunities for Januzaj which is a shame because he has a lot of potential and is someone we need to play regularly. If we persist with this formation I don’t see Januzaj playing much and I wouldn’t expect him to stick around, he will have too many options and young players don’t have any patience anymore.

830~~~
Januzaj's agent already said that the new signings will not get in the way of his development.

831~~~
He will probably be snapped by BM or Barca. will fit into those teams, not like here where his talent is being spilled...

832~~~
Aren't you a ray of sunshine.

833~~~
Think you are underplaying the situation. We'll let him leave on a free and then he'll join the other big clubs. His potential then he'll surprass Pele or Maradona. He'll also score a hattrick against us in three consecutive CL finals <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

834~~~
It's too early to say something like that. We don't know if he will fulfill his potential to be snapped up by Barca, and we don't know if he won't get the playing time. I wouldn't worry until the first half of the season is done.

835~~~
Are Belgium not playing any football this week? Jannuzaj badly needs to get 90 minutes under his belt.

836~~~
No qualifier this week so they only had the Australia friendly.

837~~~
Given he has had no pre-season, it's not a bad sign he has featured in every league game so far. I imagine he is the reason we decided to let Kagawa go for so cheap.

838~~~
Hopefully as the season goes on he starts to get more minutes. I would have liked to see a bit more of him so far but he has had that mouth infection.

839~~~
Some great posts in there <a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> really interesting reading, the lad hasn't had a great deal of chances recently and thus we can forget just what a standout talent the lad has. Well us humans forget anyway, I am sure your robot or at least cyborg, great memory.

840~~~
When was the last time he played 90 minutes? It should be back in January or something.

Try final match of the season against Southampton.

Great article In Rainbows. Great album too, while Im at it..

843~~~
That's what we want to hear. It's just a shame we dont have more competitions to use this squad of attacking players we have built up. 

Januzaj in my opinion could be one of our top performers but Im just not sure if he'll get the game time. If he could do the defensive side his position could be wide in a 4-4-2, but not sure this is his most effective. 

A 4-3-3 of the below would scare opponents with the attacking ability and players willing to beat a man. But this would involve either playing Rooney or Mata as AM and leaving 2 of Rooney, Mata, RVP on the bench which is quite unlikely IMO.

----Di Maria--------Januzaj
-------------Falcao

844~~~
Nice interview. 

He always says he wants to play centrally.

845~~~
If he wants to play centrally and we stick with the 3-5-2 then I guess he is competing with Di Maria, Mata, Rooney and Herrera for a start.

846~~~
Despite that uncertainty, Januzaj’s summer move from the No. 44 shirt to the No. 11 shirt perhaps underlined the regard in which he is held by the United hierarchy. Inheriting Ryan Giggs’ number is a proud honour for the youngster.

“I saw some reports saying I was unhappy, that couldn’t be further from the truth," he said. "I love this club and I’m excited to play for this manager. The fans have been so good to me and I want to repay them.”


Reading things like this make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

847~~~
Nice to hear him come out and say that. At the end of the day, they are only words and he will have a lot of interest and temptation from other clubs but if we can keep him happy and further his development, we will have a genuine star.

848~~~
We could invert the 3 and play Januzaj behind them with Di Maria in the midfield 3.

-------Januzaj

----Ronney----Falcao

849~~~
Confirms the fact we need to buy in another winger.. I don't think Januzaj is world class winger material.

850~~~
Feel for the lad. He deserves to play more but the question is where in this formation? And him wanting to play the #10 position, is that why there are talks about Mata leaving?

851~~~
Personally think Di Maria should play where he's most productive which for me is wide attacking. either front 3 wide. Or on the wing. Havent seen him enough centrally to comment, but wide he's ridiculous

852~~~
I'd usually agree. But he's brilliant centrally, and with someone disciplined and intelligent like Blind behind him, it'll work really well. 

It's very rare to have a guy in the centre who can go from a stand still and sprint past two or three men. We've seen what Yaya does when he feels like it, and Di Maria's capable of something similar.
It's a dimension that even the likes of Bayern, Real Madrid and Barcelona don't have. A serious weapon.
He's also a great worker and tackler. Him and Herrera would cover so much ground and then they'd still have Blind behind them.

Add someone like Reus or Depay (if he has the season he looks like he will) out wide and I think that's better than someone like Strootman in the centre and Di Maria wide.

It would almost be waste as I don't see many (any?) midfielders who can run through the centre from a stand still, and pass, and do all the off the ball stuff. Whereas there are a number of good wingers who could do a great job here.

853~~~
You know you're good when you're 18, in your debute season and your song for one of the top 4 clubs in the world is telling you about a boy ''who can do anything''.  We should try fit him in as much as possible to keep him happy, yes we've a lot of 10s but he'll be here to longest due to age and no reason he can't be the best out of all of them.  Kaka 2.0 (Pre-Madrid) <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

854~~~
Most young players want to play centrally. Doesn't necessarily mean they know what's best.

I'm actually more interested to see whether LvG continues to take him down either the midfielder or striker route. Adnan's been tried in both, and you can see why. The lad's still young enough to make either position his own.

855~~~
He hasn't shown enough to be a number 10. All his performances in that position have been average. His best performances have come from the wing.

856~~~
He was great vs Norwich when he started there IIRC.

857~~~
He really wasn't. I remember lots were questioning after the game why kagawa wasn't played there instead.

858~~~
That didn't happen at all.

859~~~
You sure? He was excellent against Norwich in the cup last season. Our best player.

860~~~

861~~~
He got man of the match but ok<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

862~~~
I've never been more certain that we need to change the formation until I looked back at some of the match comps of Adnan. He really was brilliant for us at some points last year.  

We have to change to wingers or to a system with 3 CMs, so that he can get some game time. At the minute, there is way too much pressure to be the number 10 in a 352 and he has Mata and Rooney in front of him, playing him in a mf two is a waste. He should definitely not play as a WB.

863~~~
"Lots" as in all the Kagawa Fanboys on the Caf, huh? Ok. Those are some very reasonable bunch of football fans.

Januzaj was really good in that game, won the man of the match but then Kagawa should have played instead...sure.<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

864~~~
He probably had the Norwich match mistaken for the Swansea match. Januzaj started behind the striker, and Kagawa on the lw. They switched up at halftime and the team performed better. I also thought it was the right move, but not due to Januzaj playing badly. It was more so that it made more sense to play Kagawa in his more effective position and Januzaj could easily play as the winger as he had done all season.

865~~~
LvG has tested him out in a few roles, even as a CM, and I think one thing at least he must have concluded is that he is wasted as a wingback.

866~~~

867~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>JANUZAJ INSISTS HE’S COMMITTED TO MAN UTD: I LOVE THIS CLUB</b>
</span>
Adnan Januzaj insists he’s committed to Manchester United.

Januzaj says he has not become unsettled by the arrival of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao and says he is happy at Old Trafford.

When asked where he would prefer to play,

868~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> look at his skinny little legs...bless him

869~~~
It's not Januzaj though. It's Dilhan Necipoglu.

870~~~
Saw him last night in town. Said hello. Seemed very shy.

871~~~
Januzaj is too eager to get on the score sheet. For the youth team he rarely went for goal, but for the first team tries to go for goal more often. Needs to learn that making the right decision is what will earn him minutes, not a goal. Think he's going for glory more often due to not being a starter.

872~~~
He's no midfielder, I really hate it when he plays the ball back constantly. Thats just not him.

873~~~
He's young and learning but that was one of the most terrible decisions I've seen in a while <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

874~~~
Too keen to make his mark when an assist would have been just as impressive. Nothing to worry about.

875~~~
I'd even say an assist would have been more impressive, I'm sure the coach and his teammate would have appreciated it more but nothing to worry about. RVP's face afterwards was priceless

876~~~
Wouldn't mind him taking the shot rather than pass to RvP. If that went in, we will say what a genius he is. At 4-0 up, that mistake should be forgiven.

877~~~
Exactly, if Robben does it we all cheer. Its just because it didnt score thats why we're whining.

878~~~
Well really not impressed with his selfishness today, hope he could cut that out.

879~~~
at 4 goals up, im fine with his selfishness, at 0-0 or even 1-0 i would have been fuming.

880~~~
Selfish my hoop. Not much game time, probably not all that confident, there should be no holding back this lad from showing his capabilities in a game such as this. When they fly in, and they will, we'll be all over it.

881~~~
He was selfish but he's young, things like that happen.

882~~~
should have scored but he needs more gametime. I see no reason keeping all three strikers on the pitch especially Van Persie who bottled three big chances, if it was welbeck, he would have been crucified... Van Persie is fit as ever? It doesn't seem so.. Sub him off and give Januzaj a chance to play off the striker he will be great will set up some chances as well as find his scoring boots at some point the sooner the better..

883~~~
He should've passed.

884~~~
No European or League Cup football; I don't see how he's going to get any game time.

885~~~
Shooting from there wasn't the worst decision ever, but the execution was awful. I don't blame him for taking the shot, and wild misses like that happen to the best. 

Would like to see him getting more game time though.

886~~~
Probably a bit too preoccupied with trying to catch the attention with there being so few games this campaigne and superstar players in front of him. Unless there are a few injuries I can't see him starting more than a handful of games this season, though would probably be the go to player to change things when we need it after which ever striker is on the bench.

887~~~
Could someone fix the thread title?

It looks like we have a player called Januzajl.

888~~~
Is that starts or 10 minute cameos?

889~~~
We were 4-0 up, I guess he thought going for it would not matter if he missed but he could impress the manager had he scored a cracker. Everyone would be talking about him in the same way as last season had he smashed in that attempt.

890~~~
The important thing is he got into good positions. The execution will come. I'm sure he (like all the players) will look at match footage in training and see what he should have done.

891~~~
I'd love to see him get more game time as he looked a bit rusty, should have passed to RVP but his young and to develop him we need him to be like that as that's how he will learn.

Problem is with the outlay this season and pressure to finish in the top 3/4 I can't see him starting that many games especially we only have the PL and FA Cup to play in this season. But then his only 19 and has plenty of time...

892~~~
The ball clearly took a bobble when he went to strike it.

893~~~
I think he was too keen on making his mark.. Looked a bit subdued as he was coming on, he knows he has to work really hard to even come close starting in this team especially with no european football around this season

894~~~
I must be in the minority that was glad to see him take the shot there. If that had gone in, the roof would be off.

895~~~
Trying to make the highlight reel so as to get a place in the team. A common mistake for young lads like him, no real harm done in this case.

896~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> changed

897~~~
Tried too hard to impress when he came on. He is only young though so he will learn in time.

898~~~
I agree, he is trying to hard to impress. He, however, is not going to make many friends with the strikers if he keeps on being this selfish.

899~~~
RVP's face said it all. He needs to be patient, his chances will come. I'd like to put him in the Mata role at the tip of the diamond and see what he can do there.

900~~~
You mean over hyping him based on a few flashes of ability. We all want him to be amazing but I wish people would organically let this happen rather than blindly ignoring the facts and decisions/performances he puts in which are not worthy of a starting place in our team.

901~~~
Young n learning. The other players have to be patient with him, you have to nurture a talent like this and allow him to play his game and learn from his mistakes. I remember Ruud and Ronaldo having issues and look how that turned out.

He'll get plenty of game time I think. I'm wary of the reports that he was getting a bit big for his boots and think him getting shifted down the pecking order might do him some good.

902~~~
I'm not worried about the selfishness we've seen so far this season. He's been getting short cameos here and there towards the end of games and clearly wants to make a big impact.

903~~~
he saw what happened with Welbeck. Constantly deferring to other players will get you sold

904~~~
I'd say missing chances and fecking up attacks got Welbeck sold which is exactly what Januzaj did.

905~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Welbeck hardly got any assists. Ridiculously lazy comparison. He chose to leave because he wasn't first choice up front. That in turn was because he doesn't do well enough around the box, be it scoring himself or laying it on for others.

906~~~
He's learning still so these things are gonna happen, Ronaldo was the exactly same, it's part of the learning curve. If it was 0-0 or we were losing he wouldn't have been so selfish.

907~~~
let him be confiden, he made a wrong decision in the end but if he played more he would take this chance easily. WHats more van Persie was closed down and would have his shot blocked probably.. januzaj saw him all the time but eventually chose the second thing in his mind and that was shot. Falcao was at the far post. If Van persie scored his two and half sitter he wouldnt be so disapointed after this. and should have been subbed of for Januzaj in the first place much earlier was another dodgy performance even tho he looked a little bit fitter..

908~~~
No, He's a young player. Best way for him to get playing time is to get on the score sheet. That's how i interpreted it.

909~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ooj6CbxDxQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

910~~~
He's played in every game.

911~~~
Mentioned it previously too, but he has gotten a more and more selfish streak going on now. Weird as he was never seemingly shooting in his youth days and always has composure to lay it back or find a pass.

Maybe he is smashing them in training and has been told to shoot more in matches by the coaches.


Anyway, thought he did decently today for 10 minute cameo when the intensity had dropped off anyway. Had a good chance too where he was sharp to reach and then hit the target with his right.

912~~~
Funny how some on here seem to think he's out of favour as he's not a starter at the moment. He's just a kid who only had last season as a season of professional football, and he only played so much because the team was so poor. Hopefully he understands that long term he's got a huge future here, but he'll have to be a sub this season, but it's just the normal progression of youngsters really. Him being subbed on every game shows that van gaal does rate him.

913~~~
He'll be a real test for Van Gaal's rotation, squad management and also man management ability. 

For me he somewhat mismanaged the Welbeck situation as it is in that regard though that was more borderline short term vs long term case, but he will just have to do better with Januzaj and bring him on as well. (And find his best position to begin with..)

914~~~
It's a shame we've less games this season to facilitate him. I'm sure he knows it'll be difficult to receive regular game time this season and he must be patient.

915~~~
With the purchases of Falcao and Di Maria and no games in Europe, I really don't see how Adnan will get minutes this season. Even if he had come off the bench yesterday and gotten and assist and a goal, who would get dropped for him? Mata is the only possibility, but his performance levels would have drop for that to happen, and against QPR at least he was good.

916~~~
In a parallel (and perhaps saner) universe a 19 year old in his second season of professional football playing a part of every game in a star studded team under a renowned manager would be a positive development. Now he's not starting every week, a mere 5 games into the season, it's apparently the end of his career. People are bonkers. He's played nearly 200 minutes of football this season. Which is nearly 200 more than he'd played this time last year. He'll get plenty of chances.

917~~~
Was a bad decision to shoot. I don't care that we were coasting and it didn't really matter. RvP has had a slow start to the season, a goal might have got him going! he was open, Adnan just had to slide the ball across. Poor decision. If he wants to play from the start then he has to do better than that.

918~~~
Last season we were so freakishly bad that we were relying on an 18 year old in his first season of senior football to dig us out and entertain us, it's distorted the expectation of his development. LvG has given him minutes in every PL game if I'm not mistaken and I think as the season goes on he'll start to push Mata hard for the #10 role. I see little point in him playing in Herrera or Di Maria's roles when he comes on, he's a pure attacker IMO.

Although he didn't put his chance away and should have squared that left footed attempt <a class="username" data-user="87635, @In Rainbows" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87635/">@In Rainbows</a> is right to point out that it was good to see him get in those positions even if the end product wasn't there today. He did look a little subdued when he was waiting to come on but he does seem quiet and shy so I wouldn't read too much into it.

919~~~
That's not the reason at all Welbeck was sold. That's some history rewriting you just did here.

920~~~
Not his best game, and to be honest he has been average every time he has played this season. He has so much potential, but so far this season his decision making has been really poor at times. I get the feeling that he is starting to feel the pressure a bit to perform this season. Last season he basically had no pressure on him as he was breaking through, but this season expectations are high. Probably to high to be honest, and I feel it is getting to him a bit. Really needs a few full games in a row to settle himself back down and get back to doing what he does best.

921~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sure

922~~~
He literally played 10 minutes today. It'd be ridiuclous to judge him, certainly in a poor way. If you want to slate a poor cameo, the Valencia thread would welcome you with open arms.

923~~~
I'm not just talking today. He hasn't been up to the standard of last season at all this season. In all the games he has played so far he has made a couple of poor decisions, largely because I feel he is trying to hard to impress and as a result isn't doing what came naturally to him last season. I'm not slating him, simply saying he hasn't been at his best and really need a run of games to settle back in.

924~~~
Yeah alright, fair enough really.

925~~~
This.

I think he'll have to take his chances against weaker sides and start playing with that comfort again.  I don't see him forcing his way into the first XI soon.

926~~~
I hope people don't get blind just because he is young n learning.

To take the shot from an impossible angle instead of passing an easy ball to an unmarked teammates in great scoring position really deserved a big slap on his face.

I know we are leading 4-0, but it's not like he is Ronaldo who could easily score over 50 goals a season either. Point is his finishing isn't that strong and he shouldn't give himself license to do that while ignoring his "better" teammates completely. I hope he wouldn't end up like Nani one day.

927~~~
Up there as one of the worst substitute appearances in our modern history. Awful yesterday. His decision making means whenever he comes on, we cannot afford to let him be within 60 yards of goal. This is going to be a long and tough season for him at this rate when last season gave hope to much more. Simply put, we cannot expect any level of reasonable impact from the boy this season on his current form.

I'm not going to jump to any conclusions beyond the above paragraph. Just hope he knuckles down, develops his brain and grows to become a key player for United over the next 3 years.

In good news for Adnan, 2 months ago, without the arrivals, there was pressure on him for instant results all the time. Now, he has an opportunity to regroup a bit, learn from the experience and develop with these new players. This season he will not be the go to man for an impact any more or the young hope with all of the answers. This can actually be a positive in his long term progression.

928~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Wut?

I know he needs to improve his decision making and all that..but..Ffs!

937~~~
I'm sorry I already quoted this post but I have to do it again for it's sheer ridiculousness! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

938~~~
Hat-trick today for the U21s. Half decent, that. Should ensure him a few more minutes for the first team in the coming weeks.

939~~~
Scored a Hat-trick for the reserves tonight.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

940~~~
If they manage to stick around here, "Not Jumping to Conclusions" should be their tag line.

941~~~
I hope we get to see more of him when the season gets going.

942~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

943~~~
Scored a hat-trick tonight, but he's well above that level.

944~~~
Was excellent playing as one of the front 2 in a Diamond. 

If he adds that instinct and goals to his game, will be a hell of a player.

945~~~
To be honest, you would expect him to bag loads of goals for the U21's. It's clearly below his level of ability.

Regardless, a great performance from him.

946~~~

947~~~
Thankfully he didn't come on as a substitute.

948~~~
It has been done before, but, <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

949~~~
Sounds like he's found his level.

950~~~
Those goals were fairly well taken. I know some of his shots have been wild recently but I think his finishing is actually really good for a 19 year old winger/#10.

951~~~
Same formation that we played yesterday? Very interesting that. Could be quite telling.

952~~~
van Gaal had the youth sides playing 3-5-2 earlier in the season too.

953~~~
Yeah that's what I mean. I'll post what I think his intentions are in the 3-5-2 thread...

954~~~
Oke, the lad is still talented I guess, almost forgot.

955~~~
I said before that the youth team will always emulate the first team because it makes it easier for them to slot into a first team lineup after knowing their role in the formation. It serves as no hint of a permanent formation just as the 352 at youth level didn't.

956~~~
Apparently van Gaal was at the game? Good for Adnan if he was, he's clearly above this level.

957~~~
Yeah, but this still appears to be a van Gaal implementation? I may be wrong, but I don't think our youth sides always copied like for like our first team.

958~~~
Just like your lot found their level against Villa?

959~~~
Sure.

Thought it was obvious I was joking, but anyway...

960~~~
I was joking too, thought it was obvious aswell.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

961~~~
Fantastic match tonight, but even if it is below his level, I'm glad he got a game in. Everyone on this board knows there aren't enough fixtures this season, but that'll hopefully be a much different situation next year.

962~~~
Ya it showed him several times in the crowd.

963~~~
Di Maria's replacement when he retires <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

964~~~
It shouldn't be to big a shock that he's not performing at the levels he did last year in the first team.  I honestly don't think he should have gone to Brazil, but given the situation I didn't think he'd turn the call up down for a World Cup.  My opinion is that he's come back very tired and is slowly regaining his fitness and form.  Plus it could be suggested it's second season syndrome, with other players a bit wiser to him and he's not able to get away as much as he did last season.

965~~~
van Gaal is a great manager to nurture him, I think he'll be okay.

966~~~
Anyone got highlights of the match?

967~~~
still only 19, important to remember.

968~~~
I thought Falcao would deck him for taking that ill advised shot in the end instead of squaring it to the strikers in the box. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

969~~~
Falcao looked pissed off when he didn't square the ball to him, it was hilarious. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

970~~~
It wasnt even the worst substitute appearance of that match ffs

971~~~
He'll learn, I hope. Looked to have lost the spark he had in the two home games this season. He is only 19 aspeople keep  saying. His decision making needs major improvement. A bit like Ronnie when he arrived.

972~~~
Wow, just wow.

973~~~
You cant be that stupid..

974~~~
60 yards off the goal<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ? I ain't even sure if Evans can do that.

975~~~
In the first game of the season he was our best player I thought, but yeah since then his decision making has gotten worse.

976~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Low on quality but it's all that could be found on youtube. Well taken goals and seems a bit less nervous in the interview. Waiting for the Corrigan guy's compilation now. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Glad he scored a few. Obviously you'd expect him to standout at that level but good for his confidence.

980~~~
What the feck did I just read?

Also that performance tonight was brilliant, even if he did look like he was playing against kids in the park.

981~~~
I think so, much like the reserves switched to 3-5-2 when the senior team was playing it.

Took his goals really well and was clearly a country mile ahead of everyone else on the pitch, but I like the mentality it shows. Many young players would have sulked after being the star of the season and then having to go back and play a reserve game, but instead he took it as an opportunity to showcase himself.

982~~~
He's been played as CM or Wingback in sub appearances so far this season.

983~~~
Did you see RvP's reaction?

984~~~
Watching Januzaj in his quality right now play with U21 is a pain. I understand if he is unfit or just came back from injury like Shaw. But I think he is fit and has spend his games so far this season without a single start. Not even in Capital One Cup. I hope LVG can find out a way to give this guy a starter place.

985~~~
But if he is fit - and LVG <span style="text-decoration: underline">can't</span> find a way to give him a start - then it's better that he plays with the U21s each week - he needs game time.  If he can't get it properly with your main team then U21 is the way to go.

986~~~
Great performance last night, particularly first half.  At 3-0 I saw a cricket score coming but things died down a bit.  Each time the camera panned to Januzaj I couldn't help but feel he looked a bit pi$$ed off to be playing for the U21s.  Maybe it was just me.
Hopefully he is mature enough (and I have no reason to believe otherwise) to realise that with the quality we now have, he will not play as regularly as last season but is still a very important part of Manchester United's future.
Shame about the CoC defeat because a good run in that is a good extra few competitive first team games up to March meaning he could hit the ground running if required for the League run-in.

987~~~
I think a loan would be best for his development right now. 

Playing 90 minutes week in week out for a midtable side would be great for his development. 

The problem with that is that it would be perceived as us turning our back on youth once again which is a PR nightmare right now.

988~~~
better english from adnan

989~~~
I'm guessing Rio's latest comments were about Januzaj?

990~~~
A loan would probably do him good (if it were the right kind of club) but I think he could be of use to us this season. I know we don't have a ton of fixtures but I'd still like to see him in the squad, especially if we get injuries to our wingers/forwards. He's got great quality and I think he's good enough to mix it with the top players. Granted though it might be difficult for him to get a good run in the side considering no cup football until January.

991~~~
He was the only 19 year old right?

992~~~
What comments ?

993~~~
"One young star cried in front of the boss... I told him to stop being a baby"

994~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What's this now..

You got a link ?

995~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/rio-ferdinand-told-manchester-united-4267009" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/rio-ferdinand-told-manchester-united-4267009</a>

996~~~
I think a spell on the sidelines will be good for januzaj. He's only a 19 year old and I think he was starting to feel too big for his shoes and feel as if he made it already. Crying for not being in the starting 11 as a teenager is ridiculous for example. Going to the world cup and getting the #11 shirt probably would make him feel even bigger then before too. 

Hopefully he stays focused and determined to make it, and patient most of all. Van Gaal putting him in the u21's is a good reminder to him I think that he's still got a long way to go.

997~~~
That's something the Belgian press also reported about his attitude during training in Brazil. 

I'm certain he'll make it though. It's just a phase young players have to go through, his performance for the U21's yesterday (and interview) was an example that there's not a big problem with his mentality. Pogba for example didn't have that same joy on the pitch when he had to play U21 football after his first team subs.

He might have been a bit arrogant after last season, but with his dad and Van Gaal around that will be fixed soon (or has been fixed already)

998~~~
Was it him who cried? Rio didn't name check, either way he looks mature in that interview.

999~~~
Cheers !

Yup. This is why I think it's brilliant that Adnan has someone like Ryan Giggs to use as a sounding board. He's been through it all - superstardom at a young age, temptation, loads of cash, media attention, pressure and expectations of performing week in and week out. AFAIK Ryan was of massive help to Ronaldo in his early years too. One could sense their mutual admiration even after the European Cup win in Moscow. Giggs could be a similar father figure for Januzaj in a football sense.

1000~~~
Loaning out young players is not bad. That doesn't mean we turning our backs on them. We have sending them out to get more game time and improve their game so they have a chance at the first team when they come back depending on if they impressed. Selling a young player who has so much potential like Januzaj will not be good.

1001~~~
He mentioned the guy was 19, adnan was our only 19 year old.

1002~~~
I know that and you know that, journalists also know that but that's not the angle they will go for.

1003~~~
Possibly the worst post I've read on here

1004~~~
If Adnan is the young player in question from Rio's book, then it's great to see how badly he wants to play and reach his potential.  Passion like that can only be a good thing, and we've sorely lacked that since SAF's glory days.  Sure he made that one mistake where he should have squared the ball but who can blame him for wanting to prove himself after being left out for so long.  I can only hope that he gets played properly and not just being thrown into the wingback position or central mid, it was painful watching LvG's experiment earlier in the season and playing Adnan all over the place.  I'm sure he's willing to play anywhere just to get some match time with the first team but I'd much prefer we use him as an attacking outlet, preferably out wide.

1005~~~
I think he is fit. It's just that there is no place for him to play a starter and LVG seems not trusting him ahead of our world class players in striker position, no 10 role position or Di Maria position which I'm not surprise. Not gonna lie but I hate to admit that I think Liverpool and Rodgers has done better treating on Sterling than what we are doing on Januzaj.
Time will tell more.

1006~~~
That's really poor from Rio. No need to spill the beans about the young lad. Even more so when he himself was publicly whinging that he wasn't getting enough game time. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1007~~~
Or they're completely burning him out because they're over reliant on him. They rested him for the weekend because he needed it and ended up having to bring him on anyway.

Adnan will be fine.

1008~~~
It's interesting that he spoke about working hard defensively in his post match interview. It sounds like something he's been told to do more and he's working on it. Januzaj is class though and will get enough game time I'm sure of it. It's just unfortunate that we've not got many competitions this year.

1009~~~
They did rest him a lot half of the season in 2012/2013. And it seems Rodgers didn't start him in the weekend due of him feeling tired. But still Sterling got his chances more than Adnan though.

1010~~~
I think once we buy that strong midfielder which would allow us to play a proper 4-3-3, we'll see more of him. Certainly should be the first option after ADM on either the left or the right. My dream line-up would have both of them starting off the flanks. Would truly bring back the attacking wingplay we were so accustomed to under Fergie, but with the added benefit of the both of them being so much more complete than the touchline-huggers that used to be the norm in the 90s.

1011~~~
Just watched the highlights, am I the only one who is happy with how he is going for the goal a lot more often? He has it in him, and last season he was often all fart and no poo, no end product. Now when he gets the ball, and he has a space to shoote he does it, for now it wont go in all the times, but in the future, he will be a prolific goalscorer if he continues like this.

1012~~~
Thought it was rather embarrassing myself.  Like a spoiled kid resorting to tears because he doesn't get his way.

1013~~~
I have referred to this few times now and he's getting more and more selfish if you can call it.

Definitely seems something coaches have told him to do, as he seems to be improving his shooting and goalscoring ability. Not showing so far in the matches but he can be a real goalscorer when it clicks.

1014~~~
Its not per se selfish imo, but when he gets the chance and its from a decent to good angle, he tries it. 'Its only selfish when it fails', if he was bangin all these in nobody would give a feck.

1015~~~
We've got a big problem with Adnan, and there has to be a real danger of losing him. If we continue with the diamond of last Sunday, for instance, he's got to displace either Mata or Herrera to secure a starting place; and that's after leaving one of Falcao, Rooney or RvP on the bench, and completely forgetting any claims to playing time that the equally brilliant Wilson might make. And people complain about selling Welbeck!

Adnan had a great game upfront last night, but is LvG really going to pick him ahead of two of the three musketeers?

His best chance may be if we revert to more orthodox wing play - he on one side and Di Maria on the other perhaps? Failing that, a good loan.

I doubt he's more likely to stick around patiently awaiting his chance than Paul Pogba, and for similar reasons. The difference is we've got him under contract, so he can't just walk. But would we force him to stay against his will?

All in all, I think the Mata purchase may not be the best £37m the club ever spent.

1016~~~
Its been said that he prefers the number 10 role. I think he will get games as back up to Mata. When Rooney switched to the number 10 role against QPR, all of a sudden our play slowed significantly, tied in with the fact we were happy to let Kagawa leave suggests to me now that Adnan is second in line for the number 10.

Also i doubt we will play the diamond every game. VG might want to play wider in some games, in which Adnan is our second best winger.

1017~~~
I do wonder if he is used upfront like he was yesterday for the U21s.

Oddly Van Gaal hasn't used him in one of the 2 roles up top so far but used him everywhere else all over the place pretty much even as a sub.


I think when LVG was referring to Juice as a reason to let Welbeck go he was referring to both Januzaj and Wilson.

In the sort of diamond we were playing on Saturday with both strikers drifting wide he'll be pretty well suited.

1018~~~
Doubt it. There is too much competition up front. One world class striker will always come off the bench and Wilson is the better striker. I think he would have really impressed LVG if he had gotten to play as the 10 in yesterday's match as he is at his best when he creates. I don't know if LVG has seen how good he is at passing. He had a couple of moments against Sunderland where he showed his passing ability though his execution was a bit off. The lobbed ball over the defense and his defense splitting pass to Janko were great ideas, but he didn't get his execution right.

1019~~~
Apparently some Belgian teammates where unhappy with him because he nutmegged Jan Vertonghen too often during training <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Coach had to tell him to stop doing it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1020~~~
He's versatile, so will get minutes in various positions. This feels like it will be a year of consolidation for Adnan, where he rounds out his game. No concerns about Kagawa and Welbeck leaving as it will give him more opportunities.

1021~~~
Not worried about Adnan. I don't personally think the current front three has the right balance against decent sides. It should be one proper number 9 and two roving forwards as opposed to the current narrow front 3. We can feck about when we play QPR at home but we should be working towards something a bit more sustainable imo. I expect Januzaj to be an integral part of the front 3 by the end of the season.

1022~~~
I think Adnan will get plenty of playing time. He can fill in for Mata and apparently can play as a striker like Rooney is doing, the one who drops slightly deeper, so he should get game time. There is no reason he cant fill in for Di Maria in some games against weaker opposition also.

What is worrying me about Adnan lately, is his decision making. The chance against QPR was a bad decision. A lovely move by him and Herera and he broke free in the box with two United players available, yet chose to shoot from a difficult angle.

Don't get me wrong, the game was already over, so it didn't matter, but stuff like this could cost us in other matches (I am sure he did the same thing against Swansea also).
He does the hard part getting into the great positions, but his final ball and his finishing needs work.

1023~~~
Imo there's nothing wrong with his finishing. As Lou Macari said in the reserve match commentary, he's just overanxious to make an impression on the manager in the limited minutes he's been getting.

1024~~~
What Rio said isn't bad, it's coming out and publically embarrasing the boy. There's no need for that. He may have acted as a baby - somewhat spoilt - but there's no need for this. That is, if it even is Januzaj.

1025~~~
Trying to cause a stir to sell books or not, I want this damn book.... <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1026~~~
No you're not alone. Players like him need to be indulged. Like a certain Ronaldo was never discouraged to be himself, during his formative years. Of course, if he keeps doing it for a few years and there isn't enough end product, then you just let him leave.

1027~~~
One decision and now I see him being branded selfish all over the internet. Maybe he should have passed it, but it is not as if he didn't have an opportunity to score. Would Van Persie have passed it if he were in Adnan's position? Maybe he would, but maybe he wouldn't. 

I don't think Adnan is selfish at all. Actually he is usually an intelligent and creative passer.

One of things I like about Adnan is that he is not afraid to take on a shot when the moment arises. We've had some selfish players and Adnan doesn't even come close.

1028~~~
I was rewatching the 1995-96 Season Review (the You Cant Win Anything With Kids season) and there was a snippet of an interview in there with David Beckham; the interview was commenting on how Becks is finally getting regular game time, but it wasn't in one set position, it was in a couple positions across the midfield. He asks Becks which he preferred and Becks replies "I do prefer to be in the center, but if there's a right wing spot I'll play the right wing". He went on to become a legendary right winger for both club and country, and it was all because Sir Alex knew where to play him, and trusted his judgement over Becks' own preference.

This all reminded me of young Adnan right. He states he prefers the number 10 spot, where a lot of youngsters say they want to play, it seems to be the most fashionable attacking position these days. However, I wonder if Van Gaal will do to him what SAF did to Becks and stick him on the wing anyway, and let him develop into a different kind of player than he sees himself as. I wouldn't mind that, I think he'd be an absolutely fantastic wide player.

1029~~~
Interesting that LvG referred to him as a striker today and mentioned he'd get more opportunities in 4-3-3, this plays into LvG's idea that the front 3 in 4-3-3 are all strikers, not one striker and 2 wingers. Personally I can also see Adnan at the top of the diamond where Mata plays but not in Herrera or Di Maria's roles as the box to box CM's in the diamond.

1030~~~
I took that quote as meaning something different. Januzaj is a winger that in the diamond will compete for a striker spot as there are no wingers, and if it was a 433 he would go on the wing. Januzaj can cover 3 positions in the diamond and can be a winger in a 433.

1031~~~
Am I right in saying Januzaj played as one of a forward 2 for the under 21s the other night when he scored his hattrick? I wonder if LVG sees potential in him as a striker. In a 4-3-3 I can only see him as one of the wide players in the forward 3. For now at least.

1032~~~
I agree, his effectiveness in front of goal has been questionable. He needs to work out it, and what's the best way of working on it? Doing it in a match, not by playing the safe ball across. Good on him.

1033~~~
I think LVG envisions him as a second striker, the role Robben played at the world cup behind Van Persie and I think he'd be more lethal in that role given his ball carrying and passing ability. The only thing missing is the finishing. This also enables him to provide width in the relatively narrow formations we are using.

1034~~~
Agree with your sentiments but disagree with the position. Januzaj reminds me of a young Van Persie, he lacks the pace to be a world class winger.. He can't be a Robben but I like this striker role being suggested. Might suit him down to a tee.

1035~~~
Beckham didn't have huge amount of pace either. And he was a worse dribbler than Januzaj which is arguably more important thing for a winger than pace.

1036~~~
Crossing was a big feature of our 90's based 4-4-2 game and Beckham was more a right midfielder rather than a winger. As good as Beckham was, you can see how a Cristiano on that flank is so much more dangerous - pace as well as trickery. Of course Januzaj can feature on the wing and be a solid player in that role, i.e. he could easily be a Beckham on that left side.. but I think he has the potential to be a serious goal threat further afield and I just think in the current era pace/as well as being a goal threat on the flanks is essential. The top teams Bayern, Real and Barca.. have incredible goal threats out wide. They're all pacey and skilful... Beckham would struggle to displace any of those players and this is coming from a guy who loves him to bits as a player.

1037~~~
Being able to beat your man with pace and having clever movements is far more valuable than just being a sprinter. Januzaj isn't as fast as Robben(frank there are less than 1% of footballers who're as pacey and have as good dribbling as him let alone as good as him in other areas) but he's quick and can leave even the top defenders behind with his clever dribbling ability and balance which matters the most. 
He is extremely versatile , he can easily turn into Beckham v2 or Ronaldo v2(maybe not in term of the level but similar in style and still be effective). his passing , vision and creativity is top notch for a 19 year old and he's also a very good shooter and will develop the consistency with age. 


I reckon he will be played as a right winger but will be turned into a right winger(similar to Ronaldo in 07-08) depending on whether he becomes a consistent goal threat.

1038~~~
What I was meaning is that I don't think LvG sees the right and left forward in a front 3 as wingers, I think he sees them more as wide strikers in the way Barcaelona use Neymar and Pedro. This is how I feel he sees Adnan developing, as a goal scoring wide forward.

1039~~~
I know, but it's impossible to infer that from his comment. Adnan having more opportunities in a 4-3-3 just means that he suits that particular formation more than the diamond either due to an extra forward spot (5 strikers competing for 3 spots instead of 2) or because he fits the wide role more than any of the attacking players (minus Di Maria).

1040~~~
Rio is a bit of a tosser.

'You're 19'? What has that got to do with it. Could have been another reason why he wasn't playing.

1041~~~
David Silva and Samir Nasri aren't.

1042~~~
They're not top class wingers? one has a free role and the other is a decent player but not world class.

1043~~~
Every player I referred to has those clever movements, tricks galore and express pace to go with it. If we want to be better than those teams, you have to have the same calibre of players in those positions. Might only be 1% of players who can do that.. but we're Manchester United, we're aiming to have those 1% of players playing for us i.e. Di Maria.

He can turn into Beckham v2, but to say he can turn into Ronaldo v2 with such certainty is a step too far. He has a lot to prove yet in my opinion. I agree that all those attributes you listed are top quality and he is versatile... but whether he can beat top defenders for fun and leave them for dead, like Ronaldo used to do.. is another question.

Ronaldo played against Maldini when we faced AC Milan and Maldini had a game on his hands, Cole had to be at his best to keep Ronaldo in his pocket. I've seen Januzaj kept quiet by Luke Shaw and Jon Flanagan... so to say he is on the same level and easily be as good as Ronaldo is far fetched in my opinion. I'm pretty sure if Januzaj was showing Ronaldo type talent as a winger, LVG would change to 4-3-3 asap. At the moment he doesn't feel tempted. Remember Fergie got shot of Ruud, purely because he believed in Ronaldo and keeping him happy.

Januzaj's journey will be incredibly interesting to watch, there is a beast of a player inside him but he can easily be a excellent player in a variety of positions, but with the talent he has, being merely excellent would be a waste. I trust LVG to find the optimum position for him.

1044~~~
So why can't Adnan get that role? I may be wrong here but your post seems as though you're entrenched in this view that to succeed as a player in a wide position you <i>must</i> have blistering pace and goalscoring abilities.

1045~~~
My view is that to be a top class wide player in the modern game (by top class I mean Bale/Robben/Ribery/Neymar/Ronaldo/Hazard) and I mean to threaten teams like Real, Barca et al i.e. that is what we are always striving towards... you need a winger who has their qualities. It is an arms race and you can't be left behind.

Someone like Nasri is nowhere near their level, he's a decent player but hardly a threat.. he's not a player who'll win you Champions Leagues.

Adnan in a free role? of course he has it in him to be Silva-esque, but that wasn't my point. I think a free role or a striker position is potentially his best positions if he is to maximise the attributes at his disposal, but he can definitely be a solid wide-man - I don't doubt that, I just don't think he has it in him to be as dangerous as the aforementioned players out wide but if he can improve physically i.e. get quicker, run at players consistently and beat them out wide without having spells of lethargy throughout a game, then of course.. technically he is as good as anyone.

1046~~~
Sorry, you're right, I get what you mean now, I was latching onto what he said and then interpreting where I think it will lead.

1047~~~
My comparison with Ronaldo was more in terms of style rather than ability if you read my post. Ronaldo wasn't a 19 year old in his first season in a struggling side when he faced Maldini. Januzaj was one of our best performers at the bridge last season though it says more about the team but he had Ivanovic worrying and even got the better of him with some silky skills. Its too soon to say whether he will end up as a winger or not. Januzaj is very direct and can definitely improve his shooting a lot with time on his side. Griezmann doesn't have loads of pace but he's turning into one of the best goalscoring wingers in the world. So januzaj could easily develop into one as well.

1048~~~
Strange post considering Maldini played as a centre half in that game and the video you posted didnt actually show Ronaldo beating him at any stage it showed him beating Pirlo for pace a couple of times and getting fouled by Cafu a few times. You then go on to say you've seen Januzaj kept quiet by Shaw and Flanagan which seems to ignore the fact that in his first season Ronaldo was often completely marked out of games by full backs who were a lot worse defensively than Shaw or Flanagan. I'm not Januzaj will ever get to the level of Ronaldo but its not exactly fair to pick and choose certain games to try and illustrate a point especially when you're talking about beating players considering Januzaj's dribble success in his first season was better than Ronaldo's although obviously Ronaldo made a lot more
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bng_EcjCQAAZm4S.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bng_EcjCQAAZm4S.jpg:large"/>

1049~~~
Januzaj of course is going to be a more accurate dribbler, he has better close control and dribbles at a slower pace. The point of my video is to highlight the fear factor Ronaldo has with his electric pace, they had to defend well to ensure they snuffed him out the game.. but look at how he just kept going, his intensity was amazing to watch. Milan dealt with him extremely well, but the point is that some of the greatest defensive legends in the game saw him as a threat and had to see him off with some quality defending... people greatly underrate the talent Ronaldo had at a young age.. they make him out like he was a Nani. Yes he had games where he was unproductive in terms of end product as the statistics indicate, but every time he took to the pitch.. he took the game to opponents and ran at them. 

Januzaj is a more cerebral type of talent, which might be best utilised on the wing.. but in my opinion, he'd be better placed as a support striker/forward.

1050~~~
Dont get me wrong Im not underrating the young Ronaldo he was my favourite player from the moment he arrived and I actually saw him playing in an under age tournament about a year before we signed him and started watching Sporting games to see him play. I actually agree with a lot of what youre saying here just disagreed with using two games where Januzaj was marked well in as a way of negatively comparing him to Ronaldo when Ronaldo had plenty of anonymous games himself against worse defenders and the game you highlighted was Ronaldo in his third season of professional football while Januzaj was in his first. I think Januzaj has so much talent and such a different array of talents that that if hes willing to work hard enough then he can be moulded into a world class player in any of the attacking positions.

1051~~~
I feel like the pace thing is becoming an urban myth. Of course he's no Robben or Cristiano in terms of quickness but he's no slouch (I feel like he's faster than Van Persie ever was), not to mention close control and dribbling precision is just as effective for beating defenders as haring it down the touch line. He just needs to develop his football brain to become an amazing wide attacker; I don't think he's selfish like some people are saying, it's more that he doesn't have good decision making. Once he develops, having that goal threat and creativity from out wide would be immensely helpful to the team.

Also, I don't disagree that he would make a good striker. I just feel like someone like Adnan would be frustrated if he weren't influencing the game constantly, being involved in build-up as opposed to moving off the ball up top and not seeing much of it come to feet.

1052~~~
I actually think his decision-making is one of his best attributes and will be in the years to come. It is just he feels under pressure to win a place and is neglecting the basics... his ability to pass a ball is superior to a Ronaldo.

1053~~~
Januzaj's decision making at youth level was above every player I have seen (granted it isn't a lot of players), but it has taken a dent in the first team. He used to pick and choose his moments to dribble at youth level, but put more emphasis on that for the first team. He also used to shoot a lot less for the youth teams, but has become slightly more trigger happy. 

His play style changed last season. He used to love going to the ball and picking teams apart with his passing, but he plays differently now. I don't know if that's down to his instructions or an individual effort to develop his other qualities. Or it could be that Moyes taught him a certain way of playing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

It has changed though.

1054~~~
Being in your comfort zone, it is very easy to play at your own pace and make good decision after good decision. Going up a level in addition to the pressure of cementing your place in the side.. it is bound to have an effect, trying to make an impression and forcing things instead of playing your natural game. He's trying to become a more explosive player which for me isn't a bad thing... just need to remain patient and I am sure he will strike the right balance once again. One thing is for sure - he can't play at the same tempo he did for the youth teams, he has to do the same things he did then but at a much quicker speed and keep it up throughout 90 minutes. Any let off in terms of energy will be spotted by LVG and he'll not feature in the side.. really does have to keep pushing himself to break into this side.

1055~~~
I watched Ronaldo extensively when he was young and i can categorically say that Januzaj looks like a far bigger talent. He is more technically gifted than Ronaldo was at the same age and he a more natural dribbler while Ronaldo was more of a trickster than a pure dribbler. Ronaldo however had work ethic that is unparalleled in modern football which took him to the absolute pinnacle. If Januzaj is half as dedicated as Ronaldo was then he will reach the very top. We're looking at the future Kaka here.

1056~~~
I wonder what is he feeling and thinking right now, knowing that Mata is dropped but he still fail to get his starting eleven spot in Mata role.

1057~~~
Adnan is really struggling this season I think. He is getting a few minutes here and there but not enough to make an impact and he has put in some poor performances during these sub appearances. He just doesn't seem to fit in at the moment.

1058~~~
I think he needs a start in the next month or so to get his game back together. So far as a sub he's been incredibly poor but the potential is still obviously there.

1059~~~
He's changed mentally from last season, no longer seems like the youngster doing everything he can off the bench to try and get in the team with the belief that he'll do it. Maybe he's just lacking in confidence right now but he just doesn't seem like he has the belief that he can force his way into the team and so isn't really making an impact. Of course he's not getting loads of playing time, but before you saw him running at defenders, trying things, but now he just either gives it back to the person who passed it to him or he just goes hiding. 
Hopefully he gets a start as a winger soon if we try a 4-3-3 with Di Maria on the other side, reckon we'd be great like that. Not too bothered about having RvP and Mata the ones most likely dropped in that scenario either, if it means he gets a proper chance.

1060~~~
Good grief... The guy hardly got the ball today in the very few minutes he got. Meanwhile we were playing with fecking 10 men and falling apart defensively while he was playing as a striker receiving no service.

How fecking daft are some of you? If your engine is broken do you go to the repair shop and have them look at the boot of your car? Because thats essentially the same thing.

1061~~~
I don't like how we insist on playing him as a striker though. Why not put him on the wing where he clearly has put in his best performances? Even Ronaldo wasn't ready to be a striker at 19/20 years of age.

1062~~~
He's been poor as a sub because he hasn't really gotten minutes and has been played in numerous positions. He rarely got the ball against Leicester playing as a striker and United were down to 10 men. Against Sunderland he played as a cm. Against Burnley he got 3 minutes. Against QPR he only got 10 minutes and he should have done better as he had a great chance. That's the thing with his limited minutes though. The fact that 1 mistake is all that he's allowed due to playing so few minutes is why he's looking subdued.

In all of his games he has played as a cm, a striker, a rwb, a rw, a lw, and as a #10. 6 positions he has had to cover.

1063~~~
Will become a top player when beefs up a bit. He's already talented but there are areas he needs to improve and and I'm certain he he will. I wouldn't like to loan him out but if he's not getting a game, then I think it make sense to go with that option. It would have to be a team in the Premier League where he regularly plays and not abroad.

1064~~~

1065~~~
can you post the article? b/c we have to pay for it after all <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1066~~~
Anyone with a Times-subscription who could summarize what's in the article?

1067~~~
Just going to leave <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/29p4c9/summary_of_news_on_the_suarezsanchez_transfer/cin9fj0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a> here...

1068~~~
The article doesn't say anything new, just what most of us have been talking about regarding how much game time Januzaj is going to get this season, where he should play and if we can keep him happy under the circumstances.

1069~~~
Blimey. That's sneaky.

1070~~~
Seems strange to me that in this day and age people would actually pay to view the Times website, But anyways..

In regards to Adnan, I just think he is trying too hard and overthinking everything he does at the moment, He needs to play with freedom and not worry so much, I think because the lack of minutes he is getting that when he is on the pitch he is trying to impress LVG rather than play his natural game which would impress him anyways.

I must admit I am starting to get slightly concerned on how he is going to get into this team now, I can't see him being a starter unless we get injuries in the attacking areas

1071~~~
I can't see him getting starts until December where there are a lot of midweek games. Same with Wilson.

1072~~~
I'd love for us to go back to a 4-2-3-1 to be honest. 


Won't happen though. The captain<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> needs to play, and RvP will play regardless of form.

1073~~~
That team is just perfectly balanced and full of quality players. Pacey wingers, a top class 10 and the best 9 in the world. Still, we all know this won't happen as that would mean we have to bench Rooney and RvP.

1074~~~
I hope he works out <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Was our saviour last season and now a fringe man, this can't be allowed to happen.

Surely we can't let Januzaj go after letting Pogba etc go too?

Surely not?

1075~~~
Needs to go on loan to a decent league in Europe or stay in the Bpl at a lesser club like Newcastle or something his game time is so limited for him at the minute and playing the last 10 mins of games won't help him reach his potential.

1076~~~
They're a bit of a mess at the moment. Not sure the environment wouldn't be toxic with the whole Pardew thing. Wouldn't mind him going somewhere else though.

1077~~~
LVG needs to show faith in Januzaj and start integrating him in the team more, my opinion is a 4-2-3-1 would fit best with our players - De Gea, Jones, Evans, Blackett, Shaw, Carrick, Herrera, Januzaj, Rooney, Di Maria, Falcao/RVP. 
Rotate Mata, Rooney, RVP, Januzaj & Falcao but for me Di Maria is a must starter for us already.

1078~~~
I'd love to go with a 4231, but we've only got two top quality wingers in Di Maria and Januzaj. I think as soon as we get another winger in next season, we'll be heading towards utilizing a system with two wingers.

1079~~~
I'm not concerned about Januzaj because Van Gaal clearly rates him IMO which is why he's had him come off the bench in every game we have played this season, bar MK Dons which he started. Many youngsters struggle in their second season, but I feel it's different in Januzaj's case because he's not on the periphery of games. And apart from the Burnley and Leicester games, he's had a positive impact when he has been given minutes. Of course he was criticised against QPR for not making the right decision - which is subjective anyway - but it was a typical Januzaj performance in which he had a positive influence with the limited amount of time he's had this season and that can only be seen as a positive. Also he's had to operate in quite a few roles/positions this season already - from wing back to a centre-forward, and without playing consistently in one position, it's very hard to build up confidence.

1080~~~
Or maybe I don't want to face reality? I don't know, but his performances have been consistently good thus far this season:

1081~~~
At the risk of sounding like a Kagawa fanboy, I think it's time he got a start in these next three games.

1082~~~
Ahead of?

1083~~~
There's no easy answer here, but... perhaps Mata. 

... Ugh. Even I cant agree with that. But considering Mata could very well be on his way, why not?

1084~~~
I'd start him at the top of the diamond next week, he needs the boost IMO.

1085~~~
He's not going to improve without getting minutes. I genuinely can't see him starting until December. How much of an impression can you make covering numerous positions and playing so few minutes? I hope he plays with the Reserves on Monday at least.

1086~~~
He hasn't shown anything so far (albeit hasn't had many chances) to be selected ahead of Mata, start with Juan and bring Adnan on later in the game, have him run at tired defenders.

1087~~~
I'd imagine he's first choice sub, as he can come on for any of the front 5.

1088~~~
The problem is that in the diamond formation he has less opportunities to run at defenders.

1089~~~
He's not had a chance to start and been played all over the place as a sub. Mata in a similar situation  was even worse last week.

1090~~~
I'd start him ahead of RVP with Rooney out now.

1091~~~
I hope he plays for the reserves on Monday. It's a lower level, but at least he can show what he has to offer and keep some sharpness. Hopefully he puts an emphasis on his passing and vision as he has already shown to LVG that he can score.

1092~~~
RvP scored and played very well today. I f you want to drop a striker for him then it's Falcao.

1093~~~
Mata is on the way out? 

Didnt know that.

1094~~~
Falcao did everything better than RVP today except the goal for me.

Pressed harder, held up the ball better and linked up equally well getting a assist.


RVP just isn't involved enough in this system for me and with his lack of speed and workrate as such seems a luxury to carry at times even though he somewhat was better today till the 2nd half where he went AWOL.

1095~~~
I disagree, I thought RvP had the better game and linked up very well. He got knackered and should have come off after the red card IMO.

1096~~~
I miss seeing him play to be quite honest. Hope he will start a game soon, hasn't had many chances so far to prove himself under LVG. Then again, he is competing with one of the best strikers in the world.

1097~~~
Just noticed while doing my prediction team that Januzaj should play this weekend.

With both Rooney and possibly Herrera out due to the back injury, both Mata and Januzaj should start. Unless we are going to play Valencia or Fletcher in Herrera's place, and I cringe at the thought.

Only other thing would be to have Jones play CM with Blackett or McNair in CB. Wouldn't be opposed to that however it would be having Jones play out of his supposed best position in CB.

My current team would be

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/27211/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/27211/Manchester-United-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/27211/Manchester-United-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

With Jones in defence Januzaj and Mata would play. Another possible formation

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/27210/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/27210/Manchester-United-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/27210/Manchester-United-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

Playing Jones in the midfield would result in either Mata or Januzaj being dropped with McNair in defence.

1098~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OZlagpXbgWn/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>
He's far too good for U21 football. But he's also a level behind di Maria and Mata and Rooney, and we need to field our strongest eleven as much as possible. I think a loan wouldn't be too bad for him in January.

1099~~~
I thought he was really quiet tonight for the u21's, first half you barely heard his name, only he knows if he meant the goal or not but..  yea he shouldn't be playing at that level, the only gripe I have against LvG's tenure so far is the lack of opportunities for Januzaj.

1100~~~
jeez, that's a beautiful goal. 

man i miss watching him play. it's just a bad combination of no champions league, no capital one cup and absolute and proven world class players in front of him on the senior team (not such a bad comination).

1101~~~
I can't really complain about the lack of playing time for Januzaj right now, we need results and clearly di Maria, Rooney and Mata are all superior players. I'd like to see him loaned out, hopefully van Gaal intends to implement a 4-3-3 eventually...

1102~~~
surely we intend on giving him an opportunity to show himself though... RVP is one candidate who surely doesn't have a lot of time left at the top of his game.

Whatever we do with Adnan in the near future, it better be with the full intent of having him be an integral part of the team by next year or the year after at the very latest.

1103~~~
I'd agree, I personally would like to see what he could do at the top of the diamond, potentially even over Mata, but I'm a closet Januzaj fanboi.

1104~~~
Let's see if LVG can drop RVP for Januzaj.

That will be showing balls and commitment to youth players regardless of age more than playing young defenders for one odd game when all others are out injured.


I think managing time, man managment and rotation for Januzaj will be a big test of LVG's management abilities in this regard as to keep him happy. Or else he will leave soon enough which will be criminal.

1105~~~
He's not gonna drop van Persie, he's scoring goals. And lets be honest, Januzaj has yet to impress in his cameos thus far this season.

1106~~~
I have a sneaky suspicion that it will be Januzaj who replaces Rooney, not Mata.

1107~~~
Hope he gets a good loan to a foreign club in January, preferably still competing in the CL. He's far too good to play for the reserves and won't be playing ahead of RvP, Rooney, Mata (not enough games to rotate the squad) ....

1108~~~
It's good to see him give a shit in the u21s. It would be very easy for him to have a strop and stroll around doing nothing, but he's taking it seriously. 

He's in that awkward situation where he needs the minutes in the first team but from the midfielders you wouldn't drop anyone right now and at this moment no one is dropping RVP or Falcao for him either. Hopefully he keeps his head up and is ready to step up when inevitably some sort of injury gets him a route into the side.

1109~~~
He did pretty well when he came on as a Sub vs Swansea for around the full game and was our best player.

Rest of the cameos have been all over the place and for short durations which is something even Mata struggled at even more vs Leicester.

And RVP has gotten 2 goals but then so did Mata who got dropped and so Can Januzaj as he's showing more for the U21s now then in the past if given a chance and it's not like RVP is playing that well either and now Rooney is out too. (Was RVP even on the pitch for the 2nd half of last 2 games for example?)

As i said above, I think managing time, man managment and rotation for Januzaj will be a big test of LVG's management abilities in this regard as to keep him happy. Or else he will leave soon enough which will be criminal.

1110~~~
Or Van Gaal figures out that playing 3 centre forwards at once doesn't work at the highest level.

1111~~~
Yep but he seems reluctant to drop RVP no matter what given his performances. Rooney he said will get more privileges as captain and then there is Falcao who he brought in for a big deal last minute when we didn't really need him that much either.

Will be interesting what he does in this situation as Januzaj has a compelling case for more game time too and it might not be working as you say especially across balance of games. Will he drop RVP if his performances overall don't improve ?

1112~~~
He seems to be developing a knack of scoring goals now which bodes well for us. I hope he gets to play at the tip of the diamond against Everton.

1113~~~
Sometimes the manager just has to have the bollocks to play a kid regardless, like Wenger did with Ramsey until his faith was rewarded and he finally sparked into life, Januzaj should be getting games at United, he epitomises what this club stands for, even if it means having to rotate a star like Mata or whomever to get him in.
Alternatively 433 would equally solve the issue.

1114~~~
We're not playing with 3 centre forwards though.

1115~~~
This. SAF did it with Ronaldo and Rooney as well you could say during some lean years till they eventually started to pay off in trophies and as the crux of the team 2006 onwards.

He is the the test of Van Gaal's emphasis on youth and focus on long term and Identity talk much more than the odd defenders he is using when everyone else is injured. And he's good enough too as you don't necessarily need a established star everywhere.

1116~~~
He's mad if he think's this set up is right. One could argue he's picking it due to the level of opposition but I feel we should be trying to figure out our best way of playing. The current top heavy formation would see us get slaughtered against good opposition (or Leicester). No decent team at the top level is trying anything like it.

And yes Januzaj has a great argument for game time. He's provides width, is extremely creative, clever and is adding goals to his game. RVP is getting the place on reputation to the detriment of the team and bigger picture imo.

1117~~~
He's still 19 so playing the odd u-21 game is good for his development. We know he's a much higher level above that but for now he'll benefit from it.

1118~~~
What a goal.....

1119~~~
I don't understand some people on here. Adnan is a great player and has a bright future ahead of him. Whats the big deal having him play in the starting 11, he will get his playing time in due time. A team does not rely only on the 11 starting players but the whole squad and he is a part of that. LVG does rate him very highly as he's on the bench week in week out. He's 19 ffs he will develop more as a player and as long as he is developing we needn't worry. People discussing whether RVP or Mata should be next to go to make way for Januzaj is rather ...... We should be wanting players like Valencia, Young, Fellaini, Fletcher, Anderson to leave not RVP and Mata.

1120~~~
Have to agree with you there and could add that Januzaj gives us more flexibility to switch formations during the game, than Mata or Van Persie. We could play 4-4-3/4-3-3/4-2-3-1 in one game just by changing the positions occupied by Rooney, Di Maria and Januzaj. 
LVG seems reluctant to make the decision we, including him, all know he has to make at some point, choosing between Van Persie and Falcao. This indecision is forcing us to send out an unbalanced side with weaknesses that stronger sides will pick on and do great damage to our, already shaky defense.

1121~~~
I don't think Januzaj should be a guaranteed starter, but he does need starts.

1122~~~
That's nonsense really. 

Rossi, Pique and Pogba would all have gotten playing time in due time. None of them waited around.

Use him or lose him. It's as simple as that.

(A well chosen loan might help matters, but trying to placate him with a place on the bench, U21 games and promises for the future won't work.)

1123~~~
He needs game time. Slightly concerned at the lack of time he has on the pitch. I currently think he should be used to replace Di Maria at 75 minutes or so. Hopefully he can learn from him in training also.

Don't really see a place for him with our shape and forward line though <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1124~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2774141/Tottenham-U-21-1-2-Manchester-United-U-21-Adnan-Januzaj-leads-late-goal-flurry.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...-21-Adnan-Januzaj-leads-late-goal-flurry.html</a>

Scored 1 from a free kick, and assisted a last minute goal from a corner, really seems to take all the headlines in the U-21`s

1125~~~
When is that time going to come though? Mata, Rooney, Falcao and RVP still have plenty of time left at top level unless one or two of them move on he will only be a bit par player for perhaps Another 2-4 years. As Will Absolute Points out you can't expect a talent like Januzaj to just sit it out especially not if another top european team comes in with a better offer. In terms of development you could perhaps make a comparison between Pogba and Welbeck, one left to a team who were willing to back him and quickly rose to his potential, while the other perhaps stayed too long playing a bit par and quite experimental role in the squad and maybe therefore isn't where he could've been at this point in his career.

1126~~~
I think a loan move would do wonders too. I do feel though that he will get chances this month with Rooney being out and all

1127~~~
Where's he going to go? Real Madrid? To do what sit on the bench.....

A lot of you are acting like he's getting no playing time at all... Out of 7 games this season he's played a part in 3/4 matches and 2 U21 games...why all the hysteria?

We have just started the season, theres plenty more games to play, relax he will still be here next season. He is apart of the future and his time will come, in all honesty he is not ready to be a starter for UTD week in week out, he needs to develop more, he will get games here and there at the highest level, he will continue to improve as a player

1128~~~
He's a #10 and will play that role in the future. We don't even know if we will be playing this formation next year, LVG will have 2 more windows to improve us.

1129~~~
Being out of Europe, the Carling Cup and the signing of Di Maria and Falcao has put paid to that.

1130~~~
He's in a difficult situation. With Rooney out Mata will probably be the one who comes in, I wouldn't mind it being Januzaj though.

1131~~~

<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1133~~~
You have to wonder. What the hell was he thinking going for goal from that angle?

1134~~~
He most likely wasn't. I'd guess he was actually aiming for the player at the back posts and it just went in.

1135~~~
Aiming for the far side of goal in a shot/cross is very effective. It sounds like Di Maria had been working on it a lot for his goal vs QPR so maybe Adnan has been doing similar.

1136~~~
I'm not worried about LVG not trusting in him/youth. He's already given McNair, Thorpe and Blackett starts even though Ferguson would most probably have played Fletcher or some other senior player at CB. Given his previous track record, LVG won't hesitate to drop big name players for younger players if he feels that the younger player is going to perform better. Januzaj is unfortunate that he's stuck in between being too good for u21s and not being ahead of Rooney/Mata/others. As for dropping RVP, he's scored twice in two games so that's not going to happen anytime soon. Januzaj just need to buckle down and keep working hard in training. Shining light in a steaming pile of shite last season yes, but it's a new manager this season, as Mata is probably realising.

1137~~~
I'm hopeful that at some point in the season we'll have a run of games where both both Di Maria and Januzaj start.

1138~~~
I still want to see:

1139~~~
I would say it's like di Maria's freekick goal for us, aim at the far corner for the header or the goal, mostly looking for a touch but if it goes in then great.

1140~~~
"Having followed his debut season with a trip to the World Cup with Belgium - an experience which forced him to miss United's pre-season trip to the United States - a decision was made at Old Trafford to manage Januzaj's appearances this season and nurture his progress just as Ferguson had nurtured that of Giggs two decades earlier."

1141~~~
He's been on the pitch in 5 of our 6 league games. Clearly there's an effort to grow him into the team.

1142~~~
He's only 2 months younger than Sterling who is being given much more responsibility and is really stepping up. I'm sure it's frustrating for him to watch that and hopefully he'll be in the team before it's too late.

1143~~~
Yeah, but Liverpool are already growing over reliant on Sterling, even this early in the season. And that's not good for a nineteen year old.

1144~~~
Journalist in sensible non sensationalist article shocker!

1145~~~
Very true. There are a lot of lessons to be learnt from what happened to Owen and, to a lesser extent, Giggs. Obviously Giggs adapted immensely and was still a great player as he matured but he played a lot of football at a young age (99 first team games at the age of 19) which arguably contributed to the series of hamstring injuries that took away that incredible pace he had as a teenager.

1146~~~
Rodgers has been open about wanting to be careful with Sterling being overplayed but has had no choice given how he's their best player, we don't have that issue right now with Adnan.

1147~~~
i love adnan januzaj.

1148~~~
Indeed. Everyone forgets that Giggs' performances declined markedly in his 20s because of his fitness, never quite living up to his teen genius YPFA winning years of 93 & 94. When everyone thought he'd be the new Best. So markedly in fact that he was booed in 2002, with many fans quite happy to sell him. He was certainly the least crucial and revered member of that hollwed midfield at the time.

That seems absolutely daft obviously, but it's a part of his career that's completely brushed under the carpet now. The yoga wasn't so much foresight to prolongue his career, it was a method of fixing the damage done to it.

1149~~~
That FK goal just shows how much confidence the boy has right now.  It's lovely watching a young player play like he knows he's better than everyone else on that pitch, he knows he's good enough for a first team chance and it shows.  LVG can't ignore him forever.  His coaches will be constantly in his ear, telling him how Adnan has shown a remarkable improvement in training and should be ready for more first team opportunity.

1150~~~
One player I'd like to do well outside of United is Sterling, great to see a young English player doing so well week in week out, he Barkley and Shaw could be the foundations of a cracking England team in a few years.

1151~~~
Wish we would just use 1 striker then 1 of mata or rooney behind. Leaving space for di maria and januzaj on the wings. we would be so much more balanced and have  a shitton of depth.

1152~~~
Horseshit.

A decision was made to bring in a bunch of expensive stars which left no room in the team for Januzaj.

He's nineteen, not sixteen, and there's a difference between not overplaying a young prospect and not playing him at all.

1153~~~
Agreed, England have probably the best nucleus of young attacking talent we have had in some time so beyond club rivalry It is great to see Sterling developing so well.

1154~~~
He's played in 5 of our 6 league games. He's playing.

1155~~~
That stat is nonsense to be fair, 4 mins against Burnley, 9 minutes v QPR, 15 minutes against Leicester when we've already collapsed and couldn't even get the ball. Do you honestly think he'll be happy with that?

1156~~~
unfortunately, probably not.

but what's funny about this is how people claim he's "gone off the boil", and has been disappointing this year. He's literally hardly played at all, so how it's possible for people say he's struggling this year is beyond me.

1157~~~
19 year old players don't develop by sitting on the substitutes bench. That excuse is paltry. Rooney, Ronaldo, Fabregas and Messi weren't sat on the bench at that age, and neither were many other players now currently near the summit of the game. Januzaj should be playing fairly regularly and if and when we finish top four this season, Van Gaal should be doing all he can to build the team around him going forward. We have an exceptional talent at the club and we should never be left to wonder what if. I'm not worried yet, though, I just don't agree that rest is best.

1158~~~
What was he like when he was played in CM in Pre-Season? He's not the greatest defensively but think he can do a job replacing Herrera and doing a similar role to Di Maria on the left.

1159~~~
Yes, if he's not a prima donna. As long as he's being given assurances by LVG, which I assume he is. He's been given the No11 shirt, which is a fairly big gesture of faith, put under the tutelage of Giggs and given constant game time in the U21s, which to me shows that LVG wants to keep him fit, active and playing regularly. Everyone's getting completely carried away with the lack of starts for a precocious young talent half of you hadn't heard of this time last year. After 6 games of a new season.

1160~~~
He didn't play in cm vs Valencia. That was his only pre-season match. He played cm vs Sunderland and looked meh. You could tell he wasn't used to the position and it certainly isn't a position that gets the best out of him.

1161~~~
I'm not worried yet. It's still early days. If he still hasn't featured much by December, then I'd start asking questions. As it stands, it's understandable that he's behind Rooney/Mata, which makes crashing out of the COC even more frustrating. We're facing difficult opposition in the next month so it'll also be unlikely that he'll feature much then as I'm sure LVG wants a settled, strongest 11.

He did look burned out near the end of last season so it's understandable that the club wants to make sure that they don't Sterling him. I'm sure Giggs of all people would know how to manage Januzaj given the similarities between the two of them at that stage in their careers.

1162~~~
I suppose you've known him since he was a young boy have you? 

You being happy with him playing U21's and him being happy with it are very different things.

1163~~~
Fair enough, although think he may do better in the 4-3-3 diamond than he did in the 3-5-2. In 3-5-2 he's almost a holding midfielder. How ever with the 4-3-3- with Blind behind him, he's probably got more license to attack. As said i think he could do a similar job to Di Maria on that right side.

1164~~~
Not at all, I only really heard of him towards the end of Fergie's last season. Which is precisely why I'm not throwing a fit because he's not an automatic starter yet.

Neither here nor there really. Even if he has decided that one season of top flight football should afford him a regular berth at 19, the club shouldn't be bending to his whims.

1165~~~
Should be played ahead of Mata on Sunday. I prefer Mata at this minute in time but it's clear he doesn't feature in LVG's plans in the long term. Whether LVG has the balls to make such a decision remains to be seen.

1166~~~

1167~~~
Januzaj to take Herreras position against Everton please

1168~~~
Why? He's not a CM.

You rather put ADM in CM and play Januzaj further up

1169~~~
AdM plays the same position Herrera does just on the side of the diamond. Januzaj on the right can do a similar job to what AdM does on the left and he'll be able to run at this Everton defence, which has been pretty poor this year. Fletcher would just put us on the back track on that side offering no penetration. I'd rather Januzaj, Pereira, Fellaini or Anderson on that side than Fletcher who's finished imo.

1170~~~
Januzay's place is on the bench for the moment, he has to be patient.

1171~~~
He does not. Herrera is playing box to box, something ADM is not. Januzaj cant play that position, he's an attacking midfielder

1172~~~
Yes he does, AdM just plays it differently than Herrera due to their skill sets. Both are the side midfielders in the diamond.

1173~~~
You could argue the play the same "position", but are doing different roles.

1174~~~
They do play the same position (on opposite sides of the diamond), they just carry out their roles differently due to their different strengths.

1175~~~
Baines would tear us apart on that side if we start Januzaj and expect him to track runners and work box to box.

1176~~~
Maybe if you look at the team sheet that is shown on Skysports but obviously not during the actual game

1177~~~
It may look that way on paper but on the pitch Blind (Pearson) plays the Defensive midfielder, Herrera (Pereira) plays box to box midfielder and Di Maria (Januzaj) plays the attacking midfielder. Either Januzaj plays in Di Maria's position or #10, he can't play the box to box role.

1178~~~
I'd say if you look at the heat maps, and disregard the names, you'd see he plays on the right of the diamond. He moves across when AdM moves out towards the left, and vice versa, it's AdM is far more comfortable in wide areas than Herrera.

1179~~~
Don't want Adnan to replace Herrera. Doesn't have the defensive mindset and Everton will test us defensively at certain points.

1180~~~
Anyone else tired of people saying we cant play X Player here or X Player there because we're playing some midtable team? feck it. Januzaj needs to play, and so help me if I have to see Valencia start on Sunday.

1181~~~
am i the only one who wants to see him go out on loan?

1182~~~
I fecking hope so.

1183~~~
one man's opinion:

<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/adnan-januzaj-must-replace-suspended-wayne-rooney--not-juan-mata-101702343.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blog...ed-wayne-rooney--not-juan-mata-101702343.html</a>

1184~~~
Are you actually Adnan Januzaj?

1185~~~
No. I'm the dreaded Mad Winger of the Januzaj fan club.

1186~~~
I'd personally start Mata, but on the basis that if he doesn't impress Januzaj is hot on his heels and will start the next game. Both players should react well to a bit of competition. 

The same should apply to all of our forwards though, I'm a little uncomfortable about how all our three strikers seem to be bulletproof selection-wise, for various reasons. If LVG doesn't want to drop RVP, Rooney or Falcao there's simply no place in the first team for Mata or Januzaj. 1 or 2 of the strikers will have to be dropped in order for either of those two to start regularly.

1187~~~
He should play more. He's not ready to be a number 10. He is effective playing wide. He isn't a Lennon type winger but can beat his man easily.

1188~~~
I'd quite like to see Januzaj given a chance in that #10 role sooner rather then later.

1189~~~
He should start the next game in place of Mata or maybe RVP. His dynamism would make us even more dangerous going forward imo.

1190~~~
Yeah I was thinking along the same lines, the only thing is our next game is away, so I think LVG will stick with Mata, and then its Chelsea.

1191~~~
Januzaj is very confident, I don't think playing away to West Brom would be an issue for him, I'd play him instead of Mata.

1192~~~
Yeah, but there are always a hundred reasons not to take a chance. If we somehow dont get a result against WBA, it in all likelihood wont be as a result of Januzaj.

Sometimes I think people don't remember how good Adnan is. He was our second best outfielder last year FFS, and now he cant get a look in.

Throw him in, and let him stake his claim to a place.

1193~~~
Totally agree. It should be picked on merit. That can't happen when players are just ignored and not given an opportunity. He's one of the best 5 players in the club imo and can barely get a look in. Doesn't seem right when the likes of Mata and RVP are doing feck all and getting plenty of starts.

1194~~~
Anyone else thought it was a bit harsh to bring on Wilson ahead of Januzaj?

1195~~~
Would like to see Adnan play in the #10 position next match. Mata can play the Chelsea match. Adnan has shown good passing ability and a first touch in the #10 role. The only thing he needs to learn in that role (for first team) is how to find himself in better spaces to receive the ball more often. If you think back on his performances in that role, he never does bad. He only goes quiet at times.

He's the youngster that deserves the most time due to his talent, his past season, and his current performances for the u21s.

1196~~~
Januzaj needs to be given some game time. We can't leave him sitting on the bench. He needs to keep developing.

1197~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/football/video-1124873/Louis-van-Gaal-doesnt-kindly-question-Adnan-Januzaj.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/fo...aal-doesnt-kindly-question-Adnan-Januzaj.html</a>

Any chance LVG just doesn't fancy Januzaj that much?

1198~~~
On one hand, yes. Januzaj has done more, way more, to show he's worthy of time on the pitch.

However, you wont ever catch me complaining about putting another prospect such as Wilson out there. I love seeing academy players given a shot. What I cant stand is seeing players given automatic starts based on past accolades.

1199~~~
Ogden had an article last week that indicated LVG and everyone else rate Januzaj very highly. Giggs in particular.

1200~~~
Looks like Cryuff, plays like Cryuff, LVG hates Cryuff. Seriously though, what's LVG's problem with Januzaj. He's thrown every young footballer under the sun into the team this season but is ignoring the best one we have. Makes no sense.

1201~~~
Ah thats good to hear, you got a link to that by any chance?

1202~~~
Yep. I was delighted with Wilson coming on as well but given the way Januzaj has been playing in the U21's he probably deserves a few more minutes.

1203~~~
Here you go... It doesn't draw many conclusions but left me thinking positively about the whole thing.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11130027/Adnan-Januzajs-progress-being-regulated-by-Manchester-United-but-he-will-grow-impatient-in-the-shadows.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ut-he-will-grow-impatient-in-the-shadows.html</a>

1204~~~
Cheers <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1205~~~
Playing 1 game a week is the main reason Januzaj is seeing less game time this season.

But give LVG a break! he has an entire new back line to gel together, on top of taking a team that finish 7th back into the top 4.

It won't do Januzaj any harm watching from the bench for a few months.

1206~~~
Thats been the line since January. He doesn't need to be coddled, he needs to be unleashed.

We either let him do that for us or we will have a major regret on our hands when he does it for another team down the road. There is no question whatsoever that he'll be an elite player.

1207~~~
If he rates Januzaj that much it's a bit strange that we're watching RVP drag his tired ass around the pitch for 90 mins every week while he sits on the bench. It's frustrating and must be pretty disincentivising for Januzaj

1208~~~
Agreed, it would frustrate anyone.

1209~~~
There is a danger that once Januzaj does get a chance he might end up trying to do too much ala QPR in order to impress Van Gaal.

1210~~~
Maybe I'm over thinking this whole thing but it just seems a bit odd that a coach who is famous for giving youth a chance is overlooking Januzaj so much. I would have thought he would take great pleasure from developing a player with so much obvious talent and potential. Hopefully there isn't some underlying issue here because I love watching the boy play and it would be a crime if he ended up playing elsewhere.

1211~~~
Developing a player doesn't mean playing him, Van Gaal didn't played Alaba a lot in his first season, he trained him and then send him on loan at Hoffenheim. 
Van Gaal probably thinks that Januzaj isn't ready to do what he wants him to do and therefore is careful.

1212~~~
This formation limits his oppurtunities more than a 4-3-3 or a 3-5-2 even.


And LVG seems to have given special privileges to RVP.

1213~~~
LVG gets away with a lot on here due to his reputation. I hope you're right. I don't see how sitting on the bench for the last 10 months would benefit any player.

1214~~~
As soon as we go 4-3-3 he's in the team for good, sadly though it'll probably take a RvP injury for it to happen..

1215~~~
He sits 90mns but trains all the week, the training is more important. I selfishly want to see Januzaj play but i also think that he is not ready.
His game is immature and he doesn't compensate with tactical nous. And it's the same with Pereira or Pearson.
I think that we are forgetting that he is 19, rare are the players ready at that age. Shaw, Sterling or Marquinhos are exceptions.

1216~~~
That's fu*cking rubbish to be totally honest. He needs to play. He's been ready for over a year.

His game is far from immature. Last season his decision making was excellent. He had a great understanding of what was going on around him and played for the benefit of the team.

Any recent immaturity in his game comes from trying too hard to prove himself to a manager that has shown little interest in giving him a chance. Also the fact that you group him in with someone like Pearson makes me wonder if you have a clue what you're talking about.

1217~~~
Like i said LVG has bigger issues to fix first...getting the defensive balance right in the team and getting United back into Europe. 

I wasn't suggesting LVG was making Januzaj watch from the bench as part of a master plan for his development. To put it into perspective Januzaj is behind Rooney, Mata, RVP and Falcao! most managers in the same position wouldn't have Januzaj in the team either.

1218~~~
Fat chance it's going to happen, but I'd love to see him given a start upfront alongside Falcao in one of the next two games with Rooney out. He can drift into the channels so that Falcao can play solely through the middle, rather than trying to fit two No.9's into the team. He was devastating for the reserves the other week in this role with Will Keane through the middle.

1219~~~
I think Van Gaal is experienced enough to know when the time is right to bring him on. Not the end of the world if young Adnan misses a game or two - he needs to play, but not at the expense of the greater good of the team.

1220~~~
At the and of last season and during the World Cup/Summer it seemed like Januzaj was getting a bit over confident and acting like he was better then he actually was. Maybe LVG is bringing him back down to earth, it's important at that age to be grounded and to keep working hard. And if that is the case then LVG will have recognised this and made some decisions based on whats good for hes overall development. And to be honest it is a great test of character, and it seems like Adnan has taken it in hes stride and giving every game he's all, even in the U21's. Great to see.

I dont think he should be starting ahead of any of our front 3-4 at the moment anyway, but he should definitely be getting some more appearances off the bench when others are not performing. It will be interesting to see how this pans out, he is still only young so there is plenty of time for him to make hes mark.

Such an exciting player to watch, really looking forward to seeing him play again in the future.

1221~~~
I never said that he didn't need to play, i said that training was where you improve yourself.
And about his game i think that he is immature, his positioning and decision making isn't great.
He needs to play, i want him to play but i can understand why he can't play, when he is our 5th best striker and 3rd best #10.

And i talked about Pearson because at the moment we lack CM, and he could be an option but he isn't ready, i'm not comparing the players but the situations.

1222~~~
I'd argue that not trying to play two centre forwards front of a number ten would in itself be a step towards getting the defensive balance right. Januazj for RVP and we'd be a bit more solid imo. Also I don't think we have to secure european football before worrying about developing players like Januzaj. I would have thought the process works the other way around.

1223~~~
Playing 2 forwards and a no.10 might well be overkill so that is a very sensible point.

But as a basic idea, i'd put my faith in Falcao/RVP rather than a Januzaj <i>at this very moment!</i> It is still early in the season and LVG has changed soo much in a short space of time. So for now at least i believe points on the board are more important than worrying about Januzaj.

Hopefully United can lift the FA Cup this year and in doing so give the likes of Januzaj and Wilson game time along the way.

1224~~~
Definitely deserves a chance next week to start and prove himself in Rooneys absence as Mata didn't exactly do too much to stake a claim to be a regular starter today.

And when Rooney returns i think it maybe needs to be RVP to sit out for a bit, he looks like hes needed a rest for weeks now, have Rooney and Falcao up front with Mata or Januzaj in behind.

1225~~~
Playing him at the tip of the diamond would make us an even bigger threat in attack.

1226~~~
It's frustrating that he isn't getting any decent game time. Especially when Mata and RvP continue to put in average or poor performances.

1227~~~
I reckon LVG is keeping januzaj's head in check. He's been very selfish in his play when he's come on this season, probably thinking he's Cristiano Ronaldo after last season.

1228~~~
I think the world cup experience kinda set him back a little. He probably thought he was already good enough to start in any team. He kinda expoded last season but faded towards the end. He needs to find his form again before he can be given regular first team starts. But with us out of League Cup and not in Europe, it's not an easy thing to do (i.e giving him minutes to help him find form).

1229~~~
He's obviously not going to start at the moment, not only are there better players in the positions he can take up, but the amount of games means that nobody needs to be rested and the first XI needs more time to gel. 

Also have to say, he probably would of made it on in certain games if we had a more comfortable time. West Ham and Everton both had us pegged back for the last 20 minutes. Januzaj is not someone who is going to stop that. 

Come January he'll get more game time due to the FA Cup and this friendly's we apparently want to play.

1230~~~
But the opposite is actually what's happening because the team is unbalanced and only Di Maria provides us with a threat on the break. With Januzaj that wouldn't be the case at all. Atm I'm starting to suspect that LVG will say anything to avoid dropping RVP, something that ought to have happened weeks ago.

1231~~~
Most likely because he thinks the only way he can get playing time is to have goals. He's on the outside looking in and this lack of playing time is affecting his decision making.

1232~~~
Thats my take on the situation as well.

1233~~~
Kind of a luxury problem, but unfortantly, i don't see Januzaj getting many chances this season with all the new additions to our squad. The only viable solution imo is to play him wide in a 433, but that means (again) that either Mata, Rooney and/or RvP has to be dropped.

ADM----Falcao----Januzaj
----Rooney/Mata--------
--Herrera-----Blind-----

Could make a case for ADM taking Herrera or Blind's spot to fit in RvP, but that makes for a terribly unbalanced midfield. Maybe a loan would do him good?

1234~~~
You're probably right. There's no way RvP will be dropped for Januzaj and rightfully so (imo).

1235~~~
I'd like to see him play instead of Mata or RvP against WBA but very unlikely to happen, especially with RvP

1236~~~
I'd like to say I'd put him in for Di Maria for the West Brom game, but seeing as we're not in Europe, there's really no need to rest our players, especially now that we're starting to click as a team. We need to keep our momentum going.

1237~~~
He needs to trust LvG and stay calm,he can achieve so many things in the future as United player if he just stay calm and train hard.Hope he is smart enough for both parties sake.Dont take me wrong i enjoy watching him play but i rather have this season where Januzaj is great talent who grows then last where he plays a lot more looking like only bright spark in the team.

1238~~~
Di Maria is actually going to be doing a lot of long distance travelling during the INT break, so you never know. Mind you I hope he doesn't as that will screw my fantasy team!

1239~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

True. That said, from looking at Argentina's fixtures, they have Hong Kong on the 14th Oct, (which I hope he doesn't play in) which will surely give him enough time to be ready for the game on the 20th vs West Brom.

1240~~~
I guess one could argue that looking at the past/history gives a good indication for the future. In LvG's first season at Bayern, they won the double and made it to a Champions League final. Van Bommel was Van Gaals captain, helped him in the dressing room and they seemed very close. Van Bommel did excellent that season and had a brilliant World Cup after that, got a lot of praise from Van Gaal.

Second season, Van Bommel didn't perform as well at the start, Van Gaal started dropping him after two months or so. Van Bommel thought he deserved more credit and got mad, he switched to Mino Raiola and moved to AC Milan in the winter, since then LvG became his public enemy #1. My point being, Louis van Gaal doesn't keep players on the pitch for no reason, and he doesn't really favour certain players over others. If dropping RVP would've been the right thing to do, he would've done it already or he will do it as soon is he thinks it is necessery. So there's no need to be suspicious.

1241~~~
Januzaj will only make the next step forward, when he becomes a regular starter. In the current situation and with the current squad, thats not going to happen (except there is an injury crisis). Its pretty much a wasted year for him. The idea, that a player who is already on his level improves significantly just by training is nonsense. I cant remember any similar examples, where this worked.

I can hardly blame LvG for not using him right now. The competition is stiff and LvG needs results; but that was foreseeable after loaning Falcao. Either dont buy Falcao and trust Januzaj or send him on a loan for a year.

1242~~~
He's 19 years old, of course he will improve even if he isn't a starter, especially training with the likes of di maria and Falcao. He's an excellent young player, but you don't see you players starting for top teams unless you're Ronaldo or Messi.

1243~~~
Young players in Spain or germany get significant time on the ptich. Its absolutly common that 19 year olds are starting week-in-week-out. Those who dont get enough time on the pitch either join a team, where they can play on a regular basis or dont make it. The EPL is a fantastic league, but most teams are far behind when it comes down to developing players. The notion that players have their breakthrough in the mid twenties and peak around 30 is outdated.
Today young players usually have years of professional training behind them before joing the first team. The consequence is that even U20 players are capable to compete with professionals; at least the talented once. Of course they need time to adjust to the higher level, but Januzaj already proved that he is able to compete.
Of course they still learn something in training. Even old players do, but there is the point where its sink or swim. You either trust them or you dont.

Isnt the defence a good example of what happens with player, that are not trusted to start on a regular basis on their best position? Jones, Evans and Smalling are all a bit underwhelming and only if you give them enough time on the pitch you see if they have it in them or not. The idea, that after years of sitting on the bench, you pop up as well-rounded player is nonsense.


gist: trust young players or dont buy them.

1244~~~
Some people here talk about its good how we reward youth players, and that we should reward Blackett/McNair but thats bullocks, a youth player who was our 2nd best outfield player last season, carried the team when rvp and roo were injured is being sat on the bench, played out of position. Thats the opposite of rewarding, there is nothing that Januzaj could do to get in this Van Gaal team atm, and thats as unfair as it can get. While slowpoke RVP can play as bad as he want and still start the next game. 

Incredibly frustrating for the lad and he will not progress for long time if this continues. We are the only club who has such a massive talent who is just under 20 and bench/protect him, look at the likes of (Chambers, Hazard at the time, Gotze, Sterling, Munir, Jese, Meyer, Draxler, Pogba at the time, Coutinho etc)

1245~~~
Like you said, he isn't playing because he is not the best option, but players like Rafinha, Montoya, Jesé, Morata, Shaqiri even Varane weren't or aren't  regular starter at 19-20. 

In reality the only players who regularly play at that age are the ones who play in "weak" teams or the ones who are extremely good (Pogba, Thiago, Sterling).

The fact that he isn't playing much in the first two months, is normal when you judge is current level honestly, he is not a better striker than Wilson, he is not a better 8 than Pereira and he isn't a better #10 than Mata.

He has only one thing to do, work harder and harder, and become a real threat for his direct competition.

1246~~~
Or he will want to leave as he knows that other clubs will give him the chance and that he will develop when being giving one.. Just like Welbz/Pogba did. As for now it doesnt look like Januzaj will be a regular starter as long as Mata, Rooney, RVP, Falcao are here.

1247~~~
Every year I heard, that Barca has fantastic talents, who will be the next big thing. Most of these names vanished again, because they never played a significant role for the first teams; the established players were always prefered (might change this season). Deulofeu on the other hand was loaned out and showed great performances in a different leauge despite being young. It also surely doesnt help Varane to be benched, while Pepe is allowed to play. Nobody in Munich believes anymore, that Shaqiri will become a important part of the team. He´ll be sold next season. Jese started to get significant time on the pitch and showed impressive performances; sadly his injury was a huge setback. Thiago got significant time on the pitch during Pep´s last season, but left because the next manager didnt trust him. I dont rate Morata, but he also proves my point, doesnt he? He´d never be able to have his break through for Madrid, so he joined a club, where he has better chances to play.

Its complicated for big teams to promote youngsters, but that doesnt change the logic behind it. There is a point, usually between 17 and 20, where players have to get time on the pitch or their development stalls. Either use Januzaj as important part of the team or send him on a loan. Everything else is nonsense.

1248~~~
He needs games, players progress with games it's just that simple, Wenger would  have the proverbial bollocks to play him week in, week out regardless if he has/could buy better options, as he proved with Ramsey, taking stick even from his own fans on the subject yet stuck to his guns, and look at Ramsey now, I'm sure he'll do similar with Danny Welbeck who'll no doubt end up a better player for Arsenal over the coming years than he would if he'd stayed at United, that's the very definition of giving youth a chance.
RvP has been outrageously poor (for him) yet has played every minute he's been fit, similarly Mata the jury is still out, yet Januzaj hasn't had a look in, he'll know he could easily be getting chances elsewhere the longer this carries on.

1249~~~
Whatever the case may be, we will strongly, strongly regret it if we feck this up.

Arsenal's situation with Ramsey is a perfect example of what should be happening with Januzaj. I just think that with Di Maria you could have absolutely potent wingers.

Something like:

-------------Falcao
Di Maria---- Rooney ---- Januzaj
------Blind---------- Herrera
Shaw - Jones - Evans - Rafael

Looking ahead for the next two years, I really don't think RVP is the answer. At his age, there is only one direction he can go.

Having three players right now that "can't be dropped" is going to hurt is in a big, big way down the road unless that mentality changes.

1250~~~
Bear in mind with that formation, I'm not talking about going against a top club with that set up. But anyone aside from the top 4, I'd think that this set up would do significant damage.

1251~~~
He might want to leave, but he is stuck with us for the next 4 years. And if he refuses to compete for his place, he doesn't have the right attitude.
Fortunately, it's not the case.

1252~~~
Do you think United will keep him against his will, especially if he isnt playing? Couldnt he take the club to court then? There is a difference in competing and not getting a place no matter how bad your concurrors play (whats the case until now).

1253~~~
It's very soon, he may become a starter by the end of the season or the season after. He is not playing at the moment because he is not good enough in the eyes of the coach, same coach who gave Wilson a chance. And i think that if LVG rates him we will keep him no matter what.

As for the bold part, Mata has been good, Rooney has been great, RVP is meh but efficient and Falcao is good. The only player he could compete with is RVP and we have Wilson who is a better striker. And Januzaj has no holding play in him (at PL level), so he won't take Falcao's place.

1254~~~
I am thinking sooner rather than later, against Chelsea and City we will pay for accommodating untouchables. Januzaj might not have an illustrious a name as Van Persie or Falcao but it is a fact that we do miss what he offers, which is different to what any of Rooney, Falcao and Van Persie offers. Yesterday I thought we could have used him to nullify Bairnes by using Adnan to attack him, these are the circumstances where Januzaj is more useful to have in the side than Robin. I think the line up you posted is significantly more balanced than the ones we have used so far.

1255~~~
Indeed. I would be really angry if we lost Januzaj due to not getting any playing time because RvP was undropable despite being shit.

1256~~~
I'm not worried of losing him. I'm worried that we won't bring out his potential. He should be getting a good amount of minutes so he can get out all of the poor decision making, inconsistency, etc... out of the way. He has such a wide array of skills with great creative instinct.

Here are a couple of gifs from his performance vs Newcastle last season. He showcased numerous skills in that match. Excuse the poor quality on some of them.



What he showed in a lot of matches last season was not normal for a teenage footballer. The excuse last season for him not playing was that there was too much pressure on his shoulders to carry the team. That is why his minutes in the 2nd half of the season fell off a cliff despite performing better than Young, Valencia, etc... Now we can field Di Maria, Falcao, Mata, etc... in the same team with Januzaj and we're still not playing him. He's essentially not had playing time since February.

1257~~~
He needs to be playing in order to apply and perfect what he's learning in training. If he doesn't he'll most certainly stagnate and that would be horrible considering his importance to the club.

1258~~~
It's strange that all he has got this season have been a couple of short cameo appearances. It's a crucial season in terms of development for him, his second one in which he either builds on early promise or drops further down in the pecking order and so far the latter has been happening. It's early doors but it's certainly worrying that he's been out of the team.

1259~~~
This notion is utter rubbish imo. Taking correlation as causation makes no sense as far as im concerned. While those players did have lots of injuries other players who started early managed to go through their careers with relatively minor injuries throughout so its clear that the claim that too much football caused those injuries just cant be proven. I'm more of the logic that because this is a sport and lots of different individuals with different bodies injuries will happen to others while some will go through their careers relatively unscathed. How about we play the kid and stop coming up with theories that simply can't be proven. The other thing is Janu isn't exactly a baby, he's already 19 years old turning 20 in 4 months time.

1260~~~
I think that Januzaj was supposed to play in the two last games but Rooney red card and Shaw injury, forced LVG to change his plans.

1261~~~
I'd happily see van Persie or Mata dropped for him. Neither are stepping up.

1262~~~
RvP and Mata are doing just fine. Januzaj just needs to wait for his chance.

1263~~~
If he only played sparingly last year, it would make perfect sense that he would play just as sparingly, or even less, with the likes of Falcao, Di Maria et all in the mix.

1264~~~
I miss watching him play. 

In fifa 2015 I have Di Maria and Januzaj on the flanks and it works well.

I really think Januzaj is most effective from the wing at this stage in his career.

1265~~~
You're not the only one. They were singing his song at Old Trafford on Sunday, not many 19 year old kids get that honour when they're sitting on the bench. As an aside, only Rooney sold more shirts last year. Everyone wants to see him be a star with us.

1266~~~
Patience is a virtue. Rooney is 28 and RVP is 31.

1267~~~
They certainly didn't do anywhere near enough to justify leaving Januzaj on the bench.

1268~~~
The biggest problem this season is a lack of games for the club. Most fringe players will suffer.

1269~~~
Can't believe some people losing their shit over a 19 year old not being involved much. Give it time. If he was playing, the same people would be saying we need to protect him.

Patience.

1270~~~
There's always some stick to beat. Lookie, RvP is undroppable.. Let's drop Mata and I want Januzaj... Let's sign Coleman... Sell Rooney now...

1271~~~
No one would complain about Januzaj being played, there's no way a 19-year old should be protected from football.

1272~~~
Its completely understandable that he isn't getting time, he has RVP, Mata, Rooney, Falcao and Di Maria to compete with for Christ sake. LVG doesn't want to risk the inconsistency of a 19 year old in a tight game, if we were 3-0 up against Everton he would've certainly got plenty of time on the pitch, don't panic, it'll come.

1273~~~
Rewind to last season. Heaps were saying he was overused at times.

Some of our great young players to come through have all been "protected" (maybe not the right term but gradually introduced), so I have no issue with not seeing Januzaj for a few weeks, even though, I am up there with his biggest fans. This is not a make or break season for him, fansare just too dramatic.

1274~~~
There is middle ground between playing him twice a week on a regular basis (which we cannot do anyway because we don't play twice a week) and not playing him at all. It's very early though so I hope it's just a temporary situation.

1275~~~
Let's be real here, RVP and Mata haven't exactly been consistent. Even Rooney started off slow, but has since been playing well before his suspension. No one is asking for Januzaj to start every game. Just give him 1 start at least. The good thing about the international break is that he can maybe get some minutes with Belgium.

1276~~~
I agree but as on your last point, I just can't understand the people who can't get over him not playing for a few weeks. It's football, that happens.

1277~~~
Why are so many people having shit-fits over Adnan? Ogden wrote in The Telegraph that there was a concern within the club that he was badly overexposed last season and it ended up having a negative impact.

I know some will say it's only a shirt number, but we wouldn't have handed him 11 if it was our intention to marginalise him.

1278~~~
And despite that we've had absolutely no problem scoring goals, with RVP getting 2. Evidently he's happier to build a bit of momentum with the established players, once we are playing well on a regular basis Januzaj will no doubt be integrated.

1279~~~
Pretty much. Feet back on the ground for him, it's a long season and you can only start 11 players each week. He'll get his chance.

1280~~~
The only thing Januzaj have to do this season is to play well when he's called upon. If we get into Europe, we will have 60+ games next season. RVP will be 32, and he will be 21. Best moment to take his chance and seal a spot in the team.

1281~~~
Quite simply, with the amount of games, and attacking talent at our disposal, it will take injuries for him to get proper game time. 
Out of 3 attacking spots, he has to displace Rooney, RVP, Falcao, Mata
Out of 3 midfield spots, he has to displace ADM, Herrera, Blind, Carrick

He will have limited starts this season, hence why I'd like to see him start for a PL team with the option of a recall.

1282~~~
And i prefer to see him with the team while Van Gaal is implementing his "philosophy". And after, probably in january, maybe send him on loan.

1283~~~
I just think he's going through one of those lengthy dips in form that can happen to young players. His WC tournament didn't go well and he's not looked great in his first team appearances so far this season. He's still got enough about him to look better than U-21/reserve players but he's not at a level where he should be getting many PL minutes. Not when we have other options. It happens. Sterling had a really difficult time at Liverpool in his second season, for example. People just need to be patient. With him and the manager who's not picking him.

1284~~~
I wouldn't be against that.. you don't disagree you'd rather him get game time, but prefer he was educated in the system that will be familiar to us moving forward, that all makes sense.

1285~~~
Come on. How can he have poor form if he hasn't had a start since May,  has had just a few minutes of cameos and as for a "poor"  world cup, he played 60 minutes in the entire tournament. I really don't think that's fair.

1286~~~
Not only that but the amount of people who think they know better than Van Gaal is quite comical. They have zero insight into his logic, what happens at training, and everywhere else we have no access to.

1287~~~
You answered your own questions there.

If was at his best he'd have featured more than he has, for club and country.

1288~~~
Mata good, Rooney great? Mata has been pretty poor, he has added very little apart from his 2 goals. Rooney has been good.
There is no way Januzaj will wait for like 2 *at least* years and sit on the bench. He can go to every club in the world, give me one good reason why he would stagnate his development for 2 years or more?

1289~~~
I really fear we lose another top academy product if he doesn't get game time soon. He needs to play!

1290~~~
If everyone else was measured by those same standards, there'd be 0 footballers on the pitch. He was officially named our player of the month three times last season, including in January and May (a short month, granted), I'm not sure what else a player can do to earn time on the pitch.

1291~~~
I agree, it's not like he hasn't shown that he can perform at this level, and his development will stagnate if all he gets is 15 minutes here and there, we need to trust him.

1292~~~
Be clearly better than the starters, which he is not, he is not a better striker than Wilson, Falcao, RVP or Rooney and he is not a better #10 than Rooney or Mata. 

He had a big opportunity against MK Dons and he was shit while Pereira and Wilson showed good things, Januzaj is our second best Winger but we don't play with wingers, if he wants to play he has to force his way to the starting 11, he doesn't deserve any privileges.

And the fact that he was player of the month three times is totally irrelevant, Valencia has been player of the year and people are convinced that he is shit and always have been.

1293~~~
The blind panic on here sometimes....

Lets look at the facts......He's on a long term contract. he's been excellent in the reserves of late. Working his arse off and scoring and assisting.  If there was any issue with him this wouldn't have been the case.

Hes 19 and will get his chances as the season progresses and we develop more as a team.

1294~~~
He has a long term contract. This is completely different to the Pogba situation. He can't leave unless we are happy to let him go which I don't think we are.

1295~~~
We can't truly know his level of desire until he gets a twitter account, though.

1296~~~
Im all for seeing young players in the team and think he has the most potential of all our young players but he is still growing and gaining muscle as he fills out and this can make players quite susceptible to injury. He was over exposed last year and if he isnt managed properly now he might never get close to his full potential. Hes been involved in more games this season than at this stage last season and obviously everyone wants to see our best and most exciting young player on the pitch but the idea that people on here know better than a manager who is renowned for his ability to manage and bring through young players and an entire medical and coaching team who monitor everything about his daily life and character is ridiculous.

1297~~~
It's not really 'coming up with theories' given that a lot of people within the game (including Fergie himself) have said the same, backed by their medical staffs. Whilst obviously every player is different, I'd be interested to know what other examples you can think of other players playing racking up Giggs/Owen-esque appearance stats at age 19 (we're talking 40-50 games a season here). When you come to think about it there's actually an incredibly small sample size. 

Anyway, I'm not saying we shouldn't play him at all, personally I'd love to see him starting over Mata in the next game, given that Mata didn't exactly make a strong case for his inclusion in Rooney's absence. But there's ultimately no need to risk him, he's not agitating for a move or anything and we're not short on quality in his position so by any standards it'd be daft to have him playing every game.

1298~~~
Regardless, the best way for him to improve is to get more game time.

1299~~~
I have, Pogba, Messi, Rooney, Thiago, Benzema, Sterling, Gotze, Draxler, Verratti, Kroos, Aguero, Higuain, Falcao, Neymar, Hazard...
I think that it's 50/50 half of this players are or have been injury prone, the other ones are freaks

We are two month into the season and he featured in most of the game, if didn't played lately it is mainly due to game circumstances Rooney's red card and Shaw "dead knee".

1300~~~
Adnan's age should not come into the equation when it comes to whether he should be playing or not. At least per LVG philosophy/view because he's said experience is not a matter of age.

Right now unfortunately I think he is competing against players that are truly on the top end of the positions he could play in. Even though the likes of Mata, RVP are not performing to what they are capable of - knowing they are capable of a higher standard and that they do have the experience, keeps them ahead of Januzaj. I do think if the likes of Mata, RVP continue to play they've been and LVG doesn't give Januzaj a shot, then not only is he being hypocritical but, also could potentially lead to Januzaj getting unsettled.

Personally, I think we could do with him on the pitch to give us that one additional threat to Di Maria in taking players on, if Di Maria is not on his game or fades, with our current make up of our 11, we have a harder time creating. Januzaj in place of Valencia against WBA is something I'd love to see us give a shot.

1301~~~
I'll never agree that he was shit against Mk Dons. I think his performance caught flak just because he was part of that horrible result. If you watch his individual touches in that match you would know he wasn't shit. He wasn't great, but he was at the very least decent.

1302~~~
Kagawa was decent before his injury, Januzaj was useless.

1303~~~
I am a little worried about Januzaj. He's a ridiculously talented footballer and had he been at a United team circa 2004, which was comfortably in the top 4 and werent stocked with expensive top buys, then he'd be playing week in week out. Had he been at liverpool in place of sterling he'd be playing week in week out. But at United we have an odd situation where we've been in freefall from a position of a absolute greatness, and aalso have spent big time to redeem the same, which makes those expensive big players playing very important. It's a shame and I hope he has chooses to work hard and force his way in because loads of young players and most infact would want to move.

1304~~~
We'll just agree to disagree. He almost scored, provided some nice passes, and did a great job at bringing the ball up the field from the right wingback position. The only way you can describe him as useless is if you expected him to score a goal. The midfielders, Chicha, and defenders were useless in that match, but not Januzaj.

1305~~~
I don't think Januzaj has been afforded enough starts to conclude that he's not on form, besides which you're going to get some inconsistency from youngsters, we suffered through the first 3 years of Ronaldo, where most of us were lording over his potential one game, and pulling our hair out for the next couple, before he exploded into life in his 4th year with us and never looked back.
The one thing Ronaldo recieved through it all, regardless of his inconsistency was game time here at United, and Januzaj should be afforded similarly.

Mata hasn't cemented his role in the team, far from it infact, shunted to the bench despite finally getting to operate in his favoured position no less, in favor of Rooney, likewise RvP is looking a shadow of himself as of late and Januzaj still isn't getting a sniff, he's scored 4 goals in 2 youth games in the meantime, theres not much else he can do to try and impress LvG.

1306~~~
Maybe, you are right.

1307~~~
I'm not concerned that he will leave like some people are, my concern is primarily that his development will stagnate pretty severely.

1308~~~
He is not a typical LvG winger, so he will hesitate playing him on the wing. In the No 10 he will be behind Rooney/Mata and once Carrick is back and we buy a DM he might even be behind Herrera in the No 10 role.
As striker he is obviously behind the big 3.
The EL right now would be the perfect opportunity to play him and Wilson in ... extremely depressing actually we are not in it!

1309~~~
Thought the EL would be great for the youngsters too. But we would have fielded U10 defenders.

1310~~~
I said at the start of the season that we shouldn't worry about his inevitable lack of game time this year. At 19 I don't think it's a bad thing to just be with the first team, training alongside great player's, getting used to a new system and playing occasionally, mostly off the bench. Unfortunately this has been exacerbated by being knocked out of the Carling Cup.

The main issue will be next season, whereby hopefully we will have around 50% more games to play. 15/16 and 16/17 will be key seasons for him whereby he needs to be playing every week, in his ideal position. If we can't offer him 30-40 full games where he plays the majority in his favoured position we need to learn from the mistakes made with Welbeck and let him go on loan (although I think Januzaj is in a different League potential wise).

The difficulty is he doesn't really fit into the current diamond we are playing, which suits the majority of our best player's and this is unlikely to change next season (unless we have a bit of an overhaul). If this is the case I wouldn't be against letting him join a progressive team like Swansea for a year or two. I can imagine him returning to us at 22 as a quality player with over 100 Premier League games under his belt.

Unfortunately we aren't in a position currently to gamble on a 19 year old coming good, at the potential cost of Champions League qualification.

1311~~~
If we really are intent on playing the diamond for the rest of the season and next season, which I hope we are not, we really need to sort out a loan for him rather sooner than later. I'm pretty sure there would be a lot of good team that would be interested in a 2 year loan. Maybe even some of the Spanish or German teams that play CL football.

Of course I would like to see him make his break through at our club but with a formation that only empolys one attacking midfielder/winger I see little chance for this to happen.

1312~~~
Considering that he was, and is, one of the most highly-sought after young players in the world, I think that's a fair bet.

1313~~~
That's not entirely true, sometimes the manager simply prefers experience. Januzaj was on a high when he went to Brazil. Yet he was rarely given the opportunity due to his lack of experience and caps. And to be fair to him, Van Gaal has not given him many opportunities as of yet either.

1314~~~
He's had a lot of sub appearances so far, maybe flu.d have played a bit more, but he's not first choice yet. He's only 19 years old and he shouldn't expect to be a starter with the options we have. What he needs to do is stay focused and do his best in training and the game time he gets to force his way into the team, because nobody is going to just give him a start just because he's a promising youngster. He has to prove he deserves to play ahead of Van persie, mata, rooney or falcao because we won't be rotating much this season because of a lack of midweek games.

1315~~~
Is Januzaj's lack of game time down to him or the fact that we are trying to bed in a new midfield and forward line with established pros? 

It makes far more sense to integrate the seasoned pros first before you bring in your up and coming players into that. We already have enough issues with the whole RVP or Falcao, Rooney or Mata and eventually Carrick or Blind before we even bring Januzaj into the equation.

1316~~~
Personally I don't think we'll be playing the diamond by the end of the season, or at least as our main formation. By next season I think RvP will probably just be a squad player, I doubt mata will still be here and we'll probably sign a midfielder like strootman. So that would probably leave us playing a 4-3-3 with di Maria, falcao, januzaj up top, and 3 of strootman, herrera, blind and rooney in the midfield 3. We'll also have other competitions so he'll see a lot more game time.

1317~~~
Spot on.

It's as if people expect a nineteen year-old to be an automatic starter purely because he has an abundance of potential. Last season we were far too reliant on him for long periods of the season and now we have added much needed quality and competition which should act as extra motivation for Januzaj to enhance his game and prove himself in the team. Learning off of players like di Maria, Herrera, etc, should be of great benefit too him in the grand schemes of things.

He will get his chance, he just needs to work hard in training, keep impressing the manager and have some semblance of patience and he will get his opportunities in the team. Sterling struggled for form at the beginning of last season for Liverpool and look at the trajectory he has taken in the new year. The same can happen for Januzaj. Loaning him out would be idiocy when we have a small squad anyway. He's a good alternative to our other attackers and offers something different. Not too mention players will pick up injuries and loss of form. He is needed.

1318~~~
I'd say it's simply because RvP, Rooney, falcao, mata and di Maria are all better players then him and so they'll start ahead of him. All there is to it.

1319~~~
I need to know why are we arguing here ?

Januzaj played in 6 of our 8 games, this season. And hadn't be particularly good in one of them.

So, why should he be treated differently ? The only game where LVG made a clear choice against Januzaj, was the Everton game and he chose Wilson to replace Falcao, so a striker for an other striker, against West Ham we had to use one substitution after Rooney's red card, and against Everton one substitution to replace Shaw.
Now if someone have a problem with that i don't understand because Wilson have been good in all his appearances, he hasn't been inferior to Januzaj, not even once.
I feel that some of us want to see Januzaj treated differently, which his comprehensible he was our only good thing last season, but it's not fair

1320~~~
I still think we'd need at least 1 other top class winger to convert to a 4-3-3. Having Januzaj and Di Maria for 60 games wouldn't work and I highly doubt Nani/Valenica/Young will be in the manager's thoughts. I agree with you if we signed someone like Reus, particularly if RVP's form doesn't improve.

1321~~~
I can see us rotating between a 4-3-3 and a diamond, with di Maria either playing in the hole or on the wing.

1322~~~
It'll be interesting to see how we setup against Chelsea and City in all fairness. I have a feeling (particularly away at City) that we won't play all 5 of RVP, Falcao, Mata/Rooney, Di Maria, Herrera. The question is whether Carrick comes in for a striker, or whether we change formations. I think that might go a long way to seeing Van Gaal's plan for the team (rather than just get as much attacking talent on the pitch as possible and assume they'll be good enough to win).

1323~~~
Even though Adnan is an outstanding talent, a player at that age can't expect to feature to the amount of games he had last season at a top club. Yes, he carried us at times in the past year and was one of our best players, but that was also down to a lot of first team players weren't up to it anymore and not performing at all. He will be a magnificent player in the future and is far too good for reserve games, but he has to be patient at the moment. 

The press will surely exaggerate things about him being unsatisfied about game time, other clubs sniffing around and compare the situation to Pogba, as some already did on here. But I think the club told him about his situation and that real game time will probably come around the second half of the season. He comes across as smart enough to understand that he didn't get Giggsys shirt for nothing and also has a coach who is known for developing young talent. We have unbelievable players in his positions and even just to train with them at the age of 19 is beneficial for his development. With van Gaal still implementing his philosophy, it's vital that he is with the team and I think that is more important than games at the moment. 

We aren't exactly consistently good over 90 minutes as a team, alredy have a lot of inexperience at the back due to injuries and massively needed points over the last games. We can see the process on the field and once the ship has steadied, he will get his games.

1324~~~
Yeah its not like he was being played out of position, or that he was giving short cameo's. The only time he played in his position,  he was massive threat.. (vs Swansea)

1325~~~
What are you saying ? I didn't said that he shouldn't play or that we shouldn't give him a chance. I just don't understand why all this negativity at this point of the season. He is playing, he is not a starter for the moment but he will start at some point, it's not as if he was out of the team and totally ignored like Anderson.
And against swansea he replaced Lingard as a wingback, if i'm not mistaken.

Edit: and he is initially a #10 playing him on the wing, is playing him out of position.

1326~~~
Think we'll go for
With Rvp in for Rooney for the Chelsea game as Rooney is suspended. Herrera, di maria and Rooney I'd say are automatic starters when available because of all they offer and the lack of cover for Herrera. Rvp and Falcao could change, you can put mata in there too, and then Carrick and blind would compete.

1327~~~
while you might be right, that just looks ridiculously narrow.

1328~~~
I seriously don't think LvG will ever play Di Maria as a No 10, and even if all Rooney/Mata/Herrera are unavailable, I really think he will play Januzaj or even Pereira there ahead of Di Maria. 
Playing Di Maria as a 10 will eliminate the only threat and pace we have from the LMF/wing.

1329~~~
He wouldn't be a normal #10, he'd just have a free role to go out to either wing or go through the middle. He'd keep the same role he has now attacking wise, just defensively he will more focus on pressing the defenders rather then tracking back and covering Shaw. He'd still drift out to either wing so it wouldn't be any more narrow then now.

1330~~~
Really can't see it. I like your line up, but would say Di Maria, Carrick and Blind in MF and Herrera as a 10, Herrera could press the defenders then as he would have a bit less defending to do as a 10 than in midfield.

1331~~~
He's only gotten a good amount of minutes against Swansea and Mk Dons. He had 27 min as a cm vs Sunderland, 3 min vs Burnley, 8 min vs QPR, and 18 min vs Leicester where United were down to 10 men for half of the time he was in the game. He's had no pre season and has been playing in unfamiliar positions. He's had to play as a cm, rw, lw, rwb, #10, and striker in those matches. He plays numerous positions throughout a match. For example, against Swansea he played as a rwb, rw, and lw in the same match. Against Mk Dons, he played as a #10 and as a rwb. There is just no consistency in his roles. I think it's unfair on him to say he's had chances to impress. 

I don't think people should panic about him. I like the fact that when he's not playing he's playing for the u21s and he will surely get more playing time as soon as December rolls around. I'm just saying that I would have preferred 1 start in either of the previous 8 matches or in the upcoming fixture vs West Brom.

1332~~~

Hopefully Januzaj can get a start against West Brom if our first team players need a bit of a rest. Has he been called up by Belgium? Even then he won't really be a first choice player for Belgium and might get a few runs here and there, leaving him fresh for us <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1333~~~
Talents don't become world class sitting on the bench.

1334~~~
I don't see why we can't drop one of Mata/RVP/Falcao and fit him in against West Brom. Having him and Di Maria in the same team sounds fecking brilliant to me.

He doesn't need to be protected. He needs to be unleashed so he can realise his enormous potential.

1335~~~
Mata and RVP have been performing below average, one could argue LVG should have dropped either one of them to give januzaj a chance. People seem
to forgot he was our best attacking player last season. Not saying he should start every game, but I am surprised he has barely featured so far. You know as well as I do it is very difficult to prove yourself when given such limited cameos, especially the way we were struggling a few weeks ago.

1336~~~
I agree that they haven't been performing well, or well enough, but then again none of us know how they've been in training. His sub appearances have all been pretty ineffective, apart from when he was put on the wing. I'm sure van Gaal rates him, and he'll get his chances, he just needs to be patient. 

I know he was class last season, but it was still his first season in professional football, and often you see players struggle to make that impact in their second seasons. He's still just a 19 year old so has loads of time on his hands, and he would be getting plenty of game time if we had European football. Because we don't, we don't rotate our team and so he has to settle for sub appearances.

1337~~~
I don't even think it's a dip in form that has contributed to him being on the bench. We have bought better players than Januzaj who fit our system so much better at the moment, it's that simple really. I do agree with you that people need to be patient, I don't quite understand some of the negativity and exaggeration in this thread. With the exception of the Burnley and Leicester games, he's done well when he's come off the bench, and it's worth noting that he's not had a set position under Van Gaal this season.

1338~~~
Whenever Januzaj has been called upon, he has been not that good so its understandable why Lvg is not trusting him anymore.He needs to improve his form and decision making or else he won't start that much this season.

1339~~~
Ofcourse he wont play well if he is constantly being played out of position and is put on in the last 20 min (this season, most of the times the pressure is on us during these minutes)

1340~~~
You can't use that as an excuse so whenever he get his chances he needs to take it, thats what differentiate exceptional talent from ordinary talent.

1341~~~

1342~~~
^ David Moyes. TRUST

1343~~~
He's not even getting 20 minutes lately. He got 18 min vs Leicester where half of the time he was on the pitch United were down to 10 men, he had 27 min vs Sunderland as a cm (a position he has never played before), 8 min vs QPR, and 3 min vs Burnley. I think you're expecting too much in those sub appearances. Anybody would struggle in his shoes.

Also, it's not like every starter has played brilliantly in every match. It took a couple of players a couple of matches to start performing well. Januzaj isn't afforded those same chances as he's not a star player like they are.

1344~~~
This is genuinely the new Kagawa thread of the season.

Moaning about not being given a chance then being played out of position when he's brought on - as if the team needs to be adjusted just for him.

1345~~~
Yeah, not even close to the Kagawa thread.

1346~~~
Deserves a start over Mata next game IMO.

Mata had another chance last week and failed to grasp it, Januzaj now needshis chance to start a game and show what he can do again from the hole.

1347~~~
Mata is actually putting up great numbers but I'd give Januzaj a shot. I think he's potential much more like the number 10 we need than Mata is.

1348~~~
Agreed. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1349~~~
No it's not.

1350~~~
The moaning is quite embarrassing and cringeworthy. If Van Gaal, who knows a thing or two about managing, feels it appropriate to play Januzaj, i'm sure he would do it. Ultimately, the club comes before any one player as well it should.

1351~~~
Adnan's time will come. Was a bit infuriated by his relative lack of game-time at first to be honest. But on second thought - he's just 19, not many players of that age starting week in and week out for one of the elite clubs. One can see an extended run-out taking its toll on Sterling already, he's looked decidedly knackered at times this season in part due to Liverpool's over-reliance on him. What happened to the likes of Owen should serve as a precautionary note for the future generation of young players. Trust Van Gaal to take a measured judgement on him, he's one of the best youth mentors around for a reason. Even Giggsy must be providing some input built around his experiences as a wunderkid and the exertion it puts on the still developing physiques. Reckon we'll start seeing more of Januzaj and Wilson as the season wears on and we pick up momentum.

PS : Good interview by Moyes. Agree with his assessment of Adnan. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1352~~~
Agree with this strongly, cosider Januzaj's performance against Hull at OT last year,  almost running the game at times, everything flowed through him in spells, he's more a no.10 playmaker type we need behind our forwards than Mata who's more an eye for goal but doesn't contribute to the play as much as a Silva type.

1353~~~
Come to think of it, he does have that deceptive burst of speed that Waddle had.

1354~~~
It's effective, but at times it's not enough as the player can bully him with strength. Last season against Shaw was a good example of this. Januzaj had Shaw beat the first 2 yards with either his burst of speed or first touch only for Shaw to win the ball back by using his strength. That part of Januzaj's game will only become more effective as he gets older.

1355~~~
His lack of game time is a big concern. He was one of our brightest sparks last season. I know he is only 19 but he won't be happy with this bit part role if it continues. Adnan's potential is massive so his development should be a club priority.

1356~~~
Didn't play for Belgium either so hasnt played any minutes in nearly a month now except couple U21 games.

LVG needs to invest time in him and Wilson but he's almost over loaded the areas they play in.

1357~~~
Nah, he was heavily overused last season and his form faded away as a result.

1358~~~
If LVG insist on the narrow 4-4-2 system then Januzaj wont have a real go. There's no way the guy will bench Rooney or Mata for him as no 10. Honestly Id wish we bring a quality defensive minded midfielder such as Vidal. That would allow us to play with wingers (Di Maria on one side and Januzaj on the other) and unleash Rooney and RVP/Falcao upfront.

1359~~~
He really wasn't. He started 15 games in the entire season with 12 more appearances as a sub. One of his best performances came at the end against Hull. Moyes handled him perfectly, one of the few things he got right.

Since then he's barely played. Didn't play too much for Belgium, next to no pre-season and a few sub appearances so far. Rooney and Ronaldo were regulars for us at this age. He needs to play, he's not going to get better sitting on the bench.

1360~~~
He's still young and if he has his eye set on becoming a first team United player it will come. The problem these days is loyalty though and if he's not getting first team football here he will certainty get it else where (Pogba to J<i>ew</i>ventus)

Its just hard to keep young players happy these days, especially in a time we need our strongest 11 on the pitch at all times to get back  into CL football.

1361~~~
He was also very good vs Aston Villa and Newcastle, I agree with you.

1362~~~
Doesn't have mindset for the philosophy. Seen enough after he lost the ball 22 times against Chelsea (for someone who spends that long to make a decision on the ball)

1363~~~
If someone has a terrible match, he doesnt have the mindset for the philosophy, legit.

1364~~~
Really should consider sending him loan

1365~~~
He should play more imo. His good enough, thats for sure.

1366~~~
Could do with a loan to Southamton or a similar club. Not a club that are struggling for 3 points every week.

1367~~~
Really don't understand those suggesting a loan. Who do we turn to if we need a game-changer off the bench in his absence. Young or Wilson? Even with our light fixture list, we suffer an inordinate amount of injuries and for all we know, we might end up losing Falcao, Rooney, Mata or van Persie for a long period of time. He will get games and as fans we should be patient. I'm sure he will get a run soon enough.

1368~~~
I hope it's true about him getting a start on Monday, he'll never be able to earn starts if he doesn't get more than a few sub appearances.

1369~~~
If I was picking my best team he would be in it. He really should be ahead of Mata in the pecking order for me.

1370~~~
From his general football, the way he plays, the decision he makes. That one match just highlights what happens when he plays against a big team.

1371~~~
You do realize he is 19 years old, ya? I think most people would agree he has done quite well for his age in probably the most competitive league in the world, give him a feckin break. Last season was his first/break through season playing with the big boys, and he proved to be one of our stand-out attacking players. We often relied on his creativity in order to gain something from a match, as the senior players were piss poor.

1372~~~
At the moment based on current form, perhaps yes. Still think Mata will prove to be a brilliant player for us.

1373~~~
What's this all about?

1374~~~
Trizy hates jews.

1375~~~
Is this about Januzaj? He was our best player vs Chelsea which says how bad the others were that day because it certainly wasn't his best match. He didn't lose the ball 22 times that day either so you have a really bad memory of that match.

1376~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/f365-features/9126477/Premier-League-Numbers-And-Stats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football365.com/f365-features/9126477/Premier-League-Numbers-And-Stats</a>
"Adnan Januzaj lost the ball a massive 22 times v Chelsea"

Well the way you criticize my memory says alot about your own memory and the way people defend the players they like in general. Fans are always going to overlook flaws and only remember the good things about their favourite player. You must have a very different philosophy to football (and probably Januzaj too) if you believe that someone who loses the ball 22 times was the "best player."

1377~~~
Same curse as number 7?

1378~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/motm-vs-chelsea-a.382689/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/motm-vs-chelsea-a.382689/</a>

Januzaj had 20 passes in that match. Had 85% pass completion which is 3 misplaced passes. He had 8 crosses which only 1 was accurate. He was dispossessed 3 times, and had 6 bad touches. He shot the ball twice.

This is where you and that site got the number 22 from.

It's totally wrong to assume that those events all ended up in Chelsea's possession. If a cross gets deflected and goes out for a corner, it not only comes off as inaccurate, but also as another lost ball. If a cross is put in a very dangerous position (which did happen in that match), but is headed out it is not only seen as a bad cross, but also as having lost the ball. This is why the cross stat is worthless. Some of those bad touches was also due to being put in an extremely tough situation with a couple of Chelsea defenders right on him, but stats won't capture that detail.

Stats are worthless without having seen the context onto which they happened under. Especially when they don't take into account what their teammates were doing in the match or what they didn't do.

I never said Januzaj had a brilliant match. Why do you think I said this, "He was our best player vs Chelsea which says how bad the others were that day because it certainly wasn't his best match"? He was sloppy a couple of times which is why I made that comment. So please tell me how I overlooked his flaws?

1379~~~
If you want to see the context, here it is. 
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qk-KNgrCUyg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Even from an edited video, one can safely assume that at the very least 15 of those 'events' ended up in Chelsea's possession. With his 85% pass rate that would mean he completed 17 passes but of course stats also capture something like the kick off pass. You say that stats don't take into account what his teammates were doing or what they didn't do. But to the rest of the team, they are having a teammate who loses the ball every second time he receives it. And for at least 15 times they are having to expend extra energy to regain the ball back, for at least 15 times you are losing the ball to a Mourinho team, specialists in the art of counterattack. You say that the cross state is worthless but yet the fact that he is attempting to make that many crosses shows the very lack of "creativity" which fans says he has heaps of. Crossing is a last resort, an art which success is based on quantity, not quality. 1.6% of crosses resulted into goals in the league in 2011. You say that his mistakes were due to being in "extremely tough situations" but that is rather a result of his decision making getting him into those situations, spending too long on the ball missing opportunities to pass the ball, and failed attempts at dribbling. You say that he was sloppy "a couple of times" but that is just another example of overlooking his flaws with an understatement like that because he certainly was sloppy more than "a couple of times."

Of course it is just one match, (and the "he's still 19), but put everything together and you can see why LVG doesn't rate him. Unless his footballing brain undergoes a big development in the near future, forget the fact that the system doesn't accommodate him, the philosophy itself has no place for players of his type.

1380~~~
In a long history of moronic posts on this board, it must be hard to get your logic defying lunacy to surface. Nevertheless, with efforts like this one that I quoted, you're well on your way.
Wow. I want to say something, but Im not sure what. ... This is absolute garbage,

Fuethermore, that match in question was when he was 18 motherfuxking years old.

1381~~~
I have seen that video before and I just watched it again. Here are the times you can say he lost the ball:


So he loses the ball about 10 times, not 22 times. I still maintain that he was United's best player that match, but as I have said before it certainly wasn't a match that he should be proud of. The others were worse and the thread on redcafe cements that fact by him unanimously being voted motm by every poster. It's not bad for an 18 year old in a side as bad as that.

His performance vs Chelsea was one of those performances where the logic "He was made to look better by how shit everyone else was" is spot on. Not the case for a lot of his other motm performances, but true for this one. It's strange to single out an 18 year old though if he was a top 3 player (the best imo) in the match for United.

Januzaj is a player that will naturally lose the ball more times than other players if everyone around him is afraid of taking responsibility. He will try and take players on or make something happen. For example, a dribbler will be dispossessed more times than someone like Valencia who will always turn back and play the safe pass. In that very same match Hazard was dispossessed 7 times and had 1 bad touch which the stats say went to United. We don't know if that's true as I can't remember his performance.

Moreover as I have said, you can't just look at statistics only and conclude which players were the best based on that. They have to be a supplement to what you watched. The cross stat is a great example of that. The key pass or chance created is another stat that can't be taken at face value. That stat only means that a teammate took a shot after a pass given as opposed to it meaning it was a great through ball that put him through in a great position to shoot.

His playing time so far doesn't mean that LVG doesn't rate him either. It could mean that, but I don't think so. I think it means that in this current formation there are better players that are keeping him out. He has to compete with Falcao, RVP, Rooney, and Mata for a spot on the team. Possibly even Di Maria if you wanted him to play in a 3 man midfield. The other United youngsters on the team so far don't have to compete against those players.

1382~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1383~~~
What do you think the philosophy is? Maybe if I know that, it will sound less stupid.

1384~~~
Actually laughing at the way people are analysing his performances. Some pretty funny reading.

1385~~~
As the English usually say: Get a life!

1386~~~
That's a good stat. Tell me, how many passes in the final third resulted in goals in 2011?

1387~~~
It's not even a form thing, I prefer what Januzaj brings to the table than what Mata does.

1388~~~
I'm convinced these aren't real people with real lives. Creepy bastards.

1389~~~
What do you mean by that ?

1390~~~
By that logic Di Maria doesn't have the mindset for the philosophy either. One obvious much bigger record example -

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2677740/Angel-Di-Maria-played-one-worst-match-winning-performances-World-Cup-history-Argentina.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/wo...performances-World-Cup-history-Argentina.html</a>

1391~~~
Some overrating of Januzaj going on here. It's understandable because at times, he was the lone bright spot last season. He faded at the end of last season too, and I do believe that Moyes tended to play him in the context of bringing an youth player in the team and him doing well. Januzaj has a great potential, but with the signings we've made, he's not better than the other players. Unfairly, the entire weight on the team fell on his young shoulder, it was a case of give the ball to Januzaj and see what happens and it totally increased the pressure on him.

1392~~~
A trendy boy haircut and potential? Mata brings goals and assists.

1393~~~
He was brilliant I thought when he came on in the friendly vs Valencia (I think?) and I'm surprised he didn't get more games. Ideally, I'd like to see him and ADM in a 4-3-3 with RvP dropped while Rooney is banned but that won't ever happen.

1394~~~
It must be said, I do like his haircut...

1395~~~
People talking about percentages of this and that, it's complete wank.

He is a young player, not getting much of a run at the moment, that's life. But so many are trying to dissect it and look for stuff that means absolutely nothing at the end of the day.

1396~~~
He's being judged incredibly harshly by some people on here. People forget that last season was Januzaj's first season outside of youth football, and he did brilliantly most of the time. Sure his decision making isn't the best yet, but it was a hell of a lot better then most players at the age of 18. The only thing that I could criticize is that he's become more selfish and shooting more often, which would be a plus point if his shooting was any good. He also seemed to change the way he played under Moyes and I'm not sure if he changed it for the better, becoming more of a sprinter with the ball and a winger rather then the having the deftness and composure on the ball that he had at first. Maybe I just remember it wrong though.

Either way, I think he'll learn a lot from this season. He won't be first choice and it was stupid to assume that he'd be a starter at the age of 19. He'd be getting a lot more games if we had european football, but he's still getting sub appearances which he needs to take advantage of. Hopefully he gets a start against West Brom, and performs, because unless he really takes his chance, he'll be behind Falcao and Rooney at least for the striker position, and then Rooney for a #10. The way I see it is he's competing with both Van Persie and Mata for that 1 other position to partner Rooney and Falcao. None of them have really shown much so far this season and with Van Persie aging and having injury problems generally, it could be his to take. 

Whatever happens, next season he'll play far more football and might even be a starter. He just needs to be patient, become a bit smarter and more mature as a player and stop trying to rush shots, but otherwise he's got a very big future ahead of him.

1397~~~
<span style="color: #ff0000">
</span>
<span style="color: #404040">Agree with this. But I also wonder how he's doing in training as he doesn't seem to be impressing LVG? I really want him to do well so I hope he gets it together soon.</span>

1398~~~
I'm sure he's doing fine, the reality is that he's competing with Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie and Mata for a spot, and even Mata is failing to get in the team when all are available. Hardly a surprise to see those players ahead of him in the pecking order and it's not like we have a reason to rotate or rest players ever.

1399~~~
Just out of curiosity, what do you think his best position is?

1400~~~
No idea really. At first when he broke through I thought he was a #10 without a doubt, but he hasn't played there too much. For the u21's he's looked good up front, but I don't think that's his best position. He has looked good on the wing obviously, but long term I think he'll have sort of a free role to drift to either side or up top rather then just be a pure winger. Has the potential and right attributes to be a false 9 type player too maybe, just needs to really improve on his finishing for that.

1401~~~
That's the only way I could see him fit in the XI when everyone is available.

I would even have him in the team for Chelsea next week because we need to target both full backs, especially Felipe Luis (no chance of it happening though, LvG won't bench RVP):

Manchester United winger a £23 million Real Madrid target


Real Madrid are preparing a £23m January bid for 19 year old Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj.

The Belgian international signed a five year deal last October, but has played a limited role in first team action under Louis van Gaal, not starting a single game. His lack of a first 11 place and the arrival of Angel di Maria are said to be two of the reasons he is considering a move.

Januzaj's desire to move is despite Louis van Gaal showing support for younger players in his squad. He has said he will encourage youngsters such as Luke Shaw and Phil Jones to play in next summer's European Under-21 Championships in the Czech Republic.

Reckon that's BS, didn't he recently just come out and say he's not moving and has no desire to move? Or his agent or whatever.

1403~~~
Yeah, his agent this week said that United wanted to keep him for life and that he wants to stay and prove himself. This is an absolute nonsense story.

1404~~~
He wants more playing time and he supposedly would go to Madrid? Ya good luck with that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1405~~~
Would not say no to that.

1406~~~
There were similar reports on my career mode in FIFA but Januzaj assured me that he had no idea where those rumors started and that he was happy where he was. Don't think the reality is anything different.

1407~~~
Yes because he will have more playing time competing with Ronaldo, Bale, Isco and Jese then competing whatever wingers we'll have next season....

1408~~~
All we need to hear, case closed.

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1409~~~
So what are the odds of him starting today? Lots of buzz about saying he's tipped to start

1410~~~
I hope he gets a start. He's been ripping it up in the U21s hasn't he? Plus the fact that he was at Carrington during the international break means he'd have had plenty of time to impress the boss

1411~~~
I thought he was away with the Belgium national team where he's being wasted on the bench? Didn't LVG say something about him not getting to play at all?

1412~~~
Oh you might be right, I just assumed he was in Manchester all along.

1413~~~
He may as well have stayed at Carrington, as being on his national team does nowt for his development.

1414~~~
Seems people are already judging him as if he is the finished article. He will make mistakes, he will give the ball away at times, occasionally he will shoot when he should have crossed to a teammate, but doing all of those things is the only way he will learn and improve. He was excellent last season given it was his debut season and the rest of the team were playing like shit. He won't get any better sitting on the bench and his potential needs to be nurtured. I'm not too worried atm because it's early days and at the rate we get injuries he could be in the starting line-up soon but I definitely think that for his sake, and ours in the long run, he needs to play more than he is at the moment. His progression this far, from the U18s to the first team has been astonishing in a relative short space of time, and it'd be a shame to see him stagnate. He's an exciting player to watch and he can definitely impact our games so I hope he is trusted a bit more in the coming weeks. Games against the likes of West Brom and Palace are ideal for him to be starting really (not trying to jinx anything).

1415~~~
Anyone else think he's going to start tonight in Valencia's position against Everton? I completely forgot about Valencia's injury and Januzaj would probably thrive in that position.

1416~~~
Don't think so. It will Fletcher or Fellaini though I'd take Januzaj over Fellaini any day of the week.

1417~~~
Doubt it as I wouldn't think he would be trusted to perform his defensive duties.

1418~~~
Herrera is back, isnt he? I can only see him start at the expense of Mata or RvP

1419~~~
Yeah has to be one of the attacking positions for Januzaj, I hope he plays tonight.

1420~~~
"It was interesting to read Adnan Januzaj's agent say over the weekend that he'd heard a rumour the Belgian could feature in tonight's game. Adnan's first-ever place in the senior 18 came at The Hawthorns in Sir Alex's last game in charge and he starred there at Reserves level a couple of years ago."

1421~~~
I want him to start ahead of Mata.

1422~~~
Why drop Mata? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1423~~~
I don't think RVP will be dropped, and I'm not happy with Mata performances for us this season. Boy needs a chance.

1424~~~
Because he's not really done all that much when he's played. He had a good game against QPR in the 4-0 win, however he's been fairly anonymous in some games, such as our last one, despite the fact that people were expecting him to seize his chance now that Rooney was suspended. I wouldn't be against us starting Januzaj, who's not gotten a lot of game time this season despite his obvious potential.

1425~~~
Mata didn't play last week and I would think LvG will want to give him a run out prior to Chelsea. RvP played in both of the Netherlands games.

Personally I'd like to see Januzaj get a run out in RvP's place but whether LvG can risk that when he's still trying to get the RvP/Falcao combination to click I don't know.

1426~~~
Think it would be harsh to drop him either way, he's a great player and we are playing a system that is going to bring the best out of him. If I'd put Januzaj in for anyone at the moment, it would be for RVP.

1427~~~
Maybe Falcao will be dropped? Didn't he play in New York a few days ago?

1428~~~
I completely disagree. His defensive game is non-existent and he has to contribute much more as a midfielder than a striker. It's not like the role at the tip of the diamond is the same as no10 in 4-2-3-1, where you get the best of him really.

1429~~~
It depends how you look at it, I agree he is more used to playing in a 4-2-3-1, however the current 4-1-2-1-2 diamond we are playing offers more defensive support behind him (3 midfielders instead of 2) and more strikers ahead of him (2 instead of 1) for him to pick out going forward. In reality we are playing a system that seems made for a player like Mata.

1430~~~
I think our system doesn't suit Mata at all.

1431~~~
Yeah, he'd be better suited to playing behind one striker, but with two up top he's got a lot more defensive responsibility and has to be relied upon to track back a bit more.

1432~~~
Both Herrera and especially Di Maria like to go forward, and it’s not like Rafael stays all time at the back either. In theory 2 strikers ahead of him should be better than one, but to be honest we are yet to see his creativity in our team. So far his stats are more about goals.

I don’t think so. The system we are playing is made for a play-maker also able to contribute defensively. While the latter is Mata’s weak point, I don’t see him as a playmaker at all. Like I said, just another striker.

IMO in this particular formation, Mata will not be a regular starter.

1433~~~
Yeah, playing him behind two strikers is overkill, considering he plays like a second-striker.

If anything, he's better off having a go in van Persie's role. Push Herrera to the tip, put Carrick deep and Blind right.
Would make better use of Mata's skills, at least.

1434~~~
Bleacher Report and the Mirror. Not even worth posting.

1435~~~
He finally starts... I hope he delivers!

1436~~~
He needs to take this chance and show LVG what he's made of. Good luck to him, hope he has a cracker of a game.

1437~~~
Im looking forward to him today.

1438~~~
I hope he plays out wide and not up top. Feel he'd be a lot more useful there

1439~~~
The boys looking buff, put on a few pounds since last season. Good to see, hopefully not so easy pushed off the ball.
Looking forward to seeing how he fairs tonight

1440~~~
Yep needs to make the most of his chance here. Goes without saying but I hope he has a great game.

1441~~~
We cant expect something of him, and if he doesnt play a good match we shouldnt be like , yeah LVG is right, he isnt good enough bla bla bla. This is his first start in first team football in months, his last start was under Moyes, he has played barely and it could be that he'll be played out of position today (striker).. The last time he started in more than 2 consecutive matches, it was back in January.

1442~~~
Absolutely, you can't really hold him to it if he doesn't perform, as there are many redeeming factors obviously.

Nice to see him start still though, and hopefully he plays a blinder. He's shown us before he has the confidence and ability to come out of nowhere and deliver.

1443~~~
I just hope that he can keep his cool and that the pressure to perform doesn't cause him to overthink things just to impress. I think he'll be OK though, he rarely looks to affected. It's a good opportunity for him tonight, can't wait to watch him play again.

1444~~~
Great to see him start, hopefully he has a great game and manages to get a spot in the first 11 for futures games too.

1445~~~
Spot on, I think if anything people will be worried that it'll be LvG who thinks he's not good enough if he's poor, I doubt it though he oozes class.

1446~~~
It's his chance to take now. Let's hope he finds his passing boots and is less selfish as before

1447~~~
Takes Falcao and Rooney to be unavailable to get a start. Doesn't augur well for Januzaj to be in the first XI.

1448~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1449~~~
No excuses or drama now, LVG is playing him form the start...so lets stop worrying about Januzaj please,

1450~~~
Come on Adnan, lets see what you are made of.

1451~~~
Looks like LVG definatly see's Januzaj as a striker, not sure what I make of that tbh.

1452~~~
I hope that he will prove a point. And take his chance for good.

1453~~~
Lets hope he takes his chance, for his own confidence if nothing else. Di Maria and Januzaj flying down the wings with Rafael and Shaw overlapping though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1454~~~
Whats wrong with Falcao?

1455~~~
Long flight back from South America. Jetlag.

1456~~~
Really hope the lad does well and has a stormer.

1457~~~
Van Gaal seems to prefer him in the striker role whenever he plays.

1458~~~
Seems to slow play down too much.

1459~~~
Said that of him last year and got criticised in the Januzaj love in.

Needs to do everything he does on the pitch at least 2 times faster.

1460~~~
He's been a bit meh so far. Was hoping he'd offer more for us.

1461~~~
100% Has the potential, but he seems to want to do everything himself. Needs to learn to word with Rafael and learn to pass the ball when he has an open man.

1462~~~
Either he's under clear instruction to keep things simple or he's completely lost his confidence to try things.

1463~~~
He's sluggish tonight,doesn't look like beating a player.

1464~~~
He must be absolutely sensational in training because this is yet another poor showing so far today. Decision making is just wrong, wrong, wrong. When we're 1-0 down to WBA and Falcao is on the bench, the need to give him time and learn these lessons is far outweighed by our need to win matches. His last moment of truly effective play in the first team was at the start of April vs Newcastle.

Sterling had a prolonged period of bad form in his development after his breakthrough but Adnan's is looking more like a Rooney style dip by the day!

There has to come a time when people on here start to realise what's in front of them not what stories and hopes they are fed. He's struggling to make the grade at this club and has been for 6 months now. It may be time for a loan spell to get him the confidence. Evans, Welbeck style.

1465~~~
Just what I was thinking, playing so far within himself it's crazy.

1466~~~
He's just not a winger

1467~~~
Seems low on confidence, isn't taking men on like he used to. Nowhere near the worst today but can do a lot better.

1468~~~
It's his first start of the season. None of the team has played well

1469~~~
Didn't take his chance so far. Wouldn't be shocked if LvG subs him off. But that said, Mata and van Persie are poor today too and they had already more opportunities than Adnan and couldn't show us much.

1470~~~
He's been poor this season when given chances to impress

1471~~~
Yep.

1472~~~
Yeah, hopefully this is the problem. Was hoping he'd be able to impress though and put in a good performance. If he doesn't improve, he might struggle to get a lot more starts.

1473~~~
Needs to play on the left wing to get the best out of him. Clearly very awkward for him to create anything on the right flank when he is predominantly left footed.

Might be the wrong type of match to play him. The baggies are really defending deep especially now that they are a goal up. No chance for us to break at them and use Adnan's pace.

1474~~~
The simple fact is, the experiment of giving him game time isn't worth the risk of not playing Falcao and putting this game to bed as quickly as we could. Then by all means chuck him on and give him time.

1475~~~
Tonight Januzaj looks a winger being shoehorned into a side of players who wanted to do things differently. He's often really far out on the touchline but that just leaves Van Persie with two on him. Not been good but its not all his fault. The system seems caught between some kind of weird 4-2-3-1 and a proper 4-3-3, in so far as we aren't actually playing outwide but both Januzaj and Di Maria are taking up really wide positions that just stretch us out.

1476~~~
He'll be fine. Just needs to find some match-sharpness and rhythm, must bear in mind this is his only first team involvement in over a month. Sitting on Belgium's bench didn't do him any favors either.

1477~~~
The side is completely unbalanced 

If you're gonna play him, play him in his proper position

1478~~~
Don't hate but I don't think he's all that. He needs to go out on loan.

1479~~~
Poor match, but still given some good passes and crosses, looks like what I said before the match were some wise words.

1480~~~
He's a good player, but ridiculously overrated by his fans in this thread which is inflating expectations of a kid who won't be able to live up to them.

1481~~~
He's been absolutely woeful tonight. Worse than Valencia.

1482~~~
Iv always even against this but after today I think it's very clear that he needs playing time as this just isn't working for him at the moment

1483~~~
you have to expect the overrating to some extent but Januzaj has had better games than this. Although i think he's much more effective in a front 3  or as a Right attacking mid.

1484~~~
He was absolute piss today. Shocking. He contributed nothing whatsoever - in fact, we were net worse as a team for his presence in it this evening.

1485~~~
Actually I think its unwarranted and grossly unfair to Januzaj's development for fans to perceive him as much better than he actually is. Some in this thread and others have compared him to the likes of Ronaldo, Zidane, et al which is utterly laughable.

1486~~~
He should have been switched to the left wing, he has a hard time trying to work it on to his left all the time.

1487~~~
He was wank. More infuriating than Nani and that's saying something.

1488~~~
Terrible, so frustrating, anyone who says he's a better talent or better right now than Sterling after that need their heads looking at.

1489~~~
Looked timid on the pitch. In truth, they were never less than two defenders on him, but he was too indecisive with his passing also. He set up Rafael nicely one, but other than that he contributed little. He is doing himself few favors with performances like this.

1490~~~
I was thinking this also. Even Valencia would of done better. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1491~~~
He was poor tonight. It may be true that he's not had a lot of football, but he's ultimately going to struggle to get a lot at the current rate. I was hoping he was a good enough prospect so that he wouldn't need to go on loan, but if he doesn't manage to get a lot of opportunities then it wouldn't be the worst option in January. There's definitely a lot of potential there, so it would be a shame if it fizzles out. Hopefully won't happen though.

1492~~~
Said it before, he's not good enough to start ahead of our other attacking options

1493~~~
So difficult to come in with very little football and perform immediately. He'll be alright.

1494~~~
Aye, absolute stinker tonight. 

It's like he's trying too hard, needs to relax and not put so much pressure on himself. Think the early hype is maybe affecting him. 

Only a kid, though,  it'll come.

1495~~~
His only good period was maybe the last 10 minutes. Thought he was poor.

1496~~~
Back to the U21s and let the men handle this

1497~~~
Nothing on Sterling. Not going to reach the heights people on here have predicted him to, which were ridiculous predictions anyway. Yet again a youth product gets overrated. He will become a good squad player and stand-in for years to come.

1498~~~
One match hardly defines talent, does it? That's a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. Sterling has been woeful plenty of times, as will both continue to be. Poor performance, but hardly a defining one at that.

1499~~~
He improved when Fellani came on and Rafael started overlapping him. But was very hit and miss tonight. More miss.

1500~~~
Needs to go on loan maybe

1501~~~
He definitely needs to go on loan. He won't get the needed playing time here with performances like that.

1502~~~
Woeful... Should have been doing a lot more with these opportunities.

1503~~~
Impact player from the bench, nothing more...

1504~~~
So spoke the Professor. Based on his previous performances, he is a great prospect. Based on this game people are going way over the top. I wonder why I post after matches... ridiculous altogether.

1505~~~
Other than some nice link up play with Rafael he was very poor tonight.

1506~~~
Yes, yes he's only young & he'll improve but given our current attacking options he's showed tonight he's nowhere near ready to play at the intensity we need. Back to U21s or on loan.

1507~~~
Very poor and very frustrating today. Kept losing the ball from his own feet way too much.

1508~~~
Awful - absolutely awful. 

Never seen a player tackle himself soo many times!!!

1509~~~
Slows the ball and the play down, then loses the ball.

Beats man, puts in a woeful cross.

These were his only two settings today. It shows that he's not ready for a start yet. Reminiscent of Nani's final United performances.

1510~~~
Previous performances early to mid season 2013/2014 maybe, with two goals and then 3 or 4 matches riding on a high afterwards... he fizzled out and has never been ignited again.

I never thought he was as good as people made him out to be on here, and his attributes are that of someone who won't reach the very top. Quote me on that.

1511~~~
Exactly, even last season he wasn't as good as people are making it. He has a great potential but that's it.
He is developing we should give him 2 season to grow and achieve his potential, right now he is not ready.

1512~~~
He was lacking in confidence today and played it too safe.

Though he wasn't as bad as some are making out for me.

1513~~~
I also for the record think he did more than Mata tonight. Can't think of much Mata did in the game

1514~~~
I probably will, as will many. It's amazing how so many players, coaches and managers hail him as a terrific prospect - one that has world class written all over him if he develops like he can, yet you think of him as a squad player. You know better than those experts, but then again...

1515~~~
All of a sudden everyone thinks he wasnt even that good last season, embarassing.

1516~~~
His worst performance in a United shirt. I thought from the first few minutes that he looked like he was playing with a point to prove and was trying too hard.

It was actually embarrassing how many times he miscontrolled the ball and let it go out of play, especially when there was no or little pressure on him. He often slowed play up and looked short of ideas aside from two passes one to Rafael and another I forget who to. I wonder was it because he was played on the right? Did this expose him as being woefully one-footed? Whatever, I feel sorry for the lad as he was terrible and he must know that himself. Let's just hope he puts this performance behind him and if he is as good as everyone hopes, then does what great players do and comes back stronger the next time he plays.

1517~~~
Mata was more involved in our game, but the position warrants that. Both of them created little though. What I expected with Januzaj and Di Maria was that we would attack them with pace, but that didn't happen at all. If they struggle with their fullbacks, why not switch sides? We create chances, don't get me wrong, but Januzaj and Mata created too few.

1518~~~
I am the herder, not the sheep.

1519~~~
People on here have the memory of a gold fish doing cocaine.

1520~~~
He was awful. He's overrated, a lot. Last year we saw people actually comparing him to Sterling. He'll be a very good player I've no doubt but I don't think he's currently half the player some seem to think he is.

1521~~~
His job is to take people on and quicken the attack. Did the opposite.

1522~~~
He was really bad, but as Van Gaal said Before the game he's basically been on a 2 week holiday so he's bound to be a bit rusty. That doesn't fully excuse such a poor performance however. He's come through at perhaps the worst possible time though hasn't he, considering the state the team is in.

1523~~~
I agree they were both bad tonight, but I think Mata should have been able to do more. Januzaj had a couple dangerous crosses but they were far and few between. Mata I don't feel did any more than passing it to the easiest target which is why I was more disappointed in his performance. He should be looking for the runs and taking the ball forward or quicken the play at least

1524~~~
You are funny - I'll give you that, and me thinks you even have the slightest bit of self irony, albeit only a little.

1525~~~
Not a good game from him

1526~~~
Well one thing, if Madrid was watching today, they won't be interested anymore.

1527~~~
People need to calm down. He's hardly played this season yet people expect him to hit form straight away. Its one poor game nothing more

1528~~~
He was like an attacking version of Carrick tonight. Just slowing down the play and keeping hold of the ball for 10 minutes at a time.

There is a reason why Van Gaal doesn't start him.

1529~~~
He looked slow out there today.

1530~~~
Sterling had a similar slump in his second (?) year aswell for a period where he was playing more for the reserves. Hopefully Januzaj will be able to recover as well as Sterling did.

1531~~~
Was too slow with everything. Crossing was bad. Really poor game.

1532~~~
New trend, if a player plays a poor match, he wasnt good that season and he isnt half the player people are making of him, will try it with Ronaldo in the clasico.

1533~~~
I pretty much agree with this. I've been waiting for Mata to prove how good he can be. This was the perfect match for him with a relatively low tempo and players making runs, but he simply took too long on the ball, which I've noticed that he can do. RVP was poor, but Mata did little to make him good, truth be told.

1534~~~
Giggs never scored a goal because  he didn't score in his last season - he was always a little bit sluggish for a winger also, much more suited to play in the centre of the pitch.

1535~~~
Looked a bit slow, not sure why.

That said, he was at least trying to create something which is a lot more than I can say for Mata.

1536~~~
Was pretty bad today. What I thought were his strongest points turned out to be his weaknesses tonight. His close control and ability to take on a man were none existent and he looked to slow down the play a lot whilst others were bombing forward. Not the worst performance in the world but certainly not what we've come to expect from our no.11. Hopefully this was just a blip and he'll be back to his old self soon enough. Thought he would have relished the chance to impress after not featuring for so long.

1537~~~
He had poor game today but he is at least young and has a lot to learn unlike Mata and RVP

1538~~~
I've noticed before how he can look a little sluggish at times - I think it depends on his match fitness. He's no Valencia in terms of pace and I doubt he ever will be, but today he was indeed slow-ish. I'm not even sure how much he was trying tbf - to me it looked as if he resigned in the second half.

1539~~~
Looked slow because he was always double teamed and he is left footed playing on the right flank. Which means the ball is always showing towards the defender making it very hard for him to beat his man.

Wrong match to use him in hindsight. There was no space for him to go on the break especially after we conceded early. Also, he is so much better playing on the left flank where he can actually put in a cross naturally. Of course, this might not be possible with Angel playing in the position, but maybe ADM can do a better job on the right wing similar to when he was at Madrid?

1540~~~
Bad game = bad player?

Youngsters are inconsistent, he will be back.

1541~~~
He looked like a player who hadn't played for a good while. Looked slow and sloppy on the ball, but linked up with Rafael well on a number of occasions. He'll get better.

1542~~~
Was far from his best tonight. Possibly understandable due to lack of football, but his chances are going to be few and far between this season, so if he wants to make an impression he'll have to learn to produce his best when he does get those chances. 

Many were saying he was getting a chance to earn his place for the Chelsea and City games coming up and he certainly didn't take it tonight. People will defend him and say it's very hard to produce your best when you're not playing consistently and I'd agree, but he's not going to have that luxury unfortunately. We're going to see very little of him between now and Christmas, I reckon.

1543~~~
The problem is whether he'll get the game time to get better though, especially since Rooney will be back and Falcao is likely to be starting.

1544~~~
8 mins vs QPR on the 14th Sept, 18 minutes vs Leicester on the 21st Sept. Surprise surprise, he played like he hadn't played football at this level for a while. Seemed to take ages to decide what he wanted to do which slowed play down a fair bit. He isn't poor, he just needs more minutes to get back to his confident best. Don't see why he is being written off.

1545~~~
I'm having de ja vue with last season where fans were calling on the likes of Zaha and Fabio to be given a chance when we were struggling. Then everyone jumped on them when the struggled. Why do people expect these young players to come in after not playing for an extended period, and suddenly be able to perform?

He was bang average, but so was the performance.

1546~~~
As someone pointed out already, Sterling had a pretty rough time before he properly kicked on again last season. It's completely normal for young players, and there's no reason to start revising Januzaj's potential on the back of this (poor) performance.

Sterling had the luxury of having to break back in to a side that didn't have anywhere near as much quality in his positions though, so the question is obviously whether Januzaj will be afforded the time to rediscover his mojo though.

We'll see, but I believe Mata will be shipped out before long, which should make Januzaj's chances of starting matches a bit better.

1547~~~
Bit crap. Doesn't look dangerous on the ball at all. Also didn't really link up that well. 

Seems to slow things down.

1548~~~
Januzaj is still a couple of years away from being ready for this level. Him, mata and Herrera were our weakest links tonight

1549~~~
He's hardly gotten any game time as of late under the manager that prioritizes "juice" so much, what did people expect?

1550~~~
Dont really agree with this statement, if there is one thing certain is that Januzaj has showed last season he was capable of this level. Teared almost every left/right back apart, everyone thought he would only do better when he is played alongside better players/better tea/better coach, things arent going his way and he isnt good enough? If he gets to play in this slow possesion based United, I agree he wont ever be good enough. The only player who would perform vs 2 defenders on a consistent basis, a team that just sits back, with an extremely low tempo in the team would be Robben.

1551~~~
Last season he showed that he was capable of brilliant sparks, nothing more. He had no consistency, he is a very young player, just be patient.

1552~~~
I dont understand why they didn't switch him to the left when young came on, he wasn't cutting in effectively enough and with both going down their opposite flank they would have been on their natural foot for crosses and the left side did look open for putting in first time crosses.

1553~~~
Yeah, meanwhile RVP is being given all kinds of leeway and time despite being consistently worse if anything whole season for club and country starting games.


It was his first senior start of the season and his first minutes in a month now ?

1554~~~
Precisely. We could have the same discussions about every single player on the pitch, except one. Remarkably, it was Fellaini who literally and figuratively stood out as our best player which is somewhat terrifying.

1555~~~
Yep. Agreed on all three. Not a good performance by Adnan tonight.

1556~~~
No consistency, when he had the run just in/before January he was our best played like every match, the only one who could create something, all our attacks, he played a part in it. The only thing he lacked last season was end product.

1557~~~
If he doesn't deserve to start, he won't. Doesn't matter if van Gaal cares about youth or not.

1558~~~
More to the point, why can't people see the obvious connection between the poor performances when picked and the managers apparent reluctance to pick them? Maybe their form in games reflects their form in training?

I <i>really</i> hope Januzaj's career doesn't follow those other two you mention but their limited opportunities for United have been 100% justified by what we've seen since they played more football at lesser clubs.

1559~~~
Not true at all. Players like him find it easier on the right side as it makes better use of their left foot and their tendency to go inside. He did that, but there wasn't an option to slide a through ball when he did that so just ended up passing it to the player behind. This happened many times.

I was more disappointed in Mata. Januzaj had a couple of good crosses, carried the ball forward at times, and had a good pass to Rafael that created a good goal scoring opportunity. Not an electrifying game by any means as he didn't try to take on players as much, and had to wait for the ball on the right wing a lot of the times. Mata on the other hand didn't affect the match at all and I've been wanting him to give great competition for Rooney. There is no way he is considered over Rooney behind the two strikers now.

Anyways, he's a player that is slow to get rid of the ball. He's always been like that unless an opportunity/space arises where a quick 1 touch pass is available. It's very noticeable in this LVG side as players get rid of it far quicker than a lot of other sides. He needs to work on that.

He also needs to work on his positioning as a winger so he doesn't find himself going lengths at a time waiting for the ball to come to him. He used to ask for it at every opportunity as a youth player, but the more he played under Moyes, the less he asked for the ball.

1560~~~
Consistent during 1 month out of 9, that's not being consistent

1561~~~
Not at all worried about him.

Hopefully starts against Chelsea as well because RVP and Mata were both a lot worse.

1562~~~
This inverted wingers malarckey is a crock of shite to be honest. It might work in Europe but not necessarily against wba when they are up a goal and have two players double teaming our left footed winger on the right flank.

Janujaz's best performances have always come on the left wing where he is able to beat a defender and put in a cross. That was the crux of our attack last season and why he rose to fame.

Today he lost the ball under minimal pressure on several occasions and I cant recall a single time when he was able to get the better of lescott or their fullback.

1563~~~
From October till January he was very good (ofcourse some bad matches in between), after that, Moyes wanted to protect him and he got less minutes.

1564~~~
He was off the pace and not very good. I am not surprised though, it was his first full senior game in a long time.

1565~~~
So much hate for Adnan nowadays, see the love affair is over with most people on here..

1566~~~
His best performances came on the left wing more so than the right wing because he simply played many more matches there. He had some really good games on the right wing. Whether you like it or not, he's not a traditional winger. He's an attacking midfielder who likes to go inside. Put him on the left and the only good thing it does is it makes it easier for him to cross. Put him on the right and it opens up his shooting, protection of the ball, and passing.

People have short memories and if Adnan isn't performing at his best he will receive a lot of harsh criticism especially when United don't get 3 points. Even in this match he wasn't as bad as people are making out and I'm sure a touch video will reflect this. His only problem was that he slowed things down, but he's always been that way. People really need to rewatch some of his performances last season to remind them how good he was. Of course they aren't all on youtube though.

1567~~~
Clearly you haven't watched Valencia for the last two years if you think that.

1568~~~

1569~~~
Same with RVP

He has been replaced by newer shinier models

1570~~~
Based on their respective performances tonight he deserves to start ahead of Mata on Sunday. He had a poor game overall but still showed some glimpses of his talent. Mata on the other hand had an absolute shocker. He literally did nothing positive.

1571~~~
This thread... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Some feckers need to stop posting for 24hrs or so after a bad game.

1572~~~
Ridiculous knee jerk reactions everywhere.

1573~~~
No way was RVP worse than Januzaj.

1574~~~
He was for most the match until the last 20 minutes or so.

1575~~~
Yup I agree. Definitely not his best performance but he hasn't played much so that was to be expected. Still only 19, we'll have to be patient. Mata and RVP were worse though, shocking performance by them.

1576~~~
He was mostly absent.  No excuses.  At this level you can't expect a free run of matches and expect to keep starting (unless you are RVP).  He looked like he lacked the confidence to be taking players on.  Was quite sad to watch actually.

1577~~~
Apparently he is actually overrated and wasn't that good last season afterall! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I feel like I'm back in the newbies reading some of these posts.

1578~~~
Just the Yin to the Yang I think.
In response to those saying he should play ahead of everyone and the team should be changed to fit him in.

The reality is, he is still a kid, developing. His games should be chosen carefully, and he needs to take his chance to impress.

1579~~~
And we still have the luxury to play RVP and Mata every game <i>to get them on form?
</i>
Why can't people see the more obvious connection that a player who hasn't started any senior competitive game for 3-4 months is gonna take times to get back to his best?
<i>
</i>

1580~~~
For me, his best games have been when hes played on the left for us. Using width and putting in crosses hes had goals /assists. Cant remember any games where hes been on the right where hes done well for us.

1581~~~
I've been calling for him to get a start but sadly he was very poor tonight, no confidence on the ball and a lack of pace off the mark when it came to him. He was level with Mata and RvP in the useless stakes.

1582~~~
I know you're one of these slightly strange characters who seems to prefer U-21/U-18 football to the real thing but if you really can't see the rationale behind a manager being more willing to let established top class players play their way into form than kids who might one day be top class, then this will be a short discussion.

1583~~~
fair enough. The problem is the not the expectations put on him,  it's the negative backlash that tends to occur once he doesn't meet said expectations. he's a young player who will have bad games, its too early for sweeping judgement.

1584~~~
Well maybe until the manager does the same with a certain Dutchman....

1585~~~
Direct rarely goes missing attempts to make things happening. It didn't happen for him tonight but Mata looked lost, he doesn't get involved he just get stats while doing little over 90 minutes not my kind of player.

1586~~~
Agree. Neither RVP or Adnan did anything to deserve a start against Chelsea.

1587~~~
I think he showed immaturity.  Tried to do too much on his own to try and break in to the first team and became kind of isolated.  I felt rafael didnt support him well either the way shaw did di maria

1588~~~
Honestly if anything he was too timid and wanted to just pass the ball off too often. Didn't try to run at the defenders or make things happen on his own as much as he usually does, and that's his strength.

1589~~~
So, as good as Sterling is he?

1590~~~
I think his head may be a bit all over the place. He's gone from being on top of the world and a guaranteed starter to being sidelined very quickly. He's also had the Belgium situation, and again, I don't think he knows completely where he stands there.

I think some overdid it with him, and it's time to just sit back and watch.

1591~~~
I don't think Januzaj is ready for the first team. Mata has proved he is class. Januzaj has not yet.

1592~~~
Would have liked to have seen him switch to the left when Young came on for Di Maria.

1593~~~
He is a young lad. Nobody should expect great performances, if he only starts once a month....Trust him and use him as regular starter or loan him out. Yes, he´ll have a couple of bad games, but if thats not acceptable, the club doesnt even need to buy young player in the first place. 
Talents dont just turn into worldbeater. They need to play.

1594~~~
This. Playing inverted wingers seemed a little redundant when we had Fellaini and Falcao in the box who are both great headers of a ball and I've always thought Adnan looked more comfortable coming from the left anyway.

1595~~~
Well just because I posted more on the youth section doesn't mean that I don't watch first team football mate...

The problem here is footballer isn't top class just because they used to be top class.If LVG really stand by his words by "giving fair opportunities" to everyone than RVP and Mata have been given far more chances but they have been disappointing in most of them so far and that's the only thing that should be counted.If we go by your logic than they must be impressed in training so we're having a real problem here with players perform better in training than the real match.I have no problem with playing them in the first place but they should be dropped now considering they're not "young player" to be allowed that luxury.

Januzaj hasn't been given the same opportunity and while he has been poor this game he has shown enough talent and promise in the last few seasons to be given other chances.I think the expectation about Januzaj has been so high that every time he didn't perform suddenly he became a new Macheda or something to our fans.The same thing has been said about every freaking youngsters we played this season apart from McNair because he hasn't "yet" to make a real mistake but it's just a sooner or later thing.Youngsters need to play and make mistakes to reach their potential.That's the same for every football club not just Man United.People rave about Pogba everyday but he has made countless of mistakes and drifted out of games too much at youth level for examples.I have no doubt if he had stayed we would have heard countless criticisms on the following seasons considering he had many flaws on his games at that times.

And that's the way you manage young player's development, not throw them into some isolated island after every poor game in which the whole team has been poor.If LVG listened to Redcafe he would have shipped off the whole team to MLS.

1596~~~
I'd still suck him off.

1597~~~
A lot of posters in here need to realize this. And the fact that he's 19 years old.

1598~~~
To be honest...he's not even close I don't think. If someone offered a straight swap I'd bite their hand off. Hopefully he does develop into a good player though because the potential is there, but yeah at the moment Sterling is miles better.

1599~~~
He's got as much potential. Do you not realize it was his first start since last season for us, and there was nobody in the team who actually played well anyways? He's just started his second season and has played less then half as many games as Sterling has at a professional level. Give him a fecking chance, he showed how brilliant he was last year and how much potential he has.

Ronaldo would have been gone half way through his first season if it was up to some of you lot ffs.

1600~~~
This, ffs.

1601~~~
Last season made expectations way too high for him.  After the two goals he scored against Sunderland, there was a buzz about him and it gave fans something to cling onto as we were going through a completely shit season.  He put in several good games for us and is eye-opening with his technique but I felt he was fading as the season wore on and was getting more playing time than his performances warranted.

I don't really think Januzaj can develop properly with last season hanging over him.  He was making headlines in a unique set of circumstances, when we were not scoring and our attack was toothless.  There were games when Januzaj was the center of attention because he was playing well but also because very few people were producing.  Everyone needs to lower their expectations quite a bit and realize that he's still 19 and will go through periods where he is poor or nondescript.

Unfortunately, we only have league matches until FA Cup starts so we are not going to see much of him.  DiMaria is in his better position on the left and Januzaj offers very little defensively so we will probably keep Young for the time being as the backup winger.  I would really hate to loan him when there are so many excellent players on the squad he can learn from but that might be the only option.

1602~~~
This message board is madness. Thanks for the rationality in a sea of utter dross in regards to people's highly critical views of a teenager making his first start for United since May.

1603~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECZ3Oerx6bs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

edit: This video is missing a couple of his touches. He did a croqueta in the match that should have ended up in a foul.

1604~~~
Jaysus, lads, the defensiveness in this thread is unreal. Anything other than gushing praise and the wagons get circled while people spew stuff about "haters". 

You all do realise it's possible to play badly without a) being a bad player or b) being any less of a prospect than he was before kick off?

Only it comes across as insanely precious to shout down anyone who dares point out he played badly in a game where he, well, played badly. Just for the record, he played badly. One of our worst three players on the night and an important factor in our lack of cutting edge.

1605~~~
He probably has got as much potential. I agree with that. 

Right now he's clearly not as good, though. That's just stating facts. Did anyone actually suggest getting rid?

1606~~~
Don't get the stick Januzaj is getting. He's barely played in the last six months, which goes some way to explaining his rustiness. I'd be inclined to get on RvP's and Mata's back before Adnan.

1607~~~
It's like the Mata thread few weeks ago before people realised that he was actually poor.

1608~~~
Don't see the comparison tbh. Completely different players with completely different records as footballers.

1609~~~
I don't see how anyone with a pair of functioning eyes could fail to see the talent Januzaj has.

Pogue is right - he was utterly shite yesterday, but that doesn't mean he's a shite player, it just means he was shite yesterday.

1610~~~
I meant in terms of when people criticised him and got labeled as haters.

1611~~~
You get some of that in every thread but Mata got a lot of (justified) criticism. Januzaj is getting less vitriol but he deserves less vitriol because he's played less football and there's hardly any doubt he'll be a great player for United long-term (which looks less and less likely for Mata). People should still be able to criticise a poor performance though.

1612~~~
I thought he was poor, he's a young player and going to have games like that. He certainly wasnt the only one

1613~~~
He hesitated on the ball and made loads of poor decisions. Kind of like a 19 year old is supposed to.

1614~~~
Doesn't help that he's barely played and is then thrown in. Last night was the first time I've seen Januzaj and thought he's looking nervous and playing without confidence.

1615~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xm0oXOR6b5Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

First time I've seen Januzaj not take responsibility.

1616~~~
Moyes gave him more a free role last season. He doesn't look comfortable sticking only to the wing. 

It's like he knew he was supposed to be helping the team do something, but just wasn't sure what that was.

1617~~~
Bad game for him apart from 1 or 2 decent passes. It's to be expected though, but it's a shame as it means he will be benched for another month now.

1618~~~
He will have bad games. He's a youngster. We should keep playing him..

1619~~~
I prefer him on the left anyways. On the right, he seems to slow down our play way too much. Yet, he wasnt our main problem yesterday

1620~~~
His best games have come from the right, not the left. He's very restricted in what he can do on the left.

1621~~~
Flashes of ability, but generally very poor last night. There were a couple of great opportunities where I was screaming at him to open his legs and run with it, but instead he would slow the game down and pass it inside. Obviously following the Tony Valencia book of right midfield.

1622~~~
Exactly right. Its nothing to get too upset about, it doesnt mean he wont develop into a great player, it doesnt mean he should be hung out to dry, sold to Sunderland, sent out on loan or made to wear a dunce's cap. But it has to be acknowledged that when he has been given chances this season he hasnt quite seized them. Regardless of whether there were mitigating circumstances it was a disappointing performance but Im sure he will improve.

1623~~~
This is true. 

I must say I found Januzaj's performance the most disappointing thing about the game personally, but that is only because of the probably unrealistic expectations I had of him before the game. No, not expectations: hopes. Not expectations because I am completely prepared to accept the mitigating circumstances that explain his poor performance, which do not apply to Mata or Van Persie, for example. But still, he was such a breath of fresh air last season and despite the fact he has barely played and is clearly rusty I thought he might (would) play a lot better than he did. 

But yes, in the cold light of day Mata's performance was much more disappointing and he has no such excuses. Van Persie was only slightly better.

1624~~~
Reminded me of Ronaldo before he became good on one of his really bad days.

1625~~~
Was so excited to see his name in the starting 11. He deserved his chance having been awesome in the youth games, but it's a shame he didn't step up to the challenge. Was expecting him to terrorise the right flank the way Di Maria does the left but it just never happened. A few glimpses of potential but it just didn't go his way last night. Should he have scored from the rebound when RvP hit the post?

1626~~~
I would like to see him play in the #10 position so he can start asking for the ball again. Whenever he plays on the wings now a days he has a tendency to just wait for the ball to just come to him and if the rb/lb has it he waits and then makes a run where most times the fullback won't pass to him. I want to see him take a more active role like he did for the youth teams.

1627~~~
He had plenty of the ball though. It wasnt like he struggled to get involved in the game, he just rarely did anything worthwhile when he received it.

1628~~~
Whilst its true he hasn't played much, he is a youngster trying to break into the team, see McNairs performances. Adnan needs to take his chances, I hope he performs better next time (I'm sure he will).
As a youngster coming in you really need to take the chances when you gets starts, all his games I have seen him this season in for the first team I have been disappointed in him tbh.

Still I think he will end up in the starting 11 by the end of the season, they guy has way too much talent.

1629~~~
Thought he was terrible, but it's only one game.

1630~~~
There's an element of "second season syndrome" here as well. Comparing him to McNair is unfair (Im a poet and I didnt know it) in that respect, he is at a different stage in his development. There is more expectation on him. Im sure McNair will struggle once the initial euphoria of his first team promotion has worn off and he is expected to come in after months out and play like an established first team player. 

The point is, having seen him last year, we all know the talent is there, we just need to be patient with him while LVG coaxes is out.

1631~~~
I like what I saw. Chose to dribble rather than cross at times like a future number 10.

1632~~~
You are basically giving Mata the pass because of what he did at Chelsea ? I judge a player by their ability and what they can bring to the team. For me it is an easy choice. Januzaj has more of what we need. Januzaj had a poor game and he still played better than Mata. This is a typical Mata performance, which is normally covered by a goal or assist.

1633~~~
You obviously haven't been watching Mata this season then, he has been poor. If he gets dropped for Adnan I wouldn't really cry about it.

1634~~~
He played badly you can't defend that, but for various reasons i'm not too fussed. He should start against Chelsea.

1635~~~
Definitely.

Sterling's been mentioned a few times as someone who Januzaj is behind right now (and he clearly is) but Sterling had a serious dose of SSS before coming on strong last season.

1636~~~
Based on what, exactly?

And in what position?

1637~~~
And Sterling has one more season in his legs.

It is weird that people can't accept that Januzaj in october isn't ready, he maybe will in May, but at the moment is not.
And i would add that his game would have been different with Rooney and Falcao, because Mata and Van Persie are dreadful at the moment.

1638~~~
As a #10 in the 4-4-2 diamond.

1639~~~
Of of the top 3 positions RVP and Mata also haven't been performing well. Only Falcao should be guaranteed a spot.

1640~~~
I'd start Januzaj as well.

1641~~~
Not sure we should be picking someone on the basis that he's been playing no worse than other players who have also been playing badly.

With Rooney out, though, there's a place up for grabs. Hererra was shite last night but I'm willing to accept it was some lingering problem with his ribs. If he trains well all week I'd be tempted to go with Carrick, Blind and Herrera in midfield with Falcao, Di Maria and A.N.Other up top. Januzaj really hasn't staked much of a claim for that last spot IMO. Even the widely despised Ashley Young looked more of a threat than he was last night.

1642~~~
Yeah i did jizz a little on the croquet, wish he started realized what type of skills suit him and his slow paced dribbling style like Iniesta does. Croqueta is just perfect for him to abuse, and not the bloody step overs.

1643~~~
Hardly played this season, give him a fecking break.

1644~~~
Mata and Van weren't the problem for Januzaj last night. He just looked rusty. His touch was poor on various occasions and he went for the wrong option a few times. It's no biggie, young and learnin' and he's not played much this season.

1645~~~
What he brings to the table as a player, he is direct, he beats players one on one ad he doesn't hide. I would play a 4-3-3. Blind needs to be protected and right now playing two strikers is pointless when we can't protect our defence. Add to that the fact that I feel we can't have passengers like RVP and Mata in the Chelsea game, that is how I would lineup. 

DDG- Rafael- Jones- Rojo- Shaw Blind-Carrick-Herrera-ADM-Januzaj-Falcao

1646~~~
They weren't the problem but it's easier to play around in-form players. With Rooney and Falcao you have more aggressive players, faster players, they are actually worrying for the defense.

1647~~~
Whether or not he has played much this season, there still has to be some common sense in some of the decisions he was taking last night. He is still young and naive in his play and hopefully yesterday was a big wake up call for him. He cant try to beat every person and take shots when there are better options on.

1648~~~
I'd actually be tempted to play something similar myself, despite his poor peformance last night.

Can see Mourinho sticking Hazard on whichever flank Januzaj plays on though. With Shaw and Rafael both below par, that could get very ugly indeed.

1649~~~
He seems to struggle to play his proper game when he isn't main man. It's like his head is in a million places.
Which is strange considering how young he is.

1650~~~
I agree with that line-up but LVG doesn't seem to be willing to drop RvP so any line-up is likely to have to accommodate Falcao, Rooney and RvP unfortunately. It's a shame that we can't see 4-3-3 with Falcao as the main man up top as I think that would be a much more balanced side...

1651~~~
That wasn't his problem yesterday. He didn't really try to dribble much and wasn't really dispossessed when dribbling. He won like 2 fouls and dribbled past like 2 players. Lost the ball twice so the actual dribbling he did wasn't a problem. He could have maybe tried to dribble more.

His problem was his passiveness after he had dwindled on the ball. He did some good passes that could have led to great scoring chances (they didn't in the end) after dwindling on the ball, but most of the time he was just passive. He needed to speed up his attacks and tried to look to combine with 1-2s after he repeatedly passed the ball back. He mostly hid after passing it back.

1652~~~
I know we love giving youth a chance here, and Adnan has the potential to be an excellent player for us, but should he start against Chelsea?
No. Not on current form.
There is more chance of an out of form Mata or RVP, or dare I say Young, putting in a decent performance against the league's top team, than a rusty 19 year old, low on confidence.
It is frustrating that some people see Adnan's development as a higher priority tha giving our team the best chance of securing a European spot.
That is why you get the other extreme from others, in response.
It is like an opinion of one extreme must be balanced out by one equally as extreme, but opposite.
Chelsea would eat him alive at the moment. He needs his appearances to be chosen carefully. Unfortunately, the way we are defending at the moment, we don't have the option to offer a cameo at 3-0 up, with 30 mins to go. So instead of forcing it, and risking destroying his confidence completely, we need to be patient, and wait until we can ease him in.

1653~~~
I think thats just wishful thinking from United fans.

Sterling is on a completely different level.

1654~~~
On current form? Januzaj looked off pace yesterday and still managed to do a lot more than Mata. On current form Januzaj starts over Mata and probably RVP as well and that's without having the luxury of having started most games this season. 

A rusty inexperienced 19 year old will remain a rusty inexperienced 19 year old if you leave him on the bench. Bollocks to all this about easing him in and what not. He's a brilliant talent and someone who's eager to impress. He's had 1 start in 9 games this season. Just play him and he'll blossom.

1655~~~
Laughable really. 

How can he be described as out of form when this is his first start? RVP and Mata have not earned a starting spot after the performances they have put in. Why would you assume that wanting Adnan to start means a fan is putting him before the club ? We are talking about what players bring to the table and how the team should line up tactically. Mata will be a non-factor against Chelsea, he struggles to get in the game against the likes of West Brom and Everton. A footballer offers certain characteristics whether they are in form or not and what Adnan brings is more preferable to Mata and Young. 

P.S if you think a bad game against Chelsea would destroy his confidence you have his character all wrong.

1656~~~
You don't need to judge the form of players by their starts only. It's usually substitute appearances that give you the best idea about fringe players who might be looking sharp and ready to displace a first XI player. Let's just say that - based on all his sub appearances this season - the poor performance last night wasn't entirely unexpected.

1657~~~
I dont think that is what's happening at all. If people see Januzaj's development as a high priority its because having him firing on all cylinders is good for the club - and probably more likely to help us get into the top 4 this season.

1658~~~
I'm warming to the idea of loaning him out. 
Would be best for him. Only two drawbacks.

January loans suck. Teams are under five times more pressure. 
And secondly, the other options of the bench here aren't any better.

1659~~~
That's really hash. More to the point was he any worse in those appearances than say Mata who's being afforded full games? He was good against Swnsea and once Wilson came on he was good against MK Dons as well. Barely got any time against Burnley and by the time he came on against Leicester we had zero control in the game.

1660~~~
I think fans read TOO much into sub appearances, each one it needs context. Much easier to judge players with their starts. Well for me anyway.

1661~~~
This is the type of fan boi shite, that I'm talking about. (Though I avoided using that term)

As I said, there is more chance of an experienced, top player performing in a game of that size. Their base level is higher.
I know that others are not playing well, but to choose someone equally under the weather, but add inexperience  and poor decision-making, and it makes no sense.
Still if you are determined to only see what you want to see, there is no point in arguing. I don't want you kicking your cat, just because someone on the internet isn't as gushing about an unproven kid, as you would like everyone to be.

1662~~~
fan-boi shite?

You are the one who said he shouldn't start against Chelsea based on current form. That sounds more fan-boi-sh towards Mata and RVP than anything I said. If we're going to continue to pick players based on what they might do despite being terrible then I'm not sure what the point is of having young players like Januzaj on the bench. Then 2 years down the line we'll have another Pogba like thread with everyone moaning about how he wasn't given a chance.

1663~~~
Well then, play Young or Fellaini based on form shown this season. They have both been better.
This thread seems to have people that only holds other's form against them, but not against Adnan's.
Like I said earlier, our priority is not Adnan Januzaj, it is making the top four.
If he is good enough, he will play his way into the team, and stay there.

As for the Pogba comparison, the opportunities given are miles apart.

1664~~~
Young hasn't been better at all.

Agree on Fellani though. For me it's a straight choice between Fellaini and Januzaj for who replaces Mata. I'd prefer Januzaj because I think he's more creative and inventive with his passing but Fellaini had a better game yesterday and probably deserves it more than Januzaj does.

1665~~~
We're making progess. lol
Do you really think Adnan has done better than Young this season?
I can't agree. 
You do remember Young being one of our best players, playing in an onfamiliar wing-back role, don't you?

1666~~~
I can't think of anything Young did going forward that was noteworthy which is what you need playing in that position. Adnan over Young (and Valencia), without a doubt.

1667~~~
Adnan is young. He hasnt got enough game time this season. due to lack of match sharpness he will be wasteful at times. Van Gaal has to be patient with him and so do we. Not every young player is a raheem sterling or pogba level. that doesnt mean adnan cant be a world class player.

1668~~~
He had a bad game, so did Mata and RvP so he wasn't alone and at least looked more committed than either of those two. I'm not saying I'd start him against Chelsea but some of the overreactions to one game from a 19 year old on his first start this season are OTT.

1669~~~
Hate all this comparison BS! Adnan didn't have the best of games yesterday, but it's hard to hit the ground running when you're are in and out of the team. Think that was his first start in the league yesterday. The problem should be the players starting week in week out and producing the same average performances. Adnan will get better with games.

1670~~~
Young's had more opportunities but clearly been better overall than Januzaj this season.

Valencia not so much, although his performance against Everton was better than anything Adnan has produced.

He's pretty much done nothing positive or noteworthy apart from that one little pass inside to Rafael. If that's the extent of what we're looking for from our wingers, Valencia would be a firm favourite on here.

1671~~~
Pogba at the same age wasn't as established as Adnan. At 19 he had just started to play for Juve and had done nothing at 18. Sterling has 2-3 more months of good performances than Adnan and thus far has proven himself as better.

Potential doesn't just take into account current performances. You take into account their overall ability and what they can offer should they reach their top form. It doesn't mean a player with higher potential will become the better player in the end. Januzaj is better than Sterling in a number of areas and Sterling is better in other areas. Januzaj is the better passer, has better vision, and technique. He also has the ability to dribble. Sterling can dribble better, has more pace, and has better shooting technique. He has also shown impressive glimpses of great vision and passing. Currently Sterling is the better player without a doubt.

I thought Januzaj was the better player whenever I saw both play at u21 level, but I think Sterling had better end product at that level and of course you could see he could get by players easier. Januzaj really impressed me the last couple of years and this little rough patch in his young career to me doesn't leave me doubting his future or potential at United.

1672~~~
I really don't see this.

1673~~~
Since they played at youth level Januzaj has always had more of that in his locker. I'm thinking you forgot some of Januzaj's passing ability since he hasn't shown it in a while. He's become much more of a dribbler in the last couple of months. It's one thing I've been disappointed with in his last several appearances for the first team.


Sterling didn't start showing that until the end of last season. I think he had a great through ball with England during the summer too. When it comes to overall technique I think Januzaj has pulled off some very flashy bits of skill that Sterling hasn't shown yet. Januzaj doesn't do it consistently enough though. Sterling is a smart player and knows his role in the team. He makes great use of his ability. I forgot to mention that Sterling is much better at making runs into space. Januzaj is rather weak in that area.

1674~~~
In Rainbows has already explained it about the vision/passing, but how can you doubt the technique, how do you think Januzaj got past his man so often? He isnt really quick, really strong, really explosive, he does it pure with technique, keeping the ball close to him, controlling it, dazzling defenders, he isnt in his best form but people seem the forget what he is all about, I'd think that he was a mediocre player if I followed your posts about him.

1675~~~
I didn't say he didn't have great technique. Just I don't think it's better than Sterling's, nor is his vision or passing.

1676~~~
I really rate Sterling, think he is the best u21 player of the world, but his technique isnt too special imo, I have seen a lot of balls jump of his feet, bad touches, but I also dont think he really needs  that much, he can still play in short spaces because of his extreme explosiveness and his pace.

1677~~~
I disagree. Sorry for having to use gifs, but that's the only way I can show you what I mean.


I've seen these types of bits of skill and technique far more often with Januzaj than Sterling. When it comes to set pieces Januzaj is better too. Their control is very similar. When it comes to shooting technique I think Sterling is better. Januzaj far too often sends his shot flying. Sterling's dribbling is what sets him apart at the moment. His combination of strength, low center of gravity, pace, and close control allow him to really go after teams. He's more mature in scoring situations, knows when to make runs, and has shown he can give through balls occasionally. He has great work rate on top of this. He's a better player than Januzaj, but he doesn't have better skill or technique.

1678~~~
You say Sterling dribbles better, shoots better and has good close control...
What is this, if not technique?

If by technique you mean flicks, then I'm sure I can find a few back heels and nutmegs from Sterling.
If you mean controlling a pass, then I think there's nothing between them.
His passing is no worse than Januzaj's, and he's even capable of those cutting through balls just the same, from what I've seen.

1679~~~
If Mata had what the team needed regardless of form i would stick with him and would question the platform the manager is giving him. In this case it is clear that Mata just isn't good enough. What he brings to the table is not what the team needs and his weaknesses are areas in which we need to be strong. Adnan for me has talents which this team is lacking. This is nothing to do with playing the young star,check my earlier posts I am not obsessed with him in that regard. He is young so i know hi time will come but right now i feel we actually need him. 

p.s this isn't directed at you but I can't stand the way people name drop Sterling now, a year ago nobody had him as this elite talent. Fans just tend to go with whichever player is in better from rather than actually jugging who is a better footballer.

1680~~~
Of course I don't mean technique is all about flicks. That's why I mentioned control (one of the gifs showed his great control), shooting technique, and set piece ability also. Sterling dribbles better not just because of technique. He's faster than Januzaj and is stronger. That goes a long way. Januzaj relies on his deceptive pace and the close control of his left foot. I think Januzaj has better footwork which the croqueta, heel flick in that position he was in showed. I also think Januzaj has the better first touch which he consistently shows when playing as a #10. There's a lot of bits of skill that Januzaj shows that Sterling hasn't shown, the volley he showed last season being another example. All of which require technique.

I really don't see how you can say Januzaj doesn't have better technique. The same goes for Suso. He has better technique than Sterling. Technique doesn't automatically make you a better player.

1681~~~
After looking it up I know was a croqueta is. I didn't know there was a name for that, its my favourite move.

1682~~~
I know it doesn't. I just don't agree with you about these two players.

1683~~~
Ability? Then its Mata. He's had a couple of bad games. He still has more ability than Januzaj. He's shown that for United.

1684~~~
He hasn't shown his ability for us and i doubt he will. When i say ability i'm talking about what the particular player brings to the team. What Adnan does and can do is more important.

1685~~~
Mata's record been more impressive for us since he joined by Jauzaj's. Not saying hes been great, just better than mr over rated. I'm not going to keep coming back to this thread and rezponding because the unfounded Januzaj love is baffling.

1686~~~
You'll be dearly missed, downtheplughole.

1687~~~
Your hatred for him influences your opinion on him. therefore you are just as ridiculous as these so called "fan boys". When criticising a player, at least perform it with a neutral perspective or attempt to.

1688~~~
You yourself counted 14 out of those 15 incidents where he lost the ball, yet you still go on to say "he lost the ball about ten times." Here are also some other clear incidents which you missed in the video as well:
1:30 Bad pass to Welbeck, goes out of bounds resulting in Chelsea's goal kick
5:30 Bad pass resulting in Chelsea regaining possession (which is edited out to make him look better)
5:44 Gifts the ball to Cech
And this is all without including even more losses of possession which the video maker decided to edit out. And then it is easy to see why they said he lost the ball a massive 22 times against Chelsea (yes "lost" as in transfer possession).


 Unfortunately, it is impossible to explain the philosophy in a single post. You could write a whole book on it. 
But (part of this philosophy) I can tell you this; The philosophy is the be all, end all. When we win trophies, when we enjoy lots of success, it will not be because we have better players, not because our star players played better, not because our transfer windows are good, not because of legendary man management skills but because our philosophy(which in a way though, affects all those other factors) is better and we live and die by it.

1689~~~
That's because context is important. I listed times where you yourself might count it as a loss of possession. For example, I listed a great cross as one of those instances even though I wouldn't count it. I also listed a time where he was given the ball (a difficult ball to deal with) where if he came up with possession of the ball he would have been praised for it.

And what instances did he edit out?

The ball didn't go out at 1:30.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2013/matches/695112/player-stats/154976/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...r-stats/154976/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

At 5:30 it wasn't that bad a pass. It was practically a 50/50, and there is no way of knowing if it resulted in Chelsea possession. It could have been kicked out for a United throw in.
At 5:44 the cross gets deflected and goes into Cech's hand rather easily. That one is a loss of possession.

It's just silly to say that he lost the ball 22 times because he didn't. None of the stats say so. The vid doesn't say so and since when does anyone count every cross or pass that doesn't end up in a player's head or feet a loss of possession where a player should be crucified? A cross is a great cross if it's put in a great area regardless of whether it finds a teammate. A pass can be put in a great area where the defender kicks it out. It counts as a misplaced pass, but it doesn't result in the other team's possession. A cross can be deflected out for a corner, but in your mind it's a loss of possession because it wasn't counted as accurate in statistics.

Di Maria is a great example. He puts in great crosses match after match and they don't always find a United player. In your mind he should be criticized for these crosses because it was a loss of possession, but that's not how football works. Nobody is going to have a 100% cross rate nor should they decide when to cross based on the absolute certainty it will find a teammate otherwise nobody would cross. Valencia is an example where the stats do tell the whole story because he constantly drills his crosses. There is no variety and no thought into his crosses.

Anyways I'm done with this silly argument. You'll never understand that a pass or cross that doesn't find a teammate doesn't automatically result in the other team's possession and you're the only one who thought he wasn't one of United's best players that match as the MOTM thread I linked clearly showed he was. A game vs Chelsea at 18 isn't going to make or break Januzaj, nor does it show that it's impossible for him to do well in a LVG team in the future.

His philosophy refers to a number of things. Playing style, the way he conducts trainings, the way he talks to players, the way he analyzes the performances of the players, coaching staff, and himself, the characters of the players, etc...

1690~~~
Not gonna watch the whole match again to find out exact times, but there are instances such as @54:30 (match time) which is yet another loss of possession, typical for video makers to edit those out.

You say the ball didn't go out at 1:30. That is just trying to be technical because it doesn't make a difference. Sure, Welbeck managed a touch before the ball went out but doesn't change the fact that it was a bad pass by Januzaj and his fault that we lost possession, not Welbeck's.
You say that there is no way of knowing if the pass at 5:30 resulted in Chelsea's possession and that it could have resulted in our throw in. Except there is a way of knowing (watch replay if you don't remember), and it did result in Chelsea's possession and it didn't end in our throw in. Once again typical of video makers to edit it to make it look not as bad, so don't assume things. Just because he loses the ball 18,19,20 times instead of 22 doesn't make it much better.

You say that a pass or cross could be deflected for a corner, not necessarily ending in another team's possession. Except that in the instances we did point out, his passes did end in another team's possession, his crosses did end in another team's possession. Furthermore you say that a cross is a great cross if put in a great area regardless of whether it finds a teammates. If only that was true, a beautiful cross but one sent in when no teammate is in the penalty box would be great? Furthermore, as I have said before crossing is an art of quantity, not quality, usually something a player does when they have no other ideas. 1.6% of crosses resulted in goals in 2011. And one significant factor of this is the very fact that most crosses don't even reach teammates. You would have realized by now that we don't play with a David Moyes philosophy, there will not be another Fulham repeat.

Di Maria is indeed a good example because for the great player he has indeed been subtlety criticized for those "unnecessary losses of possession" as LVG put it. May I ask how many of his crosses has resulted in a goal for us so far? Zero, I believe is the answer. I remember particularly in the game against Everton: the one time that Di Maria decided to not cross the ball, Falcao scored his first goal for us. Valencia is also a good example, look where the cut outside, drill in cross, one trick pony is now in the world of football.

Nice to know that you are done with this "silly argument." As I said in my very first post, he doesn't have the mindset for the philosophy. This was further evident in the West Brom game which at least brought some people to their sense. The "young lad" who likes to "take his man on" and "send some good crosses in" may excite a mid table team and fulfill their philosophy. But this is Manchester United.

1691~~~
All this shit for a 19 year old making his way at United, bloody hell.

1692~~~
Am I in RAWK? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1693~~~
I can't stand players who keep the ball for a little bit longer than they need to - often they just run into trouble or stop the attacking flow - Januzaj is one of these players. He's on a mission to make an individual impression, which is suicide. If he can concentrate on creating assists and helping the team - he'd be a big selection headache for LVG.

1694~~~
It's bewildering. I'm pretty much at a loss to read what people like World's Game have to say about Adnan. It's just brutal... A kid not even twenty years of age who has shown so much is getting shredded by keyboard wankers.

Well, I'm sure those issuing the completely over the top criticsm are qualified to do so...

1695~~~
I was questioning myself for a second too. O_o

1696~~~

1697~~~
He seems to do this more when he's not the main man.
I think he's struggling with the quick shift which has seen him go from hugely-hyped key player to squad player within months.

It's as if he feels the need to over impress, whereas he's better off playing his more natural game.
With all of the goings on at United, it's a bit of a Zaha situation again. Just not as extreme.

1698~~~
To be honest I also thought this about him during his first team appearances last season, he needs to learn that sometimes the pass is the better option. Although I do like the fact he has the confidence to take on teams by himself. He just needs to find that balance, and improve his decision making and he will be a devastating player hopefully for us in the not to distant future.

1699~~~
Yeah, he likes to slow the game down and take a extra touch instead of letting the ball go early. That's just his playing style so far.

Looks bad when he's not beating players lacking confidence and match fitness or getting double teamed.

He's better when he's allowed to roam in than asked to run the line out wide too which is a mistake LVG made for me. Should have allowed the 3 behind RVP to roam around freely but it was all too rigid.

1700~~~
Pogba turned 19 while he was at United. He had only played a couple of first team minutes (7 sub appearances). Then he went to Juve. Januzaj turned 19 last season and put in a lot of great performances as an 18 year old. If you were to compare both at 18 years old, Adnan is more established by the same age. Pogba broke out as a 19 year old who turned 20 in the 2nd half of the season 2 years ago. This season is Adnan's season as a 19 year old so how is it fair to say that Adnan can't be at Pogba's level? What I'm saying is that people should wait a bit before writing off Adnan's talent.

It's still very early in the season and his career. People need to show more patience before making a sweeping judgement.

1701~~~
so you and i are saying the same thing basically .i.e. adnan is young and needs time and patience. 

pogba didnt get an opportunity to shine as an 18yr old. But when he was given the opportunity as a 19yr old at juve he did very well. yes he turned 20 near the end of the season in march but by then he had made a sizeable impact which inlcuded winning goals in matches and a couple of wonder strikes (the one against udinese in particular was insane). 

You are right when you implied that it might be too early to start estimating if januzaj is in the same class as pogba, but januzaj needs a lot of game time, as much as last season, to keep improving as a player and he wont get that with performances like monday night. sterling now and pogba in the past have benifited from getting games, but they also kept their place in the side by not letting their performance levels drop. I didnt see pogba have a stinker for Juve to date like Adnan had on monday. 

Basically the additonal point im making (in addition to the point both of us are making) is that adnan will not get oportunities like pogba and sterling if he continues to squander away chances to start games. Players like Mata are not performing well, and apart from di maria there is no other world class winger in our squad. The time is perfect for him to take his chance, world class talents have always taken the opportunity and cemented their places as starters. Adnan is only 19, but so is Sterling. he needs to take his opportunites.

1702~~~
His style where he takes longer on the ball was probably more suited to how we played last year. Teams would sit deep against us, soak up the pressure and counter attack as they knew most of the time we would cross it and it wouldn't create a goalscoring chance. With the opposition inviting us onto them, it was hard to play with any tempo, mainly our fault, but it meant Januzaj had time on the ball and could slow it down and then beat his man which made him look very good.

Now we are attacking the opposition with pace or at least trying to so he just needs to adapt to a counter attacking system or a more intricate, fewer touches style where the ball is moved quickly. I've no doubt he will develop into a key player for us, Mata being there doesn't help him in terms of playing time, but he's young and can no doubt learn of him, this season will be tough for him, game time may be limited unless there's mass injuries or we go with 4-3-3 more but he will get used to LvG's system and develop into the player we think he can be. 

It's very rare for a player with his vision, technique and weight of pass to be able to beat a man as well, he has some of the features of Mata & Di Maria combined. Excellent passer, short and long, can put the ball through the eye of the needle and can weigh in with goals but Januzaj has the ability to stand his opponent up and beat him either side with pace or agility which is an excellent skill to have and something only Nani has provided in the last 4-5 years. He just needs to add consistency to his game and iron out his flaws which will come in time no doubt.

1703~~~
Nice to see some sanity return to this thread today.

1704~~~
Sanity is overrated !

1705~~~
Interview with Januzaj on MUTV -

1706~~~
Been hearing some rumours on the grapevine that he might be sent to Ajax for a loan spell. Can't recall where I picked it up but thoughts?

1707~~~
Too expensive for Ajax according to VDS. Apparently.

1708~~~
If we felt the need to loan him out, can't think of a much better club to loan him out to. Ajax would be perfect for him with their style of play and the level they're competing at.

1709~~~
Considering how well Ajax is doing financially, it should not be the case. But then again, we bought jack this period and lost our good players, so there's that.

1710~~~
Adnan is apparently on pretty high wages, relatively speaking - that's what VDS is hinting at, at any rate. I guess it's a matter of wage structure and whatnot - if there's anything to it at all, that is.

1711~~~
Wait and see I'd guess. But I would love to see it happen. Better for Adnan and better for Ajax.

1712~~~
Yes - it's not the worst club to send him to on loan, that's for sure.

1713~~~
I Think this could be a very good opportunity for all parties should the rumour be true. If so we could perhaps agree to pay a portion, if not all of his wages, as we are doing with Nani. I'm not really happy with the idea but in Adnans case it could be a worthy investment.

1714~~~
Might be doing well financially by Eredivisie standards (great to hear by the way, would love for Ajax to be able to compete a bit more on the European scene) but I doubt they can afford even modest EPL wages.

1715~~~
Aye - I agree. This season it'll be very difficult for Adnan to make much way here, I reckon. Normally I'd be against loaning our most promising youngster rather than giving him whatever minutes he can get - but this season is exceptional and Ajax would be perfect for him, you'd think. Give him a chance to develop his game under coaches who know their football - and get plenty of first team experience for a great club.

So, yes - if it's just about the money we should definitely offer to cough up parts of his wages. If there's an interest here surely a deal can be struck - relations between United and Ajax should be excellent at the moment.

1716~~~
Hope he starts on Sunday, dropping him after one poor game isn't going to help his confidence.

1717~~~
But carrying players who aren't performing against Chelsea could be really bad. Although it's not like many others are impressing that much anyway.

1718~~~
You could say that for Januzaj, Mata, and RVP. Honestly none of those players have earned a start vs Chelsea so none of them should feel unhappy should they be benched.

I think he should start declining Belgium call ups if there are u21 matches during the international break because he's not getting playing time there. He needs all the playing time he can get.

1719~~~
The performance against WBA was probably caused by a lack of confidence and playing time. Bringing out the best in him will be one of LVG's big challenges.

1720~~~
Not sure when we'll see him given another chance to be honest, we have tough games and I think LVG will look to tough playersclike Valencia and Fellaini instead.

A loan could work well, we'd prob have to pay half his wages but small price to pay if he comes back a useful player.

1721~~~
I don't think Januzaj is in competition with Valencia or Fellaini. I can only see them as part of the midfield 3 and Januzaj as one of the 3 attackers.

1722~~~
Probably true. He only started against WBA because we went 4-3-3. He doesn't get a look-in when the diamond is played.

1723~~~
Guess he might start tomorrow if Falcao is out then.

1724~~~
Personally I think he's too weak to play against Chelsea but we're literally capable of any formation or personnel this season.

1725~~~
Do you mean u21 club matches? If so I don't think there will ever be club reserve matches during international break as the youth age groups take international break too. Other than possible bhc friendlies of course.

1726~~~
I feel, at least in this stage of his career, he needs to be played out wide, that is where he was thriving last season and even in the game against West Brom, when he was moved out wide was when he got into the match a little bit, that is where he can do most damage right now I think.

1727~~~
He was probably our best player when we played against Chelsea (the Eto'o hat-trick match) last season. It was just astonishing to watch him single-handedly try to get something out of that match, though we were missing Rooney I think. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing him start tomorrow and on his best, he is quite something but yeah, he needs to get a run of matches before he can be at his best. It might not be the best time to start him against Chelsea and him coming on in the 70 min mark against tired legs would perhaps be optimal.

1728~~~
You want another lose the ball 22 times performance again?

1729~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> I've stated that I won't mind seeing him start tomorrow (given how RVP and Mata themselves are in a rut atm) and that he needs a run of games to get back to his best, thus clearly implying that he is not at his best. I've also stated that it might not be the best time to start him against Chelsea and a sub appearance against tired legs would be better.

1730~~~
World Game thinks that a 18 year old's performance against a big team will be the same exact performance until the day he retires. Do not doubt him, for he knows the future.

1731~~~
World Game needs to be demoted to the newbies.

1732~~~
Might be in for a start by default today? No Falcao and no Rooney. Not sure if Valencia is fit enough to play.

1733~~~
Very important for him to have some success vs Filipe Luis today. Zaha managed it last week

1734~~~
Good to see him given another chance! Hopefully he does well!

1735~~~
Needs a big game today or he could find himself out on loan in January.

1736~~~
Hasnt looked too bad today, definitely should have an assist!

1737~~~
No he doesn't actually. He just needs to contribute to our play.

1738~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1739~~~
Our most threat have come of him, his passes are very good, he seems to have loss some yards of pace, really developing into a #10.

1740~~~
Been pretty good today. 

Amongst our best players. Has played some nice through balls as well and some good crosses driven. Seems to have beating of Ivanovic as well.

1741~~~
He's done well Ivanovic is scared.

1742~~~
The difference between playing him on the left instead of the right. Problem is that Di Maria is also better on the left.

1743~~~
He looks much better on the left but so does Di Maria. I'm not sure we should sacrificing our biggest threat for that.

1744~~~
I wasn't expecting him to play tonight but fair play to him, has done well so far.

1745~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1746~~~
Get out of my head.

1747~~~
He lacks a true turn of pace to be a proper world class winger imo. He can't get past Ivanovic for love nor money. He's having a good game despite that though. 

I definalty think he'll end up as a #10.

1748~~~
Our best player. 

Could dod with quickening the play a bit but so far has justified it with how well he's used the ball.

1749~~~
Pretty much my thoughts. 

Januzaj definitely looks happier on the left, but Di Maria is better there than him.

1750~~~
Looks really lively but it seems like he's a bit too eager to become the next Giggs - has forgotten that he has a right foot. I understand that he has probably been told to work Ivanovic and he's doing it superbly so far but several times he had space to cut in and he decided against it every time.

1751~~~
Ivanovic is fast, plus an excellent full back.

1752~~~
Januzaj of last season seems to be back in this game. He looks sharp and appears to be our most threating attacking player. Hopefully, he will not get benched next game so he can build upon this form.

1753~~~
He's 19.

1754~~~
The problem is all of our front four are left footed

1755~~~
Pretty good first half. Created our best chance for RVP and some nice skill at times.

1756~~~
Some of his passing, especially his through balls, remind me of Michael Laudrup.

1757~~~
Not sure you can come to that conclusion. I myself think it's due to finally starting back to back. A run of games always help.

1758~~~
He's not going to suddenly get faster as he gets older though is he?

1759~~~
That's more like it from him.

1760~~~
His age is relevant in terms of intelligence on the ball and strength but not pace.

1761~~~
It is something you can improve with training and body conditioning actually, his body isn't fully developed either.

1762~~~
Started poorly but grew in the game. Much better than West Brom so far.

1763~~~
All he needs to do is get stronger and make better decisions ala Ronaldo.

1764~~~
Wish he was a yard or two quicker. Hope he can achieve that as it would add so much to his game. Has been pretty good and if we'll need him to to be even better second half

1765~~~
Yes. Same as every other 19 year old athlete.

1766~~~
Much better performance from the lad hope he keeps that standard second half.

1767~~~
You say that but Ronaldo got really fast around 21/22, like rapid. Ditto for Bale and countless others

1768~~~
Why does this lad still on the pitch?He has been f*cking useless against West Brom.He should be out of this club asap!

1769~~~
Fantastic first half. Our best player so far. Great to see him and Shaw on the left.

1770~~~
Some of his through balls <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I think Fellaini was crowding out the left a bit and causing Adnan to stay deeper and not giving him the space or Shaw to drive at the corner. Shaw needs to get on the overlap more as they have linked up well when they did it, especially when they went quick and direct.

1771~~~
... Excuse me?

1772~~~
Lets see him put some decent crosses in for RVP and co.

1773~~~
Hmm and i thought my internet connection was bad

1774~~~
Terrible.

1775~~~

Your eyesight?

1778~~~
No white text, has to be his eyesight.

1779~~~
Sarcastic and all that

1780~~~
Good first half, not so good second half. In the second half though, the performance of most players dropped.

1781~~~
He shut me up alright. He did much better than I'd hoped for. Wish he had a bit more pace to his game though. All that technique and so little pace was a little disappointing.

1782~~~
The players need to make runs when he's on the right wing. Either that or get closer to the right wing. He's always been fantastic with through balls from a stand still or when he's going towards the middle.

For example
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/i4qcU6AeTRiWE.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/i4qcU6AeTRiWE.gif"/>

They need to make better use of his passing.

1783~~~
Tom Lawrence <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

We seem to favour our left side I feel, need to get more support on the right side and mix it up.

1784~~~
Not an easy game for wingers, but he was much better than di Maria.

1785~~~
Way too much standing on the ball today. Had one nice run inside-other than that was too tentative for me.

1786~~~
No, his one move. 

Gets the ball, drops the shoulder, waits for opposition defenders to gang up on him, looses the ball, rinse and repeat.

Expected more from him, he's been disappointing this season, nothing like last season.

1787~~~
Thought he had a very good first half. Looked threatening, kept the ball well and was useful with it.

Faded in the second and I'd like to see him (and Di Maria) more central and not out so wide all the time.

1788~~~
Describing your own post there.

1789~~~
He was better than Mata or Di Maria today.

1790~~~
There was no movement in front of him, what should he do, dribble forward and lose the ball and then receive a counter, he didnt lose the ball often today b tw.

1791~~~
He caused one of the best defenders in the league so many problems today. Not often you see that. 

Hes so far away from being a one dimensional player.

1792~~~
Played a lot better today than at West Brom. Great to see.

1793~~~
He's been disappointing the last 2 games, although it's understandable given his lack of playing time.

He was half decent first half but second half seemed to have very few ideas and very little to offer. Perhaps swapping wings didn't help.

I'm sure he still has a bright future, but his performance was poor. The fact he was better than Di Maria says a lot. We shouldn't read too much into how these performances may affect his future.

1794~~~
I thought he was pretty good first half. Second half everyone going forward was sketchy. Can't really single him out.

1795~~~
He was pretty good first half.

2nd half he faded and then was shifted wide right for Di Maria.


Still better than Di Maria or Mata today.

1796~~~
He, Di Maria, and the fullbacks need to do that because everyone else is just waiting in the box for a cross. It's extremely frustrating watching the lack of movement. There was one moment when Di Maria went inside and slipped a pass to RVP who had a shot at goal. That's what Januzaj is trying to do, but it's difficult to pull off if players aren't making the run or near the side of the box.

I was happy that Januzaj started to recognize when to make runs which Rafael started to find him with passes. It's one thing he has lacked throughout his United career. That's one area he needs to further improve on so he can find himself in better attacking areas.

1797~~~
I thought he was poor. Lost the ball countless times and didn't look comfortable at all. Tended to rush things at some point and slowed the play down at others. Di Maria was much worse but that doesn't say much.

1798~~~
Did very well IMO. Had the beating of Ivanovic for the first half, but then was quiet for most of the second half. Some very intelligent passes and some very good dribbling past players, he'll be a star.

1799~~~
Was disappointing for me. Seemed hesitant. Wouldnt play him agaisnt City.

1800~~~
He played 2/3 excellent through balls/passes down the flank first half.

One should have led to a goal for RVP. Give him runners in front and around and he can work some excellent combinations and beat a man too.

1801~~~
Didn't initially want him to start but he was decent today. Had a couple of nice through balls, some better finishing from Robin would've given him two assists. Wouldn't start him vs City though considering how lethal they have been against us. Valencia should take his place if fit.

1802~~~
Surprise surprise, play him in his best position and he reminds us of his massive potential. Like I said in Di Maria's thread though you can't play the pair of them in the same side without one of them playing out of position and looking crap.

Also highlights the massive need for a right sided winger

1803~~~
Valencia out wide ? Or a shift back to a Diamond ?

Di Maria's best position is central of some sort.

1804~~~
Thought he did really well. He needs to develop a better understanding of when to cross/shoot, taking flatfooted crosses and shots when he's losing his balance just leads to poor efforts

1805~~~
I agree so to play both of them in their best positions would need to be something like

---------------GK---------------
RB-------CB-------CB-------LB
---------------DM---------------
-----------CM-----Di Maria-----------
RW------------CF------------Januzaj

Not sure how that works when all of Rooney, RVP and Falcao are fit though, you can probably get away keeping the latter on the bench as he's only here on loan, you can't bench the captain week in week out and we won't bench RVP either

1806~~~
Valencia isn't the answer. Valencia did well in Herrera's role as he could focus on supporting the attack and not having the burden of being a main creator on the wing. He was able to carry the ball forward without having to beat defenders. He also had defensive work rate that Herrera has. That is why he did well in that role. If you play him on the wing he's going to just drill crosses at the first defender.

1807~~~
Even though he turned in a solid performance with many positivies, that was my take as well. I felt that when the ball came to him, he kept it and kept and kept it. Sometimes for too long, missing opportunities for passes and plays. It's also predictable for defenders, if they know that when you get the ball you are going to downshift the attack and hold it and dribble.

1808~~~
I thought Di Maria did much better in the first half than the second, and he was playing on the right then.

1809~~~
Yep, the standing on the ball is an unfortunate tendency he seems to have developed this season. It's his directness and speed of thought which has always made him dangerous, he needs to get that back. The stunning through-ball for RVP today was a sign of what he can do when he just goes for it without thinking too much.

1810~~~
Im the complete opposite, I thought Di Maria's end product was much better late on once the switch had been made

1811~~~
It was definitely noticeable, and it's odd because that wasn't how he played last season. I just kept willing him to take on the full back and he never did, even though he's shown plenty of times that he's capable of beating players one on one

1812~~~
I do think delivery wise he is better from the left, but he got into more dangerous positions in the first half. The second half for me (either side) he generally struggled

1813~~~
I thought he played v well. Do agree he's been a little hesitant but it's early days in his season and we were playing Chelsea so I guess that may have made him a little cautious too. I think he had the beating of Ivanovic.

1814~~~
To be fair, it was chelsea today. They always get numbers back to frustrate attackers.

1815~~~
Much better than against West Brom, after that performance I was worried when I saw him in the starting line-up but he did well.

1816~~~
Great to see him closer to what should be his level today. Probably our main attacking outlet in the first half, and that was up against arguably the best full back in the league. Did very well to play RvP through, and to get Ivanovic to foul him in a very tight position.

Faded in the second half, especially after switching sides with Di Maria, but overall a very acceptable performance from him.

1817~~~
I thought he played some nice intricate passes at times that got us in good positions, and his skill in tight areas is evident, but he seems slower than last season and too often stops when the ball comes to him. I can certainly see why many think he'll end up as a #10.

1818~~~
I've seen nothing to suggest he's a no10, looks an obvious wide player to me. Does need to stop with the whole stop/start thing though but he's only 19 so I'm sure he'll soon realise what works and what doesn't

1819~~~
I think this stopping with the ball is caused by lack of passing options, today it was only Shaw who was willing to make runs and this isn't the strongest part of his game too. I do think that with Roo behind Falcao and Di Maria and Herrera in the middle he will do better. We played almost like a flat 4-4-2 today.

1820~~~
Agreed. Better today. That through ball to RvP showed why his long term posiition will be as a 10. Weight on the pass was immaculate.

1821~~~
I'm glad he's getting some game time.

1822~~~
Not sure if it was where legs were tiring but when he switched to the right side, he got more joy in the second half and same with the switch for Di Maria. Put in some decent crosses but does need to improve that. Like others, glad to see him getting some game time. Will only improve him.

1823~~~
I think it's quite apparent that he's a #10. He'll still be a good player out wide but his lack of pace will hold him back from hitting the world class level in that position.

1824~~~
Why is this myth still floating around?

1825~~~
I agree about Adnan's best positon but the thing is that he and ADM might get into each others way as ADM likes to move out once we have the ball. Interesting how LVG will play once all our players are fit

1826~~~
Get him on the same steroids as Bale then watch out.

1827~~~
It's not a myth.

He's by no means a slow player of course but he's not exactly very quick either. His vision and creativity is best utilized in a central role.

1828~~~
It is. Plenty of times he outsprinted players. Especially last season it was evident.

1829~~~
I think when people say he lacks pace, it's more a case of lacking acceleration. The past few times I've seen him I've never really felt as though he has the burst of pace to beat a man from a standing start. But when he's chasing down the ball over a distance he's difficult to stop.

1830~~~
His decision making is diabolical. He's young, so I'm going to blame it on that.

1831~~~
And plenty of times he beats players with a bit of skill skill but hasn't got the pace to sprint past them so it all comes to nothing anyway.

1832~~~
Januzaj has a surprising burst of pace to start, but usually defenders catch up as he isn't that fast on full sprint. He just hasn't been using it apart from Swansea. He's been playing more of a patient role, waiting for players to make a run or slip in between defenders. He can still beat defenders if he tries due to that burst of pace, skill, and balance. He can find players with his passing, they just need to start slipping in between the defenders if they decide to double team Adnan and they need to make runs.

He had a great pass to Shaw in the 11th minute that would have created a goal scoring opportunity if Ivanovic didn't barely manage to get a touch on it.

Excuse the bad quality
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/ibejeZmp2OJrCB.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/ibejeZmp2OJrCB.gif"/>

Like I have said in the past, this game was more reminiscent of his time when he first came up for the u21s (which I prefer) than when he started to really emphasize dribbling at the start of the u21 season in 2013/14. He used to beat teams with his passing, not his dribbling. Cole, Lingard, Vermijl, etc... had more of an understanding with his playstyle though. He always had dribbling in his locker, but he never tried beating players all the time. Even if you take a look at solely his u21 performances you can see there is a big difference to his playing style for the u21s this season compared to 2013. How many times did he try to beat the Spurs u21 defenders compared to his match in the u21 finals vs Spurs in 2013? It's night and day difference.

Not sure if the other regulars of United youth team football will agree with me, but that's how I have seen him.

1833~~~
Yeah, if he gets the steroids of Bale and the training regime of Ronaldo, he'll turn into a real beast. We sometimes forgot how young he is, and considering his slight physique, he's already pretty strong for his age.

Really good performance yesterday, was always trying to make things happen and force the issue. Looked composed against experienced defenders, too.

Did fear the worst when I saw him and Shaw line up on the left side, but fair play to them, that's where we held the most threat.

1834~~~
I felt he gave Ivanovic a hard game, that takes some doing on the form he is in at the moment. 

I can see him evolving into a David Silva type left wing playmaker. Has good pace, not electric like Valencia. Its his turning circle, vision, passing, dribbling and close control. 

he needs to improve his decision making and stop dawdling on the ball so much, but he's only 19. Im pleased with what i saw yesterday.

1835~~~
He also gets away with it as he's faster than your average player. As I said, he proved that last season and he's certainly quick enough for a winger

1836~~~
He has decent pace but he would certainly be on the slower end of the spectrum if he becomes a winger.

1837~~~
A good performance from Adnan, particularly his through balls. We posed the most threat down the left hand side and there was a reason for that.

Valencia is a fast runner, but with the ball, he really is not all that fast. His touch and dribbling mean that he is not particularly stable, whereas Januzaj, I reckon, would be a quicker dribbler with the ball.

1838~~~
Ronaldo was always fast but he was very smart with defenders. You never knew which way he was going and his leg movements were very very quick. At times quicker then his brain could register. If Adnan could develop that then he'll be even trickier to predict. Adnan have different qualities and hopefully we can work on him so that the full back is always ill at ease

1839~~~
Januzaj is the second fastest player with the ball at his feet for us. Valencia is not that fast if he can't run in straight line, plus he really can't do much with it at top speed.

1840~~~
One of our better players yesterday, happy with him, he is still only 19 years old and we played the best team in the league yesterday and he looked more often than not really dangerous. It was his second real game after all this season, I really hope we don't loan him out, we don't have that many great attacking player on the bench (except one of our strikers), which can make an impact, we need him and he will be fine this season.

1841~~~
Completely agree with that statement, i merely meant Valencia is fast in a pure athletic way.

1842~~~
I have to disagree with a lot of the posts on yesterday's game. He did OK, but that's it. he was knocked ff the ball a lot and tended to stop once he got it, looking a little indecisive. Maybe he had no options on occasion but when he had the chance to move the ball out from under his feet to cross, particularly in the first half, he dwelled too long on the ball and didn't deliver, going backwards. You cross when you have the mometum in a swift breakaway move, to keep the defenders on the back foot. Acouple of good through balls but that's it.

He needs a good run in the 1st team in his preferred position. He looked the better prospect than Sterling last season - Sterling has kicked on, but Adnan hasn't had the opportunity to. Hopefully he will from now on, as he easily has the potential to be better than Valencia.

1843~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R22gyhA-I2U?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Januzaj vs Chelsea.

1844~~~
Did he look better than Sterling last season? I don't really agree with that to be honest.

Anyway I though he did well to setup a few chances early on, but I do agree that he seems indecisive. He slows the play down quite a bit when he has the chance to take on the defender and get a ball in. A couple of time a quick delivery was on with RVP making good runs but he was too busy trying to size up the fullback. Still he is young and learning, thought he had a decent game and his ability to pick out a good through pass is notable.

1845~~~
Not so sure. Second half of the year when Liverpool were on their momentum wave Sterling was incredible. That's not to say Januzaj was miles off him though, just not quite as good IMO.

1846~~~
In reality he was actually miles off. Adnan was good last season but Sterling was consistently one of the best players in the league second half of the season.

1847~~~
He was poor for me yesterday (along with Di Maria and Mata) he slowed our attacks in the first half when he had opportunities to get the ball in. It's a shame as I really wanted him to take his chance cos I am a supporter of his. However watching last 2 games with my mates who question him, they were laughing. He really didnt offer much yesterday. 

Thought he may take the chance. With Rooney and Falcao back he'll be back to low amounts of minutes and cameo's to stake a claim IMO. Hopefully he takes one of these opportunities like he did at the start of 2013 season.

1848~~~
That's a bit harsh, he setup 2 out of 3 of our best chances in the first half, but he didn't offer much. I thought he had a decent game was definitely better than Di Maria and Mata. BUT he wasn't brilliant and could have been more decisive when he had the fullback one on one.

1849~~~
Yeah maybe yours is a fair assessment. He did okay but as you say didnt offer much, 6/10 tops. Which for me isn't what you want from your winger / attacking player against a top of the table side. Maybe more cos I have such high hopes for him, he just isnt quite showing it yet this season, when it was his chance to.

Just annoyed me the amount of times he slowed the play to walking pace, literally, I understand trying to beat his man via acceleration but yesterday wasn't a good example of it.

1850~~~
It'll be back to the bench for him now which is a shane as he needs the experience to end product to his game

1851~~~
I think he was great yesterday. I think he will get more chances after this performance. He will create a lot of goals and he will probably score some himself. Top top talent.

1852~~~
Sometimes he just didn't have the space to run into. So instead of trying to dribble and losing the ball, he kept possession and kept us ticking. 

He didn't offer much? He gave Van persie a chance to get a shot at goal twice. How many chances do you think Hazard made for Drogba?

It was a big match people, he is still only 19. He gave Ivanovic more of a hard time than Hazard did vs Rafael. And its generally accepted that Ivanovic is a better defender and Hazard is a better player. Think about that for a second...

1853~~~
Disagree with regards to comparison to Hazard

1854~~~
Surely he deserves a run in the side ahead of Mata at this stage?

1855~~~
Agreed. He slowed it down but that was a better alternative than losing the ball. When he did use the ball he used it very well.

Can't see how it can be described as a poor performance.

1856~~~
Agreed, he offered more of an offensive threat than Di Maria and Mata yesterday and was constantly challenging his man.
I hope he gets a good run of games and kicks on.

1857~~~
Didn't watch the West Brom game so don't have that to compare it to but, Januzaj looked like he belonged out there yesterday. He was a a threat and did quite well for the most part. Maybe he could have put in some balls quicker but, then again with Terry/Cahill in the back and at best 1 player in the box, that probably wasn't the right thing either.

I think he should continue on Sunday even if Falcao is fit. We saw the benefit of having a 2nd player outside of ADM that can take people on - especially when ADM is having an off day. When both are playing well, our strikers will have a field day.

1858~~~
That does not say much, expand please...

1859~~~
Hazard was far better, much more creative. Yes Januzaj created a good chance for RVP with one great pass (which was excellent and reminded me of a similar ball he played about this time last year) But he was very in and out of the game, often cut back, slowed down our play far too much, walked with the ball instead of attacked the full back, got one shot off that I can remember which was decent play but not enough of that, nor created opportunities or a serious threat to Chelsea any other time, IMO.

Hazard was pretty dangerous, every time Chelsea got the ball they tried to play through him. He was quick, defensively would get them out of a hole by beating a man down a wing. Made the corner the goal came from out of nothing via a quick 1-2 and should have scored himself at the end of it.

For me there was no comparison in performance yesterday between Hazard and Januzaj. Which is what I disagree with.

I'd imagine statistically that'd be proven as well, with touches, completed passes, dribbles etc. G Neville almost gave Hazard man of the match for a start which he quoted in commentary. IMO Hazard was the best player on the pitch, even though for me neither side performed particularly well / played tactically to cancel each other out.

1860~~~
If that through ball had gone through to Falcao or Rooney, everyone would be talking about his amazing pass.

It was a tight game, and he did very well all things considered. Was easily one of our better performers yesterday, and here's to hoping we get to see more of him and Di Maria on the flanks.

1861~~~
Haven't read everything above, but for me yesterday he slowed us down FAR too much while in possession. I understand running at a player but him receiving the ball and walking it towards the defenders wasn't doing much. He needs to either lay it off for Shaw or whoever is overlaping him or do something with it, needs to step up his game to stay in the team

1862~~~
He could have had 2 assists today and 1 pre assists, the reactions would be so much different. I see the not making quick decisions not as a bad thing, you have to wait on the right moment to pass or dribble unless you'll just lose the ball and they'll counter, he really knows when to pass the ball or when to dribble. Chelsea also parked the bus at times, when that happens you need to be patient, when we play against teams who are more open, I would be surprised if we will see that slow handling of him/

1863~~~
he often had to "slow us down" because there was literally noone around him, and was waiting for people to get into place.

jeez, some of you are impossible to please.

1864~~~
Are you saying he was the furthest player forward? Shaw was there overlapping him pretty much every single time.
Theres being patient and theres being indecisive or selfish. His agent was complaining about him not getting playing time and this was his chance in the team, and to me didn't do enough to make a case to be a starting player.

1865~~~
I don't know about no one around him. There were multiple times Shaw made a run behind him but he seemed to never release that pass. The ball seemed to be glued to his feet instead of moving it around and having it circulate. He did well with the ball at his feet and didn't lose it that often but sometimes you have to throw a crumb to willing runners, otherwise they'll stop making those runs. I'm sure he's still working on his chemistry with his full backs, but he needs to be less selfish when he's on the wing. 

Honestly, it reminded me of Nani, who enjoyed playing the ball too much, but when he was playing faster, was deadly. It seemed he was relying too much on his acceleration instead of his pure speed. Too much stop-start, instead of just running pass his opposition.

1866~~~
Thought he had a fairly good game. The decision making is still not there but will come over time as he's still only 19. The confidence of being selected in our biggest game of the year will also do him good.

1867~~~
I thought Adnan did well. Got involved a lot, linked up excellently with Rafael and helped in defence, looked to take on players and attack rather than just recycling possession meaninglessly.

1868~~~
If my aunt had bollocks, we'd call her uncle. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1869~~~
Sure, fair enough. But he did his part, it was a fecking brilliant pass regardless of what anyone did with it in the end. We're talking about a 19 year old kid who by all accounts had a really good game against the best team in the league, primarily lining up against one of the top right backs to boot.

Some sense of perspective is perhaps needed here.

1870~~~
It's amazing how little some of our fans understand football. Some round me were screaming for him to "go on", when it was him v about 3 defenders and he's 30yards from goal.

If you constantly just "go on", more often than not you'll run down a blind alley and lose it.

1871~~~
I thought he had a very average game at best. Ivanovic had him in his pocket all night and it was clear that Januzaj would not beat Ivanovic consistently in the match after just 10-20 minutes.

Wasn't helped by Shaw playing so defensively and passively and almost never making overlapping runs, or inside runs to try and cause some troubles to the Chelsea defense.

LVG used his typical LVG-Winger which means they stay very far out wide to primarily stretch the defense when they don't have the ball. They're not allowed to roam freely and make off the ball runs which could penetrate the defenses.

They're pretty much just expected to receive the ball, then challenge their full back in 1 vs 1's and Januzaj(nor ADM) isn't good enough of a dribbler to do that role.

It is a role where Ribery failed even and he was at the time one of the very best dribbling wingers in the world. So there is a lot of requirements put on your 1 vs 1 ability, a lot more than if you have the role of a regular winger.

You almost always start from standing still too, which makes it incredibly difficult to beat a top class full back.

1872~~~
Exactly. Look back a few pages and you'll see that they were getting on him for needlessly being selfish with the ball and driving at opponents that didn't end up well.

So the fact that he's been ragged on for both slowing down the play too much AND for going after defenders and not getting enough of an end result, tells me he's probably doing exactly what he needs to be doing.

1873~~~
Nonsense Exhibit A. Januzaj made him look like a fool, and very nearly got a penalty in the first half as a result.

1874~~~
Januzaj was fine, Ivanovic certainly did not have him in his pocket.

1875~~~
He does certainly need to learn when to attack at pace, and when to stop the defender still. Far too often he get's the ball and goes at walking pace. 

At times yes that can work well, it can also buy time to look for a pass - but at other times you need that forward momentum to really scare defenders.

1876~~~
I absolutely agree.  He lacks the verve and fluency he showed last year.  He is trying to make openings versus take them.  Surely it's just a phase---I remember Ronaldo going through this.

1877~~~
I am not sure I agree with that. Ivanovic was lucky not to give a penalty away on Januzaj in the first half and I felt his general link up with Shaw was rather good.

I also don't agree that Di Maria and Januzaj are not good enough to beat players 1 on 1! That is just nonsense.

1878~~~
For what its worth I'm on the side of those who feel he 1) slowed us down when we were attacking at pace, and 2) was selfish.  

I thought he killed our attacking momentum several times when he got the ball on a break.  Instead of one-touch passing to continue the movement he would pause and take way too many touches while trying to psych out his defender.  In the meantime, Chelsea's entire defense would adjust.  

I put Januzaj's start in the list of questionable tactics by LvG yesterday, as he seems better suited to when we are trying to break down a defense with incisive dribbling and skill.  Yesterday we needed pace and physicality instead.

1879~~~
I was kidding, Januzaj has been very good, and even more when you think that he played against Ivanovic who is an excellent player. I like him when he plays on the left wing.

1880~~~
That wasn't what I said though. As a winger for LVG you are pretty much exclusively supposed to beat your full back from nearly stand still.

Di Maria is good enough to do that, which he showed yesterday, but he isn't good enough to be at his best in that role. The same goes for Ribery who could do the role, but you lost 50% of who Ribery was so he wasn't the worlds best winger in that role like he was in a freer role.

Wingers like Robben/Nani/Hazard are suited for that type of role, the 1 vs 1 wingers.

1881~~~
Agreed, on another day he comes away from the game with an assist and a penalty won, for only his second start and in a game against the best team in the league up against a top RB, I don't see too much to criticize.

1882~~~
hes much better when he plays on the left. Most of his good games for us have had him starting out there where he can use width and not always cutting in like he does on the right.

1883~~~
Anytime he gets the ball, he was against 2 to 3 chelsea players. Iva, Fab, Willian and Matic. 3 out of those four will be there every time. He played well.

1884~~~
He was frustrating to watch,  yes they smothered him .............. but he did , dither , where last season he flowed.

1885~~~
i changed my mind.

he was borderline "ok" at the most. a 19 year old in his second start of the season against a shit team like chelsea should have at least scored or set up three goals.

i have no idea what LVG has been thinking, leaving him out there for the full 90 minutes the past two games. if your adnan's age and you can't show better results, it's off to Wigan for you.

1886~~~
His first good game of the season. I hope he can build on that one and become better. The kid needs some games under him. When Rooney returns, I'd rather see him start than Mata.

1887~~~
Had a good game vs Swansea, bit selfish.

1888~~~
Thing is though, that Januzaj is supposed to provide the team with more pace and direct play than Mata. This season, he has shown little of his pace (we know he's fast) and he dallies far too much on the ball. Take away those two things and I think Mata is superior in all other aspects of the game. Januzaj must dare to be more direct and run at defenders more. That said, he had a decent game, no doubt, but far from brilliant. 

Comparing him to Hazard is silly at this point - they are different players with different strengths, and at this stage, Hazard is a couple of levels above.

1889~~~
I didn't think he was good yesterday. Makes the wrong decision with the ball way too often. Hopefully he'll sort that out sooner rather than later, as he has the ability, but can't agree with those who thought he played well.

1890~~~
He has created twice as much clear chances in two matches compared to Mata the whole season.

1891~~~
Mata created a pretty good chance for Di Maria yesterday, Januzaj created a pretty good one for Van Persie. Honours even there. Don't think Mata has shone this season yet, but neither has Januzaj.

1892~~~
I meant on a general basis. Mata has better technique, better passing and close control. Januzaj has the potential, but just because Mata has played below expectations doesn't mean that he is suddenly shite. He has disappointed me though.

1893~~~
Januzaj created two for RVP and has chipped in at least two good crosses vs west brom.

1894~~~
He has been below average since his arrival, the only thing he has done well is scoring goals, havent seen him give split through passes or even pass a defender. We rate Mata because of what he has shown in the past, but since he is a red, he has been bang average.

1895~~~
Januzaj played really good I thought, always tried to beat his man, never tried to go into a shell like young and valencia, the kid has determination and nerves, that one pass to rvp, that split chelsea defence taking out like 4 players, was an amazing pass, I couldn't believe that was him

1896~~~
Only thing I thought Januzaj needed to do yesterday was speed up his dribbling at times when there was empty space in front of him like Di Maria does. For example, Di Maria went full speed and ended up turning back and passing it to Mata after he realized there was no where for him to go as opposed to Januzaj going at a slower pace than he's capable of. No problem with him spending a lot of time on the ball while out on the wing and passing it back as that was the right option a lot of times because of no support or Chelsea keeping great shape. 

It's important to note that Felipe Luis gave Januzaj much less space than Ivanovic did. Fellaini ended up giving Januzaj and Shaw support at the edge of the penalty box a couple of times (and failing to complete some attacking moves after receiving a pass) which Januzaj and Rafael didn't have on the right wing. Think both of those factors made Januzaj more effective on the left wing than the right apart from the team's overall lack of energy for large parts of the 2nd half.

1897~~~
I Just can't find it in me to be bothered to join in the discussion regarding Januzaj and his form/performances. Kid is clearly class and I'm not worried in the slightest about him. I'm just going to take the good with the bad and enjoy watching him blossom into a top class player.

Don't get how anyone can be arsed to discuss the form or decision making of a teenager that is as good as him. Just relax and enjoy the ride!

1898~~~
Too bad we don't have any league cup games. Adnan could play more games and get chances in the No. 10 position.

1899~~~
I thouvht he played well.  In a game against a very tactically astute team he managed to disrupt the solid foundations of chelseas defense and midfield.  

The red card was definitely influenced by ivanovic tired time on the left.  I felt januzaj struggled more on the right where luis had the speed to deal with his dribbling.

1900~~~
<b>Adnan Januzaj insists it was an honour to inherit the iconic no.11 shirt from Ryan Giggs, who he describes as his “godfather” at Manchester United.</b>

Giggs hung up his boots in May and almost immediately stated his wish for somebody else to accept his famous jersey. That person was Januzaj, who was proud to accept the honour when approached in the summer and did not require a moment’s consideration.

Although Januzaj only played with Giggs for a single season, the fledgling Belgian believes 12 months was ample time to tap into the Welshman’s knowledge and expertise.

1903~~~
Hazard is arguably one of the top five players in the world right now, it's insane how easily he carves teams up. But let's not forget, he's 23 and Adnandos is 19 and early on Hazard was labelled a bust during his first year at Chelsea. All I'm saying is, Januzaj needs playing time in the BPL to develop. I think that's when the positives of his game will return and he will suit our style more. Mata is a great player, but it seems like we need direct players with pace and good dribbling ability.

1904~~~
I wouldn't go that far at this stage. I'd certainly have him in the top 15 and maybe even top ten, but he has a bit to go before he is at the level of the likes of Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Robben, Suarez, Bale, Di Maria, etc.

1905~~~
I take it you missed the World Cup ?

1906~~~
far out man, only this guy is stupid enough to casually decide to switch flanks with Di Maria when Chelsea has possession in OUR half. Luke Shaw was like wtf when Chelsea played the ball to that huge hole left behind.

1907~~~
Do you even like United or are you just some mincing fecking troll?

1908~~~
I'll never understand why RedCafe insanely overrates Hazard, or any other Chelsea player for that matter.

1909~~~
Well firstly maybe you could address the points critics have made with your own (if you have any) instead of resorting to hurling insults and attacks at the poster.

1910~~~
Because when we beat them, it is sweeet.

1911~~~
I don't see how you can be sure, did 20 year old David Silva look world class as merely one example of many? There's a difference between a player becoming world class and a player developing to a Ronaldo or Messi level, that's beyond world class.

1912~~~
I'm well aware of that. I doubt either will be at the world class level. They will be good players, but I've seen nothing in either of them that suggests they will be anything more than good, long term professionals.

1913~~~
Januzaj rise to prominence has much to do with himself as it had to do with moyes.   Depay has taken the route that normal youngsters take and is reaching the stage where he has achieved all that he can achieve at psv.  Januzaj has not reached that level at united understandably. 

However  i would like it next season if we kept mata,  rvp rooney and falcao who we are still yet to buy but this will be impossible if we buy a player higher than depays calibre.

1914~~~
Huh? Januzaj was amazing last year at the age of 18. Now, if you except Messi level of talent, then that won't happen very often.

1915~~~
He was amazing at times last year but that's no guarantee that he will be amazing this year, infact he seems to have regressed a bit since some of last year's performances. He will be a good player but definitely not world class imo. And when I'm talking about world class, I don't mean Ronaldo or Messi level, i mean the level below them where the likes of Di Maria, Robben et al dwell.

1916~~~
Agreed. Reading some of the criticisms of him, it's just incredibly harsh. It's like people forget what the normal  progression of youngsters is, how they go through inconsistent spells and some poor form but ultimately they shine through it and develop into better players. He's clearly a special talent, and it shows how far he's come that people expect him to constantly perform as one of our best players despite only being 19.

1917~~~
If you are well aware of it then I don't see how you can make the statement in truth. You mention Di Maria a couple of posts later, he was a player at 24 never mind 20 that most saw in the same light as Nani, not a world class player.

1918~~~
That doesn't really matter. Some players develop later than others. That has nothing to do with making audacious predictions that 18 year olds will be world class based on a dozen or so appearances where they have impressed in about half of them.

1919~~~
I'm not predicting they will be world class or otherwise, that is my point, your statement was definitive that neither would be world class, all I am saying is that there are dozens of players that are examples of how that is as invalid a claim as anyone saying either will be world class.

1920~~~
Talk of a loan move to Ajax in January

1921~~~
You never know but in my opinion, that's just people putting two and two together because of van Gaal.

I think he will stay.

1922~~~
So what happened to him losing the ball 22 times?

1923~~~
You know ... if I was manager I would've played him in the number ten role once. Behind the striker. I feel like he would split teams open there.

1924~~~
it's okay he only lost it 11 times.

1925~~~
His vision is excellent for someone so young. Still wows me at times despite having watched him do it through the age groups. 

Chelsea was definitely an improved performance. He made better decisions and didn't take as long to decide what he wanted to do. 

Still have to remember he hasn't played much football since last season so I'm sure he will continue to improve with more minutes.

1926~~~
ESPN say that Januzaj might be off for a loan spell to Ajax.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/2115390/transfer-talk-takes-a-look-at-all-the-latest-newsgossip-and-whispers-from-across-europe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/blog/transfer...st-newsgossip-and-whispers-from-across-europe</a>

1927~~~
Said it before, but I would really like that idea. Eredivisie is no Premier League, but he can easily fight himself into the first squad considering how dissapointing Kisnha has been playing on the left wing. El Ghazi on the right wing is a bit harder to trump, but I'd think he could win that place too. With any luck, he can get some European games and cup games next to the regular eredivise games & fight his way into the united squad next year.

1928~~~
But we need Januzaj?

1929~~~
I don't really want to see him go out on loan. We're already thin on the flanks, which is probably why we've seen Di Maria out there when we've played the 4-2-3-1/4-1-4-1/whatever in the last couple of games.

Shifting Januzaj out in January would significantly limit our tactical options. Also, there was a marked improvement on Sunday compared to the West Brom game, no reason he couldn't push on from here and make a case for himself to be cemented in the first XI.

1930~~~
Why would he go on loan? That would be so stupid. It's not like we're blessed with brilliant options on the flank.

1931~~~
If he would get more first team playing time I'd rather have him stay obviously. But if he would not fit in LvG's plans (for better or for worse) it would be a shame if he was keeping the bench warm instead of getting more matches under his belt innit?

1932~~~
The idea of loaning him is beyond ridiculous especially as it comes on the back of him playing the full 90 in our 2 previous games. If we loan him we'll be left with bringing on Young and Valencia from the bench when we need a goal.

1933~~~
He literally just started two games in a row including our biggest fixture of the season. This rumour couldn't actually have come at a more silly time.

1934~~~
According to the Daily Star.

1935~~~
True. Maybe I'm just biased because I'd love to see him at Ajax.

1936~~~
Van De Sar made some comment about how they would love to have him at Ajax, probably this is where this rumour has started, I doubt he is going on loan tbh

1937~~~
Thinking about it, Adnan's performance is one of the main reasons I'm feeling so bullish since Sunday. His lack of games and relatively poor form when picked was becoming a real downer on the season, seeing as he was the one and only cause for optimism in the season just gone. If he can kick on from here it takes a lot of the creative burden off Di Maria and sorts out my own anxiety that we were a bit of a one man team. Really looking forward to seeing him get a run of games from here.

1938~~~
I'd love to see him stay in the team too, but it's difficult to imagine he will when all our strikers are fit/unbanned and Herrera is fully fit too. Also there's the fact that having him in the team basically means we're playing 4-3-3 which pushes Di Maria wide where he's clearly not as good.

Christ, when's the last time we've had problems like this when it comes to picking our team? Usually it was about actually finding 11 players in the squad good enough, now it's about the disappointment of leaving out players you don't want to. Times are changin'...

1939~~~
Chelsea defended very well against both of our wingers. There was always a man in front, and a man just inside to prevent cutting in. Di Maria was also well shackled, and was les of an over all threat than Januzaj I feel.

He did well against Chelsea. You're unlikely to flourish and rip the opposition to pieces in a game like that. Scoring aside, he did as well as any other attacking player on the pitch, perhaps except Hazard.

1940~~~
Yeah, was thinking that this morning. You could make a really plausible argument for leaving two CMs the quality of Carrick and Hererra on the bench for our biggest game of the season. And that's ignoring former central midfield regulars like Fletcher, Anderson and Cleverley.

This is still Manchester United we're talking about, right?

1941~~~
Surprising. Januzaj is a sure thing to hit the top of the game, in my opinion. An incredibly dimensional footballer that has demonstrated things on a pitch, for such a big club, that few, if any, players of his age can claim to have done. As sure a thing you'll ever see.

1942~~~
He has demonstrated an aptitude to be very good in the future, but he still has to actually do the difficult part, which is fullfull his talent. There is no guarantee that he will, in fact I would say the odds are better that he will develop into a competent starting XI player than a world class star. He has quite a distance to go before I will would be prepared to associate world class with his name.

1943~~~
I agree that there is a long way to go but I think he has a very special talent. He's a very unique footballer and I don't see anything like him anywhere. Naturally, the odds are greater that he does not become a world beater, but again, few of the elite in the game today had done what he has done at a club like Manchester United in their teens. Suarez, Sanchez, Di Maria, Robben and more. All talented no doubt, but hitting the headlines at one of the biggest clubs in the world? It's no small feat. He just needs regular games, which is a more pressing issue for me.

1944~~~
The idea that Robben, Di Maria, et al weren't at big clubs at Adnan's age has nothing to do with Januzaj or his future prospects. He is no more than a talented young player with a solid upside potential at this point. In fact its quite unfair to him to have certain fans claiming he has world class potential, as it only raises expectations that he may never actually meet, at which point everyone will be scratching their heads as to why he has underachieved. Let him develop at his own pace and discussions of him being world class will evolve organically through his performances.

1945~~~
I think it's an acceptable parameter to judge his potential. I'm not saying it's a stone cold certainty that he will go on to dominate the game, but what he is doing, in such a pressure cooker environment, is an relative indication into the kind of player he could be, as well as his strength of mentality. He was putting in great performances in a disjointed team that was shot of confidence and all star power. It's very impressive and seemingly unmatched amongst his peers. 

I have high expectations of him, but what a nobody like me is saying on the internet is going to affect him. If he doesn't emerge as one of the best attackers across Europe then I think sometching will have went wrong, because he can do very special things with the ball. I honestly don't think people appreciate just how unique his play style is.

1946~~~
Sending him to Ajax would mean more starts for Ashley Young and Valencia.  That what you guys really want ?

1947~~~
Young's career is over in this club.

1948~~~
Let him actually prove it on the pitch year in and out and the high expectations will have been warranted. Of course, if he doesn't meet those expectations everyone, in true muppet football fan fashion, will be lamenting what a disappointment he is. That's why we shouldn't inflate him at all.

1949~~~
He performed very well in preseason - I wouldn't be so sure 

LVG has helped Fellaini recapture some form - I still think Young could be a really useful squad player

1950~~~
No problem but he should not stand in a way of bringing more quality at least on Di Maria's level.

Time for another decent squad players in Manchester United is over. Only football elite now.

1951~~~
Valencia is a useful player. Januzaj doesn't need to go on loan though. If he must go then so be it. Better this season than next.

1952~~~
Really strange to be talking about loaning a player who's appeared in the majority of our games this season. Never really heard of a team doing that.

1953~~~
Ya I'm thinking the same. He is important enough to start a game against Chelsea so why loan him out?

1954~~~
Because Young performed tolerably in preseason, does not erase his previous crap two years for us. he's finished here.

1955~~~
he's not getting loaned out. this is a non-sense article, he's now getting good game time in important matches and on top of that the only way he sits is if everyone is healthy. ... how often does that happen, and for how long does that remain the case?

1956~~~
If Rooney and Falcao had been fit/allowed to play there's a strong possibility that he wouldn't have started against either of Chelsea or West brom and I think that situations as these will be few and far between.

1957~~~
A bit off-topic and and I do love the latter, but with each passing week the chances of him being a United player come the start of next season seem to be diminishing IMO. Van Gaal has a natural affinity for Van Persie, Falcao has had a few nagging medical concerns and the issue of him reaching the dizzying heights of Porto/ Atletico is yet to be resolved (then again maybe this is a bit short-sighted given his relative lack of playing time) so I'd be surprised (pleasantly mind) if we stump up the size-able transfer fee/ wages going forward. Wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility if Januzaj becomes a more prominent player than the Colombian this season who is more akin to a hired gun until any long term deal is permed. Particularly if Van Gaal settles on the 4-5-1 going forward.

1958~~~
Probably the closest thing to a young Denis Bergkamp I've ever seen. For me his future lies as a 10.

1959~~~
Am I the only one who's annoyed at how long he keeps the ball around the box when there is clearly players to cross the ball into. It also gives time for the other teams defence to get organized, he was incredibly frustrating against Chelsea when he didn't release the ball fast enough and pretty much stagnated our attacks. I think with games he can easily get better decision making, but he will probably be dropped for Rooney on Sunday.

1960~~~
It's something he wasn't doing last season (or ever in the youth sides) but has started to do for some reason in the last couple of games. Partly it'll just be because Chelsea run a very very tight defence, especially when they're backed into their box. Also because RVP's movement was pretty indifferent in that game so there wasn't normally much on for the lad. He showed what he can do when teammates do make runs and give him options with that sublime through-ball.

1961~~~
Maybe true, but you still can't leave yourself with such a lack of tactical flexibility given who is available.  

Maybe if Nani was around...

1962~~~
Actually think LVG seems happy with 4-3-3 and balance we've had last 2 games given his comments post match.

Won't be so sure he will switch back to a Diamond with basically 3 strikers again.

1963~~~
If we're sticking with a 4-3-3 then loaning him would be pointless because we'd be quite thin for options out wide. If Falcao and Rooney being fit changes things though I don't know.

1964~~~
Other world class players have performed poorly at previous World Cups, namely Messi. That doesn't take anything away from what Hazard has done so far this season in the BPL and other competitions.

1965~~~
That's why I said arguably, but top 10 or top 15 isn't unrealistic.

1966~~~
It's not arguable that he is in the top 5 though. That's the point. Maybe top 10 or 15 but no way top 5.

1967~~~
The world cup is quite important though, and he had a complete stinker. He's quite comfortably not in the 10 best footballers in the world at the moment.

1968~~~
Who is clearly ahead of him? Messi, Ronaldo, maybe Neymar, maybe Robben, maybe Neuer, but it's not as obvious as you make it to be.

1969~~~
So by your logic, Messi wasn't a top 3 player in 2010 because of his poor World Cup?

1970~~~
Lahm ? Xabi Alonso ? Thiago Silva ? Modric ? Kroos ?  Bale ? Suarez ?

1971~~~
Xavi, Iniesta, Sneijder, there you go

1972~~~
Hope we never play / start him on the right again. Think hes scored / assisted / had his best games coming from the left where he can use width and doesnt have to cut back (ive mentioned this quite a few times I think, lol)

Would be nice to have him left, Di Maria middle and somebody on the right (somebody like Robben / Ronaldo (well Valencia right now or maybe Rafael at times) behind Rooney / RVP / Falcao. Then Blind / Herrera / Fellaini / Carrick as two anchors in midfield. Think its an option when Januzaj plays (and if we can get a proper right sided player who can beat a man with pace and cross the ball).

1973~~~
I would exempt Messi or Ronaldo from this as their form has been consistently untouchable for the better part of the past 6/7 years. When Hazard is at their level, he could probably have a bad world cup and not have it count against him.

1974~~~
He's mostly played on the left so of course he will have most of his good games there, but I still think he's better on the right. I've felt that way since he played for the youth teams.  Against Hull (home) and Newcastle (home) he played on the right and those were two of his finest games. The truth is that he can play on both flanks.

Cutting back allows him to utilize his vision which he has plenty of so there is no problem there. If players give him time on the ball while he's out on the left wing he can give through balls too (see spoilered exampled which include Chelsea match), but that won't always be the case.
If he starts from the left wing and moves towards the middle of the pitch, it will be harder for him to slide though balls in with the outside of his left foot. Di Maria is very good at doing this, but Januzaj currently can't do it as well as he can. Cutting in from the right allows him to give through balls with his left foot which he does whenever there is a player willing to make a run. It also sets up his left foot to shoot. He can even give through balls from the right wing while standing still which he showed vs Spurs last season and also plenty of times for the youth teams.


This is why I think eventually he will end up as a #10 as he can utilize both sides of the pitch to do both passes I have highlighted. However, right now each wing gets a different kind of Januzaj, but I prefer the right side. I also think he dribbles better on the right touchline than the left touchline too. For example, how often do you see Januzaj doing this on the left? 


 Some prefer the left wing where he can cross more naturally, which is understandable.

I think he should play on both sides depending on which type of Januzaj you want to utilize.

I don't think it's fair to count the WC against Hazard. Wilmots has failed to get the best out of his attacking players for a while. Belgium's attacking play reminds me of United last season where there was no fluidity, making it harder for every attacker to influence the match at their normal club level.

1975~~~
What I do think though is that at this time there won't be a lot of room for Januzaj to develop as a proper #10 considering Rooney/Mata takes up that position and we don't really have a lot of room to try it out with the pressure to get points. I do agree with you <a class="username" data-user="87635, @In Rainbows" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87635/">@In Rainbows</a>, if he gets practice and proper guidance, he might become quite the #10.

1976~~~
I understand that everyone overrates the players of their league a bit because you see them every week, often in highlight shows.
But in no way is Hazard in the Top 5 in the world. Messi,Ronaldo,Robben(a level above him),Neuer,Kroos,Modric(what a monster),Lahm,Boateng, Di Maria, a fit Schweinsteiger etc.
He isnt in the top 10. He is a bit older then Neymar and Götze and could be a bit ahead of them. But thats it.

1977~~~
Kroos/Boateng above Hazard? Doubt it very much.

1978~~~
Why? Because the one is a world class defender and the other leads Real in games?
They have won things and lead their teams through the biggest games. Watch the WC final again. Boateng was the best player.
Hazard is a great player but he needs a longer run to come close to guys who are older and showed and won more then him that way.

1979~~~
Boateng is also showing great form recently, but I remember the time where he and Dante looked shaky and his partnership with Hummels hasnt been on point always. Kroos is a hell of a player but I dont think he has reached his Bayern level yet, where he was Scholes'esque (it will come in time I think), but people tend to rate on the world cup too much, it's just a moment, where a lot of factors play in. Do you reckon Hazard would be as poor as he was if he played in Germany's side? I dont know if anyone watches Belgium, but their play is dogshite, it was slow, not the typical Hazard play, he didnt fit. Hazard was top3 in the PL this season, imo him/Silva are by far the most dangerous players in the PL, he just ripped our defence out time, he on his own, as he has been doing since his Chelsea arrival. (Along with Mata for a period), I think the lad is underrated, apart from his productivity at times, I cant see something in which he lacks.

1980~~~
He doesnt lack anything but Boateng,Kroos and others are world class for years and he didnt show he me anything that convinces me that he is on their level or even better.
Specially Boateng is underrated for years; you can make the argument that he was the best CB in 2013.
But I digress. Everyone his opinion but Hazard isnt there for me.

1981~~~
surely all this talk that has nothing to do with adnan, doesn't belong here?

1982~~~

<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pitchside Europe</a>
<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/adnan-januzaj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adnan Januzaj</a> has warranted a place in<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/louis-van-gaal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis Van Gaal</a>'s new-look <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/manchester-united/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a>.

The 19-year-old has started the last two games for the Red Devils, and may have put in his case to start the Manchester Derby on Sunday when United travel to the Etihad to face Champions,<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/manchester-city/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester City</a>.

The midfielder has played in seven of Man United's nine games this season, but his only full 90 minutes came against West Brom and <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/chelsea/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chelsea</a>.

On Sunday against The Blues he began to show glimpses of the potential he showed last season.

Januzaj created three chances during the game, making five crosses and attempting four take ons, however he completed just one of those. He had a 80% pass completion rate and managed two shots, both of which were off target.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/cristiano-ronaldo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> did when he first started out at Manchester United. Fans would often get frustrated by his constant need to get past players but it if it didn't come off the first four times, you could be sure the fifth attempt would.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/raheem-sterling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/eden-hazard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eden Hazard</a>and team-mate, Angel Di Maria, you can see his average passes per game is way off the level he clearly has the attributes to produce. It may be harsh to compare him to three of the most naturally gifted players the Premier League has to offer, but much has been made about the potential impact that Januzaj could have in this league.

As a winger, a player must show intent to go forward and be the creative spark on the flanks. Januzaj is playing just over nine passes forward on average each game, creating less than one chance per game, compared to the other three who all over two chances per game or more.

Van Gaal has done well to start him over the last two games, after <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/falcao" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Falcao</a>, Di Maria, Herrara and arguably <a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/juan-mata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Juan Mata</a> signed, you feared the worst for a player who was one of the standout performers during David Moyes' ill-fated reign at Old Trafford.

Starting the last two matches can only be good for the young Belgian's progression, but like Sterling it must be monitored and there be some protection for him, especially over fitness.

With United's attacking roster, It would be a surprise if Januzaj starts in the Manchester Derby. However, having a player like him on the bench – fearless and a willing working down the flank –  can only bode well for Van Gaal and his team.

The Dutchman will know that Manchester City's defence hasn't been as water tight as perhaps it once was, so using Januzaj at some point on Sunday could be the key to winning the battle at the Etihad.

1983~~~
All the above plus Di Maria and Diego Costa from the PL alone. I'd also have Reus and Lewandowski ahead of him from the Bundesliga. He is in the top 15 at a push but no higher.

1984~~~
there was a report to state that one of our coaches (a dutch i presumed) see januzaj as a young cruff.  i concur.  he is a no winger and his best position shall be a side forward.  going wide should be of less priority unless there is no opportunity to cutting in.  his most influential area is inside the box, even it's crowded with pack of defenders.

as a young player the major deficiency is consistency.  no matter how talented you are this is extreme difficult to get out and out good performance in your young stage of career.  last season januzaj was not developed properly.  moyes tempted to turn his fortune by relying on januzaj to become his savior.   at the latter stage of the last season when i saw januzaj kept running up and down and tried to tackle hard,  my brows got tightened.  januzaj played good football when he looked like he didn't care.  for such kind of talent you just need to put him into the right position, give him room to do what he is pleasure to do.  moyes tried to shape him as a hard to beat player is the least thing can help but destroy a real genius.

just let januzaj be januzaj.

1985~~~
3rd start in a row now.  Remember when everyone was worriedly? As I said, he'll get his chances.

1986~~~
Will have to be good defensively today because Valencia is no good at RB and will need support.

1987~~~
Would love to see him get his first goal this season against City on a derby.

1988~~~
I think they'll look to target that flank.

1989~~~
Januzaj is defensively sound, he tracks back often and isnt afraid of getting in a battle, wouldnt be a big problem I guess. Nice to see LVG picking him above Mata.

1990~~~
Adnan is gonna fkin rip them a new one, mark my words.

1991~~~
Probably gonna start on the left, Di Maria's work rate is much better and we need it with Valencia at RB.

1992~~~
Does this mean we are playing a 4-3-3? Good to see Adnan given yet another start for such a big match though.

1993~~~
Didn't you back Cleverley? Januzaj is doomed.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Just kidding</span>

1994~~~
"Loan him out" they said...

1995~~~
Di Maria started on the right the other day, could well be same again

1996~~~
Go make yourself a hero Adnan!

1997~~~
I'm loving this faith van Gaal is putting in him.

1998~~~
Clev still has 4 years to make my prediction come true!

1999~~~
Januzaj doddling and being indecisive as per usual directly led to City's best chance - Aguero - and they should have scored. We cannot afford to carry a passenger all the time, so far he's being nothing but that in all of these games he's played.

2000~~~
Needs games.. but I don't think he is ready yet.. especially considering how many players we have and how few games we have this season

A loan wouldnt be the worst idea in the world

2001~~~
Blind faith in a boy that has failed to produce cannot be sustained when points are vitally needed. Training ground wonder or not.

2002~~~
All he's shown is that he can run fast along the touch line. Looks like a deer in the headlights with the ball in the final third.

2003~~~
Been better than Di Maria last 2 games.

2004~~~
Are you nut?

2005~~~
So talented yet, despite his age, such a poor decision maker when in possession.

2006~~~
Not for me. Lots of teams now paying attention to Di Maria more. Januzaj has had the ball a lot and done nothing. Can you remember a chance he's created?

2007~~~
Yeah, created a clear chance for RVP vs Chelsea. And played 2 good through balls wide cutting in to put players through in the channel besides that first half vs Chelsea too.

More than what can said about Di Maria tbh except 1/2 set piece deliveries. 

And Januzaj is being double teamed as well. Infact he's had to deal with better defensive combinations on the wing both games in terms of Willian + Ivanovic and Milner + Clichy. Also Valencia didn't help him at all today in combination compared to Shaw.

2008~~~
Did you miss the lovly through ball vs Chelsea? Played a couple of other great passes as well against both CHelsea and WBA.

2009~~~
His ultimate move is stop the ball, stand over it like he did an exhilarating piece of skill and when he inevitably gets pressured he passes back or loses the ball.

Good player in the making, not the amazing prodigy as anointed by redcafe.

2010~~~
wow I thought he was looking dangerous and I thought he was pushing clichy back quite a bit.

2011~~~
Jeez... Everything is falling apart with Smalling and Rojo to an extent, and Januzaj is getting picked on for his 35 minute cameo when he didn't do a lot, but certainly didn't screw up.

I really don't know why I read what other people say on a message board when 99% of the time it's ridiculous uninformed bile.

2012~~~
I'm surprised people are giving Januzaj a lot of criticism. He barely even touched the ball, not because it was his fault. Players were giving crap passes to him putting him in 50/50 situations. Rooney's long balls were a mystery. Why do that with a defender right next to him? The defender obviously has enough time to contest the ball.

There was only one time where he messed up, giving the ball away in the process in their half and City had a good counter attack.

2013~~~
Its kind of like reviewing a car crash and focusing on he fact the hood ornament wasn't completely in place.

2014~~~
It's really ridiculous. He starrted of really well when he turned Clichy and Jovetic early on.

2015~~~
I suspect if Clichy didn't foul him Januzaj's performance would be seen completely different by some people.

2016~~~
No, he'd have still had 67% pass completion, 0 chances created and 0 tackles.

In short, no attacking output, no defensive output and also a poor midfield output.

2017~~~
Played about 30 minutes so hardly shocking that.

You do have something against him though. Wonder if you were so harsh on Ronaldo when he was tripping over his own feet at 19

2018~~~
This is obscene. Anyone could put numbers up like that to make a point. You're so busy bashing a 19 year old who played 35 minutes and hardly put a foot wrong that you've failed to wipe the foam gathering around the edges of your mouth.

Why not have a pop at James Wilson while you're at it too. That'd be about as rational.

2019~~~
I'm sure he was. But as soon as Ronaldo cemented himself as a star, he would have been the first to jump on the bandwagon.

2020~~~
Simply has got to do more before starting games of such magnitude for us. I'm all for giving him games, but away to City at this point is too much to ask of him.

2021~~~
Or I'm just stating facts and don't have the CAF tinted view of him you lot do. He needs to produce more. Fact.

2022~~~
Started well enough I thought. His decision making remains poor at times. Would have been interesting to see how he would have got on further into the game, but Smalling is a donkey.

2023~~~
Well, yes he does but it's not like he's done nothing. Played he pass of the match against Chelsea and then you have to consider that his best position is not out wide either.

2024~~~
You could say that about everyone, but why the feck you point out a 19 year old who played 35 decent minutes whilst playing at City as your target clearly shows you're out to lunch. Jog on.

2025~~~
He looks very predicatable right now. Probably suffering from the second season syndrome. Will come good eventually, I have no doubt.

2026~~~
He's a 19 year old. Fact. How many goals and assists did Ronaldo produce as a 19 year old?

2027~~~
67% means crap when there are only 9 passes. Maybe if he had gotten the ball more he could have passed the ball back some more so the passing% goes up, but then you would criticize him for not being more adventurous. 

And those 0 chances created have a lot to do with that Clichy foul which is why I highlighted it. In your eyes his performance would have been better had that foul not been made because of all the space to dribble into (with no defenders in front of him) after he had wasted Clichy with a great turn.

You should be more bothered by the crap passes that went his way that were much to short for him to reach. That's where his quietness stemmed from.

2028~~~
Yep, there is that but while Mata and Rooney are fit and available he won't see time as a 10. He has to learn to produce elsewhere to force the issue. He isn't doing so consistently and in a phase where Utd need points more than blooding a kid with blind faith, the performances are not up to par to start games yet.

Even if you excuse today's 30 odd minutes

2029~~~
He is showing some of the 'early Ronaldo' traits. I used to be massively disappointed with his decision making and trying to take shot almost every time in early years, to the point I had thought it would be 'good riddance' after his fight with Rooney in 2006 WC and the subsequent transfer rumours. Though Januzaj don't have same level of tricks, he has lot of potential and with time he will improve. If he improves in decision making and shooting even half as Ronaldo did, we will still have a very good player on our hand.

2030~~~
Who would you play instead? We don't have any other wingers. Valencia was RB and Young was injured.

2031~~~
He's fecking 19. Which player is consistent at 19?? Messi?

And LVG did not play him on blind faith. Januzaj did more against Chelsea than either Di Maria and Mata (from open play anyway). If he was doing nothing then yeah fair enough but he's doing some nice things albeit in fits and starts.

2032~~~
in the alternate universe where only his fanboys dwell....

2033~~~
He was being closed down by 3 players most of the time.Not sure how he can contribute from situations like those.But he seemed more determined to get involved or create opportunities etc etc.

2034~~~
As for all of the Ronaldo comparison digs coming my way, I'll state facts again -

Ronaldo was more fortunate due to us not lying too far down the table and needing points quite as desperately as we do now. We could afford time to allow him to iron out the flaws and gain experience, both good and bad. Ronaldo's hot headedness is a trait thankfully Adnan doesn't yet show at senior level.

Adnan for all his skills and ability is in a tricky situation, not good enough to deliver consistently but also in a team lying far below the level it should be in the league. He needs games, he needs time. We have games, we're running out of time.

In short, our league positions and pressures allow for leniency. Ronaldo was in a safer and easier time for youth to develop. Januzaj isn't and it's getting worse, not better.

2035~~~
A diamond with one of Herrera/Mata in place of him? As bad Mata has been recently, he does a little more than Januzaj for my liking. As for Herrera, he's made our bench for the Chelsea game, so I'd expected him to be fit enough to have started this game.

2036~~~
He isn't really taking the chances that LVG is giving him, I have faith in his ability but his decision making has been very poor this season.

2037~~~
All very good, but who should have played ahead of him? Mata has been worse, Herrera and Falcao are injured. And please don't say Valencia or Young.

You also ignore the good things he's done in the last 2 games and continue with your "he's done nothing" stance which is blatantly untrue.

2038~~~
Fellaini is (correctly IMO) keeping Herrera out of the team right now. If we keep playing with wingers, Januzaj is a better option than Valencia and Young. The diamond with Herrera/Blind kept getting overwhelmed in midfield - it probably isn't the long term solution.

2039~~~
How someone can even judge that performance is beyond me. Barely saw the ball. He had one mistake which is the failed pass by City's box that led to their counterattack. How many times was their a ball sent his way that didn't reach him? That was more of a factor in his quiet performance than any of his actual playing.

2040~~~
Sorry but he looked like a small boy today in a mans game. Herrera should of played.

2041~~~
He can count himself unlucky that he had to come off because of Smalling's stupidity. There was one poor moment of poor decision making when he should have released it to Fellaini by their box. But he also showed that he had the beating of Clichy and Milner and was shaping up to be a big threat for us. Any talk of a loan is silly.

2042~~~
Shame he was taken off due to Smalling's preformance (or lack thereof), so it's very hard to judge him today. I do appreciate the fact that LvG is giving him chances.

2043~~~
I still dont like him on the right. Waaaay too much you know what hes going to do, hes going to cut back to his left foot and not use the width at all. Its all predictable from there and easy to defend.

He doesnt use his right foot enough and isnt quick enough when he cuts in onto his left foot.

2044~~~
Felt sorry for him today as he was having a decent game up till the sending off
He was the obvious player to sacrifice when we needed to sure up the defence. Silly booking from smalling on harte and a poorly timed tackle cost adnan am opportunity to show what he can do - harsh on the lad

2045~~~
He did get by his defender on the right touchline though. The ref should have given Clichy a yellow for his foul. Just look at the Swansea match where he played on the right and completed 4 dribbles and picked up 4 fouls. He by far picks up the most fouls per minute on United. Those fouls are usually dribbles that stop him from going past the player.

I think he should start forcing the issue with his vision rather than dribbling. I think he has the ability, just needs to start being more adventurous.

2046~~~
That bit of skill past Clichy was nice. Not sure how that wasn't a yellow. Still needs more confidence in himself this season. Too often he dallies on the ball when he has time and then makes the wrong decision. At the moment he's better when he doesn't have time to think and just acts on his ability.

2047~~~
The skill vs Clichy and Jovetic reminded me of the fact that he isnt Mata slow.

2048~~~
Here's his performance, which I think proves my assessment of him right. He just didn't see enough of the ball. He had the one mistake which I stated. I don't see anything else wrong with his performance. Having seen his touches again, some people expect a miracle worker.

Januzaj vs Manchester City.

2050~~~
Interesting microcosm of the problem I have with him. 

Theres two instances of him moving the ball quickly, both times in our half, and both should have led to bookings as the players that he put the ball past just hauled him down.

Then we get to the attacking third and its woeful. The first instance is at 1:25, he receives the ball with empty space in front of him, RVP and Rooney are making runs into the box. He doesn't even try and beat his man, instead he slows it down to a walking pace before eventually cutting inside and making a 2 yard pass to Fellaini. 

Then 1:46 picks up the ball with space to run into after a poor pass, Clichy on his heels and space to run into. Once again, slows the game down to a walking pace, cuts inside and then plays some weird chipped pass to nobody thats cut out and losses possession. 

2:40 good bit of chest control after Rooney plays one of his pointless slow passes out to him, once again slows the game down and eventually comes inside to pass it to Di Maria.

That this boy is talented is undeniable, but there has never been a world class player that plays the game as slowly as Januzaj tries to play it. Take the difference between Di Maria and him, Di Maria was poor today. But because he plays the game at a tempo he always causes teams problems even if his delivery is off. Januzaj's performance today was Valencia like in the final third, and the fact he isn't Valencia is the only reason he gets away with it.

2051~~~
That was on the half way line right? I have no problem with him there on the right, its when it comes to the box and he has to cross it. Hes pretty much nullified on the right when it comes to crossing.

2052~~~
6 passes completed in those 43 minutes. To say he was peripheral would be an understatement.

2053~~~
How City got so few cards in the opening exchanges is beyond me.

2054~~~
I only started watching the game after 5 minutes, must admit at the 15 minute mark, I logged on here to check if Januzaj was injured or not. He was largely invisible for me and it's been a factor of his so far this season.

2055~~~
Doesnt look interested to be honest - just strolls around avoiding involvement. Seems content in being a passenger..

2056~~~
Well he's a right winger, on the right wing waiting for the ball. If the ball doesn't come to him what can he do?

What can increase his ball touches is to stop making runs when the rb has the ball. He does this a few times a game, but the rb isn't capable of making that pass. He needs to realize that or someone needs to tell him to stop doing that.

This is why I want him to play behind the striker to try and get him more involved in the game. Right now he isn't asking for the ball (which is the opposite of his youth days), but I'm not sure if that's by design or if it's Januzaj's fault. LVG is known for preferring his wide players to keep the width.

2057~~~
Harsh. I don't Think you're right about that, I think it's just lack of confidence. I think that the underwhelming perfórmance against West Brom set the tone for him in the games against Chelsea and City who any offensive player would struggle against tbh, he needs a boost badly.

2058~~~
Didn't look like he was lacking confidence to me. Had a very good first 10 or 15 minutes but then some poor decision making (shock horror from young winger) a couple of times and then Smalling gets him the hook.

2059~~~
If only Januzaj was a portly comedy Brazilian, then he could be shite for the best part of 5 years and still get love and patience, rather than getting ripped after 3 games.

2060~~~
Did nothing during his time on the pitch. Hasn't lived up to his potential - time will tell if he does of course, but for now, for me, he doesn't deserve his starting spot.

2061~~~
He's 19....

2062~~~
He's getting chances now but not doing anything to convince that he should keep his spot. He's a young, wee lad though. Give him time, if there's a season/period we can develop a player in the heat of real games, it's now.

2063~~~
Let it go mate. Twitter age. #Ain'tNobodyGotTimeForThat #Development...GTFOH w/that!

2064~~~
Btw he was much better on the left side first hal last week linking with Shaw.

Been shifted right this time for Di maria to be effective more which did not work again.

It is also odd that Lvg keeps the wide players both pinned on the wings when both like to drift in more and along with rooney can alternate.

2065~~~
Must be a joke, he's 19 ffs. Hes not a traditional winger, he doesn't have the necessary pace. He would be better suited to a #10. We really have to make a decision between Rooney and Mata, they are both too good to be on the bench, 1 of them has to leave and Januzaj should be back up to that player as a #10.
Our wide men department is in need of a serious upgrade, the likes of Young, Valencia, Nani, Zaha, Lingard are not good enough. We need to ship the lot out and bring at least 2 wingers in, 1 hitting his peak and 1 young winger (Depay).

2066~~~
He was our most dangerous man on the pitch while he was on? But whatever suits your agenda though.

2067~~~
Such posts really annoy me. How the feck do you know he's not interested? Stop posting crap.

2068~~~
Rather have that than di Maria just losing the ball on all the time in all areas of the pitch. These arent the ideal matches to play for someone like Januzaj, 2 matches vs far superior teams and 1 match vs a team who sat back and had 2 players on him consistently, and even then has he created some chances by good passes and crosses.

2069~~~
He's 19 and all that, yeah fantastic. Let's give him time but that doesn't mean that he's not falling short of expectation either.

Raheem Sterling is 19. Tearing it up.
Julian Draxler played 30 times in the league and got 10 goals and was a Champions League player at 19.
Stephan El Shaaraway played 37 times and got 16 goals for Milan at that age.
Hell CAF Logic would have you believe he's the next Messi and Neymar given how staunchly they defend the boy.

Januzaj might be a later bloomer like Bale and the like but you cannot dismiss people's valid criticisms today because of the age argument.

He's expected to deliver every time he puts on a united shirt regardless of age. That is the standard at our club. He has failed to do so to the same standard as the 3 examples for nigh-on 10 months now. We cannot afford to continue to carry him when points are now a seriously more important commodity.

2070~~~
No wonder it's hard for the kids from the academy, the standards some people seem to have are impossible to match.

2071~~~
Why don't you actually respond to some of the posts that were directd at you yesterday instead of continuing to spout shit?

Sterling has the luxury of starting games week in week out. A luxuy Januzaj hasn't had until the past couple of weeks.
Januzaj was a Champions league player at 18 and one of our stand out players last season. Also, Draxler has scored 4 in his next 30 odd games.
16 goals at 19 and a big fat zero since then for El Shaaraawy.

You're talking about him being a late bloomer when he is 19? Are you for real? David Silva was on loan in the Spanish 2nd division at the same age.

2072~~~
Draxler was hopelessly inconsistent last year at age 20, El Shaarawy has only played one full season as a first team player and Sterling has been struggling an awful lot in the past few games...in other words almost all young players are inconsistent no matter how talented they are. Yes people got a little carried away calling him a future Ballon d'Or winner but what he's going through now is what an awful lot of very, very good players went through at this age.

2073~~~
Also I think if you move beyond stats you would see that Draxler, El Sharaway etc are ridiculously inconsistent during the games just like most young players are. It is just that we watch him week in week out so he gets scrutinised a lot more. I think playing on the right doesn't help him either because he is forced to cut in all the time, he was better than ADM when he played on the left vs Chelsea

2074~~~
2 difficult games now. Let's see if he gets his chance against the weaker sides and see how he does

2075~~~
Beat me by seconds

2076~~~
He would have had two solid runs at the City flank had he not been brought down for two blatant yellow card offences. Zabaleta would have seen red had the ref did his job and Smalling wasn't such an idiot.

2077~~~
I think he did ok yesterday, clearly was told to stay wide, that's why his contribution was limited. His decision making is pretty bad at times though, needs to get rid of the ball quicker or be more decisive when to dribble in the final third.

There’s no point in saying things like “he should be dropped” if you don’t suggest who should replace him. Certainly not Mata/Herrera, not on the right wing.

He did reasonably well in Chelsea game for me, and was decent yesterday, I don’t think we should expect much more from him in games like that. I would definitely play him next week.  

Some ridiculous post in this thread TBH.

2078~~~
For whatever reason, a day after a game and sanity resumes. Nice to see the majority understand that he's 19 years old and inconsistency is part of the package.

2079~~~
Not that other players have performed great this season, but Januzaj has been pretty terrible so far.

2080~~~
He adds nothing, just poor.

2081~~~
He's simply not as good as many have suggested.

2082~~~
Attack the ball you lazy git.

2083~~~
He's no world beater or top player, last season he showed that he is capable of doing good with the ball and being a threat, so far he has been very poor/terrible, even lost some pace too.

2084~~~
He is playing with the perception that he is already a ballon d'or winner. He looked much better last season when he had something to prove.

2085~~~
He needs Valencia overlapping him.

2086~~~
Yep. I've never understood the whole <i>"He's certain to be a top top player" </i>stuff. 
He's not at all. 

And it's almost a shame that last season happened for him. Not only has it (in my opinion) had a negative effect on him, now that he's not being given that responsibility, but it gave people the chance to really over hype him.

2087~~~
Awful.

2088~~~
Has lost the ability to beat a man seemingly over the course of one pre season. Bizarre.

2089~~~
He's just not a winger. He's at his best when he is playing passes and link up play not trying to beat full backs.

And where the feck is Valencia?

2090~~~
He's becoming very predictable.

2091~~~
The issue is there is nothing else to bring on. No one else is going to beat a man.

2092~~~
Has to cut out that diving. Pathetic attempt for a penalty.

Let's not write him off yet but yes, there was quote a bit of hyperbole last season.

2093~~~
Not a right winger. He is left footed and just looks so awkward out there. You can tell he is trying his best but he is always showing the ball to the defense. Not sure why we don't swap him and Di Maria.

Di Maria at least has a track record of playing well on the right flank. Could probably whip in some inswinging crosses.

2094~~~
He's got that Nani syndrome where he seems to have to stop with the ball and gove the defenders an age to get into position.

2095~~~
He's soooo slow. Can't beat a fullback for love nor money.

2096~~~
He's not a right winger and he is only going to be useful there if the full back overlaps, Valencia doesn't do it well enough.

2097~~~
I don't really know what's happening with him. I don't think it's a speed problem, he's shown before that he's deceptively quick and has good balance which helps him carry the ball at pace. Just feels that he's playing less naturally/instinctively than last season and trying to think to much about what he should do.

2098~~~
Sick of seeing him start every game. Don't know what he offers us.

2099~~~
It almost seems like RvP brought his younger brother to play and people are being nice to him because RvP would otherwise smack them.

2100~~~
Who else would you guys want to play out wide? He needs the game time if he is going to develop and expecting from a 19 year old to get us out of the shit is a bit unfair, how about Rooney, Di Maria and RvP who are all world class players but atm not a fig better than Januzaj.

2101~~~
Valencia doesn't do it at all.

2102~~~
Needs to think less and do more.
My memory claims that he was way more direct last year, and this year he's been slowing things much more down, Nani style.

Edit: I believe it is mostly down to him trying to develop his game.

2103~~~
Especially with Mata and Herrera available.

2104~~~
Mata hasn't been any better.

2105~~~
At least he's contributed goals.

2106~~~
What is this nonsense I'm hearing that the likes of Roooney, RvP, Mata, AdM haven't been better than him? Mata, for all the stick he gets for being anonymous, still contributes to goals directly and so do the others, unlike Januzaj. People want to believe he's an excellent young player and that he's ready for us, which I don't think he is, at least not yet, which is the harsh reality.

2107~~~
It looks like he's thinking too much on a day like today. It would be great to see his directness/fearlessness that he had last year.

2108~~~
I already said it, he is only a great potential. And last season he wasn't as good as some people are suggesting, he was very good sometimes but also very average most of the time.

2109~~~
The burden of the No. 11 shirt is too much for this youngster.

2110~~~
Giggsy needs to get into him that he can't keep holding onto the ball. He destroys our counter attacks and makes a rod for his own back getting doubled up on.

2111~~~
Exactly this. He hasn't "lost" anything, it's all in his head. Moving him into CAM would probably help him as he wouldn't have as much time to think and would be forced to act more on instinct. But at the moment he doesn't deserve a place there as we have better players for that position.

2112~~~
The amount of hate Januzaj just got in the match day thread is unreal, just because his got the #11 shirt there's people who think he should magically turn into Giggs at his peak.

He had a off game but at the same time has got game time under his belt which will give him the experience needed to move forward.

Plus it's the managers choice to play him and the clubs philosophy is to give youth a chance, you don't like it go support Citeh or Chelski

2113~~~
Was shite today. Still have high hopes for him though. Don't think he'll be a winger long term, isn't explosive enough.

2114~~~
I'm really disappointed with him today, our attacks come to a stop when the ball reaches him and he needs to press charges against whoever stole his pace.

2115~~~
Poor form of late. Somebody needs to take the dildo out of his ass and punch him hard so he wakes up. 

He was looking so much better last season. Its clearly a mental situation because there is no way he forgot how to play football.

For starters, he has to be benched for a while. He will come good but hopefully its sooner than later.

2116~~~
Someone ought to tell him he isn't Bale. He should stick to a measured dribbling style and use his pace on the break. Tired of seeing him knock it in acres of grass that he's never going to be able to cover before his man.

2117~~~
Very disappointed in his recent form

2118~~~
He was pretty gash for the 2nd half of last season, tbf.  Got a lot of developing to do yet.

2119~~~
Was he? I remember good matches vs Hull and Newcastle from him.

2120~~~
true. It's just disappointing that he is not taking his chances when Van Gaal could perfectly play someone else. He needs to snap out of it because i really prefer him in the starting 11 before Valencia and Young, but he wont make it with this performances.

2121~~~
No he wasn't. Why do people keep posting this?

He was very good in many of our games towards the end last season. Our best player in fact. Stop rewriting shit just because he's not been in the best of forms.

2122~~~
Apparently, he was pretty average last season too.

2123~~~
Re-writing shit?  Go back and check threads from the time, people were mostly discussing how his form had dipped (albeit understandably in his first full season).
Up until the last couple of matches, which were basically dead rubbers under Giggs, he could hardly get in the team other than sub appearances - three starts after 19th January.  Up until 1st January he scored 3 goals and assisted 3 - After that he scored 1 and assisted 1.

Best player indeed.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2124~~~
when played on the left he usually was pretty good... on the right, he wasn't that good.

2125~~~
He didn't start because Moyes was resting him.

He was very good in many of the games even if the stats don't reflect it. But yeah dead rubbers lol

2126~~~
As ive said a few times in this thread, play him on the left, where hes provided his best performances (assists /goals) for us.

He cuts in so much to get it onto his left foot it slows attacks. And his right foot aint that great, so he cant cross out wide. From the left hes more direct with his play.

2127~~~
In most games he had performances like the last game of the season against Shaw.

2128~~~
Even if he had been great in all those 6 sub appearances, and the 3 starts (which he wasn't, you're imagining that - he was good in patches), how on earth could that much football qualify him as our best player?<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2129~~~
That's not what I said at all.

Regardless he certainly wasn't gash<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2130~~~
as somebody suggested not a long time ago, he hasnt made it yet and with the potential he has he still needs to work hard and cant afford long time to stagnate when haunting the bracket world class. I am sometimes sceptical about him reaching the top class but then I look around and say to myself: "Then who else could reach that if not Januzaj?"

2131~~~
I think he is good on either side. He's just lacking the confidence he had and maybe little bit thinks that he already won it.

I would personally like to see him as a free roaming attacking player, playing off striker role which robben did for Netherlands. If his dribbling is not the best currently than give him some space to express himself as a playmaker, he has got a vision and good pass in him and can pass even when he is out of form..

2132~~~
Another #10 I feel.

2133~~~
Needs to work harder. Currently there is no unpredicatability to his game. 

Not worried though, he'll get it right.

2134~~~
4 matches in a row is a lot to ask from him, and unfortunately in those 4 games he hasn't really shown the best of his ability.

The only excuse i'd make for him was that having Fellani and Valencia as the closest options didn't help him against Palace. 

But Januzaj fans can't say LVG doesn't rate him, he's played in the two biggest games of the season so far.

2135~~~
That moment when you realise it's not worth trying to have a rational debate with somebody...

2136~~~
Poor today. No excuses.

He seems down on confidence and going through a bad form phase just hopefully. Tbf the Senior teammates need to help more in such a situation too as a 19 year old will have swings.

2137~~~
He needs to be brought along slowly so he can develop at his own pace rather than by rubber stamped into the starting XI as if he's an established player.

2138~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

He wasn't our best player overall. I never said that. I said he was our best player in many of the games he did play. Hull and Newcastle immediately comes to mind.. He was very good against both. Pretty good against Villa as well iirc.

But yeah he was gash lol

2139~~~
I actually (and unlike you I did this explicitly, rather than have to claim alternative interpretations of my own words later) said he was <i>a bit</i> gash.  And he was.

Being great in two matches out of eight or so and underwhelming in the rest (while not even doing enough to get in the team for many others) qualifies as a bit gash for me.

2140~~~
Against Newcastle(the second game ?) he wasn't our best player Kagawa, Mata and Rooney were our best players.

Edit: not Rooney but Hernandez

2141~~~
He was hardly a bit gash in the rest but you have strange views.

2142~~~
Strange maybe, but shared by the vast majority of people who watched.  If you thought he was good, then fair enough, each to their own.

2143~~~
Second season syndrome.

This might sound strange but this loss of form might just do him some good by bringing some realism to him as a person. He was getting too much praise at such a young age and very likely getting ahead of himself. 

He is clearly talented.

2144~~~
Some of the you guys are OTT here. He's a young player who's low on confidence, off-form and playing out on position. He's hardly going to have a great game.

LVG needs to handle him differently though, stop starting him and bring him in slowly. Hopefully he gets some of his form back.

2145~~~
Second season syndrome is what I was about to say. Damn you Sults

2146~~~
Him and Di Maria need to get inside more and switch sides a bit. Both of them are taking a leaf out of Valencia's book on the standing on the byline and neither are looking good.

2147~~~
Thought 2 things today:

1. He was better than Di Maria
2. Both the wingers are playing too deep. They're playing where they can keep possession rather than where they can run in behind to receive a pass and create a bit of space for the forwards. Presumably that's part of the plan though and tbf it worked today. 70 odd % possession and hardly any chances conceded with what was a makeshift defence.

2148~~~
He's also missing an overlapping right back, and Herrera as passing options. None of our midfielders are anywhere near and Valencia is too cautious when playing right back. This is my biggest issue with Fellaini in the side. Nothing personal but the system used and the type of game he plays has had an impact on Di Maria and Januzaj.

2149~~~
He simply needs to do better wherever he is playing but I don't understand why he isn't played on the left, where he is clearly at more of an advantage.  He is much better playing there to begin with and today he would've had Shaw to support him with overlap instead of being stuck on the right where Valencia didn't make a single move forward.  Di Maria clearly is not at his best on the left and should be moved centrally.

2150~~~
Was wank today. He tends to slow down our play more often than not and not always for the better. Also, he needs to work on his decision making. I still think a loan would benefit him greatly.

2151~~~
If he'd have rammed the ball home instead of diving we'd have been better off a lot earlier. At this level that poor decision making can prove costly (Welbeck syndrome).

For me the Januzaj experiment of starting him in every game is not worth persisting with at current. We need points more than we need him to learn how to punish teams at this level (in the short term) given the resources we have available right now. This was further enhanced by Mata's output within 1 minute of the substitution.

Personally, I'd drop him completely for a month or even 2, like Rodgers did for Sterling during his development. It will allow him to refocus both physically and mentally. His progression won't be harmed by this, he'll still be training with elite level players and we can bring him back in and test the mentality of him to push on and strive for improvement in the business end of deciding games rather than have him sitting and knowing that it's almost on a plate for him when he wants it.

That said, I completely acknowledge that once he beat his man the first time it was good to see how he grew in confidence to try it again and this was by far the most promising aspect of his game today - almost a return to that bravado of daring to beat a man and while the final balls weren't quite there, the effort was. In recent games, he was more within his shell than ever before and this was at least, refreshing.

2152~~~
I think he has looked hesitant as far back as the Chelsea game. I'm suprised he's still starting. He looks more like a number 10 to me with every passing game with his decision making the only real short coming but that will hopefully come with time. He is not quick or fast enough to excel at wing(inverted would suit him better).

2153~~~
Starting to develop a conspiracy theory in my mind that the aliens from moron mountain came and stole his talent to play a football match against the looney tunes.

2154~~~
I don't go to many games, but I was there yesterday. You could see he was terrified and the groans in the crowd every time he fecked up which was often...well it was uncomfortable viewing

2155~~~
He needs to relax and be faster when attacking.

2156~~~
We're wasting players out of position. Januzaj is clearly best on the left and Di Maria is a central midfielder.

2157~~~
"If you are good enough, you are old enough."
Age can't be an excuse if he's not doing the biz. He should be loaned out, because he is clearly too good for u-21 level, but needs regular football.
I don't think we can afford to give him that, at the expense of our first team. It is harming us and him.

2158~~~
Do we have a better option on that right wing should we stick with 4-2-3-1?

2159~~~
Do we have to play a formation to give him games?
If we say that Di Maria can be switched there(and I don't see why he hasn't been), Mata, Nani, Young, Valencia, Lingard, Perreira Wilson. Of course injuries affect choices in a number of ways, and some of these options are not ideal, but atm Januzaj is costing us a shirt and giving little back.
Would you be against loaning him out?

2160~~~
If Adnan and Angel were on form yesterday, we'd have torn Palace to shreds. Adnan struggled to make anything happen, and more often than not, Angel either tried crossing from anywhere or lost the ball trying to take on too much.

Surprised they didn't swap flanks earlier as it wasn't happening for either one of them. Not sure why, as our wing play was decent earlier in this season. Is it a case of us trying to tighten the defence? Perhaps they need more overlap from Shaw/Rafael to open up the space.

That said, I hope Adnan gets more games. He's young and needs to play in order to develop.

2161~~~

2162~~~
Marc Wilmots has tweeted that Januzaj starts tomorrow, huge surprise as his form is poor.

2163~~~
It's just a friendly......i don't think he'll start in the qualifier against Wales on Sunday

But i'm happy for him and it's good for us that he plays for Belgium

Van Gaal has said that Adnan had a holiday during the last international break because he hasn't played a single minute

2164~~~
Finally back online. Adnan was pretty bad in his last match as were a lot of our attackers. I was pretty frustrated. His dribbling isn't working right now and he needs that on the wing to open up the rest of his game. He looked more comfortable in the very few instances he was in the middle of the pitch.

Still I'm happy that he's getting game time. There will be plenty more bad performances to come from him and the other young players.

He simply didn't play much after January. He was United's player of the month in January, and then Moyes didn't start him again until February. That suggests that it was more about giving him rest than a dip in form. The talk at the time was that United shouldn't rely on an 18 year old as he would burn out and hurt his development. With Mata new to the team, I'm guessing Moyes felt he didn't need to play him as often as before.

Anyways, he wasn't that great in his limited opportunities in the 2nd half of last season, but I always attributed that to not getting a consistent run of games like he had in October, December, and January.

2165~~~
Football really does show how big the correlation between confidence and performance can be. And that's the issue with Adnan right now. Last season, everything seemed to utterly effortless for him. He looked like he had that bit of extra time and space as compared to those around him, and the game just looked simple for him. Hopefully he can get some confidence back soon, because he's a special special talent.

2166~~~
He's talented and also infuriating when you know the things he could do and doesn't. He has so much time to fully develop into a consistent  player, we just need to be patient with him.

2167~~~
A very good dribbler  but lacks explosiveness like Sterling and Hazard. I'm starting to think he should  expect a no. 10 with his silky touch and vision. I don't really like him on the right. His right foot delivery is weak and doesn't have the greatest finish yet. 

It's too bad there is no Europa or league cup. He needs games to get better and stronger.

2168~~~
It's simple to me. He's playing on the wings and teams are double teaming him now. He will find that space is a premium moving forward. It'll be interesting to see how he grows and adapts to this.

2169~~~
Exactly. So far, Januzaj's struggling with the lack of space he has and the extra pressure put onto him as a result. Also, the opposition can read his dribbles better after last season, so it'll be interesting to see how he can get around those obstacles.

So far, it seems as if he's trying to follow instructions and stay out wide to stretch the opposition, but he always has this tendency to drift into and try to play through the middle. It's what caused Ivanovic problems in the first half against Chelsea, and he also cut in quite often against Crystal Palace, too.

Another thing that'll be interesting to see is how he reacts to obstacles in front of him. From what I've read about him through news articles and interviews, he seems to be humble, hardworking, and motivated to overcome challenges. At least that's a good sign.

2170~~~
He is experiencing the growing pains CR7 went through in 2005.

2171~~~
Unlike Cristiano however, I'm not sure what the end game for Januzaj is going to be. With Cristiano you just knew he was going to be the best player in the World one day, Adnan im not so sure. I think Januzaj will come through this bad spell for what it's worth but i'm doubting as to what his actual ceiling may be.

2172~~~
Back in 2005 very few people thought that. Rooney was the one everyone hyped up.

2173~~~
Gotta agree. He seems grounded, so I hope he'll eventually conquer this and move to a higher level.

2174~~~
I noticed the same, myself, and the same is now starting to happen to Januzaj with Wilson being the more hyped up youngster at thr moment.

2175~~~
Correct. Personally I have no worries over Januzaj due to his attitude, what Van Gaal thinks of his talent and what coaches and colleagues have said of his determination to learn and improve.

2176~~~
Yup, exactly. His performances recently have been quite poor, but I still have no doubt he'll make it here. Great talent and I'm glad he's ours.

2177~~~
Wilson more hyped than Januzaj after last season?  I am not seeing anything like that.

IF anything Januzaj is a clear level ahead of Wilson in terms of experience and displays at the moment.  Probably more considering Wilson is nowhere near a starter.

2178~~~
I've not been impressed with his performances of late, but he is not doing terribly or making any huge errors, so the team should be able to carry him some what in order for him to gain experience. You only get better by playing so <i>again</i> patience is needed with him.

If anything playing/being with the national team has had a adverse effect on his football.

2179~~~
I still think he's a potential world class player but feel like his role is playing in the hole behind the striker. Reminds me more of Kaka than a winger.

2180~~~
On Januzaj's form I thought he was good against Chelsea and was subbed against City after 40 minutes because of the sending off, so it's not like he's been putting in a succession of bad displays.  He was average against Palace.  He's not as good as early last season but there's nothing to overly worried about with his form.

2181~~~
completely different januzaj so far in the belgium match... playing really well, in what looks to be a #10 role.

2182~~~
as soon as i said that, he assisted the first goal off a beauty of a free kick. really good stuff so far.

2183~~~
Januzaj playing much better in the middle for Belgium. An assist already (could have had 2 already) and almost scored.

Only needs to work on his shooting.

2184~~~
No surprise really. I've always felt he is best suited to the #10 role.

2185~~~
juuuuuust about scored on a ridiculous freekick. probably Belgium's best player in this half.

2186~~~
He scored?

2187~~~
no, i said "just about scored"... missed the top corner by an inch.

when i say that he's been belgium's best player today, that isn't necessarily saying much. lots of possession, very little end product.

2188~~~
Eh "just about scored" suggests that he scored, but only just. If he missed the top corner by an inch then you should have said "just about missed".

2189~~~
well i'm from canada, and have split my time between here in england all my life and i have never heard anyone say it that way. and yes, english is my native language even if i don't always sound like it.

"just about" means almost/close/nearly where i'm from. must be a colloquial thing that i wasn't aware of could be differentiated differently between here and ireland.

sorry for the confusion, at any rate!

2190~~~
Someone have a clip of the Assist? Only saw the free kick that nearly went in.

2191~~~
No worries at all mate. Funny how the meaning of phrases can change from place to place. When I say a player "just about scored" I mean that they only just managed to score, ie ball just crept over the line. If they "just about missed" it means they nearly scored and only just missed the target. I've never heard it the way you used the phrase but I guess you learn something new every day! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Cheers <a class="username" data-user="69901, @Redo91" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69901/">@Redo91</a>. Great kick.

2193~~~
No problem. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2194~~~
He really is hyped up this fella, isn't he…  He's been okay but not that special.   Apart from his assist and free kick just wide, he's blasted two okay chances way off target.  He was knocked off the ball once giving Iceland a very good goal scoring opportunity.  Some neat passes and dribbles but the praise he's getting is over the top against Iceland B team.

2195~~~
oh jeez. so it's okay to blast him for being shit, but not to praise him when he's playing well?

ridiculous.

2196~~~
Who's blasting him?  

And by all means, praise him as you like.  I just clearly see him a bit different to you.

2197~~~
He is not a winger

2198~~~
Absolutely this. He just doesn't have that explosiveness, the pace, or skill to be a top winger imo. 

He's a #10 in the making.

2199~~~
He's a similar style winger to Silva

2200~~~
Wilmots told Januzaj that he doesn't want him playing like Van Gaal wants him to play. He wants him to come to the middle of the pitch more often as opposed to staying out wide waiting for the ball. That's why it appeared as if he was playing behind the striker, but in reality was a wide player with much more freedom to go central.

2201~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdExPY8lgKM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Reminded me of Hazard kind of, just slower and not as good of a dribbler obviously. He's that type of wide player who can vary it up with his pace and dribbling, or come inside and do clever through passes which is probably his best attribute. Really needs to work on his shooting though. It seems decent enough when he goes to place it but he always skies it horrendously when he puts his foot through it.

Seems a bit more bulkier too then from the start of the season.

2202~~~
Said it a last night and will repeat for emphasis.

2203~~~
Yeah, I saw that article too. It almost looked like they were playing 4-3-3 of sorts.

2204~~~
The problem is that most players look better in the center. It's easier to attack from the middle unless you have really top-end pace. How many wide players are really consistently good enough and productive enough to really be nailed on starters at a club trying to win the treble? The list of 9's or AM's good enough is significantly higher.

I think Januzaj will be mainly right-sided player here in a few years once he's productive enough. We just have too many central attackers (Rooney, Falcao, RVP, Mata, Wilson, Hernandez, Di Maria, Herrera) compared to wide options (Di Maria, Nani, Januzaj, Zaha) and nobody else merits inclusion as a long-term option currently on the team or on loan, with all due respect to Valencia. 

Rooney will die here and no manager seems to see him as a serious option at LW even though if he could find a way to score some goals from there cutting in our front 6 becomes a lot more logical. That's already one central spot taken up, and we seem likely to buy Falcao and RVP will probably have a purple patch at some point as he's still incredibly skillful if clearly aging.

2205~~~
Just been watching his highlights from the last few games and I am certain he will go on to become one of the best in the world. The Chelsea highlights show some real bits of individual brilliance. He tore Ivanovich apart that game.

2206~~~
I think it helped him that he did have Fellaini support him so that he wasn't double-teamed all of the time, like di Maria was. Plus, he seems to be more comfortable playing on the left channel.

I still think he can become world class, but for all of the maturity he showed last season, we now see that he's still naive in his approach this season. More match time will help him become a better player.

2207~~~
This. Compared to Robben and RVP aged 19, who both started their career as left wingers, Adnan is up there for sure. He´s actually so similar to a young RVP that it´s creepy. Perhaps he is even a little bit faster, literally making him a RVP/Robben hybrid-lovechild. Only injuries or a bad mentality could stop him from becoming one of the best in the world.

2208~~~
He beat his full back once in the game against Chelsea, when Ivanovic tore him down just by the penalty area. That is simply not enough to be considered so highly as an out and out winger. Apart from that all his good moments comes from cutting in, crossing and passing. Compared to wingers I think he has the best passing and vision except Di Maria and Ribery. His penetrative passing is world class already, his close control allows him to challenge defenders like Ivanovic and still get a shot/pass/cross off comfortably.

His entire skill set just screams attacking midfielder, where he can play on either side - or even as an inside forward. With Rooney-Fellaini/Mata centrally - supposed to be very attacking - it pushes the wingers as far out as possible.

Of course him and Shaw has room to grow as players, and Shaw especially can be tactically much more offensive which would help him out a lot and maybe change the scenario.

2209~~~
Yeah, it'll be very interesting to see how Adnan will develop. Robben started on the left wing, eventually became a right winger who's had the best tournament in his career playing as a striker, in a free role in the 3-5-2. Van Persie showed some brilliance as a left winger, giving an assist in the Uefa Cup semi-final vs. Inter Milan, also a brilliant cross to Dirk fecking Kuijt in the '89th minute for the equalizer vs Ajax with Zlatan, Sneijder and Van der Vaart comes to mind. He went on to play anywhere upfront for Holland and Arsenal, mostly as a second striker or from the right. Eventually reached his peak playing as a #9.

Obviously Adnan can play anywhere upfront, wouldn't even be surprised if he bulked up and becomes a striker in five years or so.

2210~~~
I don't see Januzaj becoming a striker at all on evidence of how he's played in the first team.

2211~~~
Did I see him playing for Belgium tonight? Taking the corner leading to the close effort near the end.

2212~~~
Came on with 5 minutes to go, played one right across the goal line which no one attacked, and yes he put in the corner which they had their clearest chance from, should have come on much earlier.

2213~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTDauTJENt0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2214~~~
He came on for Mertens who got knocked out, in his 5 minutes cameo he put two good balls into the box that Belgium should have done more with.

2215~~~
His delivery has been off the mark this season. Whether its down to lack of game time, I don't know but he does need to improve in alot of areas for me. Hopefully LVG can bring the best out of him and get him to be more influential in games where we need to unlock stubborn defences.

2216~~~
Thought he did great when he came on last night. Belgium immediately looked a lot more threatening and could've scored a couple of goals through his work down the right.

2217~~~
Hopefully then, he brings that kind of form back to United, with all these injuries totting up, we need players that can rise to the occasion and have the determination to win. This is a big chance for Januzaj to stamp his place in the team.

2218~~~
In recent games, I have not been confident going into a game with him in the side (as much as I rate him) but for some reason, I really think he will turn it on against Arsenal. Don't know if he will start but I think he can really get at their back four.

2219~~~
I agree. Di Maria as well. Arsenal being an attacking team will leave space in behind so it gives us a chance to counter attack with pace. What we need is that end product to be there when it counts.

2220~~~
Should put him on the left if we stick to the 4-3-3 vs Chambers.

Let Di Maria float from the right and not be rigid like we have been in much of our 4-3-3 games.

2221~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAQCYjHpnT4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2222~~~
Hoping he gets a shot off the bench today... Would be great to see him and Wilson together.

2223~~~
Whenever we go to the Diamond he loses out.

2224~~~
Yup. His only option is playing the Mata role in that formation, and he hasnt played good enough to play in his spot.

2225~~~
I don't think Mata has been really impressive on the left side of the diamond either, but I agree that it will be difficult for him to grab a starting spot. 
I hope to see him tonight too.

2226~~~
Shame he didn't get a run today, but that's life I guess.

2227~~~
Yeah I really thought he'd get a look in today too.

2228~~~
With the busy Christmas period and the FA cup coming up, he'll get some time to shine soon enough.

2229~~~
Hasn't been given a chance in that spot. I agree though, there are better options there.

2230~~~
Needs to go out on loan in January.

2231~~~
Which clubs would suit him? At which club would he be a starter and play in an attacking team?

2232~~~
Everton? Palace?

2233~~~
Maybe a lower level club in Spain or Portugal. Right now when he comes on he's Valencia light - receives ball on the right wing, shuffles around until the defense is set, then lays the ball back. He hasn't got the work rate, consistency or defensive skills to play in a more central position for us. A less pressured environment where the focus is still on passing might let him develop. (I'll admit that i'm not too optimistic about his future with us.)

2234~~~
I doubt he would be a starter at Everton, do Palace play attacking? Not followed them very much.

2235~~~
People can't be any patient on this forum can they?

2236~~~
We will need him on the road to Wembley. Also think he has a part to play over the Christmas period.

2237~~~
I'd say Ajax, but we have all those spots covered at the moment <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2238~~~
Fa cup, christmas fixtures, injuries, substitute appearances. Might as well just keep him.

2239~~~
Exactly, Ajax would be stupid to stand their own talent in the way, PSV could be an option tho, they dont have a solid right winger.

2240~~~
Bizarre. He's had plenty of games this year so far and he'll get plenty more in the 2nd half of the season - particularly as we're likely to have FA Cup games and 'lucrative friendlies' to play.

2241~~~
He'd do well at most PL clubs. And can see plenty of interest if we wanna loan.

He is Valencia lite all of a sudden ? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2242~~~
he has 11 appearances already lmao. People need some patience.

2243~~~
He has 423 minutes in 11 matches, that's not really good for someone he will be 20 in 2 minutes, he needs rhythm, game time. Probably it will come with the FA Cup, but who says we'll stay in it to the end? I really think the best thing for him is just playing frequently, all talents who develop fast have that.

2244~~~
my feck, that soon?

We have many players around that age who play significantly less. Hs growth is not being harmed by playing occasional games or minutes. This is not FIFA, progress isn't linear, nor is it dependent entirely on playing.

2245~~~
heh, just so he can get used to playing together with Depay before we use them both in the future with Wilson in the middle.

2246~~~
Not entirely, but how long are we going to keep this this way, since he has lacked rythmn he just looks complete off, with all the competition he has it doesnt help him either, di Maria/Herrera for attacking midfield, Rooney/Mata for the 10. position, it's incredibly difficult for him to get in the XI, ofcourse the injuries 'help' him a little bit, but he isnt good enough yet and I think rythmn, playing time would be best for him.

2247~~~
It's a what have you done for me lately thing. People forget he's only 19.

2248~~~
I'm kind of glad (kind of) that he hasn't hit the heights of last season. Last year the weight of the team was put on his shoulders, if he continued, the pressure would just be increasing by the week. His lack of form has allowed him to go under the radar. When he steps on the pitch, no one is expecting him to carry the team and he is able to just concentrate on developing.

Of course I would prefer him to tear teams apart again but I am not concerned at all. He has years to go before we should be expecting consistent top class displays. Until then, let him be.

2249~~~
Don't loan him out.

He has bags of talent, it's his decision making that is  letting him down at the moment. That will improve with experience & games.
No bad thing that he has a spell when he's playing a few reserve games to get some form back. I think he will still have a part to play this season.

2250~~~
What's the point of loaning him out? The FA cup is coming, of course he'll have more minutes.

2251~~~

2252~~~
It would be a terrible decision to send him on loan

2253~~~
I second this. Let alone sending him to Moyes of all managers.

2254~~~
A loan to Spain would be great. Suso got 33 games there, played the big boys, didn't get chopped in half.
Something like that would be great.

Not to Moyes though, and I like Moyes. But... just no.
A club with less to play for would be ideal.

2255~~~
That would be the worst decision since Moyes' first steps into Carrington

The FA-Cup (with maybe replays) will come and we're needing options from the bench

2256~~~
Wouldn't have an issue with sending him over to Moyes, he did trust him as a player and played him quite a bit. He would definitely get more game time over there.

2257~~~
I think a loan would be a good idea at this stage.

2258~~~
With our injuries and lack of quality from wide players that would be a huge mistake IMO. He hasn't had much game-time so far, but for all we know, he might get a lengthy run in the second half of the season.

2259~~~
Yep, Moyes is better than half the managers out there anyway and as you say he'd pretty much guarantee Adnan being a main player for them. Sociedad also have some good players to learn from and La Liga is a good league all around to get experience. Personally, I'd probably keep him here but if van Gaal decides to send him out I think it would also do good.

2260~~~
Nothing against Moyes himself. But I just think it's very possible that Moyes finds himself in a situation where he needs results, and doesn't want to play a young loan player.
There are a number of other clubs where he'd be guaranteed to start. If Suso can get 33 games, Januzaj can.

I think (for no tangible reason) that he's a bit disillusioned with things here. Going from key player to having fewer appearances. Plus the Belgium situation.

A run of solid games would be amazing for him.

2261~~~
Moyes needed results and heavily relied on Januzaj at times last year. I don't think thats a good point as Moyes clearly rates Januzaj as someone that will get him those points.

2262~~~
In a sense, Januzaj forced his way into Moyes' team at united.
If he doesn't do that in Spain - for whatever reason, there's no guarantee that Moyes will keep playing him (over his own players) because of what he might do or what he did in the past.

There are clubs where he'd play, no matter the circumstance. A loan to Moyes wouldn't be too bad, but I'd look for a loan to a team lower down the table.

2263~~~
The link to Sociedad is pure speculation.

2264~~~
Unless we are bringing Nani back, loaning Adnan is madness.

2265~~~
He played much better for moyes than for LVG so why would it be the worst destination for him?

2266~~~
Adnan still hasnt had much of an opportunity to play in his best positions, either centrally or on the wing where he's clearly been told to keep to the touchline.

The biggest problem has been our lack of games... We have been involved in one competition this year, whereas our main rivals have been involved in three. On a hopeful assumption that we finish top four, we're guaranteed to play a lot more football next year and he'll undoubtedly get a better run of games.

2267~~~
He just really needs a great game to jump start his season. Not only will it show LVG he deserves playing time, but it can give him some confidence. Maybe all he needs is a little more freedom to go central. Either way, I don't think a loan is necessary.

2268~~~
Id rather we keep him here and play him. He will get games.

2269~~~
I don't understand how people wouldn't think a loan wouldn't be good for him if he isn't getting game time here. I mean, with Van Gaal favouring the diamond, Januzaj doesn't really have a place in the team. Having said that, Van Gaal often changes systems, and if we ever need to play with wingers, I can imagine Adnan will start. I guess he'll have to just be patient, but without CL football, and being out of the COC, he probably won't start much between now and the end of the season.

2270~~~
Have you people forgotten how injury prone our squad is? He will get games.

2271~~~
As people have mentioned, he's going to play plenty considering how many injuries we have sustained.  Di Maria is out for Southampton, he might start Monday.

2272~~~
I think the Southampton game is a great opportunity for him (if he is selected).

2273~~~
We don't have enough cover to be loaning him out. I'm sure he will get games especially in the busy period coming up. Next year will be a lot better for him.

2274~~~
No chance of a loan considering our wide options. Would like him to work with LVG anyways,

2275~~~
He hasn't played much despite our injury crisis, so its unlikely he will play more than he has once the crisis ends.

2276~~~
Funnily enough I guess that loan to Moyes' Real would be the best option. He's trusted him, played him, Adnan bailed him out numerous times so he'd probably be played there.

What I wouldn't want is another shit loan like Powell or Zaha's where they're playing very little minutes. I wonder, is it possible to construct the loan-contract in such way that the takers have to play them whenever possible or something?

Because if it's not, then there's simply no point. I'd rather he worked with LVG and other fantastic players in the training ground than warm a bench in some shit midtable team.

2277~~~
Unless we recall Nani from loan, it would be madness to send Adnan on loan. We need options on the bench.

If we send him on loan, Sociedad would be a good destination. Moyes truested him last season (when Moyes was in a worse position than this year) so I would expect Adnan to be a regular there (in fact, a key player too).

2278~~~
Januzaj will get more games with the fa cup soon. He had a run of starts a month or so ago but he wasn't that good. Was decent but that's about it. Just having a more difficult second season but he'll be better off staying here and training with the first team rather then go to Moyes's Sociedad, who would make him play the complete opposite of what Van Gaal would want him.

2279~~~
I haven't yet made my mind on this loan and I'm not sure if it would be a good idea or not, however, if we do send him out, I'm almost certain he'll play a lot. Sociedad are actually very dire in attack this season, from what I've seen. The quality is far from impressive, and the width even less so. They've got a total of 5 attacking players for 4 positions currently (they play 4:2:3:1) and all of them (except Vela and maybe Prieto) are, well... inconsistent, to put it mildly. Januzaj would get into that team without any problems. They've got absolutely no one decent at LW. Canales and Castro have played there this season and both are shit.

2280~~~
In fairness our injuries haven't really been in his position. He's not really competing for a spot with Jones, Rafa, Evans, Blind, Shaw etc. Plus he's started some of the biggest games of the season so far. LvG varies his tactics/formations a lot depending on the opposition so I think he will get games.

2281~~~
The real question is whether we actually have a position available for him in LvG's system. He won't be playing as a #10 with Rooney and Mata about and we're not exactly using wingers anymore.

2282~~~
I edited my last post but I definitely think there is a place for him. If LvG wants two wingers it's Adnan and Di Maria. He might not get as much time with the diamond but LvG has shown that felxibility so far and I think there will be games that Adnan is suited to. Might not be a starter week in week out but he can definitely get minutes. Mata isn't really first choice either.

2283~~~
If indeed he wants wingers then Januzaj is definitely an option, but if he's going diamond with Di Maria in a more central role, it would probably lessen the options of including Adnan, as the other midfielders would need to actually be proper midfielder and not converted wingers.

2284~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/report-januzaj-heading-for-sociedad-loan_192676.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/footbal...januzaj-heading-for-sociedad-loan_192676.html</a> 

Not a reputable source by any means, but makes a lot of sense with Sociedad lacking goals and for all of Moyes' failings last season, you have to admit he handled Januzaj well.  Would like to see him get some game time there.

2285~~~
As if Januzaj would bring goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2286~~~
not sure I want him going to spain as I think he would benefit more by further exposure to the premier league - but a loan to a PL club could be an option and he would walk into most first teams bar our cl place competition (and we wouldnt loan him there anyway I presume)

2287~~~
Yeah, maybe, but I think any games atm would help. He'll find it hard to fit in the system currently and I see him being restricted to cup games, unless he absolutely runs the show when he gets his chance.

2288~~~
What was the pay-out for Moyes? I'd loan him Januzaj for the rest of the season for the exact same amount, plus Sociedad cover Januzaj's wages and promise to play him every game he's fit for

2289~~~
He is fine here and is learning from one of the best coaches in the game. A season with a few first team games where he is learning to be a consistent first team player will do him good.

2290~~~
He will start against Liverpool. Against Southampton we had nobody that could skip past a defender and create.

2291~~~
A 6 month loan where he would get starts is not a bad idea. Doesn't look like he is going to get many chances here with everyone fit. The diamond or 352 are likely to be the predominant formations.

2292~~~
Our formation isn't suited to him at the moment, but he will still be developing and learning from Van Gal. Keep hold of him for now i say.

2293~~~
Yep, we're a much better team without him. Which is a problem because we'll be a much better team with him in a few years. 

That's the difficulty of bringing through youngsters in the situation we are in. 

When you've got 9 or 10 top players like we used to have all playing in a settled team and system, it's a lot easier to bring your youngsters through. 

I'd love to see him get a January loan at a midtable club. It would be great for his development.

2294~~~
Great coach or not you still need regular games at a top level to progress. 

If say a loan would do him good but we still need him as he's one of the only players offering us the tactical flexibility of width.

2295~~~
I don't see the point in loaning him. As far as I can see the reason he's not getting many games is because he's quite naive tactically and plays his game instinctively which helped him impress last year because his style was different to the monotonous style the rest of the team were playing whereas in van gaals style of play players have to have set roles and stick to these roles in order for the system to work. I think working under van gaal this season will give him a better understanding of the game and only benefit him in the long run far more than playing games in a different team with different systems and ideas.

2296~~~
That's a bit harsh. He's started about 4 games this season and two of them was against the two best teams in the league. And he was probably our best attacking player against Chelsea. 

I can't shake off the feeling that he'd thrive if LVG played him through the middle.

2297~~~
You mean in a 4-1-2-1-2 as the AM? Possible. Can't see him playing in a midfield-three though. <span style="color: #ffffff">Even though it works excellent for me at PES 2015.</span>

2298~~~
I mean playing behind RVP and Rooney as the AM. He's clearly got excellent vision and his dynamism will add something extra to our attacks. Also, his relative lack of pace (i'm not saying he's slow before anyone takes offence) will not be an issue through the middle.

2299~~~
I think he can play as the most attacking one in a midfield three like Di Maria. Adnan can work just as hard and is more than willing to put himself about in a challenge. He has said in the past his favourite position is in midfield and he can play a number 8 role.

2300~~~
He is a number 10. I can understand playing him out wide while he is so young but you can tell by his instincts he is a 10. 

His vision and eye for a through ball is wasted out wide. And as a winger in England you need strength and an explosive first couple of yards. Andnan is fast but takes him a while to get going. 

But I still want him here. Too bad we got knocked out of the league cup. He should be playing more.

2301~~~
This. He really impressed as a 10 when Moyes played him there last season. I guess with Mata and Rooney at the club he will have to wait for a proper run in the team as a 10. I see Mata gone by next season so it could be an option to play Rooney up top with RVP/Falcao and have Januzaj in behind them in a diamond formation. In the meantime I don't see how loaning him out would make any sense. With the injuries we are getting he will get chances and the time spent with our world class attackers will be invaluable in the long run.

2302~~~
This is it, basically. He needs to play.

2303~~~
He's no winger that's for sure. He's going nowhere until people realise that's the case.

2304~~~
Bang on

2305~~~
He's a fine young winger having a difficult second season and making a few poor decisions. That's all there is to it. He will still go on to be a very good player.

Any time a young player who can play in multiple positions has a bad run it's because they're "not in their natural position". Or is it, you know, because they're yong and lernin?

2306~~~
Injured?

2307~~~
His loan is probably all but done so it's not a surprise he's not involved.

2308~~~
This is such a fecking waste. Doesn't even make the bench?

2309~~~
We would benefit from giving him Wilson's minutes, who is nothing special and I don't think we need him in those games.

2310~~~
Was there any reason saying why he was dropped altogether? Is he injured?

2311~~~
We have 3 matches in 6 days mate...The lad will get games if he's fit.

2312~~~
Should have moved Rooney up top and put Januzaj in attacking midfield

2313~~~
He hasn't been included for some time now. That's what I don't like. 

He wasn't even on the bench so I'm not sure what it's all about.

2314~~~
I don't get it. We have one of Europes best young players but we continue with the Fletcher & Wilson subs. Can't believe he wasn't on the bench even. I want to see Wilson do well but he's not anywhere near Adnans level.

2315~~~
Maybe he is injured, we don't know anything. He is the only player in our squad who was injury-free this season, so probably about time to injure himself in training <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2316~~~
There was a qoute in one of the other threads, cant remember which, from Van Gaal saying that he was definitely not going out on loan.

2317~~~
It is a bit concerning that Januzaj cant even get minutes off the bench at the moment. Games like today would have been ideal to bring him on after 60 minutes or so.

2318~~~

2319~~~
And once again, a simple explanation.

2320~~~
Yup, Van Gaal hates Belgians & poisoned them!

2321~~~
Him and Fellani won't be involved vs Spurs.Virus apparently.

2322~~~
This can't be luck. Starting to think we are soft.

2323~~~
That explains Pereira.

2324~~~
He's a Brazilian now though.

2325~~~
What kind of Virus does Fellaini have  ? Taking fairly long.

2326~~~
Not surprised he probably caught what Felli had, they're always hanging out together.

I had the flu a couple weeks ago and it was the worst I've ever had, was disgusting. Had me down for a week.

2327~~~
LVG called it the 'Belgium virus' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2328~~~
Is this the thread where teenage girls hangout?
He's done nothing to warrant a place in the side. Even less when we are playing with wingbacks.

2329~~~
Probably is the formation keeping him out more than anything. He was in the first XI for a run when we were playing 4-3-3 against City, Chelsea etc. 

I miss him though. We will probably go back to 4 at the back today since Rafael and Shaw are back so it's a shame he's ill atm.

2330~~~
Dandruff.

2331~~~
Rumors of rib injury.

2332~~~
And I thought it was snow!

2333~~~
Second season syndrome if i've ever seen one. He looks like a shadow of the player he was last season. 

I get it hes young and learning but he was so poor today, offered us nothing

2334~~~
Should never play as a wingback.

2335~~~
What can you expect when he hasn't played in weeks. The 3-5-2 also doesn't suit him one bit. He doesn't have any confidence right now.

2336~~~
Better than Ronaldo at the same age my arse. Same stupid decision making without the world beating moments and flashes of brilliance.

Another redcafe style overhyped 'prodigy' from our youth team.

2337~~~
Send him out on loan he's nowhere near good enough

2338~~~
Definitely needs a loan. Reserve football is not good enough and he isn't playing enough to improve.

2339~~~
Shadow of he's self last season, the injuries haven't helped but with this formation we currently use i cant see where he fits in.

2340~~~
Very poor, we would have been be better bringing Darren Fletcher on and that's saying something, where are those people who said he's better than Raheem Sterling, show yourselves.

2341~~~
Give him a full run out against Yeovil through the middle.

2342~~~
He should go on loan, if he isn't gonna take these little opportunities to shine and prove his worth then he's pointless. Too many stupid mistakes, misplaced passes and controls. At the same time, wtf is LVG smoking to ask him to play as a LWB ?

2343~~~
Clearly not the same player we seen last season. Bad decision making at times.

2344~~~
Something is not right with Januzaj. Played like a prodigy last season. Now he can't even get the basics right. Anyone knows what is going on with him? Really disappointing to see this happening.

2345~~~
He will only get worse with a lack of playing time. Definitely, definitely needs a loan

2346~~~
Think he definitely needs the loan, but the problem is that while we have the likes of Di Maria out then he is needed here as cover. You only have to look at how poor the bench was vs Spurs

2347~~~
Present. Still stand by the previous statement that Januzaj will become a better player than Sterling over time. The lack of adequate playing time in some of his favored positions isn't helping his progression.

2348~~~
Shows why he isn't starting.

2349~~~
It's painful watching him try to take on a player one on one this season. He's a player who was at his best drifting around. Him and Mata have the potential to be a quality pair bouncing off each others movement and skill but whenever they're both on the pitch one of them is confined to the left wing. Okay Mata can do a good job there still because he's more refined but Januzaj looks bereft of confidence and can't even do the basics right.

2350~~~
Par for course really. First chance on the left wing was a shocking decision to try and shoot the ball.

Got better progressively as the match went on. Clearly has talent because he probably attempted to put in more crosses than any of our players combined despite his short cameo.

Still a long way to go for him to develop. Hopefully with a change in formation now that Shaw and Rafael are back we will see Janujaz used on the left wing rather than as a wing back.

2351~~~
He's not comfortable out wide. He's a number ten.

2352~~~
Sorry buddy but I just don't agree with this. Sterling looks like he could become world class once he sorts out his end product, Adnan isn't even making the basics at the moment.

Although I would say that I wouldn't be surprised if Sterling ends of burning out like Owen, Torres etc.

2353~~~
Poor man's Ralph Milne.

2354~~~
Funny all the stick hes getting, its like everyone is blaming our teams poor performance over 70-80 min because of the cameo of adnan for last 10-15 min

I thought he did pretty good, tried beat his man whenever could, tried being direct, plus hes still young, and he hasnt exactly been getting many starts

2355~~~
Even if he was getting regular game time it was questionable he'd be better than Sterling, at the moment it is laughable to even compare the two together. If we had Sterling he'd be playing ahead of Mata in midfield. That said, he needs game time.. it is sad how low he is on confidence at the moment, send him out on loan.

2356~~~
He's taken a backward step this season and isn't good enough for the first team, as isn't Wilson.

2357~~~
Not everyone can be as good as Ashley Young is out of position. I don't see Adnan in any role in a 352, he will be out soon I fear.

2358~~~
Thought he did ok given the circumstances. Could've passed a bit earlier on his lung busting run. He's clearly not been getting enough minutes to suddenly show up and turn a match on his head.

2359~~~
He has no confidence, you can see that from miles away. He needs a loan where he can be a definite starter, build himself back up, he could do well at Swansea, has more to offer than Dyer and Routledge.

2360~~~
Pathetic performance this season, extremely selfish , needs playing time - so a loan move would be ideal in january , he is supposed to be a game changer with his pace and skill , but ends up being a fragile player who tends to look for fouls - which to me is a terrible strategy especially when time is never on our side - it is extremely annoying. If there were claims last season about him being on par with or close to Raheem Sterling ,  this season has definitely put them to bed (deep slumber to be exact).

2361~~~
Have to question whether he has the mentality of a truly world class player.

2362~~~
Bet we wish we'd taken that rumoured £40m from PSG.

2363~~~
Looked lively when he came on and made a few nice runs but made a dogs dinner of a few crosses and the same for a through ball to Rooney who was in a great position. He'll need to work on his final product and that won't be done by sitting on the bench at Utd as much as he is so loaning him out is the only thing now and see what happens from there.

2364~~~
Rather he goes out on loan than having to play LWB.

2365~~~
Every time i see him, i think the same, he is not ready, he is extremely raw. He has a good potential and can become a good to very good player. But world class ? i don't think so.

2366~~~
Very poor performance today and I don't recalling him beating a player on 1 to 1 against stoke

2367~~~
Needs games, very rusty. There's not really a role for him in our system at the moment (3-5-2 or the diamond) but I don't mind him being off the radar this season to check expectations, my only worry is he will regress without gametime. He will be fine.

2368~~~
He was just back from illness and played in an unfamiliar position.Not sure what people expect.

2369~~~
Like I said in the previous post, it isn't necessarily about the here and now or based upon reactionary judgement. A lot of really good players have difficulties in the second seasons of first team football. When you're new to the scene people don't know what to expect of you and you can take them by surprise. But next time around, they inevitably figure you out. That in addition to the fact that Januzaj has hardly played first team football for a consistent period plays into his relatively weak form this season. When things aren't going well, sometimes it gets to a player's mind and they start doubting themselves as the confidence drains and the criticism snowballs to misappropriate levels, which is what I feel is happening with Adnan right now. 

He has all the requisite technical qualities and the footballing intelligence to turn this around and makes good on his earlier promise in the reserves and from last seasons. That didn't disappear overnight. A lot of different factors have conspired against him this season, but I think he'll progress really well once that air of confidence returns about his play. Main worry for me is that it might not be at United if he keeps getting pegged in weird positions or if we can't guarantee him more playing time. Would be a pity because he'll just end up being an excellent player, but for some other club.

2370~~~
It's obvious he's not a winger or wing back. He relies heavily on dribbling out wide and right now it's not working for him possibly due to confidence. For the youth teams he was able to pick and choose his moments to run at defenders as he usually drifted all over the pitch. It feels like when his dribbling isn't working he feels he has no other options, but to cross.

Maybe he's just not comfortable having to keep the width. He's always liked to come towards the ball and drift everywhere. He can't do that under Gaal unless he's a #10.

Glad he got some minutes though. He needs these minutes no matter how frustrating he will be in order to develop.

2371~~~
I hope for a decent final ball, that's all.

2372~~~
You can tell he's had very few minutes of late. Wasn't great when he come on today.

2373~~~
Hopefully gets minutes against Yeovil. But not at wingback...

2374~~~
Why even raise the bar that high ? "Truly world class player" is something you'd never associate with him.

2375~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The poor lad. In terms of getting almost nothing right, that was one of the worst United cameos I've seen. In fairness, though, he's got no match sharpness, was playing soon after illness in a position not alone is he not used to, but which basically asks him to rely on his weaknesses in a side which offered little in terms of use of the ball or movement and the conditions made even the most confident player look a bit rubbish at times. That said, he'll have to take his chances a bit better when he gets them.

2376~~~
Very very rusty and off form, not the best game to bring him back in.

2377~~~
Getting ready for a pile of abuse because of a few poor crosses and that he didn't win us the game but I thought all things considering he did well.

Had a job to do, a tough one at that (he isn't a wingback, especially at Stoke) and I thought he did quite well and gave us some intent going forward.

2378~~~
Needs to leave the club on loan asap before we completley ruin this guy macheda style. 

Nowhere near good enough for the first team but can't be restricted to 10 min sub appearances and reserve team action. He looks appauling out on the wing at the moment.

If we forget the 6 months he had under Moyes and look at his form this season not one person would believe we have a potential star playing for us here.

2379~~~
I also think he did OK. Not good crossing, but we did become more dangerous when we finally attacked them.

2380~~~
One way or another he needs minutes, because that was a perfect example of how you can suffer from no game time. The same could be seen with Herrera.

2381~~~
Di Maria has played like this a few times, but when people had a go at him it was because he was either back from injury or playing out of position.

2382~~~
Yep, I think he did decent as well, not sure where this abysmal worst cameo of all time stuff is from. Looked rusty as you'd expect but still made some moves down the wings. Won us a few corners and I think put in a decent ball or 2 which would look a lot better if we actually had someone in the box to attack it, but that is another discussion.

2383~~~
Only an idiot would have believed that so what was the point bringing it up?

2384~~~
Took him a while to settle and as he did we came into things more at the end but not enough time to snatch it. Don't think he suits a wing back role.

2385~~~
Was decent enough. No worse then anyone else. He had that one poor cross when given the space and lost the ball a few times, but also put in a few decent balls. Only an idiot would write him off.

2386~~~
Too many pussies play for this club, even the manager exhibits these traits, at times. Januzaj isn't one of these guys. He tries to make a difference, which is all I can ask.

2387~~~
He 100% needs a loan, he needs regular games to build back his confidence, he has so little at the moment
A shadow of the player Moyes clearly believed in and relied upon

2388~~~
You know when you see a young attacking player come on, you usually get a sense of excitement that they might do something ridiculously good/crazy? I never get that with him, it's always a bit meh tbh. More often than not I think he makes the 'technically correct' decision with his movement/passing, but there's no real flair that you saw in someone like a Rooney, Ronaldo or even Nani.

2389~~~
Jesus christ people, he came on as a sub after barely playing all season.

The hate is a bit much, no one really played that well today.

I agree he probably needs a loan if he's barely going to play but settle down.

2390~~~
Aye, I thought he was half-decent when he came on, certainly relative to the rest of our attack.

2391~~~
I'm a big fan but he was fairly poor, chose the wrong option a number of times, I was surprised actually that he came on when we didn't have a grip of the game, he needs game time that we can't afford him at present.

2392~~~
It must be really uncomfortable for him to just wait on the wing all the time when he's always done the opposite. Furthermore he has to stay out wide with no freedom to go inside must double that feeling.

He's going to have to work hard and figure it out, but fans need to show patience. He's only 19. One underwhelming half season for a player his age shouldn't force him out of the club.

2393~~~
I'm still trying to figure out if that was a shot or a cross from the left wing when he had acres of space to run into and several men in the box.

If it was a shot he should be made an example of.

2394~~~
I think it was a cross, he just didn't execute it right.

2395~~~
He was the only one who tried something towards the end, even winning a corner. Can't believe the ratings (4) he's got and the brickbats here!

2396~~~
Precisely

2397~~~
Not judging him today anyway, but I think in general when you come back off injury in a role you don't know how to play it will be hard for any player to make an impact.

2398~~~
Not precisely. Illness and lack of game time is fair enough but the position he played in didn't have much affect imo. He tracked back and was wide, received the ball wide like he was used too. Had some poor crosses and touched, a couple of decent crosses as well. Was a bit timid about taking players on.

He wasn't worse than many other players in our team. Did more than Shaw up front with the two crosses that connected.

2399~~~
I agree with you, and I admire that fire.

But he can't do it all by himself. He has to learn to work with his teammates, to elevate his own game. The book is out on how to defend him, isolate him (or let him isolate himself) and force him to square up and you've stopped him. If he gets by, then he'll do something useless with the ball, either give it away or take a low percentage shot. It's like he's trying to win every game by himself every time he touches the ball. If he could focus on fundamental passing and movement the opportunities to score and assist would start to open up.

The kid can play but we've got to figure out how to use what he can do and coach him better.

2400~~~
He is not my favourite players by any means but getting on his after today game is stupid.

2401~~~
Sophomore slump.  Do not be concerned...yet.

2402~~~
It was a decent cameo. One decent run that didn't come to frutition, two bad and one decent delivery. Can't expect much when you have had grant total of 300 seconds on the pitch in more than half a season.

2403~~~
Clearly isn't a wing back. We looked very open down that side the moment he came on, and he didn't provide any real attacking threat to make up for it. Right now he is in no mans land. Our formation doesn't suit him, and he isn't playing well enough to justify giving him chances. 

Hopefully we give him a full match in the Cup and he can show some of the promise that he had last season.

2404~~~
I genuinely think he's having a problem figuring out how to be effective out wide while keeping the width. It's not in his nature to stay out wide all the time. Wilmots noticed this and told him he could go inside despite playing out wide. Gaal's system doesn't work that way however.

2405~~~
Hopefully he starts beside Herrera and maybe even Pereira against Yeovil. Will be nice to see attacking intent in the side.

2406~~~
I personally don't think he's a winger or that will be his position in the future. He seems better suited to a central role. Can't really see who he can replace at present in this team.

2407~~~
I thought he provided a few good balls into the box, more than Shaw anyway.

2408~~~
He was poor today, but it was his first game in a long time. Hopefully he gets 90 minutes in the cup game. Good to see him back, anyway.

2409~~~
He seemed rusty and was asked to play a odd unfamiliar role for while.

He's been a loser so far of the LVG reign.

2410~~~
Yeah, I believe that was actually his 2nd best game this season.

2411~~~
Nothing to be worried about when he's been shunted in and out of the team so much and LVG himself doesn't seem to have a clue how to use him.

2412~~~
I know he's not a wing back but he was poor when he came on, offered absolutely nothing to the game. Considering that was his first match in about a month you would've thought he'd want to prove van Gaal wrong in leaving him out but he didn't. He kept giving the ball away, got pushed off the ball far too easily because he was so indecisive and as soon as he came on he got skinned by Walters (I think it was) and made no effort to track back.

2413~~~
That's not what happened at all. He was jockeying Walters, Walters took a touch to the side to work a bit of space and put in a cross. He never skinned Adnan nor did Adnan make no effort to track back.

2414~~~
I worry a bit about Adnan, his decision making when he has the ball has been atrocious.

And he is clearly not a wing-back, even in an emergency!

2415~~~
He's not good enough, and I doubt he ever will be good enough for United.

That said, we should look to loan him out in January to another Premier League club and see how he gets on.

2416~~~
Not worried about him. He will develop as most kids his age should. Van Gaal will gradually build up his confidence and he will do well in time.

2417~~~
He's definitely good enough. The problem, as I've repeated over and over in this thread, is that a small group of fans have hyped him up so much that expectations have been irrationally raised, which he will never be able to meet. Let him develop slowly like any other youth player who is emerging into the first team and he will do well in time.

2418~~~
Lol this place is so knee jerk,saying he's sh*t after a short cameo,  he hasn't played for a while and just came back from injury, the boy has talent just look at last season just needs to be played in the right position and get his confidence back.

2419~~~
He's got the pace, the technique, the guile, the tricks etc....

What he lacks seems to be decision making and a final ball at the moment.

2420~~~
So we can take the wait-and-see approach with the likes of Falcao and other new signings who seem to become instant board favorites, but Januzaj is automatically s**t after a short appearance? The kid is still very young and at his age, Hazard, who is now tearing up the league, wasn't great either, the same Hazard who was considered a bust in his first year at Chelsea. This is not a guarantee that he'll be great and anywhere near Hazard's level, but to write him off so early is ignorant.

2421~~~
Not his fault that some fans hype him to Zidane levels then get disappointed he doesn't live up to that hype.

2422~~~
Needs a start against Yeovil to try and get some form and confidence back.

2423~~~
Same here, I don't doubt he will be decent to good in future, I just don't think he is or will be special. But today was the most difficult situation for a 19 year old kid to impress away at Stoke for few minutes out of position without any match fitness. 
Anyway, even for him to turn out decent to good, he needs game time, I wish we sent him to Portugal, Moyes, or midtable PL club where he would play regularly. Atletico have sent Oliver Torres on loan to Porto, they had sent Diego Costa on various loans in the past, Isco was playing for Malaga regularly with 19, players don't develop while sitting on the bench and getting 10 minutes here and there. Obviously sitting on the bench for a couple of months when you are not at Adnan's level anyway won't harm anyone, but sitting on the bench for a whole season when you are ready for regular football at a lower level will harm him!

2424~~~
Don't get what people are expecting, he hasn't featured much at all the whole season, the last time he had game time he was played as a wing back then also. He's not played so he isn't going to have any form and after being dropped after a great first season, his confidence is going to be shot. He's still only 19 so his game is still developing, when he's played he's being played out of position, give the kid a break.

2425~~~
Exactly this, however it also comes with the caveat that while he does indeed have those qualities, they aren't outstanding to the point where he is worthy of a place in the team over anyone else at this time.

2426~~~
Let's not do a Pogba with him....I believe he would also come back to bite us!!!

2427~~~
Not sure if you're talking about me in particular, but I've thought this about Januzaj for a while now (see here: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/unpopular-opinions-thread.383975/page-28">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/unpopular-opinions-thread.383975/page-28</a> post #1102)

I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I just don't rate him as much as most of you guys do.

2428~~~
It was nice to see him given another chance, not so nice to see him waste it again

2429~~~
This kid needs minutes,  not sure he gets it here... Loan is needed..

2430~~~
19 year old Zidane would have struggled to find a role in this team, too. 

#NoMoreCentralAttackingSignings

2431~~~
He needs real game time and really need a left back behind him if he is to play on the left. Getting the no. 11 jersey might be a burden too. But I think he has the tools to really be a good player. LvG will improve him.

2432~~~
Not that he is at the same level but people used to get very frustrated with young Ronaldo as well. It's the nature of the beast for attacking wingers who try to dribble with the ball a lot. It will take a few years before his final ball is good enough and he needs to bulk up, and it will be difficult for him when he is only making cameos. He didn't play well but that's what we're going to get for a while, we'll need patience with him.

2433~~~
I think he needs to play football right now. Like, a lot of football. He's sorely lacking confidence and hopefully a loan to a team that plays nice technical football takes him to the level he can reach.

2434~~~
It's just confidence for me. His decision making was good last season. Once we see that swagger back it will come together. Question is, how do we rebuild his confidence and form? Gametime, for me.

2435~~~
He is 19. He isn't 22-23.

Yes game time would be good but it's not going to ruin his career. Not bothered at all, looking forward to seeing him get a good run out in the cup.

2436~~~
totally agree. He needs to play. 

I don’t get this argument. Its not about age. He is ready to compete in the EPL and he´ll only take the next step if he gets time on the pitch. Just training wont improve him a whole lot. Only Liverpool players become world-class on the bench. Either use him on weekly basis or send him on a loan for a year. Everything else is just wasted time.

2437~~~
The age means that it's not critical yet. Yes, it would be better if he was playing, no doubting that at all but it's not as though this stint of not playing (which happens to everyone) is going to ruin his career.

You can only imagine if he played 5 games in a row, the same people here saying he needs to play will be saying we are overusing him.

2438~~~
Nowadays kids start to train semi-professional at a very young age. Adnan joined Anderlech at the age of 10. By 16-19 those players know all the basics. Once they are past puberty they need 1-2 more years to develop the right physicality and they are good to go. After this point talents will stagnate if you don’t use them in the first league. Sure, you can bench him for another 1-2 years, but he´ll never make the next step. You just delay the issue. If you don’t trust him now, you wont trust him after two more years on the bench and he´ll need the same time to adjust to professional football. I know that its very hard for top clubs to give young players time on the pitch. It usually happens, when there are not alternatives, so managers are forced to integrate youngsters. LvG has to decide if he can use Januzaj on a weekly basis or if that is not possible. I don’t hold it against him, if he cant do that, but its a huge mistake to keep him on our bench. There are many decent clubs who would love to take him on a loan for a year.

Physically he´ll be just fine to play once a week, if he is not injured. That is not a problem at all. If a player cant do that he will struggle to become a professional footballer anyway. Obviously you shouldn’t expect, that a talent is carrying a dysfunctional team on his own. If you put this psychological pressure on him, you might swamp him. Its the job of the manager to make sure, that this isn’t going to happen.

2439~~~
Too much over thinking. People are complicating an issue which will sort itself out over time like the development of any young player.

2440~~~
the Albanian Steve McManaman is still on track

2441~~~
He provided a few good balls, but nothing great. That for me hardly makes up leaving our left side defensively open as he was playing as a wing back. If we go back to playing with proper wide attacking players, then he should be getting a shot out there, but he can't play as a wing back in my mind. Right now he isn't providing enough threat to warrant his lack of defensive ability in that position.

2442~~~
Blame van Gaal for that, not Januzaj. He is the furthest thing from a defensive player, I thought he worked hard defensively knowing he was up against it and going to struggle at that end of the field.

2443~~~
He runs himself into traffic way too often. Watch Eriksen; similar build and style; opens up space, plays the pass early and doesn't dribble for dribbling's sake. Gets all the benefit out of the dribble in the opening few strides, whereas Januzaj wants to keep going or hasn't fully beaten his man at first.

Essentially Januzaj cuts off his angles and options while dribbling, so despite his passing being great for his age, he's working at a severe disadvantage compared to players like Silva, Hazard, Eriksen and Di Maria, who open the pitch up and created channels for the players around to run into.

This is the reason I'm not sure about Januzaj through the centre yet (even if Rooney, Mata and Di Maria weren't there), though he's more suited to it than the wing. He runs to one side or the other, like a swimmer who can't stay in lane. So even centrally he will box himself and hand advantage to the defensive midfield.

2444~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93464, @luckyspurs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93464/">@luckyspurs</a> I would not compare Eriksen to Januzaj, they are very different players. We can debate all day where Januzaj's future position is but he plays the game different to Eriksen. His game at this stage is about running, taking on players and getting past his man. For that reason, I think he is a natural wide player and should remain there.

2445~~~
I agree with this. As a 19 year old winger/creative player he should come on and play without fear. Add a new dimension to the team. But he plays like the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He would be an excellent option off the bench if he could become a real impact player. He has the talent but maybe not the mentality.

2446~~~
I think we should calm talk about his mentality, he is still very young, players are allowed patches of not so good form, it shouldn't come down to not being mentally tough enough right now.

2447~~~
Probably just the second season syndrome plus abit oflast season's heroics getting to his head. He'll be ok in the long run.

2448~~~
I agree that falls on LVG. Adnan shouldn't be played in that role is what I was trying to say. I could accept his defensive liabilities if he was looking a constant threat going forward. But currently he hasn't looked good enough right now to make up for it. He should be played as a pure attacking player or not at all.

2449~~~
Yeah he really isnt suited to the wingback role, i agree.

2450~~~
He needs to improve his decision making and learn not to over complicate things.

2451~~~
But surely that improvement will only come once he has a run of games? How can you possibly work on improving a skill when you don't get a chance to practise? So I think the best thing for him would be a loan spell

2452~~~
I think you are right, unfortunately for Adnan this season is all about getting into the CL. We have had terrible injuries and a smaller squad so cannot afford to nurse him through the season. Next season there will be more games and a bigger squad, so more rotation for the manager to be able to pick and choose when he plays so any bad decision making might not cost us the same.

2453~~~
I don't really buy that, especially when you consider how confident he looked last season. He's just going through a rough patch, and his confidence has probably suffered as a result. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with his mentality.

2454~~~
Exactly. He's only 19 years old. If he hasn't kicked on by the time he is 22 or 23, then perhaps we should then be worried.

2455~~~
Will be interesting to see how he fairs against Yeovil

2456~~~
Maybe that's because he's been played on the wing almost exclusively since he came into the first team. He's forced to use try and take on the defender constantly because he's on the wing. He absolutely has the vision and technique to play at number 10.

2457~~~
No doubting he has the ability to play central but there we also have Rooney, Mata, Di Maria, Herrera etc.

Januzaj can offer us more out wide in my opinion.

2458~~~
Not in the team. He really can't be impressing too much in training. He needs a premier league loan.

2459~~~
If Anderson gets on ahead of him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2460~~~
No thanks. Not now. 
A loan has to be at the start of the season, in my opinion.

2461~~~
I don't get it, he won't loan him out but he won't play him either. It makes me think that he's only here as cover in case of another injury crisis. Frustrating.

2462~~~
This season has been one big injury crisis and he hasn't been getting any game time. 

I think it's as simple as LVG sees him as a winger (not a wing back) and so he has no place in the 352. Hopefully the fact he's keeping him around is because we're going to see the return of wingers in the second half of the season.

2463~~~
It can't go any worse than sitting on the bench constantly.

2464~~~
He can't even get a game vs Yeovil in the fa cup. He's not been good, but the kid needs game time to play himself into form. It's understandable that he can't do that in the PL because top 4 is a must this season. The FA Cup though? It wouldn't hurt to give him playing time.

2465~~~
Can't believe he can't get a game over Wilson, who looks unready/unable.

2466~~~
While I thought he was a shoe in for the game beforehand, having watched it play out, I think van Gaal made the right call by not playing him.

Only in Angel Di Maria's substitution did the game open up to allow a dribbler to work some magic. Before that it would have been a tough ask for Adnan to a) adapt to the physical battles and b) prosper amongst them or find space to work.

Simply when it came down to it, Angel was always going to get the nod over Adnan for the sub. Read into it whatever you want, loan possibility perhaps but I felt today was the correct judgment call as opposed to him being "dropped" / "excluded".

2467~~~
He can play out wide, but playing out wide is different under Gaal. Gaal likes his wide men to keep the width where as Januzaj was allowed more freedom under Moyes and Wilmots.

2468~~~
How damaging could this season be for his development if this season continues like this with little gametime?

2469~~~
I really hope not <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

But it's disheartening to see IMO. He was our best player last season (arguably), yet for one reading or another, he can't get a game this season. He's still very much young enough for it not to affect him.

I hope it's not a attitude problem or a lack of application in training on Adnan's part. One things for sure though, when he has had chances this season (still not as many as other underperforming players), he's regressed a bit. Especially with his decision making and execution. He's been a tad selfish - maybe he has a need to prove himself etc. 

I'm sure if we move towards a system using wingers, he'll get his chance. We do miss his creativity - especially when AdM isn't available for selection.

2470~~~
He needs to understand that he can't do it all by himself, it's okay not trying to nutmeg 3 players by himself and instead pass the ball to a teammate. I been frustrated with his selfishness when he has been on the pitch, like LvG says he should just "let it fly".

2471~~~
Jeez. The guy never plays, and the best you can do is complain about him?

2472~~~
Should everyone in this thread moan about him not playing or what are you suggesting?

2473~~~
Is it me or has he looked half the player since he signed his new contract?

2474~~~
A shame we were shite and he couldn't get minutes. Or a shame he didn't start in the first place, thought he'd be a shoe in for this game. I honestly think he probably just has a shit attitude in training and is all moping around and that's why he isn't getting many minutes. Has way more talent then Wilson IMO, though Wilson has loads of potential as well, but Wilson gets a lot more games probably because he works harder in training.

2475~~~
No. And it's a case with a lot of youngsters. Get a big fat contract and they turn big headed. 

He needs to go out on loan.

2476~~~
Like Sterling, his second season has been less than stellar. Shock and horror, that.

2477~~~
he should be playing over wilson in the front 2 or push rooney up with him deeper. but if hes not showing it to lvg in training thats his own fault.

2478~~~
I doubt Adnan can play the role that LVG wants Wilson to play up front. From memory Adnan struggled when he was forced to play as a striker. His best games for me have come from out wide or deep. Where he has had space in front of him to run and move into. So replacing Wilson with Adnan shouldn't happen in my opinion. The same as an actual CM as well, Adnan struggled in the couple of games he was chucked there. He really needs to be given a free roaming type attacking role (preferrably wider) to get the most out of him. Basically the sort of role Mata plays for us a lot of the time. But we have a stack of players who based on this season deserve to be played over him in that role. For whatever reason, he has simply failed to impress in the chances he has been given this season.

2479~~~
Say for example we're playing a 442 diamond we like to use with our best 11 present which normally has rooney as the CAM behind the strikers, mata or di maria alongside carrick/blind and hererra or fellaini, now falcao or rvp comes off after 65 mins, now the choice becomes bring on wilson as a like for like, or you move rooney up top and bring januzaj into the attacking midfield in the free'er role. this is purely based on my opinion that januzaj is a better player than wilson currently as well as having a higher ceiling all things being equal. hope that makes my view a bit clearer.

2480~~~
Sterling's second season was one of the best by a teenager in the history of football. Even the fast half of it when he was getting muscled off the ball too much, he looked lively (just too small to really take control of games). Took him mere months to work on that though.

2481~~~
Sophomore slump, like clockwork.  I recommend we take it easy on the boy.

2482~~~
LvG doesn't rate him. True story.

2483~~~
Wasn't a big fan of it but I now see no other alternative other than for him to go on loan.

LVG has fecked it up with Januzaj, no two ways about it. For all his reputation of handling young players, he might well have ruined our best one.

2484~~~
Adnan plays - he's terrible, he isnt that good, loan him out, whats the hype about him about

Adnan doesnt play - LVG doesnt rate him, he ruined him, he'll be gone this summer.

2485~~~
3-5-2 doesn't suits him very much. 

He can't play left wing back, he's not good enough to play 10 because of the competition and can't play striker too.

I'd rather have him in our team if Van Gaal finaly play in 4-3-3. I'm sure that he can develop in a very very good footballer, but he's not in a very good period now, but I found him pretty good when he came against Stoke

2486~~~
So much for "he'll play during the festive period". I thought he would start or at least come on today. I hope he goes out on loan and gets some regular first team football.

2487~~~
Are people really suggesting van Gaal has ruined Januzaj's career? fecking hell.

2488~~~
He was ill.

2489~~~
Not sure what happens behind the scenes in training, but given our 3-5-2 formation, I can't really imagine him playing as a wing back, or ahead of our strikers at the moment.

2490~~~
Van Gaal hasn't mucked anything up.

This was his last season with Bayern in 2010/11 and the players' ages at the time.

___Ribery 27_________Gomez 25___________<b>Muller 21</b>_______
________Schweinsteiger 26__Tymoshchuk 31__<b>Kroos 21</b>_______
___Pranjic 29___Van Buyten 32___<b>Badstuber 21</b>___Lahm 27___
________________________Butt 36_________________________

Kroos and Muller both better defensive players than Januzaj even at that age. Kroos already had amazing ball retention and 5 goals/assists and Muller had 23 goals/assists that season and lost the ball a similar amount to Januzaj does, just further up the pitch.

Van Gaal needs midfielders who can tackle, because Mata and Di Maria are often in the team and neither are great at it. He needs players who can retain possession, or else are so prolific infront of goal that they're difficult to ignore. Or he needs things the other players in his team lack, like pace upfront.

He isn't there to pick the team for the future, he's there to win. You don't pick Pranjic, Tymoshchuk and Van Buyten to build for the future, but to win pragmatically in the here and now. Muller, Kroos and Badstuber earned their spots, they weren't projects.

2491~~~
People are going completely over the top with the Januzaj thing. Van Gaal ruining him etc. Ludicrous. We're playing a system that simply doesn't suit him. And when he has had chances this season, he has not played well. So why does he deserve to start? He doesn't, simple.

2492~~~
He was injured when the fixture was more congested and his chances of playing were higher, unfortunately. Also when he got his chances he was pretty poor, so he needs to be patient and wait for his chance again.

2493~~~
Does this have any relevance to what I posted? 

Fact is after a superb opening season at the club, Januzaj has declined this season and we continue to stick with a formation that's both shit and does not suit one of our most promising players.

2494~~~
The relevance being Van Gaal picks young players who bring things he wants to the team, he's not about advancing their careers to his own detriment. They have to retain the ball, provide defence or score/create goals. 

Muller's was miles better at scoring/creating and Kroos as good as Januzaj. Kroos though fantastic at not giving away the ball, while Badstuber a really competent defender. 

Van Gaal hasn't let him down at all. Januzaj's the same as he was last year, but defences have found out tricks to stop him and he hasn't learned enough new ones to overcome that. Van Gaal doesn't owe it to anybody to pick a player with 4 goals to his name who can't defend or keep hold of the ball yet. His entire system is based on keeping control of games and those are two fantastic ways of losing control, as Stoke reminded all of us.

2495~~~
I understand that and you are right at the moment he doesn't deserve to start. But this isn't a 28 year old who is not playing well and doesn't suit the system. 

This is one of the best young talents in the world who could develop into one of the best. This is a key phase of his development and he needs game time or he's going to stagnate. With regards to his playing time, it has been limited and mostly of the bench. LvG will try to appease him by bringing him on at LWB but we all know he's not going to be effective there. LvG needs to make a decision, either change system which I believe would benefit the whole team not just Januzaj or loan the kid out because he needs to be playing football.

2496~~~
For all of that, I think he's been unlucky. Yesterday is a prime example. Yeah, I would have probably started him. But the plan was, I imagine, to give him minutes in the second half. Once we had injuries we were left with Di Maria as our last sub and getting him match fit is infinitely more important right now. That sort of thing has happened a few times, where we've had injuries, or been playing poorly and as such bringing him on wouldn't have made much sense.

2497~~~
The bit in bold is just not true, not even close. There's plenty of revisionism going on with regards to Januzaj last season.

At the moment LVG's team selections are very questionable. We've had 2 games in the entire season where he could say we've played well throughout the 90 minutes. He keeps sticking with this crap 3-5-2 garbage with a number of players out of position and our best young player n the bench. If LVG's syetem is based on control, then he's done quite a pathetic job of implementing the same so far.

2498~~~
Januzaj last season was useful in a free role and full of promise, but not even close to good enough from a practical point of view. 

Chances created and possession lost for every 10 successful dribbles.

2013-14
Januzaj - created 6, lost 11

2014-15
Sterling - created 7, lost 6
Bojan - created 7, lost 9
Hazard - created 6, lost 6
Mahrez - created 6, lost 6
Bolasie - created 5, lost 6
Moses - created 5, lost 6
Oxlade-Chamberlain - created 5, lost 3

You can't be losing the ball twice as often as guys like Bolasie, Moses and Mahrez, while creating similar amount of chances.

Oxlade-Chamberlain would probably get in this United team, because like Kroos, you can trust him to not get caught in possession.

That's too much for Van Gaal to cope with; playing Rooney, Mata, Van Persie and Falcao.

Carrick is brilliant but he isn't superman. It needs players like Rooney and Mata retaining the ball whilst they pose a scoring threat.

You wouldn't demand Zaha to play so you can't Januzaj. He loses the ball nearly twice for every chance he creates.

2499~~~
Yesterday was also a great example of the foolishness of perennial complaints every time we start a weakened team when we're playing inferior opposition a few days before a really big game. Lost track of the amount of times we start a weakened team and people say the manager should have started with a strong XI, then subbed people off after we get a comfortable lead. Yesterday was a great example of that. The XI we started should have been far too strong for Yeovil but shit happens in football and we ended up being forced to play a number of our best XI for the full 90. No biggy, as we've got a decent break between games but would have been a disaster if we had a Tuesday night CL fixture.

2500~~~
All very good but he's not a winger and doesn't have the pace to play there. He can skip by he full backs occassionally but too often the full backs can recover because he doesn't have the pace to get away. Prime example being the Southampton game aganst SHaw. His ability to drive forward is utilized a lot better through the middle.

This season, he spent the game against WBA playng almost like a touchline winger which reduced his effectiveness and made him very predictable. The very next game he was our best attacking player against Chelsea and played a great through ball for RVP. Got taken off aganst CIty after Smalling was sent off and was average against Palace. Don't think he's started a game since then. The other games he's barely had any time to make an impact.

The fact that you're comparing Zaha to Januzaj says it all. Januzaj is level or three above Zaha. There's no reason why Januzaj can't start ahead of Falcao. Not like either of them are pulling up any trees. RVP up top with Januzaj and Mata beind him sounds good to me. Added creativity and dynamism.

Right now, we need to loan him out. He needs to play games and Van Gaal clearly does not rate him.

2501~~~
I wouldn't play Januzaj up top based on the erractic finishing we have seen from him this very season.
Whilst I think hes a great talent, his decision making and rashness at times in key positions needs to improve, too many times hes had the ball in great positions only to blaze the ball over from an impossible angle.

2502~~~
I didn't say up top. Play him behind RVP. His finishing and composure will not improve looking on from the bench.

2503~~~
At the expense of Mata? Di Maira? Or Rooney when we're trying to get back into title contention?
I want him to play more too, but when he gets his chances on the pitch he needs to show alot more than he has so far.
The only game I actually thought he did well in was Chelsea.

2504~~~
Chances created is such a bad stat as is key passes. Januzaj did lose the ball a lot last season, but he still dribbled past players and picked up a lot of fouls from his dribbling (which don't count as dribbles despite getting past a defender). He was a better passer last season than Sterling. He was a better crosser, better at cross field balls, and actually did more through balls per minute on the pitch. That was evident. Sterling was the better dribbler though, and had more end product. His ability to do a through ball progressed towards the last part of the season and some of those passes were really impressive. Though both players were better last season compared to this, Sterling has still been good while Januzaj hasn't. Sterling is clearly ahead of Januzaj at the moment and was last season.

Januzaj was inconsistent last season, but some of his performances were extremely impressive. The home Newcastle match in particular was one of my favorites, though it's too bad there is no touch compilation of that performance anymore.

The talent is there, he just needs to get minutes and fans need to show patience.

2505~~~
Falcao.

Let's be fair here. He's had 4 starts this season and in one of them he had to be taken off early due to a red. That's nowhere near enough time to pass any judgement especially in a young player who looked so promising last year.

2506~~~
Don't get me wrong I am not judging him. I actually just don't see that he warrants starting games. I would have started him in the FA Cup game though, but apparently he only just back to being fit after being ill.

Its a bit like Falcao when he was out many people crying and wanting him to play more, I'm sure when hes fit and we don't struggle in games he'll get minutes (off the bench) and if he does well he'll get more.

2507~~~
That's true enough but how is he going to prove his talent if all he's given is a few minutes playing completely out of position?

2508~~~
Unfortunately thats life, also he isn't really playing completely out of positions I.E playing out wide isn't completely out of position for him, given he played there quite a bit last season too. I know its not his best position but you need to take your chances when you get them.

2509~~~
I was talking more about the Stoke game. Even when he's come on, he's invariably come on when we've had no control of games. A bit like Wilson in fact.

2510~~~
Januzaj was sensational when he first exploded onto the scene, but then he was rested (and got a nice new contract) and he's not been the same since.
At the backend of last season, he was all dribbling and no end product.
Teams learnt how to deal with him, and he's been ineffective since.

And this season, whenever he's been on, it's all dribbling and no end product.
He's more keen on dribbling past players but then he doesn't deliver the cross that's needed.
More often than not, I get frustrated when he's got the ball because he'll run it into a crowd when there's others opened ready for a easy shot.

It's like Ronaldo when he first joined (tho Ronaldo was better).
Unfortunately for Januzaj, our current squad is actually stronger and he doesn't have the luxury of playing weekly to 'get it right'.

2511~~~
I agree, but saying that if he wants to break back into the team, its in exactly these kind of scenarios he needs to do more to take his chances and make an impact.
I think this season he is a bit too passive when it comes to taking players on, that is just an observation but he seems to wait far too long when he is one on one with a defender, seems to lack a bit of confidence in that aspect of his game, but I'm sure it'll come back.

I realise what I am saying above in terms of him coming on and making an impact seems harsh, but unless he wants to wait for less important games when he can get starts (which this season because we are so far behing the leaders there wont be many) then he has to try and force his way into the team, which means he has to be very positive in his play when he comes on the pitch. Thats actually what made him so good last season, when he was good that is, is that he was confident and positive in his play.

EDIT: The alternative is to give him a run in the team regardless of his form, which may be an option but then when we are fighting quite a bit this season do we take that risk and leave one of Di Maria Mata Rooney etc on the bench for him?

2512~~~
Think if LVG is going to pursue with 3-5-2 he should be loaned. 

If he considers 4-4-2 especially as injuries continue then Januzaj has an option as a winger, but he's not getting enough games, if he could find himself some games at a prem side which has limited squad numbers but are playing alright football then this would work. Southampton could be an option they play Tadic left side who doesnt always perform and never lasts 90 mins. With Mane injured they could do with someone behind Pelle too. 

Southampton may be a bit optimistic given their current form, but there's a few sides in the prem where he'd get games which surely has to be better than potentially getting 5+ cameo 20 min performances between now and end of the season.

2513~~~
If they're giving minutes to a youngster, think they'd rather do it for Ward-Prowse than Januzaj. He's been really good. They've also played Isgrove, Gape, Reed and Hesketh, so I doubt they'd want to bring along a slightly out of form United youngster when it's working for them with their own.

Infact it's really hard to find a Premier League team that can afford such a loose winger. Leicester for example wouldn't replace Mahrez or Schlupp with him.

QPR's wingers are abysmal, but I'm not sure they play great football.

Still think Holland is the best destination. Attacking formations, lots of goals, even guys like Atsu and Altidore wracked up great numbers.

2514~~~
You don't play a formation just to suit a 19 year old who's barely played one proper season of football. Playing him ahead of Mata or Falcao is just nonsense.

2515~~~
I never suggested otherwise. But you also don't play a formation that suits precisely no one in the squad and full of players out of position.

Falcao has been poor. He might have been good once upon a time, but he's not done much so far.

2516~~~
Not a huge fan of 3-5-2 but. 

3-5-2 suits Rojo, Smalling and Jones since it helps Rojo and Jones take a few more risks out towards the wing without leaving their centre back partner in trouble, while giving Smalling passing options. 
It's not bad for Carrick and Rooney, because they're 2 on 2 in midfield but with more protection in behind. 
Shaw and Rafael get to be the attacking full backs they want to be. 
It suits Mata or Di Maria in behind the strikers because it gives them two goal scorers to pass into, with the less likelihood of them being marked out of the game.  
It suits Falcao and Van Persie because it gets them both on the pitch. 

Only person it doesn't favour is Januzaj and possibly Herrera.

2517~~~
Understand your point but if he cant get in those teams he's not going to make it here lets be honest. Loan or not he should be able to get into those sides. I think Saints have already made there move for a winger/forward with Elia coming in. 

Holland wouldnt be a bad move I think I'd just prefer the prem as that's where hopefully he'll apply his trade for utd and therefore you get more of a gauge if they cant actually make it in this league.

2518~~~
It suits no one really which explains why we end up playing shit and turgid football. Rojo and Jones aren't good enough and both specialize in running the ball straight into the opposition. Di Maria has been average since we changed into a back 3 actually. He was very good in the diamond. Rooney did very well in the diamond as well. The 3-5-2 involves wasting his ability by playing him deeper.

2519~~~
After the cringefest the club made over him being our "new number 11" during the summer, it was almost inevitable that this season was gonna turn out like has for him.

On a side note, he looks a bit like a member of Jedward <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2520~~~
What cringefest?

2521~~~
The big hoo haw on social media by the club.

2522~~~
Hardly a 'cringefest'.

2523~~~
Roles reversed....Gerrard leaves Liverpool in the summer, the club e-mail people and post statuses on social media about a "big announcement" ....Cut to their FB page and the big announcement is that Henderson is their number 8....The post is accompanied with a picture of the number 8 shirt hung in their dimly lit dressing room, with a spotlight on the jersey.

The RAWK thread on here would explode.

It was quite cringy

2524~~~
The dressing room thing, was for all the new players, right ?
And if i'm not mistaken the club communicated about Januzaj new number because of the fans who wanted to purchase a Januzaj's Shirt.

2525~~~
Doesn't sound like a cringefest to me, sounds like an announcement. Pure hyperbole on your part.

2526~~~
No it was for Januzaj....I'd log onto FB and find it and post it here but, not arsed

2527~~~
Yeah right OK. 

So, if Liverpool do this in the summer, I trust you won't be laughing your bollix off, saying "Awh typical dippers"

2528~~~
Yeah, I won't be.

'Cringefest', what a load of shit.

2529~~~
Load of shit? Coming from you?! 

Right OK....I'm out

2530~~~
Good.

2531~~~
Can he not do a job in the middle for us as opposed to out wide? He has the physical attributes to play there and surely enough technical ability to adapt if given a chance.

2532~~~
It was like that ?

2533~~~
Yeah, except all the other shirts were darkened out and Januzaj's was in the middle, all lit up. 
Sorry but, it was strange and cringy to me...

The "big announcement" and all this build up to it was alien to me. It's a shirt number! Contrast this to when Ronaldo got the number 7 jersey.

2534~~~
That's what i thought it's a Nike ad, probably also pushed by Chevrolet.

2535~~~
First LVG has ruined his career and now he clearly doesn't rate him? You do seem to enjoy peddling the doomsday prophecies, eh? And I'd say there is a pretty good reason why Januzaj can't start ahead of Falcao, and that is that he just isn't as good as him at the moment (and let's not forget Januzaj's rather forgetful displays during that run of games he got a few months back.) 

I still think he has a good future ahead of him, but he's clearly suffering through the not-uncommon phenomenon known as the sophomore slump. I'm not sure that you can put the blame for that on LVG's shoulders, any more than you could Falcao's struggle to hit the back of the net or the inability of Evans to recover his confidence.

2536~~~
FFS... How LvG's ruined Januzaj ?LvG 's tried him in many positions, not working so far that's for sure but it's somehow all LvG's fault not Januzaj himself ?? He had one good season but if people think a 19 year old kid could just walk into this team, you seriously need to get your head checked.

2537~~~
Maybe Moyesy will come looking for a loan deal...

We need to start playing him and having him start games, but it's also up to him to perform and play at a high level. LVG have him plently of chances during the beginning of the season in which he started about 5/6 games in a row but wasn't pulling his weight.

He's only 19 and a brilliant talent, I really want to see him develop into a world class player and I'm sure LVG has big plans for him, he needs to start performing at the level we know he's capable of, (Sunderland away 2013), (Newcastle away 2014) (Swansea Home 2014) for example.

2539~~~
You're misremembering here, his first run wasn't until end of October and he started 4 in a row with the latter two not even anywhere near full games. 

He's not had the chance to play himself into form, he's young he can't be expected to always show consistency. 

Can anyone actually see a place for him in LvGs preferred system? I have the same concerns with Lingard, they'll need to go out on loan and hope there's a place for width next season.

2540~~~
Yeah we shouldn't expect him to be consistent every game but I definitely want him to show his best form more often because he's capable of some very special things.

Yeah but Lingard was picked by LVG before his injury so he must have been impressing, really want some of our good youth players to get runs in the team now that we are getting more settled, Lingard is a very good player and I'm sure he will get more games when he's fit again.

2541~~~
Most likely why he was left out. Probably not in the right frame of mind.

2542~~~
Had a Emoji of a broken heart as the text.

2543~~~
i can't see what you posted, but if it's his instagram account then yes that's probably why. he posted two photos in the last day of his mate, so that's probably why he was omitted.

2544~~~
We are not doing him any favors. Destroying the kids confidence. 

Either send him on loan, or better change the god awful formation to 4231 and play him on the left.

2545~~~
Think his exclusion yesterday had more to do with losing a friend then LvG not rating him. To be fair, I would probably not be in the right frame of mind either.

2546~~~
I don't believe in the loan system. I have absolutely no faith in it. To be fair, the U21's is really poor at the moment as well so there aren't many options but I just don't think loaning players works.

What kind of success have we had with loaning players in the past? I honestly can't think of any success stories. It looked like it could have worked for Evans and Cleverley at the time, but it didn't. Beckham made 5 appearances for Preston, wouldn't even count that.

If Januzaj goes abroad, he'll learn nothing. Everything is different. The pace of the game, the physicality, the tactics. If he joins a Premier League team, he'll only end up at a side who are in a relegation battle, playing with a completely different mentality than we would be. It could break him into the Prem a bit, but has it really worked in the past? 

My only hope for Januzaj is that LvG switches up to a 4-3-3 formation next season when he gets the players he wants and then he can continue his development here.

2547~~~
He'l never get games in the 3-5-2. I dont see us moving to a 4-3-3 this season so his best hope is that we atleast move to a diamond where he can be employed in the middle 3.

2548~~~
United play best using 4-4-2 with 2 wingers and 2 strikers. Its a proven formulae for us.

2549~~~
Wary of the source but worrying all the same. Watch him turn into a star somewhere else now. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2550~~~
Should just be loaned out, not sure why we haven't sent him somewhere already to be honest.

2551~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/manchester-united-determined-to-keep-david-de-gea-from-clutches-of-real-madrid--despite-victor-valdes-move-9963375.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ian Herbert</a> said the same earlier this month, with PSG mentioned as possible suitors.

2552~~~
Feck off are we selling him, he's going to be a brilliant player. Absolutely pathetic if he is let go.

2553~~~
He won't be sold, Giggs wouldn't allow it.

2554~~~
Surely just a loan deal? We would be absolutely insane to let him go permanently.

2555~~~
I'd be absolutely pissed if van Gaal even thought about selling him, I'd have van Gaal sacked for even mentioning it.

2556~~~
Still don't see the sheer panic that so many people have over him not playing. Yes, it would be better if he was but he has featured this season, not many 19 year olds make 10 appearances (I'm guessing he is around that so far) a season for United, he has made that in a half a season.

He still has plenty of time. Not playing 30 games a season isn't going to ruin his career. I know we are all scarred from the Pogba case but from the outlook, this isn't the same situation.

2557~~~
LVG can leave before Januzaj, as ridiculous as it sounds. 

As someone else said, surely Giggs wouldn't allow it. But everything everyone else has said suggests he has a great attitude...

2558~~~
I'd be worried if that was the case. You go from giving him Giggs' shirt to binning him inside of five or six months? Bit of a mess.

Maybe his attitude is poor, but you'd think a loan would be the wisest option.

Club is in a weird auld state it has to be said

2559~~~
What does the sun article say anyway? Bloody pay wall.

2560~~~
As much as I agree with the thinking behind what you have said. No decision is made by Giggs. The club, the directors and the manager will decide on a players future, not Giggs.

Sure they might seek advice on a few things from Giggs but if van Gaal didn't want him (which I'm positive is rubbish), nothing Giggs will want or say will impact on van Gaal's decision.

2561~~~
Would we really be surprised? It'd just be the latest in utterly mindless decisions over the last couple of years.

2562~~~
Giggs surely has some control, and I'd imagine he'd see to it Januzaj isn't sold. We were criticized last summer for losing our identity, and it'd be hard to disagree with that sentiment should we sell Januzaj to be honest. 

Still don't see it happening, he's one of the few players we possess you feel can produce a moment of magic at any given time. The current system does not suit him, but I'm hoping we'll see a more familiar shape implemented once a competent defence is acquired.

2563~~~
Really sad how this kid isnt getting a chance, him and now di maria are our only players who have the balls to take on players, I remember in that dour last season, there where a few times when Januzaj would beat his man with pace or dribbling, and then beat a second, was some exciting stuff to watch

Now its like he doesnt exist

2564~~~
LVG comes in, buys a bunch of overrated stars, sells two of our best homegrown players, fails to get top4 and gets sacked at the end of the season <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2565~~~
Both Welbeck and Keane could have been useful for us this season, instead we decided to sell them. And now reports (though unconfirmed) on Januzaj leaving. 

Sounds about right for a "Post Sir Alex Manchester United".

2566~~~
No chance will he be sold, none at all. We aren't complete idiots.

2567~~~
but a lot of LvG's decisions have been quite questionable. And I don't think Giggs is a good judge of talent, other than the glaringly obvious

2568~~~
Go on, please tell me your reasoning behind this?

2569~~~
There os a very negative perception on the Caf about Giggs in general, may I know why?

2570~~~
it is based on the very sound bites i have heard from him, as well as the stupid video they did when he was the manager.
also i would think he was involved in our decisions to get rid/loan Nani, Welbeck

so nothing really solid to go on, just a hunch

2571~~~
In our next cup game I'd live to see him playing behind Rooney as number 10 but likely won't happen.

2572~~~
If Januzaj is lucky, he'll come on for the final 10 minutes and play as a wing back or maybe it will be as a CM this time.

2573~~~
Silky touch, good dribble, excellent vision and creative passing means you should be a number 10. Adnan has all of that. In England you need that explosive speed and power to be winger and Adnan doesn't have that. 

Maybe the coaching staff doesn't want to give him too much responsibility at such a young age hence playing him on the wing.

2574~~~
We don't play with wingers and Adnan is behind Rooney and Mata for the #10 position. He isn't a wingback either so he just doesn't fit in the team right now. I've had no problems with the players LvG has sold because ultimately they just weren't good enough as form at their new clubs has shown. But I'd be extremely disappointed in we actually sold Januzaj. He was wanted by a host of top clubs for a reason. No doubt he'll be a top player eventually. Have a bad feeling that it won't be at Old Trafford.

2575~~~
LVG has said he's our player and he's not going anywhere.Not sure why we should take words from those tabloids more serious than his.

2576~~~
He needs a run of games. He could inject some much needed pace.

2577~~~
Would be mighty ironic if the manager most famed for "juice", gets one of United's best youngsters in years sold under his nose.

2578~~~
I’d be gutted if we can’t keep him. He’s only 19 and proved last year that he could play a part in a team if well surrounded. This year I thought he was good before his confidence felt. LVG seems not be impressed with him, but I think that it will be a mistake selling him this summer.

I want to keep him, LVG should give him a run of game

2579~~~
Firstly I don't think LvG would sell him. That said, however, I am concerned about the way he's been handled this season. A loan with Moyes might not be the worst thing in the world.

2580~~~
Where and how would they have played? Welbeck would have just about fumbled with the ball while Keane has regressed badly since his injury.

As far as Adnan is concerned, don't think we would really sell him or send him on loan. It's just that there are too many players about in the attacking front, and of course you would want to play them instead of Adnan, given that he has been so inconsistent this season.

2581~~~
Both Neville bros. rate him highly.

I am sure Giggs does too. But Van Gaal is strange and let's players decide IIRC.

2582~~~
WOODWARD should just overrule LVG if he wants to sell and loan him.

He is on 5 year contract. Makes no sense from club perspective to sell.

2583~~~
When did he say this?

2584~~~
Just a query, do you think LVG was expecting, or led to expect better from him?

His reputation grew and flourished so quickly that it was the clear beacon of hope in a very turgid and disastrous season. Could this have led to his demise by being naturally inflated above his actual level? Sterling suffered a similar 2nd season experience. Bale took time to reassert himself after a 50 match no-winning streak at Spurs. Countless other experiences of players suffering dips.

Sunderland away match and West Ham at home were the only 2 matches in which his goals had a direct impact on the results. His other league goal came at the end of a drubbing vs Newcastle. While there would have been hugely promising moments along the way in other matches, the reputation he developed was so high that he was <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/2014/01/20/adnan-januzaj-the-man-to-save-man-united-and-david-moyes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seen as our saviour and the man to stop Moyes facing the sack</a>. Clearly too much, too soon in hindsight.

Just wondering what your thoughts are lads on this - is the boom reputation from a terrible season the enemy here?

2585~~~
you can say the same about taking what managers say as 100% true

2586~~~
If this is true then I'm really not liking our transfer business in the January window. He's one of our only wingers with decent pace and invention. Yes he hasn't been great this season but he should have had more games and if we're going to play a 4-3-3 surely we need him? I for one hope this is false it will be a shame to see him go on loan even though it could benefit him.

2587~~~
Januzaj is not fast - lets dispel that myth.
He has decent acceleration in the first 3 yards which helps, but he's not a quick player, so he's not really suited to playing on the wing.
A loan for the 2nd half of the season would be a good thing for him imo - needs to be playing games.

2588~~~
No point in Woodward blocking a loan move. If the manager isn't going to play him, it's best for his development if he goes on loan and gets regular games. I originally hoped he would stay and play but he isn't really playing and he'll end up stagnating at a crucial stage of his development where he should be kicking on. He has real ability.

2589~~~
The problem here is that, at the moment, the formations we play don't really allow for him. Not without dropping either a mainstay of the team or a very expensive player like Mata.

2590~~~
##10

2591~~~
Looks like LVG sees him more as a winger. It's unfortunate for him that we didn't use wingers much this season, because whenever we did he started. 

Maybe vs QPR if RVP is out we might do it, but we all know it's gonna be 352 again...

2592~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/forgotten-man-januzaj-enduring-season-8439468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/forgotten-man-januzaj-enduring-season-8439468</a>

2593~~~
We could easily incorporate him in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3, just play rooney up top on his own. We'd be much better off for it I think. Di maria, rooney, januzaj/mata up top, herrera/mata, Carrick, blind in midfield. Rotate the striker with rooney/rvp and rooney can push back in midfield too depending on form and injuries. Hopefully we switch to a formation like that so we can use him, as the 35-2 is shite regardless.

2594~~~
Yeah that's what i meant. Woody should block permanent move and loan him.

2595~~~
If we somehow revert back to 4 at the back we'll need him as our only other winger who can take people on, so as not to be completely reliant on a diamond system. Would love to see him and di Maria on the wings with 3 actual midfielders (Herrera, Blind and Carrick) with a sole striker in the striker position.

2596~~~
The problem is that he's not really a winger either, or at least not in the way Gaal likes his wingers to perform. Januzaj needs freedom to go inside. Asking him to just dribble past players is just asking for trouble, because that's not his game. He only really started to dribble a lot last season anyways.

Personally, I find it a bit weird to see Januzaj just stand out wide waiting for the ball to come to him. I was always so used to him going towards the ball and just floating all over the pitch. I'm sure anyone that watched him at youth level would agree with me.

2597~~~
I can see why van Gaal doesn't like him with the way we currently play. It's all about possession, playing the safe pass and patiently building our play up for a chance. That's not Januzaj's style and it isn't di Maria's either.

2598~~~
Edited

2599~~~
Want him to succeed here badly without spending tens of millions on players but we have to prepare for the worst, too.

He needs games like every other footballer. Loan sounds like a logical thing to do but after he rejected supposedly massive offer from Ligue 1, it's hard not to appreciate his desire and loyalty in such young age.

Just another hard decision to make for new boss.

2600~~~
Loan him to Everton to get Coleman, or PSG Marquinhos, everyone's a winner.

2601~~~
There shouldn't be a hard decision if van Gaal has a reputation of developing young talent and giving them a fair chance. We don't have a more talented youngster than him right now.

2602~~~
Frankly, LVG would struggle to survive the backlash from the fans if he sold Januzaj.

2603~~~
Exactly. He can put up with it from one player, but not two. Especially when he's already overworking Carrick and Rooney to begin with.

2604~~~
I was indifferent to his sale, but right now I rather saw Welbeck fumble the ball than Falcao. Falcao has a horrible first touch and isn't the quickest, if not anything Welbeck's pace would have been beneficial in the formation that we have played. It doesn't look like Wilson is ready yet. 

I meant Michael Keane, he could have been a good back-up CB and also could have played RB. 

Adnan hasn't been given a chance to find consistency. It has been 5 minutes here, 10 there, and each time in a different position on the field. He has been one of the biggest casualties under VG.

2605~~~
It would be utterly daft to let go of such a brilliant talent.

2606~~~
Yep. If we sell him it will hugely change my opinion on LVG and no one will be able to convince me that's an overreacting

2607~~~
He'd survive the backlash because I'm not sure there would be any real backlash over selling a kid. But it would be a completely and utterly daft thing to do if he did do it. Januzaj could well turn out to be a player we'd be happy spending 30-40 million to sign in 3-4 years.

2608~~~
He's not getting time on the pitch at the moment because 3-5-2 and 4-1-2-1-2 doesn't require wingers, not because he isnt good enough. Mata and Rooney are way ahead of him in the hole and he doesn't have the discipline to play as a wingback. Loan would be a good option for him.

2609~~~
Would be a great option in 4-3-3 though wouldn't he? If LvG ever returns to his supposed 'favourite' formation, Adnan will get plenty of opportunity.

Definitely won't be sold, but a loan could be good for him.. as said he needs games at this age

2610~~~
Sad it at the start of the season, dont think Januzaj will really come good under LVG, because of his possession based football. It's so slow, once our attackers get the ball, they are immediately surrounded by defenders and have no where to go, they just pass it back or lose the ball, di Maria has been struggling with the same thing. Last season, Januzaj got space to roam, got space to dazzle past defenders and do his thing, but what we are doing now, just doesnt suit him at all.

2611~~~
I think last year he wouldn't have stood out, but this year he seems to have forgotten how to play. I think he needs to maybe tone the dribbling down a tad and work on his movement more as he is coming up against bigger and faster fullbacks than he is used too. His touch has looked a bit sloppy recently which when marked tight he has lost the ball a lot. Hope he can regain that spark he had last year.

2612~~~
Him and di Maria in a 433 would allow both of them to cut inside. It would present a double threat on either flank, with them able to knock in crosses or cut inside - with the threat of overlapping full backs. I just find it strange that Januzaj isn't getting a look in at all.

2613~~~
We played 4-3-3 a few times this season with Januzaj on the wing, but that was when Falcao and RVP weren't both fit. When they're fit we'll always play at least 2 strikers just for the sake of them being world class players and playing.

We could've played a 4-3-3 against Southampton, but instead played Di Maria as the second striker.

I just hope we return to playing 4-3-3 or at least 4-1-2-1-2. People say the lack of a good centre-back prevents LVG from playing four at the back, but our performances with the 5-1-2-2 are terrible and clearly LVG should know that. So he has about 2 weeks left to bring in a centre-back he thinks is good enough.

2614~~~
We need him to play more. We have no exciting young player in the team now, someone to hype and overrate, that has the potential to be one of the best. That is very important, imo, especially at a club like ours, who prides itself into making top players, not only buying them.

2615~~~
So you'd like to go back to last year when we gave him plenty of game time and ended up in 7th place??
He just hasn't done enough to warrant more time period. The time he does get he just hasn't been doing enough with

2616~~~
We need to play 4-2-3-1 with 3 floating around. The 4-3-3 we played with fixed wingers neither helped Di Maria or Januzaj.

2617~~~
Biggest disappointment of the season so far for me. After the way he broke into the team last season and almost became one of our most influential players until the end of the season where he looked like he needed a rest, he's reached a point where everyone's wondering if he even has a future at the club anymore. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2618~~~
Firstly it's not like all established players been all guns firing. Infact RVP had a way worse spell and DI Maria has been worse wide. Januzaj is inconsistent but he needs playing time for now and for future investment.

Secondly, how about going back to the year before where we won the title playing many ?

He's played about 400 minute in total much of that as a sub or in weird positions in diff formations.

If Someone is writing off such a talented a 19 year old based on that then what to say....

2619~~~
He'll come good. You'll see <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2620~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> I agree with your sentiment but disagree with your way of expressing yourself. 

Adnan's been disappointing but to think he has no future here is ridiculous.  Especially when we've played the 352 so much, which has put the reins on generally great attacking players besides Januzaj.

2621~~~
Surely a loan deal would suit everyone at this point, selling him would be a massive mistake.

2622~~~
Talksport reporting he is going alone. Not really reliable but thought I would share.

2623~~~
I'm sorry, I forgot it was his fault we finished 7th...

2624~~~
Going on loan strikes me as the most sensible option for him right now. He's clearly talented, but with the array of attackers we have he's going to struggle for substantial game time. A spell at a club in a top league (either here or elsewhere) would hopefully be beneficial to him.

My worry is that even when he returns, we may still have a lot of attacking players to fit into the team. I struggle to see where he'd go in LVG's 3-5-2 system, but even if we don't persist with that, he's still going to be competing for players like Mata and Di Maria. Still young though, so that's a major positive.

2625~~~
so because an 18 year old was one of our top three players last year, that's HIS fault AND the reason why we finished in 7th?

you're not that daft, smarten up.

2626~~~
Cream rising to the top:

<b>On a dairy farm, after the milk is 'taken' from the cows, it is usually put into a bucket of bulk tank - depending upon the size of the farm and how much milk. After the milk sits in a refrigerated container, the cream (Januzaj) separates itself and floats on top of the milk. 

When someone says 'cream rises to the top,' it<span style="text-decoration: underline"> means that someone who is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">exceptionally good will distinguish himself from others and be noticed.</span> 

The best usually stands out in a crowd. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/></b>

This lady who goes by the name of 'copper'who gave this answer to the meaning of 'cream rising to the top' says it best!!!!

2627~~~

2628~~~
We're struggling to create and lack penetration and he's languishing there on the bench. I think our management isn't handling our best young talent very well. He has what we might be looking for in Depay or Reus, but he can't get a game here...I think we'll be a more creative team in a 4-3-3 with him, Rooney and Di Maria as the front 3.

2629~~~
Players get better when they're are not in the team, although I think he deserves more chances this season, when hes been in the team hes not been very good (except from the Chelsea game) and thats why he isn't getting many chances.

2630~~~
Wilson is getting more games, and I can't remember him doing anything of note. I think it's deeper than "hasn't played well , so isn't playing".

2631~~~
Wilson has been getting games because Falcao was injured though

2632~~~
So hes not allowed to go on loan, but he's not allowed to go anywhere near the pitch either. Great development of our best young talent, that.

I think the supporters need to sing his song over and over again next match. Ring it through LVG's ears.

2633~~~
I think Januzaj has actually played one more game than wilson this season

Neither have overly impressed. Maybe Wilson has shown more in training?

2634~~~
He's had what, 3 starts? Chelsea, good, by your own admission. West Brom - poor. City, brought off after 30 minutes because we'd gone down to 10 men.

Plus a few short sub appearances, none in his main position and almost all in games where United have been generally dire are hardly enough to judge merit on, right?

2635~~~
Indeed. Januzaj's actually had almost twice as many PL minutes as Wilson (435 vs 273) so let's nip this "<i>Wilson's played more than Januzaj</i>" crap in the bud.

Training aside, I think Wilson's been slightly better in competitive games. They've both been fairly ineffective but Januzaj has really been quite crap.

2636~~~
He started in the game I went to, at home to Palace and he was shocking

2637~~~
I don't understand why he doesn't come on and help stretch teams when we need a goal. He offers a wide outlet.

2638~~~
He often does though (comes off the bench, or at least he was), and he often does nothing. When he is one on one with the fullback, he just gets jockied, and either wins a corner (plays his cross against the defender) or comes back and plays the ball backwards/inside.

2639~~~
I think he also started vs Palace and was complete shite.
Anyway like I said in my post, I think he deserves to play a bit more, but people need to calm down and stop acting like when he has played he has been playing well.
When he comes on as a sub, usually he has been very poor, if he wants to break back into the team he has to do better.

2640~~~
Aye, he did start that one. Admittedly, it was another to add to the list of games where we were utter shite in general though. For the games he's been poor in (2 starts), so has everyone.. but they've had plenty other opportunity.

Equally, apart from a lot of huffing and hard work (not all his fault, admittedly), has Wilson been particularly good when he's come on as a sub? And yet he's had a lot more time. Or atleast, he's had a more consistent run in how he has been used. Januzaj has come on, sometimes in the last few minutes, and otherwise never in his actual position.

2641~~~
Exactly. We had the same stuff about Falcao earlier this season. How it's difficult for him coming on as a sub. Tough titties. For players trying to force their way into the team, they need to make the most of their sub appearances and force the manager to start them in the next game. Van Gaal has shown himself willing to do that with (for example) Hererra so I'm sure he'd start Januzaj more if he made an impression as a sub. It's how he got into the first XI last season anyway.

2642~~~
No he hasn't. In fact Januzaj has had almost twice as much time as Wilson.

2643~~~
I don't think he has. Herrera has been dropped permanently IMO and will only start games when we have no other options available.

2644~~~
I think it's not as simple as he's not played well, so, he is on the bench because of that. I think it's deeper than that, just like the case of Herrera. If you rate a player, you'll find room for them and play them into form at times, it's not like we don't know how good Adnan is/can be.

2645~~~
I thought the stats might make me look a fool there, that's why I included the 'or atleast' bit. 

To clarify, Wilson has come on in consecutive games for the most part, almost always in a partnership up front. In terms of substitutions, I feel like Wilson has been brought on with more time to go, in a good run of games, and in one position. Januzaj hasn't really been afforded that.

Januzaj needs to do more for sure. In comparison to Wilson as impact off the bench, the only thought to Van Gaal could be that Wilson is being disciplined and following instructions, 'doing a job' or the role he's been given.

2646~~~
The difference here though is that Falcao was injured, and we had no one else.
Also your statement is incorrect Januzaj has played more minutes than Wilson.

2647~~~
There was a game, a month or two back, when he came on off the bench - played well - and started the next game. Can't remember the fixtures but it was a big deal at the time.  Van Gaal was unusually outspoken in his praise. Unfortunately, Hererra was a bit crap in that next game and got benched again straight away. Still, can't say he didn't get his chance.

2648~~~
You can't expect a manager to pick players based on form they showed when he wasn't in charge. Same reason he's probably not too keen on Rafael.

2649~~~
Good versus Hull, average versus Stoke. Benched straightaway after Stoke game. I think van Gaal basically doesn't like him at all. There are a few players at the club van Gaal doesn't like IMO and a few that he loves and will play regardless of form. He's apparently always had his favourites.

2650~~~
I meant more time as a sub. My bad.

In which Januzaj still might have had more time, but it doesn't feel like it. I clarified why in my post above.

2651~~~
Even if Wilson <i>had </i>seen more minutes than Januzaj, what's the big deal?
Maybe van Gaal doesn't see Januzaj as better than Wilson.

I'm not even sure why Wilson's relevant.

2652~~~
That's the big deal, I'd have Januzaj leagues ahead of Wilson and would find it weird to say the least if LVG prefers Wilson.

2653~~~
Except they play totally different positions so I don't really get the comparison. Wilson has been getting playing time as a Striker because we had no one else. Similarly the same for Blackett and McNair.

We have plenty of midfield players, some not getting games like Herrera now, and Mata earlier in thew season.

2654~~~
Exactly. Januzaj can play either as 10 or on the wing. As a 10 he's competing with Rooney and Mata, isn't as good as either of them and Rooney's the only one of them to miss any games this season. We don't play with wingers, so the closest Januzaj will get to games on the wing is as a wing-back, which is something he's really not suited for and is competing with Valencia, Young, Shaw and Rafael. All of whom are streets ahead of him defensively, which is a key part of that role.

Wilson is playing as one of four strikers competing for two places. Falcao's been injured for a decent chunk of this season and Rooney's been playing mainly in central midfield. Plus Wilson has an attribute that nobody else being picked in his position has. Pace.

All in all, the fact that Januzaj has still got almost twice as many minutes as Wilson shows that's arguably more - rather than less - highly rated than the younger player.

If/when we finally drop this godawful 352, I expect the gap between them in terms of time on the pitch to get even larger. I'm hopeful that the reason he's not going out on loan is because Van Gaal is seriously considering a change in formation which will give more opportunities to conventional wide men. I live in hope anyway!

2655~~~
I really doubt that tbh. I think he's treating Adnan as a special case. At the moment, with the system we are playing, he is surplus. But, surplus because he feels 3-5-2 is the best system to play whilst we do the rest of the rebuilding process (likely summer). As, Januzaj is in no way a wing back then, he will surely come back into play next season when we should have a more balanced squad. That is assuming we have a successful summer, recruiting players!

2656~~~
Hope somehow he gets some minutes this season and does not get sold (or wants to leave) thereafter. Next season will be a fresh start. All he can really do is be a keen student, apply himself in training and impress the coaches and by god give them a very good reason not to buy more competition for him.

2657~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">This season

Ball retention
78% Januzaj
65% Zaha
Good, but Zaha's more of a risk taker and not playing for a possession team. Still nice to see Januzaj despite a few poor touches isn't giving the ball away much.

Dribbling
41% Januzaj
38% Zaha
Not much in it but not done bad in that respect.

Crossing
22% Zaha
20% Januzaj
Surprisingly Zaha's been better.

Tackling
50% Zaha
25% Januzaj
The main reason he isn't getting games.

Shots on target
41% Zaha
7% Januzaj
Quite abysmal really. 4 goals in his senior career explains why he's not playing number 10 ahead of Mata and Rooney.</span>

2658~~~
Ridiculous to interpret stats given the limited game time. The overall minutes is way too few for any meaningful analysis.

2659~~~
Isn't most of what's said about Januzaj ridiculous to interpret given the limited game time?

Their entire Premier League careers then.

Ball retention
Januzaj 73%
Zaha 57%

Dribbling
Januzaj 51%
Zaha 47%

Crossing
Januzaj 29%
Zaha 19%

Tackling
Zaha 55%
Januzaj 35%

Shots on target
Zaha 39%
Januzaj 21%

Januzaj retains the ball more, yet isn't in the team as much to be the wildcard as Zaha is. His dribbling is marginally better, his crossing quite a bit better, his tackling substantially worse and his finishing substantially worse.

2660~~~
Januzaj can play up front though, he'd be a lot better there than at LWB too I'd imagine.

2661~~~
I'm not entirely sure what you're point is, and why you're comparing him to Zaha.



He played 27 games last season, 15 games as starter and 12 games subbed on. Of the games he started he was subbed off 7 times.

*all data from Squawka


So, He's not playing well this season. He's clearly demonstrated last season he can make a significant contribution. Doesn't worry me. Why? Because he's young, we're playing a formation that doesn't suit him, and he's shown that he can come on and <i>change </i>games. He's also an exciting player to watch.  With the dull football being served up of late, it's good to know that we have players like him, who when they're ready, can induce fear into the opposition.......

2662~~~
My point is, Januzaj is terrible defensively and terrible infront of goal, even compared to somebody like Zaha. He's a great crosser, creates decent amount of chances and doesn't lose the ball as much as Zaha without taking as many risks.

They are United players of similar age, playing in a similar position. One of them is derided as a failure, the other is talked about as a future Hazard or Silva. The difference on the pitch is limited.

That stat is quite simply untrue. Januzaj had 47 shots and got 12 on target (26%). Mata had 29 and got 11 on target (38%)

Even the way of getting to Januzaj's 43% stat, taking out the blocked shots to leave 12 from 28 (43%), Mata is 11 from 18 (60%).

I've said Januzaj's ball retention was better than Zaha's. He also had way more games than Mata and Zaha, so total chances created and goals is bound to be higher and not an accurate representation, like per game or per shot is.

Those stats are nonsense again. Januzaj; 24 tackles and 31 fouls. Mata; 17 tackles and 7 fouls. How on earth do you reach Januzaj being a better tackler than Mata.

He doesn't induce fear in opposition teams. No more than Bolasie, Zaha, Mahrez or Schlupp.

2663~~~
My point is that stats don't tell the full story. In my book Zaha is in no way comparable to Januzaj in terms of ability. Call me deluded but I seriously believe we have an utter gem on our books here, in Januzaj, and a dodgy start to this season won't change that. You can bring up all the stats you like but I wouldn't trade him for anyone (honestly). Come back here next January and let's see if I'm talking tripe. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2664~~~
Zaha is 2 years older and is less talented than Januzaj. Anyone that watches them can see the difference in talent. They are different players too. Zaha is a winger and Januzaj is an attacking midfielder capable of playing out wide. Zaha is more athletic and his main threat is his dribbling because of his pace. Januzaj is a better passer, that has the ability to dribble. Januzaj has been bad this season and has still produced passes Zaha can only dream of.


He's having a bad season, but that doesn't make Zaha the better prospect.

2665~~~
What the hell is this? Who gives a feck how he compares to Zaha?

2666~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2667~~~
Januzaj is a brilliant talent who's having a bad run of form. It happens to young players. He will get back on track once we inevitably abandon the 532 nonsense. Not much more to it

2668~~~
This. If we'd bothered to play him this season then he'd be progressing nicely, I have no doubt. Just goes to show how fickle some people are that they are questioning him.

There's no real mystery why he's struggling, it's just game time. He looks rusty and shot of confidence. Compare that to the player last season who, at 18, took the game by the scruff of the neck when senior players were failing. It's quite sad to see him reduced to this little confidence now and how van Gaal is not nurturing his development. We've produced many great players by building belief and confidence until they naturally carry it to the highest stage of the game. Now we're tearing him apart.

2669~~~
Exactomundo!

2670~~~
:leavebritneyalonegif:

Amazing the way young players bring out  so many caftards inner drama queen. He's not the first young player to have a bad season after a good one (bad half season, to be precise) and he won't be the last. Loads of examples under loads of managers, including Fergie himself. Most high profile recent example would be Sterling at Liverpool. A bit of time off is the best response. 

There's plenty of reasons to have a go at Van Gaal for events on the pitch this season  but let's not lose the run of ourselves here. This really isn't that big a deal.

2671~~~
Strongly disagree. Caftards are 57% less likely to have a go at Zaha than Januzaj, stats speak for themselves really. He's a failure.

2672~~~
But has Adnan played enough this season for anyone to say he's having a bad season for any other reason than not playing enough. He was thrown into action in some of this seasons biggest games for some strange reason and not played against lesser opposition. Its all very odd.

2673~~~
Chicken and egg. Is he not playing because he'a out of form, or out of form because he's not playing? Bit of both probably. No big deal though. If he's as good as we think he is he'll force his way back into the team enough. And I think he's very very good. Just a bit yong and lernin.

2674~~~
Yong and Lernin. Pogue you've been told off today already am i right?? Anyway *** kid I actually think is the closest thing to a young Bergkamp I've seen but his progression to that position looks a long long way off right now. LVG has his ways. I guess a big game player doesnt exist for example in his world. If you aint a big trainer on Tues morning your aint nothin...

2675~~~
Might be considered blasphemous here, I know. But what if . . . he just isn't actually *that* good?

I'm not necessarily saying this is my opinion - frankly, I haven't seen enough of him to judge. I have, however, seen every game he's played for the United senior side. And i've seen him do a lot of good stuff - score great goals, produce breathtaking moments of individual skill based on his dribbling ability and balance, clever little passes, taking games by the scruff of the neck. But i've never seen him do it over a sustained period, where you are left in no doubt that this is an amazing player you're watching.

I've also seen a lot of average to poor performances from him, especially over the last 6-12 months. Mishitting crosses frequently, floating around on the periphery of games, making bad decisions. Much of this could be put down to him being young and inconsistent, as most young players except the odd few freaks are.

There is also the possibility, though, that he won't turn out to be the world class - or even United class -  talent some tout him as, and that his contribution last season was overstated as people desperately tried to search for positives amidst the sea of gloom.

</devils advocate>

2676~~~
Van Gaal is no mug though. Surely he understands that he can't impress in 10 minutes every few months. If he wants to see what he's about then he needs a good run of games. Plus, in response to your other point, I see no reason as to why Januzaj needed or still needs a break. He basically had the summer off.

You might think this isn't that big of a deal but if the end of the season comes and he's still barely played, then that's a big deal in my opinion. And I see no reason why his ccircumstances will change the way things are going.

2677~~~
Aye, you can't rule out that possibility. More Macheda than Ronaldo. He was actually a lot more inconsistent last season than you'd think from many comments in this thread. At times very good, at times not good at all. 

He does seem to be sprinkled with star-dust though. Got that je ne sais quoi.

2678~~~
I'm not saying he's physically jaded. Just that it can be good for a young player who's struggling to live up to the hype to be taken out of the spotlight for a while.

2679~~~
Yeah totally. Its silly how much importance some people place on stats in football, this being a prime example. There are so many intangibles involved. Januzaj has scored 4 EPL goals to Zaha 1 so yeah...

...spot the horseshit. Did you actually watch him play last season?

2680~~~
I think LVG's issue with Adnan is you have no idea what the boy is going to do. I mean we know what Nearly every other player does from Rooney looking right for the cross field ball to valencia using his one trick to try and find a crossing angle for a pacy shot/cross. All things LVG can measure against his philosophy and ideas of where people should be and what they will be doing. This lad its in the lap of the gods. And so far thats not seemingly ok with LVG.

2681~~~
Well I suppose there is no right or wrong way of handling that situation. However, I don't think the problem is even that complex with Januzaj. Give him games and he'll be up and running again, I just think the issue is that he's not played enough.

2682~~~
Considering he broke the PL transfer record to sign a player who's every bit as unpredictable that shouldn't be a deal-breaker. 

Anyway, as I said a while back. The main reason Januzaj isn't playing is the 352 formation. Just doesn't fit any of the positions apart from the one occupied by Mata (or Rooney) and he's nowhere near ready to oust either of them. If we play a bit more 433 in the second half of the season he should get more games. If we don't, well, Januzaj is the least of our worries!

2683~~~
I would like to pick you up on this physical bit. I believe he's a very big talent and 10-15 years ago he would probably been seen as a more dominant player. Today even the average skilled players have such good physics that they are able to recover from a step over. A top player also need to have an elite body to fully dominate the game. I think Ronaldo and Bale are cleare examples of that. If Januzaj would man up a bit he could change the scene. His physics today is very weak and he will probably look like that all his career unless he's put under a tough program. I don't understand why the coaches are not bothered by this fact.

2684~~~
I dunno, countless examples of great players playing today who are of a similar build.

2685~~~
Surely you realise by now 3 5 2 is our system even when we have players fit to move off this....the evidence is there.

2686~~~
I'm guessing you don't remember Ronaldo's physique at the same age?

2687~~~
Nah, his comments today make me think he's willing to try different systems.

2688~~~
No, I'd say it's a valid suggestion. 
Actually, I'm one of those who think people overdo it with him a bit. I will be surprised if he hits the heights most here expect him to. 
*legs it*

2689~~~
you can kiss my arse boy!

2690~~~
We havent had a chance to put him on an extreme strength program. Its normally done in the summer but he was away with Belgium last summer and didnt do the pre season with us. I think his lack of a pre season this year has gone against him as well as its meant he wasnt able to hit the ground running like he was last year. Its easy to say he should have caught up by now but there are countless examples of players having poor seasons after missing out on pre season

2691~~~
That's what I'm saying. Ronaldo was really good but weak. He later on developed a great physics and he also took his game to a new lever because of that. I never said Januzaij couldn't change his physics - i'm just saying it won't happen unless he actually try to do it.

2692~~~
They usually continue with individual programs even during international breaks. However, a tournament is not the same thing as having a break and then building up during pre-season, so your point is of course valid.

2693~~~
For those dissing him on his few starts out wide almost as a fixed winger in a 4-4-1-1, well Di Maria playing the other side has been equally bad if not worse including the Chelsea game.

Beyond that he's had few sub oppurtunities where he has been poor on most occasions but playing all sorts of weird roles from Wingback to CM to Striker in different formations. He needs to play from wide cutting in consistently to get his confidence and rythm back.

Young players seem to get a tougher ride because they have less credit in the bank compared to a big name like RVP, Falcao, Di Maria etc..

2694~~~
Do you have any players in mind? Messi is not a beast but on the other hand his other skills are enormous + he's got acceptable physics now that he's a +25 year old player.

2695~~~
Silva ? Mata ? Fabregas ? Iniesta ? Going few years back Xavi, Scholes.

RVP wasn't really a great athelete either. Then Suarez is terms of strength.

Can go on..

Not getting your point here.

2696~~~
You can add Reus to that list. Or, going back a few years, Kaka. Or how about someone Van Gaal will remember well. Johann Cruyf?

Not every great footballer needs to be built like a brick shit-house.

2697~~~

2698~~~
What makes you think he isn't working on his physique?

2699~~~
I kinda like the mention of Cryuff in this thread. I think there are a lot of simarities. Granted Adnan isn't playing like it at the moment

2700~~~
Sorry Louis... but the fans kind of are.

2701~~~
Wtf are they doing in the classroom learning physics? Get out onto the pitch I say.

2702~~~
Would like to see more of him. Our other players aren't exactly setting the world alight so lets see what Januzaj has in him. I'd even want to go back to 4-3-3 with di Maria, Blind and Herrera in midfield (Carrick CB) and then Rooney Januzaj and Falcao/ RVP up top.

2703~~~
Yes but Custis wrote this week that Januzaj would be sold, which may have annoyed Van Gaal understandably.

2704~~~
van Gaal set himself up for a fall though to be fair to Custis, he comes out and say "Why don't you ask about Januzaj?" so when someone actually does he complains about it! Would of thought he would have a better answer if he's seemingly actively asking someone to ask a question.

2705~~~
Did you actually watch him, or just remember his 4 goals in perfect detail and built the idea of him being a great finisher off the back of it?

Taken 61 shots in his United league career; over half of them from inside the box, so these weren't hopeful efforts from distance. 13 on target (21%), 26 off target (43%) and 22 blocked (36%).

Take somebody like Coutinho (2 years older, way better in general play, but known as a rubbish finisher). Took 138 shots; 40 on target (29%), 57 off target (41%) and 41 blocked (30%).

Januzaj's one of the least accurate prolific shooters in the Premier League. He just is.

2706~~~
As Speak said, but sorry Louis....... we are.

2707~~~
Bingo.

2708~~~
He hasn't been given enough of a chance to play this season for anyone to judge him. He's barely started a game and comes on in situations where the team has already degenerated into a complete mess.

If he'd been starting game after game or playing in a clear role which he'd been given opportunities in, I could understand, but Van Gaal's managed him like a piece of shite. The same as he has with a number of other players. In fact the pattern seems to be that players who play with flair or make United entertaining to watch, get missused or not used at all. Often in favour of sticking a midfielder in defence or something else completely counter productive.

Meanwhile on the caf:

Players who get better under Van Gaal - it's because he's a genius

Players who get worse under Van Gaal or don't get given a chance - It's because the player isn't good enough



It's about time some of the journos started pulling him up on his non sensicle bullshit. The performances and results don't nearly justify any of it and he's gotten an unbelievably easy ride so far.

2709~~~
Seeing as we've barely played with wingers this season, the only position Januzaj can play really is the #10 role. And he's not going to get in the team ahead of Rooney, Mata or Herrera. Because they're all better players.

The only way he was going to be in the team was if he made a real impact in the limited time he has played, and he hasn't, in fact he's been largely shite. What do people expect? LVG to play him ahead of Rooney or Mata? Can you imagine the shitstorm that would lead to if he did that and we lost. 

He needs to go on loan and get some proper game time.

2710~~~
How many players HAS LVG used correctly this season?

If Januzaj is competing with Rooney, Mata and Herrera for the no10 role, how come none of them play in the no10 role? Two play in midfield, and the other (the one who's actually a midfielder), sits on the bench doing feck all.

If it's down to Januzaj not taking his opportunities (which he basically hasn't had), because he hasn't played well enough, how come Herrerra has also barely played? He's largely been very good. How come other players who've been poor still keep getting played?

There's so many players who've been poor or inconsistent this season, due to "not being in their prefered role" or not being comfortable with what they're being asked to do. Di Maria, Mata, Rooney, Rafael, Valencia, Januzaj, Evans, Fletcher, Smalling, Jones, Shaw. But it's wrong to look at Van Gaal rather than the players, because Ashley Young's been decent and Fellaini played well for 45 minutes against West Brom.

A manager's job is to manage the players. Not throw his ego around at the expense of them

2711~~~
Well, an improvement over last game. Not only was he on the bench, but he got a hug from Fellaini as well. Baby steps. Maybe one day he'll even get minutes on the pitch!

2712~~~
Bromance moment of the week! Poor adnan looked a bit embarassed that their little carnal secret is out.

2713~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBq9PHIwq3I?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> A gentle reminder.

2714~~~
Yeah you can't really blame him for januzaj not featuring this season. The kid has no confidence whatsoever. But I did think lvg would allow for our attacking players to express themselves more which hasn't been the case. There's a lot of shackles right now.  Once the team plays with more freedom I can see the likes pf januzaj playing better too. Obviously he needs tp get his belief back either way.

2715~~~
Stunning talent. Makes football look easy. Him and di maria both in form in one side would be great.  Realy hope he gets his mojo back soon.

2716~~~
I have no doubts he will. You don't lose ability like that over night. He just needs  a few chances, he will be alright.

2717~~~
I'd give him games here and there. The payoff with januzaj getting it right will be huge.

2718~~~
Even though its youtube highlights thats just from his break out year, and you can see even against chelsea, constantly taking on defenders, getting quality passes in final third, creating chances, exactly the type of player we`ve been crying out for years, even better hes home grown in a way

2719~~~
The most impressive thing about him last season was his decision making, which look well beyond his years. The ability to spot the right pass, some his passes from the deep, his ability to make decisions on when to take or not take on the defender, it was all magnificent.

I see him trying to force the issue a bit this season. That maturity seems to be lacking and I fully blame LVG's handling of him. In order to play his "philosophy" he has marginalized the kid and dented some of that confidence he displayed last season. 27 minutes since November is a good enough proof of that. He was excellent in the Chelsea game, then got taken off in the City game and has been rarely used since.

2720~~~
I don't know how anyone could have watched him and not rate him or think "maybe he isn't just that good". At his age, where was Ronaldo. What people fail to understand is that young players have that inconsistency about them, LVG has his reasons for not playing him, and I'd wager that it has nothing to do with quality, because he has it. We have this tendency to underrate our own at times, it's annoying, he's good enough and will get better.

2721~~~
At his age, Ronaldo was playing pretty regularly for United, scoring goals etc. He's not another Ronaldo. He's a good player but he'll come nowhere close to having his career.

2722~~~
When you consider how good Eriksen, Oscar, Hazard, Coutinho, Sterling, Isco, Gotze, Draxler, Rodriguez and Koke are all just a couple of years older, do you see him being that good in a couple of years time?

If he isn't then he's overrated by most United fans if anything.

The world is littered with brilliant 22 year old attacking midfielders.

2723~~~
You don't even need to take players who are older, most of the guys you listed, as the same age of Januzay, were still clearly much better than him currently. He has time on his side but not sure Utd is the right club for him right now.

2724~~~
It's funny that when a Di Maria comes back from injury and plays 3-4 bad games he will get sympathy but this kid gets like 20 minutes every month and people start getting on his back just on that. On a side note I saw watching a recent interview of his where he mentioned his football heroes to be Giggs , Ronaldo and Riquelme which is kind of funny because Riquelme was also completely sidelined by Lvg

2725~~~
They are all very good players. I would argue that Iniesta and Fabregas have average strenght for a footballer. They also have extreme talent. Some of them don't even use their physics in game situations.

As I said Ronaldo - he was really good with us, but he reached a world level of class when he became athletic. The same thing goes for Bale. To me this is the new kind of footballer. Bale is not a special player without his speed and power. If you were to put him in a role like Zidane/Pirlo/Scholes where he was suppose to play the ball around and not making runs at goal I'm sure he would be quite average.

RVP strikes me as a pretty fit guy but not the kind of guy with a lot of muscles like Heskey. It's a fine line bulking up but still being able to keep athletic.

The past 2 years and the fact that he's looking like an 18 year old boy. He should be in the process of coming out of his shell. I am thinking about a kind of transformation like Bale and Shaw.

2726~~~
So,if he's not as good as them, then he's rubbish and we shouldn't bother about him? Don't be stupid.

2727~~~
Did I say he'll come close to Ronaldo? He was not scoring goals, he was doing stupid step overs and falling over most of the time. Januzaj is more than a good player, he's a fantastic young player than cost us nothing  or close to it.

2728~~~
And he can be better than your Eriksen who is nothing special. You always have nothing good to say about United, so I don't take your seriously, small club fan.

2729~~~
Which Ronaldo do you mean? You could argue that Cristiano had a similar first season at United, but in his second season he was basically a regular.
Not all young players are inconsistent. Ronaldo had scored 35 goals in a season when he was 19. Many players have done better than Januzaj at his age. But not all of them have played for a big club at his age. I do think that it's more difficult for a young attacking player to break through at a club like United. If you are just a very good young player that may very well not be good enough at a club of United's status.
That is true, but looking at the video you can actually perfectly understand why van Gaal won't give him too many chances.
He looks good but he seems to play kind of within his own system. He had some brilliant passes in the video but also some where he is basically playing a blind pass into no man's land <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2730~~~
I think Januzaj's overrated by people who think he's levels above Eriksen and Oscar, Falcao's overpriced, Shaw is a great defender but needs to improve his confidence in attack and Di Maria's a less effective though better to watch player than Bale.

Other than that, I'm always praising the likes of Rooney, De Gea, Di Maria, Carrick, Blind, Van Persie, Rafael, Smalling, Herrera and others. I don't have to think every United player is brilliant to use this site, just because I'm a Tottenham fan. You no doubt think Eriksen, Lloris, Kane and Vertonghen aside, every player in our team is complete rubbish. So I'm allowed to have my opinions too.

On the Eriksen and Januzaj comparison; Januzaj could do with watching him along with Di Maria and Rooney, particularly in terms of decision making and opening up space in the middle and final third. Eriksen learned from Bergkamp remember, so he had great tutoring of his own.

In the Premier League so far. Eriksen scores twice as often as Januzaj (3.5 to 1.7 every 900 minutes), creates 50% more chances (29 to 19 every 900 minutes), dribbles better (56% to 51%), tackles substantially better (50% to 34%) and loses the ball a lot less (21% to 27% of possessions).

2731~~~
You can stat dump all you want, it doesn't make your assertion that Januzaj is a much worse finisher than Zaha any less silly. As I said, there are far too many intangibles in football to let stats dictate how you judge a player as much as you seem to be doing. That's why I get the impression you haven't actually seen him play that much. Yyou said earlier he's a great crosser, for examples. While his crossing is pretty good and all, I think most people on here would agree his touch, vision and balance are his main attributes, and I've not heard anyone complain that he's particularly wasteful in front of goal. He's not a particularly good finisher but you're going on as if his finishing is as bad as some donkey like Soldado

2732~~~
I've seen him loads. You never worry about him on the edge of the box, you know he's probably going to strike it wrong. I just wanted to see it was backed up statistically. He's about 10% worse than Coutinho and everyone knows Coutinho takes more shots than Andros Townsend and ends up with about 5 goals a season if he's lucky.

Sanchez worries you, Hazard worries you, players like Oscar and Eriksen increasingly worry you. Januzaj you'd rather he shot than crossed because he's more likely to find a team-mate than make the goalkeeper work. It's a major reason why he doesn't play as one of the main attackers; people aren't scared of his finishing, they just look to mark the players he's passing to.

His vision is great, but balance and touch isn't. I said this the other day, if he dribbles better he has the passing to be great. His touch is still extremely heavy compared to guys like Eriksen and Oscar and dozens of others that age. Balance for me is being able to get where you want to; he so easy to muscle down the wing or into a corner. Watch it next time he plays, he's worse placed after the dribble than he was when he got the ball. Players like Hazard, Eriksen and Coutinho it's the opposite.

Passing's great but he needs someone to teach him how and when to dribble. Crossing's great, but he needs the dual threat of getting more than 1 shot in 5 on target. When you can score and assist, you become a nightmare; now, he's quite easy to handle and teams are realising that.

2733~~~
Christ, I've not seen one person who said he's above Oscar or even Eriksen, yet, I think in time he has the talent to be far better than the likes of Eriksen [who is nothing special, i repeat] and Coutinho, Oscar is 3 times the player Eriksen could ever be, so, let's not go there. It's not easy to thrive under the circumstances he did last season, and to do it mostly for a full season, he's fantastic and he'll surely start for most club at Spurs level.

2734~~~
There are no words to describe how stupid this post is.

Januzaj is 19 years old - given the ability he already has in his locker, it's not at all inconceivable that he could be at a high level by the time he's 22.

All of the above mentioned players will have had lulls in their development. We're talking about a young player who has had half an underwhelming season after a very promising breakthrough.

2735~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93464, @luckyspurs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93464/">@luckyspurs</a>

P.S. Your critique of Januzaj is particularly bizarre given your very own Harry Kane has suddenly burst into form. I can't think of a much better example of everything suddenly falling into place for a young player.

2736~~~
What you're talking about would be lack of strength rather than balance. He can wriggle away from defenders in tight situations that most players can't, especially at his age. Maybe agility is a better word, the two are interlinked anyway. He does go down blind alleys more than you'd like, which is why I didn't cite dribbling as one of his strengths, you saying his touch is heavy though... I honestly can't see where you're getting that from. Not sure why youre comparing him to Eriksen Coutinho and Oscar, what had they done when they were 18?

2737~~~
Most wouldn't dispute that. But the next question is, will he be able to thrive at United then?

Btw, Eriksen bagged 8 goals in 40something games when he was as old as Januzaj is now.
Januzaj won't get that many appearances this season.

2738~~~
Kane scored 18 in 19 starts this season to get compared to Sheringham and talked about as superior to Crouch and Bent. He'd be getting praise whatever his age; if Januzaj was Chadli's age he'd be performing worse than one of the least praised wingers in the top half of the table.

Spurs players have to be incredible for a season or great for 2 or 3 to get any hype and people still think they'll be rubbish at big clubs (Modric, Bale, Van Der Vaart, Vertonghen, Eriksen, Kane and Lloris). United players need youth, vague potential and about 10 good games in 2 seasons to be considered the same level.

2739~~~
The stats, man. The stats. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2740~~~
In his first two seasons he got us 15 goals. All whilst adjusting to a new league and country where januzaj has been here a while. Why exactly did you compare them? I think januzaj is good, not fantastic, personally. Slightly over hyped here in my opinion. Hopefully he will develop to be that fantastic player but I do feel he's had more bad than good games overall.

2741~~~
Your second paragraph is absolute tripe. Spurs players get praise very quickly, hence your ability to extract big prices when you sell them.

On Januzaj, you're talking absolute nonsense - your dismissive attitude says it all about the football culture we have these days.

2742~~~
The culture of not hyping a kid to the heavens before he can create or finish like players among the most dismissed and piss-taken in the Premier League; with Van Persie, Rooney and Mata around him and taking teams completely by surprise.

If a Crystal Palace fan compared Bolasie to Nani off the back of a couple of dribbles, you'd say they were getting carried away. It's completely fair to say Januzaj has mountains to climb to reach Eriksen's level.

Every 1000 minutes (this and last season).

Chances created - Eriksen 32, Moses 23, Sigurdsson 22, Lamela 21, Chadli 20, Townsend 20, Januzaj 19

Goals involved - Eriksen 7, Chadli 6, Sigurdsson 6, Januzaj 3, Lamela 3, Moses 3, Townsend 2

Don't dismiss Moses, Sigurdsson, Lamela, Chadli and Townsend either please. There are hundreds of players to get through on the journey from talented unproductive youngster to Cristiano Ronaldo.

Don't remember every through ball or chance Januzaj made and assume Townsend and Moses and players like that aren't perfectly capable of doing it more regularly.

I don't dismiss people for having rubbish stats when they look the part and play visually great football with amazing close technique and talent; Isco, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Coutinho great examples.

A kid amongst the most miscontrols in the league this season, who runs down blind alleys almost every time he gets the ball and has created next to nothing since teams learned he can't shoot and holds onto the ball to long before passing, doesn't need to be talked up in order to enjoy and watch modern football.

I'm sorry but this thread got so carried away last year, it needs statistics to remind people that players like Townsend and Moses have been more creative and effective than the only evidence they yet have of Januzaj being a great player; what he achieved this and last season.

Below is the non-stat, probably and hopefully more interesting version.

2743~~~
All your post has done is illustrate that Januzaj is broadly comparable to a host of talented (but older) players. Not bad for someone who's still developing and has barely been in the side this year.

2744~~~
Maybe I'm misreading this but are you trying to suggest:

a) Chadli is as good or better than Januzaj?
b) Chadli was even close to as big a talent at the same age?

I will eat my fez if Chadli, Moses or Townsend go on to be better players than Januzaj over their careers.

2745~~~
His entire argument is absurd.

2746~~~
Yeah, but look at all those stats!

2747~~~
There was a stat doing the rounds a few years ago when Bale was on fire, that he had less goals and only slightly more assists than Walcott. Everyone knew it was bollocks and Arsenal fans were only trolling when they posted it. You're not gonna convince anyone by reeling off a load of numbers - if anything you're just hurting your own argument by showing stats that the likes of Zaha and Moses beat Januzaj, because anyone who's seen them play knows Januzaj is much better. 

Tl;dr stop stat dumping

2748~~~
I bet he's never actually watched a football match, just trawls through Opta's website all day.

2749~~~
I've almost forgotten who he is.

2750~~~
Football is so fickle though, take last season for example Isco barely got a game for Madrid while Eriksen didn't have the greatest first season at Spurs, he scored in the World Cup final but Goetze also had a mediocre year with Bayern.

Adnan isn't playing at the moment and when he gets a chance he looks well off the pace but he's a top prospect, if it's here or elsewhere I'm sure he will prove himself over the coming months.

2751~~~
The argument is that if Januzaj was 22 rather than almost 20 and still anything like the player he is now, at a mid-table club, he'd be in the same category as Arnautovic, Mahrez, Bolasie, Moses, Townsend and the like. He'd struggle to get in any team in the Premier League on what he currently produces.

If you've ever watched college football in America and then watched those same guys in the NFL. Januzaj's one of those quarter backs with a couple of great looking throws on ESPN, but more interceptions than touchdowns and playing a level like Christian Ponder and Carson Palmer.

He doesn't create anywhere near enough to be as wasteful, quiet and weak defending as he is. He accounts for very few actual chances, though all of them get repeated and spoken about and gifs made about them.

2752~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's an absolutely absurd argument.

He's not 22, he's 19. Why are you arbitrarily picking 22 as a benchmark age?

Ludicrous.

2753~~~
Yeah but you know, if he was 22, which he isn't, but if he was, he'd be average. Like Townsend. Although he's 23. 

See, it makes perfect sense.

2754~~~
It's a fecking nuts argument.

2755~~~
But how good would Messi be if he was 40, overweight and couldn't score goals?

2756~~~
Not as good as if he was only 37.

2757~~~
What this post needs is some % stats.

2758~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93464, @luckyspurs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93464/">@luckyspurs</a> stats, lets go

2759~~~
He's a less good player than Chadli, Lamela and Sigurdsson. He's level with Moses and Townsend.

That is the player he is at 19. United fans are the ones predicting Ronaldo or Hazard level improvement.

2760~~~
Have the poster of the year awards been announced already or is the voting still on?

2761~~~
At 19, there are about 40 attacking midfielders in the Premier League better than what he produced last season. That's it. He's young and he occasionally does a nice looking pass that United fans can gif and pretend they've got another Eden Hazard, if you don't have to wade through the hours of losing possession and wrecking United attacks because he wants to spend half an hour on the ball before doing something productive with it. We had one of those guys ourselves; Adel Taarabt.

He's 19 and Swansea wouldn't pick him ahead of Montero, Dyer, Routledge or Sigurdsson. Stoke wouldn't want him ahead of Walters, Arnautovic, Assaidi or Bojan. Spurs wouldn't want him ahead of Townsend, Eriksen, Chadli or Lamela. Leicester wouldn't drop Mahrez or Schlupp for him. Crystal Palace wouldn't drop Bolasie, Puncheon or Zaha. Southampton wouldn't drop Mane, Tadic, Ward-Prowse or Elia.

Infact you could keep going through most of the Premier League. Nobody wants a winger who creates 3 chances every 2 full games, can't finish, can't defend and gives the ball away constantly. Your own manager not least of all.

2762~~~
I'm sorry but you have an inflated opinion of Chadli and Lamela. Sigurdsson is playing well but I would pick Januzaj over them three all day. Comparing him to Moses and Townsend??? Now your just embarrassing yourself.

2763~~~

2764~~~
How many 19 year old wingers would effortlessly make their way into the starting XI of every squad then? Sterling, most likely, but you'd probably expect that of the European golden boy.

2765~~~
Ah, so even Zaha is better then Januzaj now, despite two managers both prefering to loan out Zaha and keep Januzaj in the squad.

Logic.

2768~~~
This Spurs fan has to be on a wind-up. Has he ever watched Januzaj??? He's struggled for form a bit this season but that's because he hasn't had a run of games.

2769~~~
Yea, and Zaha is a much better finisher because he's scored a quarter the amount of goals Januzaj has, or something. I can understand people thinking he won't ever be nominated for Balon Dor. I cannot understand saying he wouldn't get in the fecking Leicester team <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2770~~~
He's got to be on a wind up!

2771~~~
And has played fecking wing back a lot of the time.

2772~~~
Exactly.

2773~~~
He's glastonspur with numbers.

Not sure why Spurs fans have such a chip on their shoulder with us tbh.

2774~~~
Oh right... Was this in the vastly easier dutch league might i ask???

Thought so!

2775~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wouldn't make any PL side? I forgot Juventus were only Championship level. Deary me, go back to posting stats.

The same league that made Jozy Altidore look like RvN.

Speaking of gifs, I rather liked his assist vs Spurs.

If my aunite had bollocks, she would be my uncle. You are clueless - 8 times out of ten however 100% of your posts are worth reading for comedy alone.

Good job footballers aren't graded on KPI's other Miroslav Klose would be the worlds greatest striker of all time and we no that isnt the case.

Anyway im off to put my  Hollands pie in the microwave for 3 mins and 30 seconds <b>IF</b> it was a pukka pie, im not sure i would microwave it as i like the extra pastry crucnh which cooking in an oven for 45 mins can provide. Only on gas mark 5 tho. The box does say Gas mark 6 but i dont read into stats too much as its all about personal preference!

2778~~~
Wait... what? Is it 8/10 or 100% or both or stats? I'm fecking lost here. Just stats.

2779~~~
sorry - i meant he comes across clueless in 8 posts out of ten ---- 100% of his posts are worth reading tho. Idiot

2780~~~
Wouldn't get into Chelsea, City, Bayern, Real or Barça's. Probably struggle to get into PSG's too.

Sterling is nowhere near as good as people think he is.

Neither is Januzaj mind. He had his moments last year so he does have quality but he's never been absolutely amazing. Certainly early comparisons with a young Ronaldo last year are way, way wide of the mark. I just don't think he's that special.

2781~~~
I meant in the league. I'd take Sterling over Willian/Schurrle, likewise against Navas/Nasri.

2782~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2783~~~
Watching that makes me dislike van Gaal even more for not giving him more game time. Some of his dribbling on that video is very similar to di Maria's.

2784~~~

2785~~~
I'm on a site where saying Januzaj isn't brilliant is seen as deliberate winding up? Seriously, just shave away the extraordinary hype and inbuilt assumption that everyone United is indefinably more talented than everyone else.

Imagine Januzaj and Mahrez were Leicester City players. They both create exactly the same quantity of chances, yet Mahrez scores and creates goals about 30% more often despite being surrounded by worse players and seeing less of the ball. Mahrez is also the better defender, marginally, and only 3 years older. He's also the better dribbler, stronger and more energetic.

Would you hype the Januzaj guy at Leicester or would you consider him Townsend and Moses level and a complete non-entity, until he's proven himself more?

If a Leicester fan described this Januzaj guy being better than Eriksen, Oscar and Coutinho and compared him to Ronaldo, would you agree or call him another overrated player like Vardy?

Everything that makes Januzaj in any way above average so far is talk, assumption and people predicting he's going to become great, based off of some of the thinnest evidence ever put forward. Nobody knew him last season, or what to do to stop him. Now they do and now he's playing with pressure.

Fortunately we live in a world where hype doesn't last. If Kane and Januzaj stink next season, they're tomorrow's Macheda and Holtby. People thought Modric wasn't worth buying because Cleverley would improve, that Welbeck would score 20 a season if played as a striker. Before this season people would have said Kane couldn't compare to Wilson or Mason to Powell. Blackett was talked about as an England prospect after 1 game.

Bentaleb's had a great season but you don't need and it's stupid to hype it. You don't jump up and start comparing him to Carrick or Modric off the back of half a good season at 19 years of age. You wait to see if he can consistently outplay a Dembele or Sandro, who he can't even match yet, when people know exactly what his tricks are.

There are reasons Van Gaal won't play him. He is one of the worst tacklers in the league, misses the target with 4 in 5 shots and can't create close to 2 chances in 90 minutes despite playing with Rooney, Van Persie and Mata, because he's clueless when to pass and dribble despite having some ability to do both.

2786~~~
Mahrez plays a lot more than Januzaj. Did Januzaj do something to you or what??? You say he is one of the worst tacklers in the league? What games are you basing all these 'facts' on?

2787~~~
He struggled for form for most of last season too to be fair. Had a great start then faded badly.

2788~~~
It's the <i>way </i>he plays. That natural balance he has, the ability to ghost past players. Stephen Hendry was a phenomenal snooker player - The ultimate winner but he'll never match Ronnie O'sullivan for that certain 'magic' about him. You won't find any stats about that mate, you either see/feel it, or you (clearly, in your case) don't.

2789~~~
Moyes stopped playing him when Mata came because the worry at that time was that we were relying on an 18 year old too much. After winning United's player of the month in January he didn't get a start until a month later, which kind of hints that Moyes started to rest him regardless of how he was playing. He simply didn't play much after January. That doesn't mean he was always brilliant. He was inconsistent last season, but that's expected from an 18 year old.

2790~~~
almost forgot how good his debut season was, incredible dribbler, hope he stays. Van Gaal won't change it

2791~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2792~~~
Fair enough if luckyspurs holds his opinion that Januzaj isn't any good but he's literally getting every opinion from the stats. It's stupid.

2793~~~
That's mental. You're going to look extremely foolish.

2794~~~
You were far less of a WUM and a lot less ridiculous before you got promoted. Please don't go down that path, we'd actually like to have a Spurs poster here who isn't as bad as Glaston. Thanks.

2795~~~
Yes, but in my opinion part of the problem is that we still aren't sure about Adnan's best position. Moyes said that he was better behind the striker, which makes more sense IMO. (Correct me if i'm wrong please, but when Adnan was in the academy he played as a left wing or CAM?)

I think that LvG has struggled to spot Adnan's qualities, sadly.

2796~~~
He's a great passer but he needs a Bergkamp or someone to tell him how to find space and stop making it easy for defenders to box him in. Di Maria would be perfect if the language isn't a barrier.

Eriksen's decision making is Modric like; Oscar's touch and effectiveness is ridiculous, Coutinho has staggering amount of talent he hasn't found an effective use for yet.

Januzaj holds the ball so long, you're screaming for him to pass it and show a bit of urgency. Can have all the talent you want but if you're not smart and start to get vain about your own ability, you're next to useless. Adel Taarabt had phenomenal talent, but he held the ball too long.

2797~~~
This isn't a wind up I promise you.

I honestly can't comprehend the hype around this guy. He's no better than 60% of the wingers in the league at the moment and the other 40% are bench players. It's like listening to Texas A and M fans insisting Manziel is more majestic and talented than Luck, Rodgers and Brady, because he was splashed all over ESPN.

It's like a few through balls and a volley against Sunderland and he overtook all but about 15 attacking midfielders in the league as far as United fans are concerned. Since when was he better than Lamela; I know Lamela's not shown his Roma form but he's still done as well as Januzaj in the Premier League and can't even speak English. Didn't even want to leave Italy if reports are to be believed (why would you, as an Argentine).

For reference, my only vaguely anti-United player comments and sentiments are

1. Falcao's price (love him as a person, it's just a huge price).
2. Januzaj being overrated unless he improves drastically.
3. Di Maria being less effective though much more fun to watch than Bale (I actually don't like watching Bale much; it's Modric that I love watching).
4. Occasionally that Shaw while a great defender needs to grow his confidence in attack.

Every other United player I'm dishing out praise to (and those guys too of course).

2798~~~
All fair and true comments imo. I do think Januzaj is way over rated tbh, we tend to do it with all our young players. We over rate them to the points where they can't possibly fulfill expectations and then throw shit their way when they aren't playing well.

2799~~~
He's definitely been overrated on here. That is not to say there is talent there and he can be a very good player though. Just needs to start getting more minutes and finding some consistency.

2800~~~
He was a #10, but also played on the right wing with a lot of freedom. In the u21s he also played as a striker alternating with Lingard because the reserves didn't have strikers at the time. He played that position different from a normal striker. Instead of scoring goals he held that ball up really well and brought everyone into play.

Here's a game of his from the u21s in 2013 (wish there were more of these during that time). As you can see, it's completely different from how he plays now a days where it's dribble or cross. He picked his moments when to run at players at youth level. Now, like I said, it is and has been stressed since last season.

feck sakes, this sort of stuff just doesnt go away does it? Player of the month in january and may. But that doesnt count right?

2802~~~
Said no one ever. Really what is actually wrong with you ? Atleast use reasonable analogies instead of talking out of the arse.

2803~~~
Explain the bits in between.

He wasn't consistently great and in some cases was completely useless in several games last year. Not surprising, he's 18 and he's learning his trade but the bad performances outweighed the good even last year.

2804~~~
Since when did young players have to be the finished article. For goodness sake, there is such a thing as potential and development. Some players shows signs of enormous potential and depending on their development they go on to fulfil that potential or they don't. The argument to be had, in my view, is not whether he has shown enormous potential (obvious to many) but how to nurture and develop it.

There are many exciting young players in modern football, but when one comes through the ranks at your own club, then there is going to be excitement and some hyperbole. Deal with it!

africanspur is still here, just doesn't post as much. Eriksen got banned.

2811~~~
In October he was player of the month which is when he really started his season. November there weren't many games, probably around 3 total due to internationals and he only played like 2 of them. December was very hit or miss for him because of minutes. January was player of the month. From February to April he was average. He played very little in that time. May he won player of the month due to his Hull performance.

2812~~~
Maybe Van Gaal would agree with him? I would also agree with him to be honest. Completely over hyped player, even if he is a very good player with a lot of potential. Was very very hot and cold last season, and has been downright poor this season when he has had his few chances.

Love how people think someone is trolling just because they disagree with their opinion on a player.

2813~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> such a nonsensical post.

I have no idea how good januzaj will end up being and if he will fulfill his potential, but the talent he showed last season was immense.  And for a 19 year he was pretty fecking brilliant. He's going through a slump but comparing januzaj of last season to stoke players, townsend is just <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Rvp called him one of the two best young players hes played with. What he makes of his talwnt is up to him, but the potential is giant.

2814~~~
I knew you'd say this. Ridiculous. Massive difference between not thinking he's brilliant and saying Routledge Zaha and Schlupp are better you utter loon.

2815~~~
The lads a proper talent, that is clear to see. I'd sooner he peak here and 25-27, than burn out at 22. Lets give the talented youngsters time and we'll have a home grown crop of talents and save 60m or 70m in transfer fees to boot.

2816~~~
describing an 18 year old (at the time) as having had a season more bad than good, who happens to be lauded as one of the very best teenagers on the planet, a player named player of the month for his own team three months in that allegedly terrible season and would be snapped up by any club (NOT into a starting 11, but into a team) is trolling.

2817~~~
You just go too far. I also think he was over hyped last season, but to say he couldn't get game time at Leicster ahead of Schlupp is just crazy. This happens to be the same Schlupp trailing for our reserves last season.... yeah ok Also he would probably get game time ahead of some of those players you mentioned.

2818~~~
He won't get chances in the current system, he's up against Mata, Rooney, AdM etc for #10, he isn't a wing-back. You can't judge him on this season. Last season he was one of very few highlights for this team.

If we won't change the system then he should go out on loan to prove (or disprove) his talent.

2819~~~
I don't think it's trolling to be honest. I just think it's a different opinion than you have, that doesn't make it trolling. I happen to agree. As was mentioned by someone else, he got the May one, mainly on the back of 1 performance that month. He's a good player, but he was wildly inconsistent - which is to be expected at his age. Saying so, is not trolling.

2820~~~
Januzaj's last season was one of the best anyone has had at his age. Other players were quite terrible, but Adnan tends to be a bit underrated here. 

He's been quite awful this season, but given his age, some people should give more notion and recognition to his performances last season. He did bigger things at the age of 18 than those mediocre Swansea and Palace players mentioned earlier will ever do. Januzaj is inconsistent, might have lost some of his confidence, but what I refuse to believe is that he wouldn't do more of those things in the future.

2821~~~
It's not trolling, just a completely laughable opinion, which is probably worse than trolling.

2822~~~
It's too dangerous out there. We need to wrap him up in a protective bubble and keep him from the clutches of evil.<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

It's an interesting one about teenage stars and their development. More flops than successes.

Teenagers and the goals and assists the managed.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Great careers</span>
Aguero 27, Raul 21, Messi 16, Rooney 16, Torres 16, Eto'o 11

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Decent careers</span>
Lukaku 24, Owen 18, Anelka 17, Sterling 16, Balotelli 15, Icardi 14, Rossi 13, Keane 12, Defoe 10

Berardi 25, Pato 21, Bojinov 13, Krkic 11, Lamela 11, Canales 10, Keita 10, Dos Santos 9, Hernandez 9, Lennon 9, Ljajic 9

Littered with players who got 5 to 8 in a season as a teenager and did next to nothing. Collins John, Victor Anichebe, Luke Moore, Matty Phillips, Junior Hoilett, Jordan Henderson, Francis Jeffers, Nathan Redmond, David N'Gog, James Vaughan, Carlton Cole, Victor Moses, Michael Johnson, Gerard Deulofeu and countless others.

2824~~~
I don't even know where you're getting at with this post.

2825~~~
Stop feeding the troll.

2826~~~
Three player of the month awards for Manchester United in your debut at 18 years of age is pretty fecking special imo. He had a very good season. Everyone in football including non-United supporters were highly impressed by him. 

SAF said he was a certainty to make it at United. Van Persie said he was one of the two best young players he'd ever seen. Gazetto Del Sport in Italy named him the best teenager in the world. Mourinho described him as a fantastic player who has everything and plays with the maturity of a 25 year old.

Anyone trying to suggest he didn't have a good season last year is being an idiot.

2827~~~
It was but there is context given how incredibly poor we were. Not trolling but it wasn't as black and white as 3 player of the month awards for a standard United season. 

It was a horrendous season where he was the shining ray of light besides Wayne Rooney and David De Gea. Pretty much everybody else regressed a level or 2 at least. Public opinion was/is still split on Rooney and it was a case of picking the flavour of the month for the fans, De Gea or Januzaj.

I'm not getting at Januzaj, or yourself for that. Just pointing out that the context wasn't nearly as black and white as it seemed.

2828~~~
Eh? Henderson has been excellent for us. Not sure how you can judge Sterling's career as being decent either. He has another 15 years left in the game.

2829~~~
Somebody said they couldn't imagine a player who had a season like Januzaj's as a kid, not producing much more in the future.

I took a few minutes to find the players who'd got those sort of numbers in the past and what happened to them in their careers.

2830~~~
Statistics. Are. Not. Everything.

2831~~~
What the feck is wrong with you?

2832~~~
It's not just goals and assists that make a player's performance stand out. For example, Berardi had a lot more end product than Sterling, but Sterling was the more influential player. Some players have more potential despite similar end product at the same age.

I also don't see why you listed Berardi (a long with many players like Pato who suffered from injuries) as having a poor career despite only being 20 years old. He will most likely play for Juve next season so long as Allegri switches the system to allow for a wide forward/winger to play.

2833~~~
Do you work for Opta <a class="username" data-user="93464, @luckyspurs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93464/">@luckyspurs</a>? Genuinely curious what this database of stats is you keep calling on.

2834~~~
You need to stop watching football.

2835~~~
Anyone who thinks goals and assists are the optimum reading to gauge a teenagers potential and ability just has to be either taking the piss or clueless.

2836~~~
We need more stats.

2837~~~
My contention is that Januzaj wasn't that influential. He was nice as a home grown talent to praise; similar to Bentaleb at Spurs, but he didn't actually do anything like what people say he did.

He doesn't create enough, lacks composure infront of goal and in the box and tackles worse than Mata.

2838~~~
He's 19.

2839~~~
I honestly couldn't care less about his tackling stats too.

2840~~~
No more stats; they've had there day and I'm not keeping this fight going. It's just so difficult to argue against a torrent of people who don't watch players like Bolasie, Montero and Mahrez and think Januzaj is way above that level, because he won 3 player of the month awards. Turns you into a rather boring person; quoting stats just to instill some actual analysis and realistic placing of a players strengths and weaknesses, not blind cheerleading and football snobbery.

I only use statistics if it's something I've seen already watching the games. You watch Januzaj dribble and create nothing game after game, and see people going on about last season where he did the same but happened to score 4 goals despite taking a huge amount of shots and getting very few on target.

Judging people on player of the month awards; especially inter club ones, is a hideous way of judging ability. Wigan made Gary Caldwell player of the season; Moyes won 2 manager of the year awards. It's not exactly a surprise that a guy doing most of the dribbling and looking the freshest in a team struggling to score or win, is going to get player of the month awards decided by the fans with tickets.

2841~~~
Of all teams to pretend to support to get promoted and WUM, why Spurs?

2842~~~
Obviously not a WUM; obviously a Spurs fan. Got a press pass at Palace and far too much to be getting on with to even want to wind anyone up. 24 year old local paper writers with a hunger to make it in the world and young families, don't feel the need to wind people up they've never met (or met for that matter).

They do however have very strong opinions about certain players that they tend to be a bit of a dog with a bone about. I used to criticise Redknapp (while he was Spurs manager) perhaps a bit to much, though the editor never pulled me up from doing it, in local newspaper articles because of the hype and belief from the press he could do nothing wrong.

300 posts in a month and half and the only ones criticising a United player are the 10-15 in this thread (I haven't even written a post criticising the team as a whole or the manager, beyond the fact he's forced to play long balls by the 5-1-2-2 system).

I don't criticise Carrick or Di Maria, Smalling or Van Persie, Rooney or Blind, Herrera or Rafael, De Gea or Shaw; I'd love all of them at my club. They're really good players who've proven they're top level or close to it; I just hate when hype blinds people's analysis and reasoning and you can't have a reasoned debate without somebody mentioning what club you support or putting players down for not playing for a Champions League club.

2843~~~

Your editor must earn his Wonga, I can see that much. Just saying.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2845~~~
Some of those stats are just useless. You clearly did not watch him play so stop talking about him. You are using stats to paint this picture of how Januzaj performed last season and are failing to take in what could make him a great player.

Lacks composure in front of goal? Most of his shots from last season were from outside the box barely missing the corner of the net. He needs to improve his striking because going for the perfectly aimed goal isn't always the best thing to do. It's not like he was Welbeck who managed to slip in the final third or messed up a 1v1 situation. That's lacking composure. Januzaj needs to work on his shooting from outside the box. If anything, he also needs to improve his ability to make runs to put himself in those positions where one might question if he lacks composure.

Dribbling stats? You fail to include fouls suffered because often he would get past a player and the player would foul him. Those instances don't count as successful dribbles so won't show up in dribbling stats.

How about passing ability or vision? The stats you used don't show how good he is at passing only how much possession he was able to keep. Then again, you have problem with gifs showing his vision as if that is normal for an 18 year old to do at first team level. Crossing stats are also dumb because failed crosses can still be good crosses if they were put in a perfect area. Watching the game is better again. Chances created or key passes is also useless because any pass that leads to a shot counts as a key pass. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/jjnC7dWIlhiP7.png" src="http://i.minus.com/jjnC7dWIlhiP7.png"/> 

Stats are such a poor representation of player ability failing to take into account technique, vision, passing ability, age/phsyicality advantage, etc...

2846~~~
He has some very prized attributes that you can't teach. Excellent field vision and awareness of what his teammates might do, the ability to create dangerous attacking situations quickly.

We haven't seen much of that lately with his ill-suited role, limited minutes, and recent selfish/careless style of play.

2847~~~
OK then what about SAF, RVP and Mourinho. All wrong as well? The Italian newspaper naming him best teenager in the world was based on him having a bad season?

2848~~~
I think he is trying his best to try and impress in the limited time he gets on the field. Unfortunately he is trying too hard and getting it wrong in the attempt to prove he can score winners.

2849~~~
Hope he has a blinder today.

2850~~~
Same here.

2851~~~
Go on Adnan

2852~~~
Is it just my memory that is bad, or has he grown a lot of muscle since last year?
At least height wise he's grown some, no?

2853~~~
You do fear for the lad atm under LvG,  he really should have been loaned to a club like Everton to show if he's up to it.

2854~~~
Pleased with the performance so far, bit rusty at times but him and Rojo have been two of our best players.

2855~~~
Some neat passes but why doesnt he take on players anymore?

2856~~~
And the first half ends with a whimper...

2857~~~
That last moment of the half said it all about Adnan for the last while. Complete lack of confidence means wrong decision.

2858~~~
Blind mentioned in his interview that LvG prefers it if the players pass it around looking for space instead of dribbling through a player and creating space. 
It'd be my bet that it's simply Januzaj playing as LvG wants (or trying to).

2859~~~
Zero confidence to try anything remotely exciting or dangerous. He's been on a cycle of passing it back.

2860~~~
Has been our best player alongside Rojo in the first half.

2861~~~
He has great vision - he sees a lot of passes not many in the side do. His distribution and technique doesn't match it though. Bit rusty with a suspect final decision, but he still looks a bit nimble.

2862~~~
It looks to be the same with di Maria. It's a shame because you take so much away from these players.

2863~~~
The lad needs a loan

2864~~~
I thought he was our best player in that half; which perhaps isn't saying much.

2865~~~
He only really started to take on players constantly last season. His game has always been about passing, though he has the ability to dribble. He used to pick his moments when to dribble. He's much better playing in this manner.

2866~~~
I agree.

2867~~~
Ye should've tried a shot. Pleased with his performance so far though, looks the most likely to make something happen for us.

2868~~~
He's played well in the center. Swap him and ADM. Good game.

2869~~~
Played well, should have tried to beat his man and get a shot in there at the end though

2870~~~
He should've shot but otherwise decent. Some nice tidy passes. Should swap positions with di Maria.

2871~~~
Best player after Rojo so far, needs to get his confidence back and start taking chances. Looks like he's playing with fear, like he'd get a mouthful from LvG if he loses the ball trying to be too brave.

2872~~~
Totally disagree - think he's great when taking a man on, that's what caused so many players problems with him last season. Don't know why he doesn't run at them any more. 

Underwhelmed with him this season to be honest, although he is mega young and obviously has plenty of time to come good.

2873~~~
Lacking in confidence/match sharpness but has provided us with much needed pace. Just needs to get wide and whip in some crosses/beat the fullback.

Not sure if he was instructed by LVG to come central alongside Di Maria but it just makes us easier to defend because the middle is crowded.

2874~~~
Good half from him. Lack of confidence shown at the end, should've taken a shot.

2875~~~
Needs to dribble more but his passing has been the best of our midfield attackers, he's better centrally than Di Maria for me.

2876~~~
He's done well but should have taken that shot on at the end if the half, he has the ability to finish that.

2877~~~
Sorry but I still don't see the hype of him. Looked no more a talent than a couple of the Cambridge players like McGeehan and Donaldson. OK, those two might be a bit older, but they are League 2 players!

2878~~~
Yeah it looks that way to me too, just like he is always thinking I can't lose the ball or I'm going to get a bollocking or taken off. Playing decent though.

2879~~~
He's underwhelmed this season because his dribbling hasn't worked this season in contrast with last season. As a wingback he has less help out wide and has less freedom to go central. That means his game is more restricted to dribbling and crossing.

Januzaj is much more than just dribbling.


Btw, this thread just shows how much of a "what have you done for me lately" mentality this place is. Januzaj has played well all match, but because he had that bad decision to not shoot at the end, now his whole performance is seen as bad by some posters. It's ridiculous.

2880~~~
I'm more underwhelmed because he's not trying to go past his man, not that he's not successful. the wingback thing might be true, but he's played in midfield too and had support. 

I agree, he's more than dribbling but imo that's his best attribute. He's got great vision too but slightly lacks the decision making and poise to pull it off sometimes. That will come though. 

My decision to criticise was in no way based on his decision not to shoot. I genuinely haven't been impressed with him this game or all season which is what has compelled me to write these posts. I hope he picks up for the rest of the season, because he's the type of player that excites me. 

As I said, plenty of time to improve. Really hope for him to become an automatic first team pick at some point.

2881~~~
I wasn't saying you were basing your decision on the shot, that was more of a general comment on the others who hinted at him playing bad.


I never thought he was special because of his dribbling. Like I said, he only really started to emphasize dribbling last season. He used to use that portion of his game more sparingly even though he had that ability. I thought he was a special player since Fergie was at the club because of his technique, passing ability, intelligence, and vision.

2882~~~
Thought he played alright tonight, 2nd half in particular putting in a few good crosses and beating men. Hopefully he stays around the 1st team and gets another chance, particularly in the replay at Old Trafford.

2883~~~
He looked more confident in the second half and his direct play was back. He needs some regular first team action.

2884~~~
Him and Rojo were the best players, but still lacked a bit of end product and sure touch at pace (his touch at walking pace was quality, but not so much when sprinting). Nice shot from the left side of the box and the cross was really nice if anyone had gone for it.

2885~~~
We have to find a way to give him more game time.

2886~~~
He was one of our best players. Maybe a little slow at times but our only real attacking outlet. Showed up some of his superstar teammates.

2887~~~
Probably our best forward although Di Maria was significantly less shit second half. Hope he gets a few more opportunities and maybe a goal or two.

2888~~~
Easy motm for me. This is the Januzaj from last season that we have been waiting for all season.

2889~~~
by far the best control of the ball and dribbling of all players, him and herrera, neither of them is starter, shocking. I think we should also try to play him further the pitch where he can use his good control and sharp turn and vision which he showed today for instance when he fed Blind and rather give di maria box to box role where he can work hard..

2890~~~
MotM. Played very very well.

2891~~~
Showing good signs again.

2892~~~
What a fecking surprise. That was his first start in ages too.

To anyone that was writing him off, give up on football. You clearly don't know shit.

2893~~~
Our best player tonight (Rojo ran him close).

2894~~~
he was our best player ahead of di maria, RVP etc... so called world class palyers... he showed his ability not that he would be less shite  than others...even played out of position and after a long time sidelined. For how long have you been watching football?

2895~~~
Looked very good.

Weirdly enough, I don't really trust LvG to develop him the right way. I would have said the exact opposite at the start of the season but I don't think LvG is a big fan of him, hope I'm wrong. Feel the same about Herrera.

2896~~~
He just got better and better throughout a hard game. If he was actually given some game time he could be key to saving us from our drone football.

2897~~~
Didn't look great early on, but certainly grew into it. Good to see.

2898~~~
His touch to get him from his back facing the goal to facing the goal is fantastic. It's one of the reasons why I think he's a #10.

Thought he looked effective in both halves, but looked more limited on the wing if that makes sense. Just felt that his options out on the wing is to just dribble or cross. It worked for him this time, but on other occasions his dribbles could fail and it will collapse his effectiveness/performance out on the wing. It's a clear difference in play style.

Part of the problem is that he didn't have a proper fb that can quickly join in on the attacks by offering another passing option and also Di Maria sort of taking his space centrally. I wasn't sure who was the #10 and who was the lcm. The attack would have been far more effective with Di Maria playing deeper than Januzaj and having Shaw offer both players a quicker passing option.

Good game from Adnan today.

2899~~~
His confidence grew throughout the game which was good to see, of course it'll be for naught if he is back to the bench vs Leicester.

2900~~~
Van Gaal really has a decision to make about Januzaj this month.
Either he decides a 433 (or 442) and Januzaj will be heavily used during the rest of the season or he should give him his loan spell.

He's too good and too young to be on the bench right now. The only thing really missing at the moment is confidence and the experience to deal with different situations during games. He won't learn that in training, he needs games.
There's only 16 PL games and it doesn't look very likely that Januzaj will play a lot of them. Surely Van Gaal knows how he sees the rest of the season. He shouldn't keep Januzaj around to be an impact sub in 5 of these games

2901~~~
Our best player tonight. Needs to play more. Drop one of the donkeys upfront, they are useless anyway.

2902~~~
Better in the second half, a couple of decent crosses into the box.

2903~~~
Second half was like 'vintage' Januzaj.

2904~~~
Proud of him today, tried to make things happen, looked hungry to impress but was let down by pretty much everyone around him. Hopefully he can keep it up.

2905~~~
Thought he was good all the way throughout the match other than towards the end when Ander came on and we played heavily on the right so he didn't get on the ball as much. Was trying to force it more in the second and looked to have more confidence, hopefully van Gaal had a chat with him at HT not to worry as much about losing the ball now and then. Need to see him on the pitch more. Lovely bit of close control at the end there too before the Di Maria shot.

2906~~~
Mad tekkers at the end there.

2907~~~
Anyone get a Gif of those dancing feet?

2908~~~
One of the only players we have that will actually take on his man (and stand a good chance of beating him). Thing is, are Januzaj and Di Maria offering us anything that Nani didnt, or couldnt?

I do want to see Januzaj getting more gametime but that effectively means switching to a one-striker system, which it seems LVG doesnt want to do. 

Januzaj - much like Nani - is a player who needs consistent gametime in order to actually build some form. Sporadic sub appearances and the likes really dont allow him to get any confidence.

2909~~~
He did well when he went wide on the left flank and might have made a case for the 4-2-3-1, with Shaw and Rafael returning we have a left back and back up in Blind, RB and back up in Valencia, Januzaj and di Maria up top with Valencia as a back up option for winger too.

It means Rooney competing with Mata and RVP with Falcao but I have no problem with that. Louis van Gaal won't be messing around either because he knows that the race for top four is going to be tight, he'll do whatever he thinks will get him the points.

Fellaini and Herrera can both play the 8, Carrick and Blind 6.

And we have time until the window shuts, considering Valencia is our back up option for winger, surely we can improve the selection!

2910~~~
Better but still not back to his best and a lot to learn, the talent is there though and in of level ways the replay could be a good thing for us as it will give him another game

2911~~~
Easily the MOTM for me. LVG, you gotta give him more game time.

2914~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He made #2 look a right mug.

2915~~~
Showed a lot more confidence in the 2nd half. Give him a run, not as a wingback, and watch him shine. Brought an unpredictable twist that we've been sorely missing.

2916~~~
I was frustrated by his hesitation to shoot at the end of the first half, but I feel pleased with his performance. I saw some solid tackles, clever passes, and clean touches from him that to me show his quality. 

I do want to see more aggression but for a player who has not gotten consistent minutes I think he made a case to play more.

2917~~~
Had to rewind it three times. With all the possession football we've not seen much in the way of tekkers this season have we?

2918~~~
Is there any other top team in the world where this system works? I doubt it, no big team plays on two strikers while also having 5 defenders... Why do we stick to it when we saw it didn't work so far? Nobody knows, well maybe we wanted to utilize both or all three of our so called world class strikers. Hope we get a winger or two and finally some player we are missing for a long long time, some defensive midfielder because I can't just watch 34 yo walking Carrick around the pitch. It is even worse when his passing is off. Then we can use Januzaj more and most likely our no9 strikers will play better in 4-2-3-1/4-3-3 also. We just need to wait and stay frustrated until another big money spending spree comes in summer

2919~~~
I wanna see it again, the boy is so talented

2920~~~
Lacks confidence. Other than that he was quite good. Deserve to start next match.

2921~~~
Everyone remembers he has talent... he made some poor choices here and there, and dithered on the ball a little like when Ronaldo started out but at least he showed some bollocks and imagination.

2922~~~
Our MOTM easily. Kept the ball well in the first half and early on when he played it through to Blind was great vision. Lost it once or twice but he made things happen, deserves another start after tonight.

2923~~~
Wow, that was impressive

2924~~~
Decent enough game by Adnan. Never stopped trying and some real moments of class in horrendous conditions. Great to see him play and do himself justice. He needed that. Hope he got a pat on the back from the manager.

2925~~~
To be honest that knocks out of the park any trick I've seen Odegaard do (Neymar level stuff instead). Still want more end product, but him and Rojo were good today (impressive given the pitch).

2926~~~
great, on my stream it looked like he somehow thread it through but from the replay it is obvious that none of the defenders had a touch and it was a great piece of skill after all, shame he didn't go on and decided to shoot. 

His end product and decision making is not is a bit off due to his lack of games. The question is where he can play when Mata, Rooney and RVP are back? Not that at least two of them didn't deserve to be benched from time to time.. 

Rojo was great particularly in the first half, unlike Jones who was terrible, hoping for Smalling to come back asap..

2927~~~
Think tonight did him a world of good, looked a real threat when coming off the left tonight at times. Worked his socks off too.

2928~~~
Decision making still let's him downdown

2929~~~
Put in some really decent balls at times. Strikers had given up at one point and weren't gambling.

His passing was crisp and precise. The dribbling was back to what we saw last season and his movement was excellent (compared to those around him).

Good signs. The decision making comes with match practice and form - two things he went into the game without.

2930~~~
Needs a run of games.

2931~~~
He was good.

2932~~~
Decent game for someone who hasn't played a lot of minutes this season.  I think we would have been better off with him playing as a second striker and Herrera starting in midfield.

2933~~~
The highlight in a pool of shite! 

He wasn't even that good but, he showed adventure and a willingness to make things happen.

Put it this way, he was fun to watch unlike the rest of the cnuts

2934~~~
He needs games in the right formation

2935~~~
Good performance. Shades of last year's potential.

2936~~~
he finally turns himself into a lvg player.   maybe shall i credit this to fellaini for his mentoring?  keep doing this there is no way we will loan him out.

2937~~~
Good performance from him, he had an opportunity to show himself and he took it.

2938~~~
Looked absolutely and completely useless, till the last 15 mins or so when he just ran down the left a few times and tried to cross the ball. At that point he had an idea of what to do and a few good goes at executing it

2939~~~
Weird post because for me he was possibly our best player in the first half

2940~~~
Encouraging performance. Given how deep and compact CU were, it was very difficult to pick out a final ball or a decent run. If we had been playing a team who wanted to play football, then he would have excelled.
Made a good case for his ability on the wing, and given we have ADM I hope we can set up 4231 perhaps.

2941~~~
Thought he did well, was pleased to see him out there. Have said previously that I wouldn't mind him in that diamond role if it meant some more minutes.

2942~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2943~~~
Some good pieces of skill there. Has probably earned another start. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oatH9MFRMn8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2944~~~
Now I know where he fecked off from Fellaini thread.

As for Adnan, I think he was our best attacking player, probably the only one who didn't look like a clown and tried to make things work.

2945~~~
Thought he played quite well. He dithered on the ball a lot but there wasn't any space for him to move in to and there was no option of an overlap. He still needs a loan though, the odd game here and there isn't going to do him any good.

2946~~~
TBH I'd rather we just put him in the team for the next 4/5 games, we have some decent fixtures, and he might just add that extra bit of energy we need.

2947~~~
He looked like a player who was really trying to impress, possibly even too much - by which I mean what Shearer commented on at HT, that he was sometimes delaying playing the ball. Basically he was a bit selfish, which may well have been due to his limited gametime recently that he was desperate to make a big impression.

I would really like to see Januzaj get a solid 4-5 starts so he can start building up his form and confidence. Unfortunately if we go back to 3-5-2 then its hard to see a place for him.

2948~~~
I think it was his best performance this season. He made wiser choices and recycled possession better instead of trying to dribble through defences. and that is what he need to become a starter under LvG.

2949~~~
I am glad you posted that. With all the praise he was getting above I was starting to think I watched a different game. He was really wasteful. He put one decent ball in the whole game and nobody made a run because they just expected him to waste it like the previous 4 or 5 attempts.

When you have Di Maria, Mata, Herrera and Rooney available he isn't good enough to be in the team.

2950~~~
He should be playing the next game. Build his confidence up. Reward inform players with another game, especially when him, Rojo and Herrera are the only players you can call inform after that crap last night.

I hope LvG has found out he's better on the left. I can't really recall him doing anything on the right.

2951~~~
He actually put two very good balls in right across the 6 yard box as well as a few in behind the fall back for Blind who was actually the one that was wasteful.
He wasn't brilliant but the reason he is getting so much praise is because he was so much better than everyone else (Rojo aside).

2952~~~
Hopefully. He did well but was clearly lacking in confidence, but as he game wore on he started sitting on the ball less and had quicker decisions which was better. He just needs to get a little run of games, hopefully. Being back on the bench for the next few is exactly what we shouldn't do to him as he'll be right back where he started.

2953~~~
Spot on

2954~~~
I know using Liverpool as an example is tempting fate, but couldn't Januzaj operate in a fluid front 3 similar to how they are playing? Not as a winger but as an inside forward?

2955~~~
I actually thought he was pretty poor for the most part, but he really seemed to step it up in the last 20 minutes or so. Taking a lot more responsibility and putting in a few good crosses. So fair play to him for that. He definitely needs regular football though, and I think a loan would do him the world of good.

2956~~~
I didn't think he was that good either. The last few moments really saved his performance.

2957~~~
The Cambridge game was not easy for a forward player to play in due to the small areas of space and cruching tackles going in. I thought he done very well considering.

2958~~~
Yeah that would suit him better. A role in a fluid 3 behind a striker would be the best.

2959~~~
Don't really see how anyone could have thought he was poor last night. I thought he was good throughout. Very neat and tidy in difficult conditions and one of the few players looking to make something happen. He holds onto the ball a bit too long at times but when nobody is making runs or giving him any options I don't see how this is avoidable. Its definitely preferable to just whacking aimless balls into the box.

2960~~~
The only attacking player trying to make things happen, much better then Di Maria which should be a statement of intent but the way we are playing under LVG I recon Messi would look average! 

Deserves to start next game along with Herrera

2961~~~
That was more due to them playing terribly rather that him playing well. I admit he did play quite well though. But so did Donaldson. About 31 years, you?

2962~~~
It really is funny. In the first half he was constantly looking to make things happen. What do people want him to do if there is no final third passing option? You saw him receive the ball with his back facing the goal and then would turn to face the goal often times dribbling to find an opening. People then say he's not taking responsibility if he passes it back despite trying to look for an opening.

In the 2nd half he was trying to make things happen, but that seemed more like he was dithering on the ball compared to the first half. He resorted to either dribbling or crossing which if it works, fans will praise. If it doesn't work, fans will say he's frustrating. Either way, from a wide position those are his two instincts. I personally preferred his 1st half and looked more mature in that position. He can easily find passes in the final third if there is one to be made. The only blemish in the first half was the lack of shooting which he obviously should have done.

edit: btw, that januzaj touch video is missing some of his touches from the 1st half.

2963~~~
Rewatched the game today. Adnan was one of the positives in yesterdays game, it wasn't a barnstorming performance by any means but it was solid. He looked intelligent in possession, he tracked back well.. there was no arrogance in his play, but he seemed confident enough. That was a good base from which he can hopefully kick on from for the rest of the season.. I see him returning to the fold a little now with wilson hopefully getting less game time. Adnan is the more talented player and needs the minutes in my opinion.

2964~~~
I think this is probably the perfect description. Was impressed by his aptitude.

2965~~~
Some claim he was selfish or took too long with his decision making. I saw a lot of patience in order to avoid possibly costly mistakes. The reason he had to be so patient was due to a lack of options to pass the ball to. We didn't have good man movement and that was really the key problem for him. In the first half he was playing it safe and van Gaal seems to have told him to be more assertive, which he tried to be in the second half but it wasn't easy given how the game was being played.

2966~~~
I think it was just lack of confidence a little, he had a few chances to start a break/counter attack and he slowed the game down instead. Had a good game though overall.

EDIT: Also at the end of the first half, Di Maria put him in, he could have taken the shot or taken on the defender but he chose to play it safe. Minor criticisms though, I'm sure if he gets a run of games, he will become more positive in those situations.

2967~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">
</span>
- Januzaj's agent

2968~~~
interesting. is adnan himself wanting to move or what caused his agent to state this?

2969~~~
Apparently PSG made a formal enquiry.

2970~~~
Good, now if he would get more chances, that will be great.

2971~~~
It's maybe a different context but even though Van gaal rated Alaba, he didn't used him a lot at the beginning, he even sent him on loan.
Van gaal like Ferguson rate training, so they can appreciate a player but not play him until they are 100% that they will make a difference.

2972~~~

2973~~~
I just don't understand real life. On Football Manager he becomes a world class player half way into this season whilst being tutored by Juan Mata. I just don't get why he's not consistently world class yet. I bet it's Juan Mata not tutoring him! Louis needs to pull his finger out and start holding more backroom staff meetings! <span style="color: #ffffff">White text just in case </span>

2974~~~
He needs game time.

Wonder what PSG offered for him.

2975~~~
I though Van Gaal hated him, and was ruining his career though?

2976~~~
Well, he isn't exactly helping his career if he blocks this move and still doesn't give him the game time.

2977~~~
Yep! I was confused by some saying he was shit. No one covered themselves in glory but Adnan was probably one of our top 3 performers. Looked the most threatening of all our attackers too.

2978~~~
Why would we want to loan him to a club that could a) potentially turn his head b) probably wouldn't play him that much anyway?

Januzaj will get his chances. But right now, there are better players ahead of him in the pecking order.

2979~~~
I felt he did ok and was one of our better players in the last game

he needs 3/4 games to see the best of him return

2980~~~
Surprised no one has commented in here. Thought he looked really dangerous in the 2nd half. Was probably a bit quiet early on but grew into the match. Think he did enough to deserve another start.

2981~~~
Played with great maturity today, similar to the game against Cambridge. Great to see.

2982~~~
That's a normal Januzaj performance when you put in on a right system.Nothing to see here.Should start the next game.

2983~~~
Thought he was good. I don't mind him in that role and think he could grow into but I much prefer him higher and wider.


Would be great to see him get anther run during the week

2984~~~
I thought he played better in the first half. He looked more mature in the midfield role. I thought he showed some immaturity in his play as a winger which is normal as a 19 year old. The only thing that sucks about the lcm role is that he doesn't get to roam to the right side of the pitch where he can make great use of his left foot.

2985~~~
I thought he could have cut in onto his right more often today, after the first couple of runs the fullback realized he was going on the outside.

2986~~~
He did well. Still think his role is to play in that hole.

2987~~~
I think I know what Louis Van Gaal has done with Januzaj this year.

Remember when Rio's book came out? He claimed that there were certain youngsters who felt as if they were entitled to a place in the first team. Januzaj came into the spotlight and his personal life was all over the local dailies and Nando's. It just seemed that the boy was getting a little ahead of himself and Giggs noticed this. This is Manchester United we're talking about. You have to earn your place in the starting eleven. I understand he was exceptional for us sometimes last year, but the way Moyes used him was verging on desperation rather than him "giving youth a chance."

Young players with talent need to be shown that they're not the sole focus of the main team. They have to look up to their seniors and have to earn the coach's trust. Moyes was feeling heavily pressured and played Januzaj because he might have been the only tricky type winger we had, yet as LVG shows putting trust in the likes of Young and Valencia can completely transform a player's output.

By giving him the number 11, Louis and Giggs showed him that he was wanted here. But by not playing him as a first name on the sheet, a message was sent that he needs to earn his place. He needs to put on some muscle and play the system well. He needs to be disciplined and believe in the manager. Louis had to recultivate the boy's need to prove the manager that he's good enough, rahter than feel entitled to play like how he was made to feel under Moyes.

This may seem all too psychological and trivial, but to bring up somebody the Manchester United way - hard work, discipline and loyalty - we need to instil ethos of the team over the individual at all costs.

Yesterday, he showed great improvement. He has clearly grown physically stronger and stuck to instructions. His decision making is still a little warped with his need to impress sometimes overtaking the goals of the team, but that is youth in all its glory. He's played two games in a row now, and I get the feeling that Januzaj has turned a corner with LVG and, we might just see him play more in the final run-in to the end of the season.

2988~~~
So it is Moyes' fault?

2989~~~
his natural position is something similar to what diMaria is currently doing for us.  but with falcao, rvp, rooney & diMaria this is not easy to break in.  staying more deep to help midfield in team play can gain him more play time, is better than not playing at least.  using it to develop his game and wait for this time, just like what cr7 had once gone through.

am very pleased to see his current development within the team

2990~~~
Saying it is his fault is far too harsh. We have Moyes to thank for letting the boy show his potential and making him believe he can make it here at United. Yet, he was not protected by the manager and was treated like a senior player. That is never good for a young player unless the player has overwhelming skill like the likes of Messi and Ronaldinho at 19. Januzaj has just as much potential but he's not there yet. 

When the team was failing, it was imperative for the manager to put Januzaj on the bench and shield his sense of winning and losing. Instead, he was put there in the first team in desperation. One may say that if you're good enough, age does not matter. "Look at Pogba!" They'll say. The difference is, we risk damaging the identity of the club and the structure of the 'egosystem' in the club. These things matter and managin egos is a major part of football management. At Juventus, Pogba was given his chance and he has shown phenomenal growth when he played. Januzaj played a couple of times at the start of this season and he didn't look quite right. Now he's starting to show his true worth.

2991~~~
I thought he was quiet in the first half but very good in the second. It's just a confidence thing and he needs to get it back. His second half was promising.

2992~~~
Looked decent in the 2nd half. Was probably trying a bit too hard to impress.

2993~~~
His touch is just excellent for a young lad. Give him a run of games and he'll get better

2994~~~
Good post.

2995~~~
Very happy with his peformqnce yesterday. He seeemed to be playing with freedom and the confidence was back. Didn't always make the right decision or beat his man but like I said, he looked comfortable again, and with his talent, if he's comfortable and confident, I have no worries at all.

2996~~~
Seems to have develop great upper body strength needed for PL. He was holding players off much more physical then him with ease which was quite surprising considering he was regularly brushed aside in physical battles last year.

2997~~~
Fellaini has been looking after him well. Probably pushing him harder in the gym as well

2998~~~
I said a few weeks ago that he was my biggest concern of this season (and maybe Rafa). Not that I thought he was going to leave or anything, but because I just think the lack of minutes he was getting would eventually stunt his development, when he has so much potential. I still think he's so important to the future of this team and I was over the moon to see him get 90 minutes yesterday. He will get better with more games, but even so he was still very good. When we have lots of sterile possession having Januzaj on the pitch is a massive help because he will take people on and commit defenders which creates space for his team mates. He gets us on the front foot and his end product will sharpen and improve. He's quite clever in the way he tries to go past people because he will be one on one with a defender and when it looks like he's slowing the game down and making it easy for the defender he manages to unbalance them and put them on the back foot which then gives him that half a yard to get past them. I love watching him again and I'm glad he had some of his confidence back and wasn't afraid to take people on. Last week he seemed so scared of losing the ball that he played it overly safe and that meant that we saw very little of what he is best at (particularly in the first half).

His hold up play was brilliant yesterday too. He was strong and determined and managed to wriggle away from tight marking quite a few times.

2999~~~
This makes total sense, excellent post.

3000~~~
This is not just harsh but complete nonsense.

Moyes handled him exceedingly well and at one point took him out of the team while 90% of the posters were demanding him to start every game.

3001~~~
Well, that's your opinion. I can live with mine.

3002~~~
Yes but Moyes also called him Cruyff in public. I know some of us thought that he reminded us of him in terms of style but discussing it amongst fans and going to the media about it, as well as over-hyping him to the media was irresponsible. It was in stark contrast to his approach with Rooney where he was over-protective.

3003~~~
Brilliant post mate.

3004~~~
Didn't Moyes only compare him to Cruyff the other day? Not whilst he was here. 

I'm not sure how people are making out that Moyes did anything wrong with Januzaj. There was a period in November/December where he probably played him a tad too much because he seemed a little burnt out for a while after, but he didn't hype him up or give him any huge ego or put expectations on his shoulders.

3005~~~
Thanks Mr. Best Newbie! (No sarcasm intended - words can be quite one dimensional!)

3006~~~
Do we think he'll be given a similar sort of training regime to Ronaldo?

3007~~~
What do you mean by that ?

3008~~~
Think it was Ronaldo pushing himself very much over the limits rather than us imposing anything on him to be fair. It has to come from Adnan that he wants to kill himself in training/gym.

3009~~~
Ronaldo was a scrawny lad when he came to the game, he was beefed up.
Yeah true, although he was still put on that specific routine when he joined the club to cope with the physical demands of the league.

3010~~~
Yeah, Ronaldo is a bit of a freak with regards to his work-ethic and will to succeed. I think it's a bit unfair to expect others to exhibit the same drive that Ronaldo did.

But there's no doubting Adnan could do with bulking up a bit. He has definitely improved his strength on the ball but he still looks a little lightweight sometimes. I did think he was pretty good yesterday, though. His comfort on the ball and natural ability is there for all to see, there's just his end product which needs to develop - something which is perfectly understandable for a player his age.

3011~~~
Ah, probably, I always think about that when I see Wilson and Januzaj, the club will probably create a program for them, but Ronaldo was very determined and trained harder than anybody.

3012~~~
Absolutely agree that there's no harm in him getting stronger by the way, he's a tall lad who's already hard to knock off the balance and it would be even harder to dispossess him with a little bit more strength.

3013~~~

3014~~~
love watching him play. especially on the left. very exciting player and one always looking to go to the goal.

3015~~~
Watching that vid he has definitely gained in strength and stands his ground more, would have gone to ground a lot more last season with some of those bumps etc.

3016~~~
Good that he gets some game time now but as many other players, needs even more to find his best form

3017~~~
I thought he was OK honestly. Better than he's been at other points this season but his final ball/shot still needs a considerable improvement.

3018~~~
<b>Adnan Januzaj must make the most of his talent to shine at Manchester United, admits boss Louis van Gaal </b>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2935542/Adnan-Januzaj-make-talent-shine-Manchester-United-admits-boss-Louis-van-Gaal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...hester-United-admits-boss-Louis-van-Gaal.html</a>

3019~~~
Rumours of a loan to Everton? Bollocks?

3020~~~
I'd imagine so.

He'd get plenty of game time at Everton though, but I don't think playing in a side struggling for confidence is a wise move for Januzaj.

3021~~~
Bollocks.He's starting games for us and playing half a season for Everton won't suddenly make you better than Juan Mata (which seems to be LVG's criteria for him to get picked).

3022~~~
Are Mata/Herrera so damn lazy at practices?

3023~~~
Herrera is a hateful person.

3024~~~
He's just stating the obvious, to be fair. He's seeing these players in training every day and will be picking the team based on well they're performing. This is something the redcafe back-seat managers can never get their heads around. The fact that players who aren't starting games must not be convincing the coach to play them with their performances in training.

Good to see Januzaj winning him over. Hope it continues.

3025~~~
Did seeing them in training make him play Rooney in midfield and Di Maria up front, because if so then he should also try to look at the pitch during actual game.

3026~~~
Uh. Yes. 

Of course, systems that work in training won't always work as well in a match. I'm sure he's clued in enough to realise that without you reminding him. What with him being an extremely wealthy and successful football manager and you being some bloke on the internet.

3027~~~
So that's how it works now, you have to agree with the manager because they do this profesionally and we're just fans?

Perhaps we shouldn't really criticise players either because they're professional footballers while we're just sitting on our arses watching through the games.

3028~~~
You don't have to agree with the manager and nobody is stopping you criticising players. I'm just pointing out that it's worth giving a manager the benefit of any doubt, when it comes to picking his XI. So long as the training sessions aren't televised, there's a hugely important bit of information that the manager has and we don't. And that needs to be taken into account when discussing which players do and don't get picked to play.

3030~~~
Ironically, a 0-0 draw with a League 2 side seems to have been the turning point for Adnan under LVG!

3031~~~
Heh. Possible. I thought he was really good in that game. Him and Rojo seemed to be the only two really trying to make something happen. Fingers crossed he gets a decent run of games now. Such an elegant footballer.

3032~~~
Weird to drop him altogether after 2 very good performances. Maybe being saved for the weekend?

3033~~~
Like Shaw....he was in the team hotel yesterday

A friend of mine has a picture with Shaw from yesterday. He has said Januzaj was there too.

3034~~~
Just played on Saturday so probably giving him a rest.

3035~~~
Adnan speaks:

3036~~~
Got a knock so not involved today

3037~~~
This is the dilemma and probably the unbalance LVG is talking about.

3038~~~
Interesting read... and very misleading headline. I expect better from the Guardian.

3039~~~
Any more info on that? Likely to be back soon?

3040~~~
The scary thing is, Januzaj would suit Real Madrids fast moving counter attacking play so well.

Eep.

3041~~~
No he wouldn't. He'd be too slow for them.

3042~~~
Yeah, Isco and James would have to settle for a spot on the bench.

3043~~~
First I thought they rest him because he looked quite exhausted after finishing his first 90mins after a long time but it is a knock they say, hopefully he is back soon, he was nailed to start against WHU..

3044~~~
Even if this were a valid concern, the proper time for it would have been last season before we signed him up to a five year contract. We can now match Madrid's spending power, whilst offering any outfield player a better chance of game time (because our team is worse than theirs). So a contract ending in 2018 means no-one, not even Real Madrid, is getting their hands on Januzaj against our will for at least two or three more seasons.

Ugh, bad timing. Still, if it's just a knock he could be fit for West Ham, which might be a better opportunity anyway. After all, he's done plenty of impressing against small teams in his time with us already. What he needs is proper Premier League game time.

3045~~~

3046~~~
Even more than Rooney?

3047~~~
Sounds like he knows that he'll probably have to leave to get regular games and prosper. 

If top clubs keep on vying for him then our only hope he's very patient and loyal

3048~~~
Yeah, that tweet is bullshit. Rooney had racked up well over a 100 PL appearances by the time he turned 20.

3049~~~
What top clubs would sign him now and play him more than us?

3050~~~
He played the last two games in a row and only missed out on a third because of a knock. Now would be a very strange time for him to want to leave to get game time.

Also, he's got a five-year contract with us. If we don't want to let him go, he'll go nowhere.

3051~~~
so he was not playing because of a knock? fine then..really was hoping he would start again, as he was brilliant against leicester. the confidence is surely coming back into his game, which is nice to see..

3052~~~
None.

3053~~~
It says "for Man Utd".

3054~~~
Ah. Good point. Rooney may have had slightly less, in that case.

3055~~~
Rooney had 35 games for United before turning 20 according to another tweet I saw (which I can't find anymore!)

3056~~~
He has done quite well for his age and position, i really do hope we keep him, wouldn't mind loaning him out though, <b>he would have been our Sterling</b> if our midfield was as terrible as Liverpool's.

Edit: was said in the context of a youngster from the academy playing well enough to obtain a starting role for the team, as he did last season... not in any way,shape or form trying to compare his ability to Sterling's, who is far more superior ... for now.

*for those too stupid to understand*

3057~~~
That's some logic there.

3058~~~
Even though he plays up front for Liverpool apart from when he played at the tip of a diamond in a 3-0 win at Old Trafford in a 'terrible' midfield.

The Sterling comparisons are becoming increasingly strained.

3059~~~
Its a fair point but it doesn't need to be a top top club. He'll see what Pogba has done and if he continues to feel like he won't be fully utilizing his skills then he'll wish he was elsewhere where he's shown more respect. I do think he's a lot more level-headed than the likes of Pogba though so maybe he's just happy for the opportunities. 

I don't think many here would say he's at the best club for his development right now would they? He's too risky of a player for LvG

3060~~~
Considering LVG broke the PL transfer record to sign a <b>much</b> riskier player, how'd you figure that out?

3061~~~
Not comparing performances or anything like that, just saying if we didn't have quality players like Di Maria,Mata,Rooney etc Januzaj would be getting more games like he did last season.

3062~~~
Agree or Disagree?

3063~~~
You don't agree or disagree with magical thinking. You just nod and move away.

3064~~~
Your midfield is as "terrible" as Liverpool's. Better on paper but being better on paper means feck all.

3065~~~
LOL 

Coutinho - Henderson - Can - Sterling - Gerrard -Lallana - Lucas - Allen - Markovic  

Di Maria - Fellaini - Blind - Carrick - Mata - Valencia - Young - Rooney - Herrera  

Every single player in our midfield has had at least 2 MOTM performances this season and have scored 24 goals combined compared to your 28 goals, despite most of them being out injured or played out of position.

3066~~~
Err yeah, firstly like I said you might have the bigger/better names but your midfield isn't functioning any better than ours is. If anything it's worse, basically every thread you read on here has someone complaining about how your strikers are starved of service...

Secondly, rating a midfielder's performance on goals is pure nonsense. I don't think our midfield is great but I don't see how a Man Utd fan can think they have a midfield unit that is clearly better.

3067~~~
So what would you rate them on ? even though both our strikers have basically been useless this season,we have created more assists, had a higher % of possession,that also includes passing accuracy and successful passes... i understand our midfield hasn't exactly been spectacular - but that may be due to the fact that we have been struggling with injuries, a lot of fans don't even know our first 11 as we haven't had the chance to watch them for a full month.

You can afford to play Sterling because he brings so much more to the table than your other midfielders which isn't the case with Januzaj as individually our midfielders have been superb, they are still not in-tune as a team but individually they have all won us games, you can't say that about all your midfielders. 

Regarding the shortage of ball supply to our strikers your team is actually not doing better than us in that department as Rickie Lambert is your leading scorer (strikers) with only 3 goals followed by Balotelli and sturridge with 2, whilst RVP has 9 goals, Falcao has 4 goals and James Wilson has 2 ... Rooney has 8 but you could argue that he hasn't played as a striker this season.

3068~~~
well, that might be in regards to Real specifically.

but it's pretty tedious reading over and over again here about how "slow" he is. adnan has plenty of flaws, but speed is not one of them.

3069~~~
Hearing rumours about him being used in a possible swap deal involving either PSG's Marquinhos or Everton's Seamus Coleman.......

Surely has to be complete bollocks? otherwise god help us.

3070~~~
Of course it's complete bollocks.

3071~~~
Any word on what the severity of the knock? Is he out for weeks or is he expected back at the weekend?

3072~~~
What??? I can't think of many threads complaining about the strikers being starved. It's mostly that the strikers aren't quick enough. United's midfield is stronger than Liverpool's hands down.

3073~~~
For United? Rooney joined in 2004-05 and played 29 games in that season and I think he turned 20 by the time 2005-06 season rolled out.

3074~~~
Sterling is miles better. People need to give this one up.

3075~~~
How many of them were for Everton though?

3076~~~
I don't really buy into it for what it's worth, not to the extent others do at least, but you just need to read the Falcao thread. Every 2nd post is "oh, but he doesn't get any chances, the midfield is to blame".

I think it's a bit of both, like you say your strikers aren't the quickest but I don't think your midfield has been performing well either. Not helped by injuries either in fairness.

Since Lucas came back in to our team our midfield has been performing very well, especially if you consider Coutinho a midfielder.

3077~~~
Rooney had played 105 PL games as a teenager. Prodigy.

3078~~~
The context of that statement was regarding starting role not performance

3079~~~
Grauniad actually has a better way of looking at this, number of minutes played for United as a teenager. 

Unsurprisingly, Rooney is way out in front despite making one appearance less than Januzaj (and a dozen or more less than Giggs/Ronaldo)

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1423135053847/adnan_januzaj.svg" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1423135053847/adnan_januzaj.svg"/>

Still. Adnan is keeping good company. Which has to bode well for the future.

3080~~~
Happy birthday Adnan!

3081~~~
Would take him to Nandos for his birthday.

3082~~~
He has as much natural ability as Sterling. Sterling has had constant games, and has developed quicker because of it. Januzaj hasn't been afford that.

The way Liverpool play suits Sterling too. They should just keep him upfront as Sturridges partner, be a nightmare for defenders. I really dislike Sterling for some reason, but you can't deny at the moment he's ahead of Adnan.

3083~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3084~~~
Denilson would not look out of place in the current United midfield - every thread in here regarding United's midfield, performances or tactics has a multitude of posters bemoaning the passing backwards/sideways and pointless possession for the sake of it.

Going by that overwhelming opinion you'd think the highlighted point is, well, pointless.

3085~~~
So my point is pointless because a group of people decide to moan about our passing on every thread? you do realise fans complain about everything right? i mean fans who call RVP wasteful in one game go on to say balls don't get to him in another, despite the fact that all his goals this season have come from assists... i fail to see how having more possession,higher passing accuracy and successful passes is ..."well,pointless" as you say when it is an argument about our midfielders,when i mentioned the goal tally of our midfield.. he/she disputed it by saying you can't base how good a midfield is by using goals so i got actual stats that you can base a midfielders performance on.. and ours was still superior.

If goals,possession,pass accuracy and successful passes are pointless when judging a midfielder, then how on earth are you supposed to judge one?

3086~~~

3087~~~
I know he's only 20 but he needs to improve his decision making quickly, especially in the final 3rd or he only has himself to blame if he's left out the team for another few months.

3088~~~
By watching players and analysing them, assessing the traits in their game and how effective or ineffective they are. For example, Carrick is incredibly two footed and uses either to play balls over a range of 40 yards, can thread balls in between the lines and is composed under pressure. That tells me more about him as a player than his average passing accuracy or whatever. Don't get me wrong, they can be useful, but was Xavi so impressive because of his pass success, or the range of passes in different situations he played to get it?

3089~~~
Seems pretty pleased here. Quality kid.

3090~~~
Couldn't have said it better

3091~~~
Why is he holding onto the ball so long he gets doubled up on? Brainless.

3092~~~
Overrated

3093~~~
I know, lets play a young winger, in midfielder, against West Ham, away.

That couldn't possibly go wrong could it?

3094~~~
He's been quite good actually..

3095~~~
He's years away from being ready for this level. He should be nowhere near the first team but Mata, Falcao and Herrera will also go missing in games so we have no one on the bench good enough to take the place of Januzaj

3096~~~
Hit and miss, mostly miss, but a helluva lot better than Di Maria.

3097~~~
Game intelligence isn't trying 8 through balls and hoping 1 or 2 come off. It's about making the right decisions, where and how to pass the ball and keep the move going. The move dies when Januzaj gets the ball; every couple of months he'll resurrect it with some amazing piece of play starting from scratch and a gif will be made.

He might technically have a great passing ability but he's lightyears behind even Eriksen and Oscar, let alone Fabregas, Silva and Modric when it comes to decision making and slicing a defence open.

3098~~~
What are you lot going on about? One of the few who looks like he's making something happen.

3099~~~
His decision making is really poor.

3100~~~
No white text??

Seriously one of the weakest players today.

3101~~~
What? He's done more than Falcao, Rvp and Roo combined.

3102~~~
Done what exactly?

3103~~~
Even those passes where he set up Rvp and Shaw in good positions, has been more than they did all match.

3104~~~
Looking more and more like a flash in the pan player to me.

3105~~~
Thought he was decent after the break. Di Maria or Falcao should have been subbed instead.

3106~~~

3107~~~
Adam Johnson is more dangerous than our forwards/wingers.

3108~~~
I do think Januzaj needs to bulk up. I know he is young but he seems so under developed for a premier league footballer. It was the same last week. Hes obviously got the ability but he hasn't got any kind of physical presense. Hes so weak, just brushed aside.

3109~~~
Really bad today

3110~~~
Wank. Waste of space today.

3111~~~
He was mediocre but again I feel he's the one who'll make something happen. I dont get that from our strikers.

3112~~~
Very Very poor today,really disappointed in him as he is not taking his chances.

3113~~~
His substitution was a joke, our only decent attacking player prior to that. Falcao, RVP, Rooney and Di Maria were outrageous. Blame it on the manager.

3114~~~
This place is way too reactionary after every game. I thought he did well in the 2nd half and the other midfielders should have been taken off before him. He and the rest of the midfielders didn't control the game in the first half.

3115~~~
He had 1 or 2 decent moments, but 59% passing accuracy is comical. And that was an improvement on the first half

3116~~~
Plays at a snail pace.

3117~~~
Looks like he's stuck in molasses at times, shame but he is not doing enough to warrant starts.

3118~~~
Average performance from him but due to the unbalanced nature of our team it was easy for west ham to plant 3 defenders on the left wing because we have no right winger.

3119~~~
You prefer passing it backwards to Blind, Shaw, Fellai i right? Playing it safe?

3120~~~
A lot of the time he was trying to play it safe and got it wrong

3121~~~
Looked like a boy wearing his father's suit.  Had no control of the game and made poor decisions.  Rooney or Mata should be #10 ahead of him.

3122~~~
Oh no! His decision making isn't as good as some of the best players in the league/world that are 3+ years older than him. What shall we ever do?

3123~~~
Exactly. Ehile he needs to do better, this stat means nothing considering he's one of only a few trying to make something happen.

3124~~~
not very good today. he's been meh since he signed the new deal.

3125~~~
False, he tried to pass forward constantly even though there wasnt space for it.

3126~~~
... He wasnt even playing as a number 10. Useless comment.

3127~~~
Needs to improve.  Was ineffective today and has been mediocre when he's had his chances this season.

3128~~~
I guess we need to complain about someone who wasnt the source of our problems today...

3129~~~
LVG should not be playing Januzaj in tough away games. He was non existent tonight. Absolutely atrocious. Our next game home to Burnley is the only type of game Januzaj should get game time in

3130~~~
Wow, didn't expect this reaction. For the 15 minutes after they scored all of our creativity was down the left flank with him and Shaw. He played a few good one twos with Shaw, and was one of the only players to actually try an incisive pass.

3131~~~
Incorrect. He did not try to play 12 passes of his 22 passes forward and create things, it was a fraction of them

3132~~~
Not a good day for him but it's clearly not his position so deep in midfield either. The strange thing about van Gaal is that he talks about our lack of balance but than plays Rooney and him in CM which makes the side even less balanced than with Herrera or Feallini in it.

3133~~~
He also made good runs out wide to take defenders away from Shaw. Both of them did fine in the 2nd half.

3134~~~
I still feel a loan would've benefited him hugely instead of staying with us this season.

3135~~~
He doesn't build off the momentum of the move, but slows it down again then speeds up, rather than getting the job done quickly enough to catch the defence out.

It's like watching Moussa Dembele; has to have his moment to show how skillful he is, even if it slows the team down. Incredibly irritating.

3136~~~
He should only play on the wing, and seeing as we don't play with wingers, he shouldn't be playing.

3137~~~
If we had won, Januzaj would not be talked about in this manner. But since we didnt, every player gets bullocked, often unfairly.

3138~~~
I liked him a lot, him and Shaw. He did have some bad passes, but you could see the idea behind them and some of them were the kind of passes which the defender stops, or if it goes through, it's a huge chance and usually this balls don't go through.

3139~~~
I didn't think he was bad today. In the first half where we offered nothing he was the most creative option.

3140~~~
Gave him a 5 today. Did some good things, still gets himself crowded out too much.

3141~~~
You want him up against Boyd and Trippier? Really? Mo Farah gets worn out by those two.

3142~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps4e4bc046.jpg" src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps4e4bc046.jpg"/>

He completed three forward passes.  He wasn't the worst player-but didn't show much to me.

3143~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0JA0NszRlQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3144~~~
Not a particularly impressive performance. Perhaps was a mistake starting him today, at the expense of the Fellaini or Herrera. His football intelligence is just not there yet.

3145~~~
Playing a young winger in central midfield against West Ham away didn't work?

Blimey, who would have predicted that one?

3146~~~
I thought it was a decent effort. Not a great game for his display his qualities with so many passes bypassing the midfield and against a team like West Ham but he tried to get involved and he wasn't bad.

3147~~~
And RVP, falcao, di Maria, Rooney are?

3148~~~
He was average today, which is still better than the other more 'experienced' players. That thing he does where he slowly dribbles right into a crowd of opposing players is pretty frustrating.

3149~~~
Slows everything down too much.

3150~~~
Exactly, it bugs me. Could have quite easily had him playing at the tip of the diamond and he would have been a lot more comfortable.

Though IMO, he shouldn't have started away to West Ham and that spot could have gone to Fellaini. 

ADM the LCM.
Fellaini the RCM
Rooney at the tip.

Would have made much more sense in a game like this.

3151~~~
Considering he's barely played this season, throwing him into a game away at West Ham, in central bloody midfield, is bloody mental. There is no logic or sense behind it. Its just fecking stupid.

3152~~~
Could not agree more. He wasn't great but I thought, in the 2nd half especially, he looked our best creative outlet. Him and Shaw combined well for a patch too. Was a disgrace that he got subbed off while Di Maria stayed on the pitch.

3153~~~
Still better than Radamael falcao...

3154~~~
That's hardly a feat, is it? Anyway, I think LvG should manage him better. He should only be starting games against lowly teams at home which is really handful. He should only be coming on in away games if/when the points are in the bag.

3155~~~
Shaw not being a Evra/Rafa offensively might also slow his impact?

3156~~~
Eesh. Just seen his stats. Awful.

3157~~~
Woeful

3158~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3159~~~
The Falcao bashing makes it's way to the Januzaj thread. Wow.

3160~~~
I think he made some good combination of play with Shaw on that left hand side but overall wasn't convincing but who was? Don!t get why people are all over Januzaj when you see absolutely disgraceful performances from senior players like Rooney or RVP. DiMaría had a poor game also..

And why the hell don't we switch him with diMaría so they could play in their natural positions ffs?
This arrogant genious on the bench needs to get a grip or has to go..

3161~~~
I find it strange that he is all of a sudden back in the team as he didn't seem to be anywhere near the squad for a few months.

Not really kicked on and I can see his position in the squad over the summer being under threat if he doesn't improve.

3162~~~
To us it makes sense to play Januzaj as a 10 and di Maria as a lcm, but I think Gaal likes that Adnan is a little less adventurous than di Maria. Pretty much every player is less adventurous than di Maria though. Adnan is clearly a #10. He even plays the lcm like a 10 a lot of the times by being further up the pitch compared to Blind and Rooney. That is why he saw much less of the ball compared to them. He only made 22 passes, where as Rooney and Blind each had 50 passes.

The problem is that this is probably the only way he can get playing time right now. He can't play as a 10 because Mata is better right now.

3163~~~
It's encouraging and good to see LVG is going to give the kid a chance, he just needs to take it. He's still a young player learning his trade some games he is going to be sh!te we have to accept that, the responsibility is on him to learn and improve. Saying that none of the senior players showed anything noteworthy so it's harsh to slate him too much.

3164~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3165~~~
I'm glad he's sorted out his defensive contribution. He always presses the ball and is aggresive in the intercepting of it, really good to have that at such age and in that position.

3166~~~
He needs to really up his game in the 2nd half. Playing like a headless chicken

3167~~~
Every time he gets the ball there's about 4 opposition players around him. The lack of wingers is killing him.

3168~~~
He's done well given the shambles around. 

The midfield behind is all over the place and the front 2 strikers given zero dynamism. Some decent runs to relieve pressure and couple of good passes.

3169~~~
He's feeding on scaps so obviously he's going to struggle to look like he has loads of time on the ball.

Was one of the only decent things about thst half I thought. And that's not saying much.

3170~~~
Impressed with his holding off of the opposition and ball retention so far.

3171~~~
Working hard and had a couple of good runs, the 2 OAP's up top don't offer much for him to look for.

3172~~~
Not looking very effective today and getting ganged up on that left flank. Without Shaw he is finding it hard today.

3173~~~
The only times I perked up in that half was when the commentators mentioned Januzaj.

3174~~~
I think the lack of in form strikers is killing him right now. no one seems to be making runs or helping out when hes on the ball. Falcao's hold up play is a joke at this moment.

3175~~~
I console myself by imagining him playing in a better system with players around him that will support and help and let him do these creative things.

3176~~~
thought he did ok, needs more support

3177~~~
Our best player by a mile. He's the only one actually trying anything for fecks sake, everybody else looks like they can't be bothered.

His defensive play has been very good too.

3178~~~
Needs support. Getting triple teamed but no outlet.

3179~~~
Atleast looks like he's trying, but getting crowded out of it a lot of times in that first half.

3180~~~
Weren't people so convinced he wasn't slow? He doesn't look much quicker than Falcao or van Persie.

3181~~~
same here!!

3182~~~
Wut. He's miles quicker than either of them.

3183~~~
I'll be honest at the start of the season i was really frustrated whenever i saw him about to come on or start but the boys class.

Still unsure about him as a winger but his ball retention is something special

3184~~~
Quite decent, solid defensively and kept the ball in the team. Still think he should offer more offensively, unlucky not to score.

3185~~~
If by "much" you mean "miles" then I agree.

3186~~~
Looked lively tonight but he used to be able to glide past people with ease.  What happened to that?  Now he looks like a young frustrating Nani.

3187~~~
He's brave and I like that, once he hits form things will come off easier for him.

3188~~~
My MotM after Smalling (he wasn't that special, but he made the result). Our best attacking player today.

3189~~~
His decision making at times can drive you nuts but you can see the talent there.

3190~~~
Probably his best game of the season?

3191~~~
Well he got my MOTM, held the ball up well, ran at their defense and put plenty of defensive work in, pleased with him, the system is dogshit and out strikers are out to lunch, so him and Di Maria had to do everything from out wide.

3192~~~
Did ok today.

3193~~~
I thought he played ok. He has no runners up top, so cannot thread any balls through.
I do think he tries a bit to much some times, but at least he tries. He seems the only one who wants to pick up the ball and run forwards with it

3194~~~
Did decently.

Lacking bit in confidence still and was being double teamed constantly.

3195~~~
If that is his best game, then the bar must not be high. 

IMO he has been crap again. Running into opposition players, losing the ball every second touch, waaay to selfish, end product absolutely horrible. 

It's either he's not ready, or doesn't fit into the system.

3196~~~
I thought he was disappointing. Too often he just run forward like a headless chicken and lost the ball almost every time. Got better as the game went on though

3197~~~
I liked him a lot. I know he didn't do to much, but in the first half him and ADM were the only once able to take the ball forward. 

Also, he had no back up, where were the full backs? He was always surrounded with 3 players and had no other choice then to take them on.

3198~~~
That's absurdly harsh.

3199~~~
He ran a bit and decided to take more touches than anyone else before making a pass but it was hardly great. Did better on the wing than through the middle, though.

3200~~~
Got crowded out so many times but where the feck where his teammates. We don't attack as a team at all, just the odd burst on their own from Di Maria and Januzaj and that's it. The opposition will just put 3-4 on them and the move will fizzle out.

3201~~~
This. He was closed down by 3-4 Burnley players every time he got the ball, but due to our lack of movement up front he had no options to play the ball. Often looked like he ran himself into a corner, but a lot of the times he had no other choice as far as I could see.

3202~~~
Didn't do much for me, but the main thing is he's being played. Would rather he get experience in the team and an opportunity to take on the responsibility as a United first team player. Can only get better in my opinion and he done a decent job. Just a lot of room for improvement, especially with his potential.

3203~~~
He gets crowded out because he is too slow in his decision making and constantly ignored the fullback who was overlapping.

3204~~~
Please don't take him out of the team Louis, lets see what he can do in these run of games.

3205~~~
People taking him accountable for losing the ball when he has 4 defenders in front if him and has no support, seems legit, he's Robbem/Cruyff after all.

3206~~~
He did ignore the fullback too often, but it also seemed on too many occasions he had nobody to pass to.  I remember at least two instances of him just stopping and looking around for ANYONE to pass to.

3207~~~
Probably a bit harsh, but really what were the positives from his game today?

3208~~~
there was one counter attack in the 2nd half where he raced down the pitch, looked around, and had to pass back because neither ****ing striker was anywhere near him. diabolical on their part, but highly indicative of their issues this season.

januzaj had a solid game, and was only behind di maria for me in terms of MOTM. might seem harsh on smalling, but i'm so disgusted with our defenders i can't give it to him.

3209~~~
I agree with both.  He looks dangerous running at players, but flatters to deceive.  Still, I hope he gets better from here as he's denying Mata some game time.

3210~~~
how about he continuosly drives the ball forward and is always looking for something to happen? of course it doesn't come off nearly every time, but he at least is consistently moving the ball forward.

just imagine if we had strikers to move the balll to. when wilson came on for falcao we immediately looked better up top. no question in my mind now that wilson is more important to this team than falcao, but that's for a different thread.

3211~~~
Slowly finding his form, should be hitting the heights of last season around March after a few more games.

3212~~~
This. Clearly lacking confidence but he takes too long to do nothing with it. Slight signs of improvement lately though, just irks me that he gets in over Mata

3213~~~
ignoring the full back? what full back? the guy was alone all. the. time.

i'm a huge fan of rojo, but he did himself no favours today.

3214~~~
I thought he did well on the ball but was too often crowded out. I don't think we can blame him entirely for running down blind alleys, since he was one of the few who dared to try things.

Edit: Give me that over Valencia's sprint-sprint-sprint-STOP AND TURN and pass backwards any day.

3215~~~
Decent game today, but he was marked pretty tightly. Still, not bad.

3216~~~
Burnley were tired in the second half and we were on top so we stretched them on couple of occasions when we had tons of space. The problem is not that it doesn't come off nearly every time, but it doesn't come off at all. Yes he was tight marked, but so was AdM, but the latter made a peno and assist and could've another peno and generally looked much much better compared to Januzaj, although he started slowly in the first half as well. 

Yes, Januzaj is still very young, but his decision making at the moment is awful and combined with a lot of selfishness. He often takes wild shots when there are actually available teammates in better position. Tends to run with his head down. His crossing was poor. Neglected not only the full back but sometimes just to keep possession rather than just going straight into the defenders. 

Someone compared him to Valencia. The trouble with Valencia is that he is afraid to challenge even one defender and he turns and passes back. When you have 2-3 defenders infront of you it's common sense to retain possession rather to give it away and possibly create a counter.

3217~~~
Didn't do much but I love his no-fear attitude of running at players, we need balls like this in our team and from our manager.

3218~~~
i think what you pointed out better describes adnan's flaws in general as opposed to his performance today, but fair enough.

for my money, there were no fullbacks in the equation today to begin with as he had next to no support.

3219~~~
Was pretty useless at #10 today. Looked much better as a winger

3220~~~
Thought both he and AdM were more effective being flip-flopped from last game's positions.  Thought he was most effective on the wing after Hererra came on and formation switched to a more traditional 4-4-2.

3221~~~
I prefer him as a #10 but with freedom to roam to the wings. He is more unpredictable then.

3222~~~
Seems to be the way our fans are towards our youth players, yet you still see people defending RvP and Evans, bizarre. 

I think Januzaj had a decent game tonight given he had no strikers to aim for, but in truth I think he lacks the pace to be a winger, he'd be better as the #10 in a 4-2-3-1 with two quick wide men either side of him and a mobile striker in front IMO.

3223~~~
The second half was more like last season. He freed up and started to take on his man, and showed confidence and courage to keep going.

I don't think he does bad in CM. The problem is he is doing exactly what the manager is wanting. Recycle the ball. It wastes his qualities. Januzaj plays at best with no fear and exuberance to play. He is not someone who is disciplined or frankly good enough in midfield to get a grip of the game.

3224~~~
No help from Rojo the two useless strikers and Rooney...  But gave a shit today and gave his all my motm with Herrera..

3225~~~
Much better today than vs. West Ham.

3226~~~
With a run of games in the team he can bring more balance to the team. He has gradually been improving with each game but only very slightly....He still looks about 2 years away from being properly ready but I don't think Van Gaal trusts Mata anymore and at least Januzaj can help stretch teams with his pace.....if he can find any sort of consistency then he will be absolutely vital in our hopes of scraping that 4th spot

3227~~~
I gave him 6 today that is what he deserved. wasn't special but it was good to see him as 10 today switched with ADM even if it didnt go well mainly due to Rooney the playmaker and two strikerrs who couldn't hold the ball. I guess Herrera will take Januzaj's place next game. Anyway it's always good to see him getting minutes, on thw wing he was much better in the second half..

3228~~~
Yep. His problem today as a 10 was that he didn't see enough of the ball. He was good in tight spaces, and used both wings to dribble when he had the chance. As soon as he gets better at finding space so he can see more of the ball he will start to tear it up.

3229~~~
Inexperienced, young winger plays games in Central Midfield and doesn't play that well.

In other news, water is wet.

3230~~~
Unlucky not to score from Di Maria's rebounded shot with an off the line clearance that beat the keeper.

Definitely a drastic improvement however it's quite worrying, a player we've had for over a season and a half and we can't still decide what his best position is.

3231~~~
Why is he trying to be a hardman though with his scowls, moaning and silly hairdo? He is built like a 'frail teen' as someone famously billed him last year, his angry face is worse than Henman's fist-pump or Henry's gay aggro face.

3232~~~
Is it really that worrying that so young an attacking player be tried in different positions?

At any rate, I don't think he had much of a chance in the first half to impress.  Did show glimpses afterward of danger which he couldn't quite capitalize on.

3233~~~
Was quiet in the first half but class in the second I thought. Ran with the ball and dribbled past defenders easily and got in dangerous positions. The final ball will improve with time and experience. Both him and di Maria were our most dangerous players though.

Awful hair though, should sort that out.

3234~~~
The only reason he gets crowded out or double marked is mainly because he runs himself in trouble and isolates himself from his teammates. Horrible first half, much better in the second.

3235~~~
This.Can't believe what people see in the games sometimes.Losing the ball and giving it away means the player is shit to people no matter what the circumstance is.

That won't happen unless Januzaj is rested.

3236~~~
Was one of the players who was willing to try things and not afraid to be out there. It wasn't a vintage peroformance but still very good. He and Shaw in combination on the left side of the pitch can form some partnership if given a consistent run.

3237~~~
The only one of our forward players who played with any urgency. He's definitely part of the solution. If a few others around him had played with the same verve, it would have been a much more comfortable night. He seemed to be quite bereft of options at times and it wasn't always his fault. Easily the best he's played all season.

3238~~~
He seems to be getting better, hopefully he keeps getting chances. Him and di Maria out wide could be awesome to see if both start to get some form.

3239~~~
The boy has the skill and the confidence but my word his decision making is terrible. He needs to know when to give up the ball and move into space instead of trying to dribble his way to the goal. He doesnt have a great eye for a pass but thats because hes not actually looking to pass it to anyone.

3240~~~
Wasn't great but I saw enough about him for Van Gaal to persist with him for the next few games.

3241~~~
This.It would benefit us tremendously in the long term and not like we have many difference makers in the team at the moment.

3242~~~
I'd rather he be criticised for daft decision making than be totally 'dead' as a player and offer feck all going forwards.  Yesterday he proved he has a lot to give if he can be moulded properly... there were times during this season he played at the pace of a snail and had no desire to take a man on. Yesterday he was full of confidence but he just needs to execute all aspects of the game with more polish and cut out the clumsiness.

3243~~~
I was very happy at the way he at least attemped to take on his man. Yes, he wanted too much and it was pretty frustratung to watch. Had the rest of the team played well, it wouldhave been encouraged. Remember how frustrating Ronaldo was at the start?

3244~~~
He's a top talent and showed it yesterday, I thought he played well. As the 10# he was good and I believe that is the position he will grow into. Its now weather he will reach his potential in LVG philosophy or not, I mean in the diamond formation were currently playing. I can really see him progress only if we play in a 4231/433 formation as back up to Rooney

3245~~~
He wasnt good in the no. 10 position, he didnt create anything and was not enough on the ball. He was a bit better when he played on the wing as he got more space. But still, he lost way too many balls and seriously needs to improve his form. TBF, he also needs games

3246~~~
Looked much better when we switched to 4-4-2, along with Di Maria. I think stretching the game out and playing at a quicker tempo suits our players, they just don't know how to play the slow possession game. It may not be to Van Gaals liking, but we just do not look a threat when bumbling up and down the pitch.

3247~~~
Happy with Januzaj against Burnley, he was thinking positive and trying to do something.

3248~~~
He's actually one of the few players who's capable of playing 'philosophy'. I know he said he was struggling with the defensive side of the game but his style of play is well suited to 'philosophy'.

3249~~~
this. not his best performance but he was okay.

3250~~~
I agree, my only complaint with him yesterday is the silly fouls he kept giving away. Rooney is also a master of those.. especially when challenging in the air.

3251~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7S8Gf16NczY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3252~~~
He kept trying to beat too many players for me which sometimes meant he played himself into trouble. I like seeing players dribble past their opponents, but sometimes you need to pick and choose your attempts. He's probably just a bit over eager at the moment.

3253~~~
The boy will be just fine - he is one of only two players (ADM) that have the ability to make a run with the ball that is more than 20 meters. 

The caf is all over the map on this one.  He gets slammed when he plays too safe and he gets slammed when he takes chances and they don't come off. 

Unfortunately, any player with creativity is going to struggle in this system because our lack of movement.  The creative types like ADM and Adnan need space and we create absolutely none.  I still haven't figured out if it is the players or the system or a combination of both - either way something has to change as the only positive at the moment are the results.  Our current style of play is almost unwatchable at the moment.

3254~~~
He needs to be brought along slowly, which LvG seems to be doing.

3255~~~
I don't think he should be starting tough away games like West Ham, keep him for home appearances against relatively easy teams.

3256~~~
Had Januzaj's shot not been blocked on the line verdicts on his performance would be more positive. I thought he played well. In the first half he was running down blind alleys, but everyone was rubbish in the first half so I can't hold that against him. In the second half he took players on, committed people and while he didn't always make the best decisions he gave Burnley something to worry about. I was pleased to see him look more like his old self. I remember how awful he was against West Brom, last night was a big step back towards what we wanna see from Januzaj.

3257~~~
He did ok, still not back to his best and a work in progress but the talent and potential are definitely there. With us trying to play Falcao and RVP up front I think LVG has realised he needs someone else other than Di Maria who is going to try and beat players. I think it is very difficult to play behind those 2 though because their movement is too similar and limited to certain areas of the pitch and Falcao’s attempts at hold up play are so bad it is almost laughable at times

3258~~~
LvG has fecked up a lot of things, but his handling of young players has been excellent in all fairness.

3259~~~
I was very impressed with the game and he showed great courage and ability. He looks to be gaining some good form within a team who is struggling, I can imagine in a team who was on fire (like chelsea) he would be even better. It must be hard when everyone around you fails to show the same level of courage and zest for the game.

3260~~~
this looks promising... <a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2015/02/12/88-pass-accuracy-6-dribbles-manchester-united-star-flourishes-in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2015...ribbles-manchester-united-star-flourishes-in/</a>

3261~~~
One problem with him right now is he's desperate to score a goal or do something spectacular. He really needs a few to give him that composure.

3262~~~
i agree. was a big shame that his attempt got cleared off the line. would be a weight off his back, i'm sure.

3263~~~
He needs to learn when to take an extra touch on the ball and when to get it in quickly, he must be frustrating to play with at times, as was Ronaldo in his first 3 years here, it will come with experience.
I really like the kid, I'm aching for Wilson, Shaw and Adnan to be the cornerstones of our team for the next decade.

3264~~~
I agree - and hope LVG builds with these players in mind.  He should build straight up the middle and that means he needs to get in a proper (under 25) holding midfielder and at least 1 proper center half that is also young.

I realize these players do not grow on trees but if he could solidify up the middle with young talent - we could fill in the rest.

3265~~~
Agreed. I'd much rather see him be brave and make mistakes.. than end up a scared frightened little boy or even worse Valencia. He needs to balance it out and not overrun with the ball.

3266~~~
First half he was the only decent attacker.

3267~~~
The only problem was that he didn't see enough of the ball. Once he gets better at finding the space so he can see more of the ball he will become more dangerous as a cam.

3268~~~
I don't get the flak players like him get about decision making. We want to moan about the turgid (rigid) way LVG has us playing, where everything is predictable but, when we have players that try make things happen, want to be critical of that. Their not always going to make the right choice that we see after the fact, especially watching from the sidelines or on TV where we have perhaps a better view but, at least players like him and Nani in the past gave us that bit of unpredictability we are sorely lacking right now.

LVG needs to tell players like Januzaj and ADM - go out, play on instinct, make things happen, when the reigns are let off we'll see them shine a lot more.

3269~~~
This. Still very young so expected. Can improve and hopefully will get enough time to (with us). But yeah it is frustrating especially when the team on a whole are playing poorly.

3270~~~
Like most young players (and a fair few people I play with on a sunday) he needs to be more aware of his limitations. But that'll come, I'm just glad he's getting the game time he needs to make headway in that regard. I think a big problem form him is that the area where he had a lot of joy dribbling from last year is the position Di Maria likes to take up tucked in deepish on the left.

3271~~~
I'm quite impressed with how his strength,balance and general ball retention has increased since last season

3272~~~
Firstly Louis van Gaal has said we need to play with more ball speed, not so much a quicker tempo in the sense he doesn't mind sideways and backwards passes but we need to be attacking with speed, he said after the West Ham match that the team needs to play like they did when they went a goal down.

Secondly he has no problem with the 4-4-2 and he played this with AZ.

3273~~~
He's looking much stronger this season and I was impressed with his performance against Burnley. He needs a goal just like di Maria to kick start a run of form again. The problem was when he went on a run, he often ran into 2 or 3 defenders, I put this down to us not having strikers, who can pull defenders away and out of position to free up space for Januzaj and di Maria to run into. 

To get them this space I'd start Rooney and Wilson upfront, with Herrera filling in Rooney spot in CM. 

I'm more than sure he's gonna come good and capable of winning us games, like he did last season.

3274~~~
Best game of the season and it's no surprise that it's against Sunderland. He always seems to perform well against them.

3275~~~
Breath of fresh air. Love seeing him on the right.

3276~~~
Brilliant cameo, always looked like making something happen with good passes/shots/dribbles. Keep it up.

3277~~~
He is more effective than Di Maria

3278~~~
Made a real big difference today.

Valencia and he linked well.

3279~~~
Fantastic today... Really hope he continues like this

3280~~~
Played well.

3281~~~
Ran at defenders, kept them uneasy and created havoc which we scored from. Who knew that could work?!

Great to see from him, hopefully he keeps it up while RVP is out

3282~~~
Made the difference when he came on, great to see. Hopefully eh gets a start next game.

3283~~~
Today, yes. He's still not actually put any numbers on the board this season though.

3284~~~
Bloody brilliant today.

3285~~~
Good to see that positive drive. A little frustrating at times but all in all, very good.

3286~~~
Terrible crosses and greedy. Ended up assisting Rooney though.

3287~~~
And Di Maria has?

3288~~~
Played well. I'd still like him to mix it up and come inside a lot more.

3289~~~
Lol that wasn't even an assist to be fair, he was selfish on that play as well

3290~~~
I don't even need to answer that.

3291~~~
Changed the game when he came on as suddenly we were dangerous on both flanks and he is so much better on the right than on the left for me, it gives him more options on the ball and his use of it was very good today with him making quick choices and now dawdling.

3292~~~
Much improved cameo from him today. Good stuff.

3293~~~
Was good, delighted for him.

3294~~~
Good cameo from him. He looked confident with the ball. Hopefully he can kick on.

3295~~~
Excellent performance. He should probably get the nod midweek after that.

3296~~~
Yes, obviously. 

Thought the lad did well today.

3297~~~
Finally playing with a bit of swagger again. His and Smalling's performances were the two real bright points from today.

3298~~~
Been a while Adnan! Good to see him play like he did last seaso.

3299~~~
Looked a lot more like he did last season today, played with confidence too. Only thing would like to see him do things a bit sooner, he seems to like taking an extra touch or two when doing something first time would be better. Hopefully he keeps his place.

3300~~~
He actually has a fairly good shot on him I have to say. With a bit more fortune he could have had a goal or two today. Still maybe he is shooting a bit too much when playing on the right. In the end if he scores from those shots no one will really complain. I just hope we stick with the 4-4-1-1/4-2-3-1 for some time and he can get a bit more playing time in those wide areas again.

3301~~~
Those are terrible numbers for a World Class player who has played more games than Januzaj,if we are expecting average performances from Di Maria then he has been more effective.

But that is not the case now is it?

3302~~~
He has 10 assists and 4 goals in 23 games. Thats not 'terrible' numbers in the slightest. In fact, his numbers are good, its his overall performances that aren't good enough recently. He's putting up the numbers though. 

Whats not the case?

3303~~~
I don't think he needs to go out on loan anymore, he has the ability to change a game from the bench

3304~~~
The Januzaj we all loved last year.

3305~~~
Love the fact that he was positive and took some shots today because he does have a good shot on him. If you see the goal again it is an excellent effort and Pantilmon actually did really well to save it

3306~~~
LOL yes it was.

3307~~~
Needs to do more of that. He's still only 20 so it's not as if he's under huge pressure to be productive, but when he's on he's got to look at taking his man and trying to create some havoc in the opposition backline. Opens things up for everyone else.

3308~~~
We can't complain about too much passing and how few shots we have and then say someone is being greedy. It's about damn time someone decided to be greedy. 

Happy to see this, which is what I was hoping for all season
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-8sCMJU8AAgb9Y.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-8sCMJU8AAgb9Y.jpg"/>

3309~~~
Good today and a possible good partnership with Valencia on that side.

3310~~~
LVG had the big talk with him at half time and clearly Adnan delivered. Pretty much guaranteed to start on Wednesday, which would be great to see.

3311~~~
He can be very frustrating, but the fact that he wants to take on players is what we all like to see, we just have to be patient with him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3312~~~
Much better from Januzaj compared to his earlier appearances.  He needs to improve his crossing and shooting as well as his decisions.  Generally he looked composed, confident and looked to take on defenders.  Good signs <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3313~~~
I like that he's shooting (somebody needs to) but he needs to check his options before taking another low-percentage shot at the side of the net. He'll need to improve his decision making on when to shoot and when to pass, but otherwise an assured performance. I don't want to be too generous since a large portion was against ten men, but his skills are obvious.

3314~~~
He was right to be selfish on that play. He had the shot and knew he could test the keeper. Some of his decisions were poor but he is young and he must be allowed to learn. I believe he has the tools to be a world class winger or attacking mid some day.

3315~~~
I guess LVG isnt ruining him after all?

3316~~~
Good performance but he needs to work on playing a final ball.

3317~~~
He needs to know when to slow or quicken play. Quick pass, hold up play or take his man on. He's on the right direction though.

3318~~~
I actually have Been thinking a while. Adnan is the perfect model for Gaal to work with, mould and develop.  Good today taking into account his season so far, but ultimately it's what I expect from adnan. Maria needs to take a look at himself.

3319~~~
2 brilliant weighted passes for Valencia, 1 very good cross to Fellaini, won us 2/3 corners, good shot which resulted in a rebound, one free kick in a good position, his decision making was very very good today.

3320~~~
Really happy to see this. Will do the kid's confidence a lot of good. Needs to improve his decision making at times, but hopefully that will come. Probably a good thing not to have him playing too much this season. Anyway, let's hope he follows up this performance with another good one.

3321~~~
That's more like it, nurture that juice Louis!

3322~~~
Excellent performance today, think us as fans and him directly needed it in reality.

Good to see that as the game went on his confidence was building and building, much like last season. Hope he gets a good run now and keeps it going because the only problem I have with Adnan which may be a tad harsh is that this season when he knows he is back in the starting lineup he starts to become complacent, let's hope that isn't the case now.

3323~~~
I agree that he can be frustrating, but today that wasn't the case at all. The frustrating one was the guy he came on for.

3324~~~
Thought he was great today, after di Maria's disappointing performance. The full back didn't know what Adnan was gonna do, which was great to see. The thing I liked was even though he's left footed, he's starting to learn to use his right a lot more. Step in the right direction from him anyhow.

3325~~~
It wasn't that bad, but today he got himself in very good positions but sometimes chose the wrong option to make a chance bigger, not that i am saying he was bad or anything, i really like him.

3326~~~
Once he learns to control Valencia (who is brainless in attack at times) this can be a hell of a duo. I always thought he will be the best as wide attacker on the right, and overlapping fullback will be a great option. 

Delighted with him today, I love his style of play, dribbling especially. LvG substitution for 60m winger will do wonders for his confidence I reckon.

3327~~~
Still remember being one of the few backing him to get chances a few months ago when everyone was throwing their toys out of the pram when he wasn't playing. I think van Gaal is managing him very well and it was great to see him impact the game the way he did.

3328~~~
It would be nice to see him get a run now out wide, not in field.

3329~~~
Best he's played all season by far

3330~~~
This was a very good performance from Januzaj. His decision-making was much better, and it showed in his performance today. He was a bigger threat than di Maria on the right, and he gave van Aanholt lots of trouble whilst di Maria wasn't able to do so.

He still shows that he's quite a good dribbler on the ball. His close control is amazing, and his deliveries into the box are also quite good. His two shots from the angle were very good and required Pantilimon to make two good saves. He still has moments of naivety, however, but I'm sure that he'll smoothen those rough edges as he continues to play more.

He just needs to learn when to slow things down and when to speed them up, but when he gets that down, he'll be a dangerous wide player.

3331~~~
Anyone have a gif of his fancy footwork by the touchline near the end of the game?

3332~~~
Fantastic talent but he needs a run of games now.

3333~~~
Love seeing that.

3334~~~
Offered a lot more for us today than what Di Maria ever did.

3335~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5JvCqeb4wU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3336~~~
Good performance off the bench. Hopefully he gets a start now. Deserves to be playing ahead of Di Maria anyway. Don't have a problem with him shooting, no one else seems to want to take shots.

3337~~~
Loved his performance today. Him and Valencia had a good understanding and the variation in his play was fantastic. Early shots, hitting the byline to cross, using Valencia as both an option and a decoy, I hope that's what we start with in the next game.

3338~~~
I've always felt they have a horrible understanding. Valencia doesn't realise he is left footed and plays the majority of his passes to his right foot and they always seem to get the overlap wrong. Well not wrong but never quite right.

It can only improve though.

3339~~~
Nice to see him playing with confidence. He looked like he was let off the leash yesterday he's been so conservative this season. Nice to see someone taking players on and getting shots and crosses in at any opportunity. He was a little rusty with some of his crosses but he's entitled to be. Hopefully he can kick on again and get a run of games now.

3340~~~
Don't get me wrong, it was ten men, but I thought the overlap was used to great effect yesterday. Valencia got free a couple of times inside the area and it also opened up a lot of opportunities for Januzaj to attack the full back 1v1. It probably can improve, but it's the first time I've seen us use it frequently this season and it needs to happen more often. I was absolutely seething when Rojo didn't do the same on the other side when Young played the reverse and he'd stopped running.

Really good performance. His decision making still reminds me of a young Ronaldo but good to see him so confident despite being benched for a few matches.

Made the difference today and we really need to be signing younger players in the mold of Januzaj who are hungry and have pace. I know its easier said than done but we have always rebuilt our teams in the same manner.

3342~~~
Love this kid, so entertaining to watch, brought us to life when he came on the pitch yesterday.

I would much rather have him in the starting 11 than Di Maria. I was worried that signing Di Maria would stifle Januzaj's development, and though neither player has been particularly impressive, I do think Januzaj deserves more time on the pitch.

3343~~~
Good to see Adnan back but let's not get carried away his end product is woeful at this stage.

3344~~~
Di Maria was immense the first 5 games he played for us, or do you mean just for that one game?

3345~~~
Yes sorry, I did make it sound like that. No at all I totally agree he was brilliant for us in the first few months.

3346~~~
Adnan did what he needs to continue to do. He was disciplined and he went down the line and cut inside. He looked to create and score. More importantly, even if it's a lucky assist (shot saved and someone taps it in), you need to put it in good areas of the pitch so if you don't benefit someone else might. We need to rely on him in his position, to create 10+ goals and score a fair few himself. Hopefully he can keep being productive.

I would say other then the odd exceptional cross by Di Maria, he's not better then Nani. Nani rarely overhit crosses. Would prefer Di Maria giving us invention in midfield but he needs to be stronger.

3347~~~
Ideal game for him, especially off the bench. He should gain confidence from games like this at home. Good for him.

3348~~~
he did ok. nothing great but maybe he should get some additional minutes now and give ADM a rest.

3349~~~
.Thanks for this, missed the match.  Looks encouraging and seems like he challenged his full-back well consistently

3350~~~
Apart from scaring their defence s**tless (their left back just couldn't handle him – he was either giving aways corners, being skinned or fouling) and setting up the second goal no, he didn't do much.

3351~~~
I thought his showing yesterday looked a lot more mature and professional. Maybe LVG was quite clever by not over using him like Moyes last season.

3352~~~
That's a very basic and easy way to look at it. Januzaj has some great performances under Moyes, some inconsistent ones, some good ones under van Gaal and again, some not so good.

If he doesn't have a good showing next time out, I don't think it can be down to the use of him between Moyes and van Gaal.

3353~~~
Well we shall see....<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3354~~~
fuc4 sake so that's great now is it , jesus wept.

3355~~~
That was much more free-wheeling and swashbuckling thank anything else we have seen from him so far this season.

I would love to know what van Gaal was saying to him on the way to the tunnel at the end of the first half.

3356~~~
No, it's just not 'nothing great' or 'ok'. Jesus wept is right.

3358~~~
apart that he was 44 times better than 60mil diMaria he did okay..

Nailed to start next game

3359~~~
I met him last night. Sound lad is our Adnan.

3360~~~
agree 100% , like i said not great , did ok , worth more minutes and sit ADM.

3361~~~
Which Nando's?

3362~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> nope, but his best mate Felli was with him

3363~~~
They seem to be glued to each other these days.

3364~~~
Definitely a step in the right direction, hopefully he does enough in training as well to earn an away start. Just hope he can provide a spark to end our away curse too...

3365~~~
Oh come on... I cant be the only one who wants to hear all the details! I'm a sucker for this sort of thing.

3366~~~
DIdnt watch the game but saw highlights, I like how he took few shots and was really confident and look composed. Definitely deserves to start on wednesday.

3367~~~
Adnan Januzaj in "a winger playing well when being played on the wing" shocker.

Mind you, saying this in jest, but LVG is probably legitimately amazed by this...

3368~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> basically, I was at some restaurant with a group of friends. Not sure when they come in but a couple people spotted Fellaini and Januzaj across the other side of the room. One lad tried going over to them but security pulled him away haha. Eventually, they went up to the bar with the people they were with. A few of us followed and saw Fellaini first but he seemed eager to get back to his bird. Security wouldn't let people in the VIP. But Adnan came over to speak to the DJ and so I went across to him, had a few words, got him to take a picture with some of my friends, then I got one with him. He seemed pretty chilled.

Hope you're happy now <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3369~~~
People need to stop this, He played 4 games in a row back when we played City and Chelsea. All of them were as a winger, because at the time LVG switched to 4-3-3.

3370~~~
A winger as part of a 4 is different to playing as part of a 3 (and Adnan has looked more comfortable being with the 4)

Also, isn't making 17 appearances and only a handful in your natural position a fair basis to make such a comment?

3371~~~
I'm not really convinced he's a winger tbh or at least I get the feeling that he might become a good winger but he could become a special player if played through the middle.

3372~~~
His natural position is in the hole, he is still learning the winger position.

3373~~~
But then why has he looked a bit shit when played through the middle this season? All his best games for us have come on the wing - this season and last.

3374~~~
How many times has he played through the middle this season?

3375~~~
I agree. He's never impressed me playing through the middle. Always looks better when playing out wide.

3376~~~
Because it's a much harder position to play.

Most creative youngsters fancy themselves as number 10s but when it comes to making the step up to senior football - played with a much greater pace and intensity - they're better off with a bit more time and space out on the wing.

Januzaj has previously said he wants to play at 10 but I think he's a year or two off playing that position for the first team.

3377~~~
That's a fair argument... agree that space and time is his friend, which is why he should be exclusively a winger for us for the time being. 

Going forward, I don't know... fair enough if he thinks 10 is his best position, but his best attributes for me (first touch, dribbling and either cutting inside or going outside) are all suited for a winger. His passing is good, but not on the level of a top number 10 (though that could well be due to a) him not getting to show it off often and/or b) our movement not exactly leading to many great/incisive passes from people).

3378~~~
I just don't think he's quick enough to be a really top class winger. Also think you're being a bit harsh on his passing. I would argue that his eye for a pass was probably his best quality as a reserve/underage player, although we haven't seen a lot of it for the first team there have been glimpses. He's played a few mint through balls in his time.

3379~~~
IIRC, I think last season against Spurs at OT, he assisted a beautiful through ball to Mata or Kagawa. 

His penetrative passing I'd agree with you. Seems a bit underrated because playing on the wing limits the opportunities (angles) to play those through balls.

3380~~~
Agree with this.

It was Welbeck. Also played a nice pass to RVP against Chelsea this season.

3381~~~
He is rarely going to blaze past the quicker fullbacks in the league, but he is definitely quick enough to take people on. His balance and quick feet will be enough to get passed the majority of defenders anyway, there is more than just pace required to beat somebody. 

I think eventually he will turn into more of a Figo type player, rather than a plain get to the byline and cross it style player.

3382~~~
Yep, thanks akash. Also, last season vs Soton at home. Put Rooney through with a mint pass.

3383~~~
Just watching MOTD and it really stood out on the highlights how much more Januzaj created than Di Maria. Arguably a little selfish at times, shooting instead of passing or crossing. That said he got an assist from shooting when he could have passed, so who am I to judge.

3384~~~
He has a bit of everything to me. He's able to go inside, outside, use both feet. I would go as far to say he's a bit more Best-like than anything. I'm not saying he's a good as Best obviously, but he has a similar way of playing maybe. In terms of how he 'plays' with defender's minds and doesn't rely on just pace and power.

3385~~~
If that's the one where rvp followed up ans scored on the rebound, that pass was from a wide position. Great ball though

3386~~~
Yeah, correct! It was, but i wasn't really debating from which passing - i think i was just referring to why his passing is a bit underrated as that of a #10 - because it is more difficult to thread such through balls when you're out wide. That pass though. Ozil'esque <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3387~~~
Totally agree with this. Much easier to tell a kid 'there's your full back, win the battle with him', rather than 'right, you're the focal point of our attack'.

3388~~~
He hasn't done bad as 10 in the sense that he's just bad there and can't pull it off in the future. The only thing he suffers from in that position is finding the right space so he can get on the ball more. His first touch and passing from that position is good.

I think you're underrating his passing and vision too.

Anyways, as a 10 for the reserves he made use of both wings. He picked his moments when to dribble on either wing and found passing angles to create good attacks. I think that's his future position and the better he gets at being more involved while in that position the more you'll see how he's suited for that position.

3389~~~
Considering Falcao's lack of pace and RVP being out, why not try Januzaj up top, maybe as a false #9? That would allow Rooney to play as a #10, while still getting ADM on as a winger. Of course, he'd be crap for hold up play, but we don't really use our forwards like that, unless we're behind and Fellaini is subbed in. 

I've never been impressed with Januzaj's defending so by taking him out of the winger contingent, we'd have a bit more balance since ADM & Young do track back rather well. Plus, he gives more cutting edge & a more finished product than Wilson.

3390~~~
I can't help but just wish he was that bit faster. He's not slow, but he doesn't have that explosive pace that you want from a winger. He's got great skill and ability on the ball, but he doesn't get any 'free' beatings of a fullback by just being able to speed past them, he always has to use some bit of skill or trickery.

Thats why I still reckon he'll end up as a #10 in the long term.

3391~~~
Nah, he and di Maria are both at their best when they run at defenders and get past them. Then they're able to pick out the killer pass or cross. If we want pace upfront, just play Wilson

3392~~~
Needs to start tomorrow. He was very good when coming on against Sunderland the other day, and more or less changed the game for us. Was a constant threat down the right wing, not only by beating his man, but picking out some intelligent passes too.

3393~~~
Slow as feck

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/fastest-players-in-the-premier-league/318120" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/fastest-players-in-the-premier-league/318120</a>

3394~~~
I've always thought he was quite fast, but the consensus on the caf had me doubting myself. 

I assume the opinion that he was slow originally came about because of a low rating on Football Manager, or something.

3395~~~
Perhaps he looks slower because sometimes he takes too long on the ball. Also we pass it quite slowly so he never has that much space to have a go.

3396~~~
I don't think his top speed is awful, but he lacks great acceleration. That first 10 yards is so important for good wingers (sterling,Neymar,Hazard,Moura etc). While he is quick enough to beat most people when moving he struggles from a standstill IMO.

3397~~~
Some papers are saying he's getting the start ahead of Di Maria today...

3398~~~
He would deserve it after a Sunderland performance.

3399~~~
Definitely.

3400~~~
can't disagree with that. still hope di maria plays though, hopefully in place of falcao.

3401~~~
He looks slower because he never receives the ball on the run.  With out dire movement, 90% of the time he receives the ball at a stand still.

3402~~~
januzaj not having pace is not up for debate. he has pace. loads of it. anyone who thinks otherwise is being daft.

if we're going to nitpick on AJ, surely there are other areas of his game that warrant it more?

3403~~~
He's fast once he gets going. But he doesn't have that explosive pace that you want from a winger.

No one is saying he's slow.

3404~~~
He's not slow but neither is he really fast. He can beat players with skill but often the full backs can get back to their positions because he lacks that extra yard of pace.

3405~~~
I agree. Top speed means nothing if we play that LvG risk-free possession game. He has the skills to beat a defender when on low speed though (something Di Maria isn’t very good at- he thrives at top speed dribbling).

Exactly.

3406~~~
Read the numbers. Means that in a race for the ball from the halfway line to the byline, Mousa Sissoko could give him a two yard start and still beat him to the ball. (Which could be relevant as we're about to play Newcastle.) Speed isn't his primary asset - he's not likely to beat many players by pushing the ball past them and sprinting - but that's not really a surprise to anyone who's watched him. Doesn't mean he's slow, he's just not fast enough to use speed as a weapon.

3407~~~
Hope he starts tonight but I get the feeling it will be Di Maria.

3408~~~
He should be starting over fvcking Fellaini.

3409~~~
LVG even said right now that Januzaj played very well against Sunderland... Wondering why that isnt enough to start? I imagine he's set up to be the first sub today.

3410~~~
He's been pretty poor since he came on...di maria was offering a lot more

3411~~~
He was wank. Needs to go on loan IMO.

3412~~~
After the performance the other day he was a let down when he came on, I guess we have to accept the erratic nature of young players.

3413~~~
... LOL?

3414~~~
Yup, I agree

3415~~~
Yeah, no improvement over ADM this time. Kinda wish he came on for Fellaini instead. Only real contribution was getting a YC on Jonas, LOL. After that, nothing.

3416~~~
He was incredibly pointless tonight.

3417~~~
Top throw-in. Quality speed and hand action. Tony V take note.

3418~~~
He took the throw in quickly right before the goal so i'm pretty satisfied with his contribution to the winning goal.

3419~~~
it wasn't a good cameo for him but he should have been handed a start in the first place because when you're coming on at such state of game there is quite some pressure to do something with the game especially when you are as confident as Januzaj so he tried things which didn't come off today as simple as that..

3420~~~
What? He was terrible. ADM was better.

3421~~~
He was a bit shit. But worse than Di Maria? Pffft...

3422~~~
A loan would do him good.

3423~~~
Could he play as a no.10? He's definitely quicker than Mata, Herrera or Fellaini and isn't afraid to play in risky passes.  Maybe he isn't fast enough to be a winger, but I'm sure we can utilise his technical skills elsewhere on the pitch.

3424~~~
What did you lot expect him to do? Newcastle parked the bus, did you expect him to play the no risk passes or expect him to try and make things happen. In such matches it's very difficult for a winger, dribble 2 times and there are 2 players in front if you, pass the ball backwards and you have no influence.. Only the likesnof Robben, Ribery, Messi can handle these situations perfectly.

3425~~~
....didn't get much of a chance, you guys are crazy.

3426~~~
Started brightly when he came on but then sort of faded. Didn't contribute a lot.

3427~~~
Every time he's poor people want to send him on loan...

3428~~~
Good points. We do not feed our wingers quickly enough. By the time they get the ball, the opposition has got men behind the ball and a couple of markers sitting on the winger. A fast ball into space on the counter allows the winger to build up speed and attack the full back. Both Young and Januzaj would benefit from this but our no-risk style of play of late has cut this out of our game somewhat.

3429~~~
Didn't make the sort of impact he made when coming on against Sunderland, but had a few good moments.

3430~~~
Was double marked for the parts I seen.

3431~~~
Can we send some of the caftards here on loan instead?Berry berry screw those mentality.

3432~~~
Helped win the match with that quick throw-in, and in the process helped redeem his, Rooney's, and Young's performances.  

Such is the fine line between success and failure at the top level...

3433~~~
Seconded.

3434~~~
He struggled to get going as a sub, particularly as Newcastle were happy with sitting back in numbers for much of the match. He did play some nice crosses and passes, but given that Newcastle were sitting back in numbers, it was never easy for him to get going as he was double-teamed for much of the time.

3435~~~
... So do you agree with some of the enlightened folk here that he needs to go on loan?

3436~~~
Commentator was hitting the nail on the head tonight.

The way we play just isn't how it used to be and it doesn't suit Januzaj at all.

It used to be turn and run at the opposition now when we receive the ball and would normally run and counter attack with them out of position we stop and let them get back into shape and start passing back and forward, does my head in.

3437~~~
I think he had some useful touches today and I don't think he needs to go on loan...he just needs to play more for us.

3438~~~
Yup... That's possession football for you.

3439~~~
No, I don't think so. He's getting quite a bit of match time here, particularly recently, and he's starting to adapt to van Gaal's ways. Next season, I believe van Gaal will finally have his team set up properly, and this should give Januzaj a better platform to establish his place in.

3440~~~
I don't think he was that bad. Didn't get involved much but wasn't negative with his play or anything.

3441~~~
Fairly anonymous. I don't think the wing is his best position.

3442~~~
He should have replaced Fellaini not ADM and play #10.

3443~~~
Sorry, I was being ridiculous.you provided measured, reasonable feedback by comparison to what a few of the others were doing is all. I was being an idiot.

EDIT: Never mind, I just got the hint from the "enlightened folk" part lol.

3446~~~
He is playing well after a bad start of the season

3447~~~
Well short of the standard we need right now but not far from the standard we have in Young. A loan would help Adnan and he has time on his side and he has potential to be a right player for us but we have a drop in standard right now when he plays imo.

3448~~~
If we're to play a cautious first approach next season then I agree with this.

Just watched the clip posted above. Live, I thought it was a poor appearance from him, on second sighting I'm not quite as harsh but there's no doubt it was below average.

He offered 4 good moments - the pick of the lot was the inside through ball to Rooney, brilliant. There was also the first run he made where he drifted in field from deep, the run that Jonas got booked for and the throw for the goal. The rest of it was certainly no better than ADM's off night so the standard drop point made in the quote is spot on.

A young player of course so he can be forgiven slightly but we must also remember he has 40+ games in a Utd shirt too so should be improving more with time. Last night he was far too individualistic, especially when chasing a goal and his decision making wasn't good again. Choosing to dribble vs 3 men and giving the ball away on the edge of the box rather than recycling and moving isn't right and could easily have been to the detriment of the team who had pressed high and could have been caught on the counter through his sloppiness.

It's easier to say in light of a late win but you've got to commend his guts and effort for trying I suppose. In a better system across the next 2 seasons that way of thinking could work out to be what is needed. Right now, it's not.

That all said, there's clear promise in the lad and even with the critique above, he's showing signs of getting better in this style than his early season cameos and if we're honest, the last 12 months.

3449~~~
Will he ever be played at the 10?

3450~~~
He's really frustrating right now, I say that as one of his biggest fans who championed him as a future star before most fans knew him, he's getting some opportunities but he's just not taking advantage of them right now, its been this way through most of this season.
Watching him can be terribly frustrating, often playing the wrong ball, or dithering, allowing defenders to reposition themselves when he should be more direct.

It's his second year in the league, hes still only like 19, lets not be too harsh on him yet, I've seen him play well on the either wings in the youth, I think his best position will be a no.10 when he devolps fully but right now lets not kid ourselves he should be delivering better when played wide.
Hopefully next year he can progress but its ultimately up to him and grab his chances.

3451~~~
If we didn't have so many 10's i would have played him there.

3452~~~
The biggest problem is not the player, but those who consistently overhype him (not you) in threads as if he's an established star, which always leads to the inevitable disappointment. I recall getting into it with a couple of Januzaj muppets who insisted on comparing him to Ronaldo following his two goal performance last year.

3453~~~
You sometimes heard Cleverley compared to Paul Scholes, when he initially broke into the side, a few years back when we beat City 3-2 in the Charity Shield, progressing to the 8-2 Arsenal win, over that time period, you would hear these type of claims before he got injured at Bolton, being out so long after his good form helped pepetuate  the hype,, so I understand what you're saying in being a touch perplexed by some stuff you hear/read.

I still think Januzaj could and should be doing better this season, but for every Raheem Sterling going from strength to strength you have also have a 2nd year Ross Barkley who's also having a tough year, I guess we just have to remember hes still  more untapped potential at this point than full blooded first teamer as you say.

3454~~~
Its the natural youth player bias imo. People are so desperate to see one of our youngsters develop into a star that they immediately jump on the bandwagon, usually far too early, only to wind up disappointed.

3455~~~
Just checked all my players' season ratings and he turned out to have the lowest (5,5) <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. It's still relatively high compared to the caf's average (5,1), too.

3456~~~
Shouldn't be - he's lowest on the "professional" ratings as well (even below McNair and Blackett). The reality is that he's delivered very little for his minutes on the field. On the positive side - thought he looked a little better last night.

3457~~~
Yeah, it used to be a point or two lower actually, but he's improved a bit lately. Looking at his form chart, he was awful in November and December with a few consecutive games below 5.0, which are keeping his overall rating this low. Hopefully he continues to improve and gets a bit of confidence. He rarely has more than 15-20 minutes on the pitch though which definitely has an effect, as well. Much harder to impress coming off the bench.

3458~~~
Does he have the intelligence of a top player? I have to say I don't think so. I know he's just a kid but football intelligence is largely instinctual especially for an attacking player. The amount of times he takes the wrong option is incredible. hopefully I'm proven wrong but I gotta say from what i've seen of him, he might have the pace and the tricks but not much else.

3459~~~
I think it may partially be down to sort of 5/10 minute sub appearances where you really cannot give higher than a 6 unless something special is done. Defenders would have less than those.

3460~~~
Btw, his best position is starting wide but given license to roam inside freely. That way he becomes tough to mark or double on up also.


Last season he was kind of playing that lot more but this season he has been stuck to the Wing by LVG when he starts from the wide. Same with Di Maria to a lesser extent.

Should play them in a fluid 4-2-3-1 with 3 behind striker all interchanging all over.

3461~~~
I agree, but he has plenty of time to learn

3462~~~
On the other hand,you have countless of idiots ready to jump in and write a youngster off overtime he has a poor performance.

3463~~~
The last two games summed him up for me. One fantastic apperance where he looked like he could take on the world. Another where he had little space and looked a bit impotent and fraustrated. 

That's the reason I shake my head at posts that suggest formations with him as a winger and Di Maria on the other wing usually (another inconsistent winger) and they say things like "I reckon if we played this team all season we would be challenging for the title". 

Well no, we'd win one game 4-0 and lose the next 2-1

3464~~~
At the end of the day, attacking players are judged on goals and assists as that's what wins games.  Sadly, I don't have those stats to hand but I'm sure someone will.

3465~~~
Not really. Writing players off has nothing to do with youngsters,  it's applied to all players.

3466~~~
Wasnt Ronaldo a bit like that when he was in his age. 
Not saying Adnan is Ronaldo's calibre or anything like it but he's young and time is on his side. He'll learn how to play the right way.

3467~~~
You seem to be implying decision-making doesn't improve with age. It's probably the one quality that improves most of all as a player matures.

Ronaldo's decision-making was diabolical in his teens. It's why <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/hes-yong-lernin.125646/">this thread</a> was started.

3468~~~
Seems to have quite a quick mind to me. Lack the application at times, but all the building blocks are there.

3469~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3470~~~
But Ronaldo could more than make up for it with pace, as far as I am concerned in order to be successful decision making is much more important for extremely skillful players who lack pace. That's why players like Iniesta/Silva or even Isco are/have been so successful, whereas good decision making might not always be required for the likes of Ronaldo, Neymar or even Bale in order to still shine.

3471~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think Richardson is my new-old-banned favourite <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3472~~~
How good was Iniesta or Silva's decision making at 19 or 20 though ? It's unfair to compare Januzaj to players of that established class based on retrospective judgement. eg. At his age, Silva couldn't get games at Valencia and was loaned out to Celta Vigo after a similar loan spell at Eibar. Januzaj has plenty of time to improve upon that aspect of his game. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3473~~~
Silva has been a regular for Valencia since he has been 20. Same with Iniesta at Barca. A more recent example is Isco though who has been a starter for Malaga with 19.

But I wasn't really comparing them anyway, just saying that comparing Januzaj's decision making with Ronaldo at the same age doesn't have much relevance as Januzaj is not and will never be a Ronaldo type player. I mean Ronaldo's decision making even now is not that great but that didn't stop him to win his 3rd Ballon D'or because he has a lot of other attributes which make him the player he is.

Whereas the likes of Iniesta/Silva/Isco would lose a lot without their decision making abilities because skill alone won't bring you anywhere.

3474~~~
Ah ok, gotcha mate. That's a fair assessment. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3475~~~
That thread should be in the classics.

I have to say I'm not sure decision making improves that much past a certain age tbh. Aaron Lennon and a multitude of shit English wingers should attest to that. I think coaching is definitely a factor, a new coach could teach a player a few new tricks but footballing vision is not something you can practice and get better at imo.

Also with regards to Adnan, I do agree with united_99 when he says that Ronaldo also had the advantage of become a physical beast and he was also a much better finisher at that age. Scoring goals will mask a lot of deficiencies for a young player and unfortunately he hasn't been clinical enough.

3476~~~
Wrong. He had a terrific first year. The problem lies with the people who expect that sort of level consistently and won't accept nothing less from a 19/20 year old, and write him off for not doing so. Its compeltely logical and sensible to think that he had an excellent first season for us given his age, and not make ridiculous knee jerk statements criticising him and writing him off when he's not followed it up the next year.

3477~~~
This really isnt true. Option taking, habits, vision and awareness are all attributes which can and are coached for. They require different layers of experience and understanding. These are things that can be improved with specific drills and training routines. They take time to accumulate and each player is different in the rates with which they develop these attributes. "Football intelligence" (which is an awful term) is something that can be learned. "Instinctive" reactions are an accumulation of experience and habit.

Option taking isnt an individuals decision making process, there is also an element of cooperative choice involved.

3478~~~
Lets assume that's true. Like you go on to say it's still different for each individual player how much they learn and the rate at which they develop. In essence we're making predictions while playing a waiting game. Any criticism of a player so raw and young should obviously be tempered but my potential ceiling for him has decreased.

3479~~~
I think with respect to predictions on a young players possible  final level of ability there are some things which  can give us clearer opinions. For example Ronaldo. Despite so many talking about how physically developed he was when he first appeared the thing that stood out for me was how advanced he was with respect to his technique and skill levels.  He was clearly head and shoulders above most other young players in those areas, Adnan is not as good as Ronaldo was in those areas at the same age but not too far off so I think with time he will continue to improve, I think he has the potential to be a regular 1st team starter within the next couple of years.

3481~~~
or idiots who say "he'll come good" see anderson/cleverly. it can go both ways. right now you can't write him off. but - he needs to get some consistent form and get consistent run of games to develop that form. wingers have it tough being so isolated.

3482~~~
He just has to work on his decision making, thats his biggest flaw at the moment.

3483~~~
Not wumming above. We need a good performance out of him on the weekend or a Falcao season defining saving moment.

3484~~~
Someone needs to tell him that the objective is not to get in the box and dive but to try and actually score a goal. I don't get these youngsters who dive - that's not how you make a name for yourself.

3485~~~
That moment when he knocked the ball past their full back and got inside the area I genuinely thought he was going to go on and actually deliver on some of the potential, but he predictably just fell over and got a booking because he's not even very good at diving. 

I don't want to write him off but I think Wilson has a much brighter future

3486~~~
It's almost like winning a penalty is more important then scoring for some players.

3487~~~
Who said he isnt pacey? He clearly has pace and great dribbling, I hope we really can develop his decision making and end product.

3488~~~
I'm getting really tired of his diving. When Ronaldo got a reputation as a diver, he was getting lumps kicked out of his ankles. This kid just falls over for nothing.

3489~~~
Stop bloody diving, you're better than that.

3490~~~
That and not playing very well generally.  There was another one where he had his man beat down that wing and just booted it out for a goal kick, and very little of merit from him.

3491~~~
I'm sick of how often he goes down like that. It's not just the diving, it's the fact you've just BEATEN your marker so the opportunity is there for a pass/cross/shot. He does the hard bit and then looks for the cheap option. The difference with Oxlade Chamberlain who looked to get in behind and pick a team mate was clear.

3492~~~
What I don't like is the commentator mentioning he has had 8 yellow cards this season and he's sure half of them have been for diving. You should pretty much research a stat like that before recklessly throwing it out there

3493~~~
Disgraceful diving (again). Cut it out or feck off. 

Not surprised he doesn't get the abuse Young used too, mind.

3494~~~
The timing of his dive was absolutely ridiculous. He was running at goal and a great opportunity to do create a big chance. Pathetic and brainless.

3495~~~
I see nothing in him to think he can ever be a decent player "in the hole". He's a winger and should be developed as such.

3496~~~
Yep it was so stupid and fecking obvious he was gonna go down as soon as he knocked it past his man.

He didn't say <i>this season</i> and half overall have probably been for diving.

3497~~~
Does anyone actually rate him (I seem to remember people thinking he had more talent than Raheem Sterling...) or is it just fangirl teenagers who cream over he's boyish looks?

3498~~~
Great cameo, i was hoping he will somehow score a miracle goal that will save us<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Then he dived.

3499~~~
Needs to start maturing and cutting out some of those silly decisions i.e. diving.

3500~~~
Oh shut up. His dive was stupid, but the fact he got into that position in te first place is something few players on our team could have done in the first place.

Diving absolutely must stop though. He did the hard part, why dive??

Anyway, he will come good. No question.

3501~~~
First time I've actually seen him use his pace. Was an impressive run but an idiotic dive at the end of it.

3502~~~
I'm serious, the kid has been bigged up to be this special talent.. I haven't seen anything from him this season to suggest he is going to make it. The diving is something he has been doing since he broke in to the side, I don't see that changing any time soon.

3503~~~
Played with fire when he came on and showed desire but was over eager and lacked composure at the important moments.

3504~~~
Fangirls obviously.

3505~~~
Can't understand the dive. He had his man beat and could've crossed it.

3506~~~
Think he took a heavy touch and so he went to ground.

3507~~~
Think he believes his own hype? Fecking pish poor again absolutely no end product nowhere near the standard of a United player at the moment (maybe never)

3508~~~
If he doesnt dive there, you're not coming into this thread to spout shit. Youre pissed at him for diving (as you bloody well should be, like everyone else), but otherwise he was good in his short cameo. Falcao or Mata would never have gotten into that position in the first place, so clearly he's capable.

3509~~~
I don't rate the kid.. he has pace and a bit of flair, that's where it ends. The guy is a diver, he will always remain a diver. I wouldn't be sad to see him go.

3510~~~
I'm strangely extremely pissed off yet encouraged by his appearance tonight. His dive was utterly brainless - he was in a fantastic position to create a chance. However he showed a what he's got in his locker in terms of beating a man and creativity. And showed that he's got a bit of pace, too.

3511~~~
I know... I agree. A tale of two Adnan's.

3512~~~
Should have brought him on at half time like vs Sunderland.

3513~~~
Can't believe he feels the need to fall over in that position

Club needs to fine him.

3514~~~
Who exactly does he beat with his pace and who does he dribble? he only gets to the box when there is none marking him

3515~~~
Tried to run past everyone but only succeeded in running out of play or falling on the floor.

3516~~~
He beat Monreal 3 times on pace today.

3517~~~
He is shit.  He has plenty of potential but at the moment he adds zero to the team.  In fact he takes away from it.  
He can get past people reasonably well but is hopeless afterwards leaving the previous moment of slightly-better-than-shit-ness pointless.
Needs to be sent on loan.

3518~~~
He has a lot of improving to do and people were getting way carried away last season. Secretly thought so at the time. The potential is still there however, I'm reasonably confident he can make it in the long run.

3519~~~
I dont think I've ever seen a player with such obvious ability repeatedly do the wrong thing over and over again.

3520~~~
Could not really fault him for that given in what heights a good portion of United´s support and the British media lifted him just a few months ago. Curious to see, how the tides have turned, although he does not do himself any favours with his diving. I still stand by what I wrote about a year ago, that the boy has loads of potential and already quite a lot a ability, but needs to be brought up carefully. He is just in his second full season as professional after all. 

I also don´t think that he is overconfident, quite the opposite actually. I think he lost some of his carefree attitude from last season and the pressure is getting to him. This can easily lead to poor decision making and wanting to take short cuts (diving) to help the team. Does not help that a lot of people expect something special from him, while there should be other players (Di Maria, Mata, etc.), who should shoulder that burden. 

A loan deal for the next season might not be the worst idea. If the manager can´t manage to shield him from the hype and expectations, get him away from that and allow him game time to mature as a player and person.

3521~~~
Shit dive. Must do better.

It's going to be a close call this year to see who picks up the "Running down bind alley's" award between him and Di Maria.

3522~~~

3523~~~
A dive and then he is shit.Yeah so right.

Don't think I need to repeat my viewpoint about the knee-jerk reactions after every matchday here.

I love how people expect big things in a less than 20 min cameo vs Arsenal,most of which we are 1 man down.

If we need to send him on loan then we need to send almost the whole team on loan also.

3524~~~
Considering our whole team is made of non-league players bar De Gea it might actually be best to send him on loan to a better team so he can learn from some proper players.

3525~~~
He's 20, smart and skillful. He'll be great.

3526~~~
What the hell was he shouting when Oliver booked him ? That he didn't dive ?

3527~~~
He was pointing to the edge of the box so I'd imagine he was referencing the bit of contact that he got outside the box.

3528~~~
Frustration more than anything else then. If you're gonna dive though, do it properly when the contact is made and not a second later.

3529~~~
The annoying thing is that he had just beat his man, ffs stay on your feet and do something good with that ball, but no, he decided to go down, a very stupid decision. The decisions and behaviour of our players at times smarks of a total lack of intelligence, what's it all about, am worried.

3530~~~
Well this video clearly illustrates what I saw in this game. I can't believe people thought his cameo was good. He was absolutely hopeless. Messed up every single thing he did. His two decent bits of play, one ended in a dive, one when running the ball idiotically out of play. Young, loads of potential but I'm really starting to get frustrated by the fact he clearly isn't learning from his numerous mistakes.

3531~~~
He wasn't any good in his last game and  everyone was lapping him up. He beat some players, and his final ball was as shite as ever.

3532~~~
To be fair, Welbeck went down easily in the first half and the ref let that go.  Still, I don't know why he dived considering he was past Monreal.

3533~~~
The dive was shite but I liked the way he didn't pussy foot around. Got the ball and then tore his full back to bits whenever he was on the right.

3534~~~
fecking pathetic dive from him. Either dribbled the ball off the field today or fell from a gust of wind. His dive is far worse than Di Maria's. Why do players dive when they've passed their defender?

3535~~~
Its frustrating seeing someone with so much ability resort to such antics. 

He might get a game on sunday with Di Maria's suspension, and he really needs to start taking his chances.

3536~~~
His diving is becoming a real embarrassment. And his decision making seems to actually be getting worse. I'm all for beating the man but he does it when it won't lead anywhere. Sometimes he just needs to step up his end product. Improve those areas and I do think he has the talent to be a very good player.

3537~~~
Indeed. The dive was terrible, but he showed eagerness and flashes of brilliance too.

3538~~~
That's the most frustrating thing with him at the moment, he creates space in dangerous position only to have either a shitty pass or a poor shot.

3539~~~
His end product is awful. Rooney had a right go at him a couple of times last night.

3540~~~
Needs to bulk up

<b>Januzaj heads for the gym</b>

3541~~~
I agree. I think there is good chance he could be very good. No need to loan, play him on the wing against right competition.

3542~~~
Think he'd be best in Germany, he'd be great with fast playing teams giving him some space, wouldnt mind him going to a Gladbach for example.

3543~~~
Only it's not knee-jerk, is it? He's produced practically nothing for a long long time. 
I don't doubt his natural talent, but he has not developed one bit from 18 months of first team involvement, and that's worrying. 

Yes, he's far from being the only one failing to play as well as we expect. But in his case maybe a loan might help at his age. Whereas we're hardly going to send ADM or Valencia on loan to learn their trades, are we?

3544~~~
Maybe I'm being stereotypical but that diving shite won't pass in those teams.

3545~~~
it won't pass for united, either. he's dove once all season, the rest of those dives came last year.

not for a second do i believe that management and the other players in the team will let him forget it either. that shit isn't right.

3546~~~
That move right at the beginning of the video! Why the hell don't we do that more often! That's exactly what we're missing.

3547~~~
Frankly its embarrassing and the lack of pussying around is something I've always liked about United. We have some serial offenders but the bulk of the team is tough enough.

3548~~~
Tell Robben that.

3549~~~
Do you have his # for me then?

3550~~~
Lol, he's 20 years old and he dived. Ronaldo did and then cut it out his game when he matured. Feckin hell, some plays can do no right...

3551~~~
He is going to be a top quality player, there's no doubt about that. I think his current situation is similar to that of Ronaldo when he was at United.

3552~~~
I think with Ronaldo's development; he had more of an opportunity to develop where as with Adnan, we are in a situation where we have to field our strongest 11 every lineup unless injuries/suspensions prevent that.

It's good to know that he's hitting the weights and looking to increase his speed and strength to improve his all around physical ability just as Ronaldo did.

He's just got to gain some more experience under his belt and he'll gradually improve his decision making and surprise us with a nice curve of form.

3553~~~
Not sure what you are smoking but he is a billion miles of what Ronaldo was when he first came.

3554~~~
Don't disagree he will be quality. He reminds me more of Luke Chadwick circa 2001 than Ronaldo.

3555~~~
You say that now, but in his first season there was a pretty even-sided debate about who had more to their game at 18, Ronaldo or Januzaj. Nobody was claiming he was as good as Ronaldo or will be as good, but at that time he genuinely seemed to be overall a more complete package

3556~~~
Nobody saw Ronaldo becoming the player he is today. At 18, he was a tricky but inconsistent winger with great dribbling skills and little end product. Now he's a powerhouse goalscorer whose game is all about pace, strength and finishing. There are barely any similarities between what he was and what he's become.

People who claim they could tell he'd become world class are being disingenuous. He's not a world class version of his teenage self. He's a completely different player in a way that nobody could have reasonably predicted.

Januzaj's development could still go in any direction. Whilst he has the physical frame to become a monster like Ronaldo, I think he'll probably stay slight and turn into more of a playmaker. You'd expect him to be inconsistent for a while yet, if that's the case. Direct comparisons do him a disservice.

3557~~~
I disagree about Ronaldo. He was pure electricity from day one when he came on against Bolton. You just knew there was something special there. I had no doubt he would become one of the world's best players one day.

3558~~~
There's a lot of nebulous terminology there. He's world class for reasons nobody could see a decade ago.

3559~~~
just console yourself with the fact that a lot of fans in here wanted martinez at united this time last year

3560~~~
I can see him being an integral part of our team withing two years. By integral i mean a regular starter.

3561~~~
Fully agree. I've not been on here long enough to provide written evidence but from the first time I saw him play in Lisbon I said he would be one of the best players in the world. He even beat that.

3562~~~
By the time Ronaldo was about to finish his second season with us and during parts of his third, there were plenty of doubts about him and people wondering if he'll develop end product. People forget that now. There are clear similarities to Januzaj.

He's got great ability to beat men, like we saw in that move against Arsenal. It's what he does afterwards that's the problem, like we saw in that move against Arsenal. It could improve, it could improve immensely, or he might end up being stuck.

3563~~~
I really hope Januzaj doesn't develop in the same way to become a world class prick though.

3564~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3565~~~
What? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3566~~~
He frustrates me but I have a lot of sympathy for the kid, sometimes I think if he hadn't scored twice on his debut his development would have been psychologically easier. Harry Kane at Spurs might be a decent example of a player allowed to develop at his own pace. fair enough there's plenty of hype around Kane now, but it did take a good level of consistently, for quite a long time before people starting to think he might actually have what it takes. Even now there's still an undertone of surprise every time Kane does something genuinely classy, whereas Adnan had the burden of being our next (insert world class player) pretty much since his full debut. That said, Januzaj hasn't progressed much in over a year for one reason or an other, and my main concern with him is whether he has the mentality to turn his talent into the career expected of him. One thing going for him is we all want him to, unlike some players at our club, he has the full support of millions of supporters and backroom team that want nothing but the best for him. 

The hype from an early age thing is one of the reasons I have a lot of respect for Rooney. He's been under the microscope of this country's press and public from the age of 16 boy to man, and yeh he's had his ups and downs, but there are too many examples of human beings being hyped too early and it reflecting negatively on the rest of their life, showbiz and sport.

3567~~~
Mechanically, Ronaldo was well ahead of Januzaj though. He did get his share of stick about being a step over specialist, but his technical ability was far beyond Januzaj's.

3568~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> 

Ronaldo has the perfect attitude for an attacking footballer. A proper winner.

3569~~~
I hope Januzaj becomes ten times the prick our Ronnie ever was, if it means he even became half the player.

Unbelievable comment. Ronaldo is the model pro.

3570~~~
Maybe he'll build a museum 10 times the size of Ronaldo's in his own honour too. ;-)

3571~~~
If you're going to compare Januzaj with Ronaldo then do so. Otherwise take the Ronaldo is a prick stuff elsewhere.

3572~~~
I'd rather have Januzaj than Ronaldo in our squad. Never liked his me me me antics. He may be the ultimate professional, but not the ultimate team player in my humble opinion.

3573~~~
When you're as good as Ronaldo you are allowed to be a bit arrogant.

Plus, people mistake confidence for arrogance way too often.

There plenty of examples off the pitch that shows he's not some me me me me all about me person.

That confidence on the pitch is one of the reasons he became who he is.

3574~~~
If I remember correctly he was at his best last season on the left. 

Seemed to drift past players so easily. I'm not losing hope. He will come good.

3575~~~
Ridiculous statement, in my humble opinion.

We're talking about one of the best players in the history of the game here, he can be a serial killer for all I care.

3576~~~
You might be going a bit far there.

3577~~~
Great post.

3578~~~
I really don't understand why Ronaldo's name is brought up in relation to Januzaj. Ronaldo was a freak. Januzaj doesn't have anything like his pace, physique or trickery. Ronaldo's deveopment arc is absolutely irrelevant to Januzaj. Don't expect 10 goals next season, 20 the next and 40 after that. He'll probably take a good 5 years to build up to 15 or 20 goals and 10 or 15 assists.

3579~~~
We need to be patient with him. He's frustrating now but he will learn and be devastating in a couple of seasons.

3580~~~
He has his chance on Sunday. Big game, make or break.....Let's see how he does now when the pressure is really on

3581~~~
As I was saying, he has his chance on Sunday with Di Maria out.....I'm very interested to see how he does when the pressure is really on and how he handles it

3582~~~
Ronald's first game versus Bolton was a real eye opener. Yes he frustrated at times after that but he was a game changer when he would come on. Adnan has bags of ability but is not at the standard of what a United player should be at currently imo. (He could become a great player for us but is a mile away just now). The same goes for Blackett McNair these guys shouldn't be anywhere near our first team. Imagine these guys playing for Chelsea or City? No way! I love youth coming through but we shouldn't have to be asking them to dig us out in situations until they are ready and able, and these guys are a million miles of being ready and able. A loan is far the best option imo.

3583~~~
Get over yourself I see nothing much wrong with Ronaldo. You see all the bad things what about the way he has conducted himself of the pitch or the standards he has set on it? A true pro who can have his faults (we all do) but some of the stories you here regarding gestures he has made to people less fortunate than himself is heart warming (a they are no publicity stunts either). I have nothing but respect for this guy and wish he was back at United.

3584~~~
They are mentioned because both have shown similar problems with turning a good position into a good decision and result. They are not the same, but Ronaldo is evidence to how a player can develop his final product. If Januzaj can do that he'll be a terrific player. Not a Ronaldo, that is bloody rare, but a terrofic player.

3585~~~
Fair enough

3586~~~
Come on now. People need to stop with the history revision. No one knew that Ronaldo would turn out to be the player he is today at age 19 or 20. He was behind the likes of Van der Vaart,  Torres, Robben, Podolski, Rooney when it came to top players in and around his age group. He was fast and tricky yes and had good potential, but so did Quaresma. It's as if it was abundantly clear that Ronaldo was going to be one of the greatest ever or even of the last decade, it's simply untrue and smacks of retrospective adjustment of opinions.

Ronaldo was excruciatingly inconsistent, had ridiculously bad decision making, was a bit of a selfish prat, was labelled a big game bottler, dove on every occasion, hadn't developed his rocket free kick technique, didn't even score a European goal till age 21, did nothing when we got steamrolled by the likes of Chelsea and Milan and crashed out of the group stages in 2005/ 2006 - finishing 4th behind Benfica, Villarreal and Lille. It wasn't until the 2006/ 2007 season that he really started to assert himself as one of the top players in the game.

Different players have different growth curves. Some of the players who were considered better than Ronaldo at that age stagnated or didn't progress beyond a certain level. Others who weren't rated as highly as the absolute top young talents - the likes of Ribery, Van Persie, Suarez have developed into better players than Podolski or Torres or Reyes or Van der Vaart. Januzaj has a great chance to be that caliber of a player. Someone like Kaka was going to be loaned out by Milan at age 21 in 2003. It was only because of Rui Costa's weak form that Ancelotti kept him in on and he developed into a Ballon D'Or caliber player in the space of a few seasons which shows that footballers can develop rapidly and that growth isn't linear.

Young footballers are dismissed very easily these days just because of a few poor games and because they are compared to X, Y and Z players who are all finished products and we have the benefit of hindsight. Was Zidane Zidane really Zinedine Zidane at Januzaj's age ? Was David Villa the finished article for Gijon's B team ? Was Van Nistelrooy when he was playing as a central midfielder for Den Bosch ? Was Vieira when he couldn't even break into Milan's senior team at age 20 ? Januzaj needs time to develop both physically and mentally. He is still very young and needs the right environment to thrive.

3587~~~
Absolutely right. Great post!

3588~~~
This always annoy's me to no end. If a player isn't as good as Messi was at age 18/19 people will already start calling them "not good enough". Young players almost all have bad phases it's just natural for 99% of them and most of them won't even get to their best before they reach their mid twenties. Players who are already world class in their early twenties are an absolute rarity yet people seem to expect from ever player who breaks into the first team to be that kind of player.

3589~~~
Great post as always, Invictus.

3590~~~
Best post in here

3591~~~
Make or break game at 20? wtf?

3592~~~
Maybe he meant the game is make or break for United's season with regard to the top 4, and that we'll see how Adnan does with the pressure on? It could be read that way too I guess.

Adnan has really frustrated me over the last year with regard to his growth, but lately has shown glimpses of a bit of form coming back. I didn't think he was good in his cameo against Arsenal (unlike a lot of others on here) but other than that he has looked good lately in my opinion. I'll be interested to see how he does this weekend if given the start.

I also kind of wonder ... will he start? We might well randomly see Mata come back in. Or if RVP is fit (is he?) I wouldn't be surprised to see him come straight back into the lineup either.

3593~~~
i might be in the minority here, but i would far rather have adnan playing than an out of form, out of shape RVP.

anyway, all the pages in this thread should be deleted up until this, as the best posts have clearly been on this page. refreshing to see.

3594~~~
That might work if Januzaj scores goals, otherwise it would be a very bad idea, as RvP still manages to pull a few goals here and there.

3595~~~
I wouldn't mind it, so long as we keep playing the formation we're doing, but put someone other than Fellaini in at number 10, be it Mata, Herrera ... even Januzaj or Di Maria if need be.
I think the issue is the 2 up top. It doesn't work for us.

3596~~~
Mata is a far superior player, who actually contributes goals and assists. He should be playing regularly imo.

3597~~~
Not in any way is Sunday Make or Break for a 20 year old. It is a big chance for him tho. He's played well recently, and apart from his pathetic dive, he was good against Arsenal when he came on.
I'd like to think that Adnan can somewhat mirror what Sterling has done for Liverpool. Excellent breakthrough season, a bit of a nothing second season and then really kicked on in his third.

3598~~~
He, like pretty much everyone in the team, was a bit frustrating earlier in the season, as I felt he was being way less adventurous than normal. But yeah, I'd have him back in now if I were in charge, behind Rooney. Young and Januzaj (for this game anyway) on the flanks. I have a feeling we'll see Fellaini though.

3599~~~
He  really wasn't. His two good moments he followed up with standard Januzaj bad decisions - a dive, and an extra touch which put the ball out of play. Other than that he pretty much messed everything up.

3600~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2991655/Adnan-Januzaj-puts-extra-gym-sessions-tougher-Manchester-United.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...a-gym-sessions-tougher-Manchester-United.html</a>

He's shown a very good attitude and understanding of where he needs to improve in recent interviews.

3601~~~
Ehhhh I clearly mean't United and the season so far <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3602~~~
Well, it wasn't clear. And given some of the posts on here I had to be sure...

3603~~~
We should just demolish that Fergie statue. And his stand. It's a disgrace that living man got immortalized that way.

3604~~~
He's 20 years old for gods sake. Nearly 2 years younger than Harry Kane ..... who I'd never heard of 2 yrs ago! Adnan is a special player with a lot to learn ..... massive potential which wil only really come to fruition in 2 or 3 years time.

3605~~~
are his boots warrior or new balance?

3606~~~
New Balance. I think everyone who wore warrior are now wearing new balance. Not sure why they didn't just use the new balance name from the start.

3607~~~
That's unbelievable, no offence. Team player or not, Ronaldo is outscoring every football team in the world, except for the title contenders of each league. If United reach the CL final next year & you had to choose who played on the left wing, Ronaldo or Januzaj, would you really choose Januzaj?

Edit: It's worth pointing out that I am a massive Januzaj fan, by the way. I think he will go on to be a world great, if he ever fulfills his potential.

3608~~~
If he keeps working extremely hard,there is no need to fear for his future.

3609~~~
I wouldn't disagree with this but would say he shouldn't be a player we rely on right now and the fact we do says more about us than him. Nowhere near the standard for a regular right now imo.

3610~~~
What about other 20+ players except de Gea?

3611~~~
I single out Januzaj because we haven't really seen him in a high pressured game like this, where we HAVE to win and I'm just interested to see how he copes in that situation. 

Nothing more to it really <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3612~~~
cheers. i thought so too, but i've never seen an "n" on them. unlike fellaini's which do, and i was assuming they were more or less the same boot.

for those who play, is there much of a difference between nike vapour and NB? ... can't help but notice adnan hasn't scored since he made the switch. :P

3613~~~
You are asking a lot. He wasn't able to perform against weaker opponents very often this season(same as rest of our team), I hardly doubt we will see much from him this weekend. But one can hope. Btw, we saw last year he can be good in big games.

3614~~~
Last year we weren't exactly fighting for anything though. Season was pretty much over in January

3615~~~
He used to wear white-out warrior boots, the new balance ones are new so not sure how long he has been wearing them. Here is a picture of him in a match and there are some pictures of him in training wearing black ones. He used to wear the nike hypervenoms, which have the same honeycomb looking texture as the NB ones. Never worn either but I wouldn't think they'd make much of a difference.

3616~~~
People forget that he was almost as infuriating as he exhilarating prior to the 06/07 season.  Also, Cristiano made 31 appearances for Sporting before we acquired him.  Just because Adnan isn't a Messi or Fabregas that is extremely good at a young age doesn't mean he can't develop into a top player.

3617~~~
I think he needs some game time. Play a 433 / 4231 with him and Di Maria on the wings.
The more he plays, the more he is going to do the right things I believe.
He is the only player who is willing to pick up the ball and run at defenders, and he does it will, and beats his man a lot, he just needs to learn to pass more than shoot, and to make the passes effective

3618~~~
This is massively setting him back, call me crazy but on slow pace/static positions there's no one in the team who beats defenders so easily, not even di Maria. He just seems to glide past them as if there nothing, if he learns to not dive, shoot in right positions and remain calm and pass the ball to players in better positions, it would be a huge asset for this playing style as he could make something happen out of nothing. It's really frustrating to see him beat Monreal three times in quick succession and have 0 end product.

3619~~~
Actually, his best games were in first part of the season, when we were fighting on all fronts and when the pressure on the team was bigger than at the end when everyone gave up on us anyway. He was putting some good performances back then when rest of our team played like shit. He rarely performed good when we were already out of everything and relaxed anyway, I can only remember last home game against Wigan where he played good, apart from that, he was poor in second half of the season once the season ended for us.

3620~~~
Aston Villa, Newcastle, Hull City?

3621~~~
Nevermind, I forgot it, it still doesn't change my point.

3622~~~
Apart from matches vs Liverpool/City etc, I didnt think he was poor. He played significantly less but in the matches vs midtable and lower he was still fine imo.

3623~~~
He was definitely significantly weaker in second half of the season.

3624~~~
Anyone reckon Januzaj not playing yesterday and then playing for the reserves today might just be a slight 'punishment' from LVG for that dive against Arsenal?

3625~~~
no, he didn't play yesterday because it was a good chance to give Perreira some first team football and he's playing tonight to stay fit in accordance with the philosophy.

3626~~~
How'd he do?

3627~~~
Lost his place in the Belgian NT for some kid who's playing in France. Shame.

3628~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3629~~~
That is a shame indeed. Who's the kid?

Adnan will have to work hard in the off season and will enjoy the benefit of returning to training with the rest of the team at the same time. He didnt have that this year, and it seems he never really caught up. It didnt help his cause he was dealing with a new manager either.

Onwards and upwards and all that.

3630~~~
Michy Batshuayi from Marsseille.

3631~~~
He has been on good form to be fair, but he is more of a central striker. I would imagine he, Lukaku and Benteke will be their lead strikers for years. I guess between Hazard/De bruyne/Mertens/Mirallas Januzaj is going to have trouble breaking into that setup soon. He definitely need's to step it up and play more regularly/better than this season, but I am sure he will.

3632~~~
Another upside to us using the 433 is that now Adnan should hopefully get a few more chances than he was. He didn't really fit into the 41212 or the 352 as he isn't ready to start at CAM yet, is not a WB, nor is he an out and out striker. 

Here he can play either side of the striker, which at the minute, is probably the best place for him.

3633~~~
right, he can give competition to Mata for that false winger position that Mata is currently excelling in.

3634~~~
I wouldn't say having a "false winger" is essential to the system, I just think allowing Mata to drift inside is the best way to utilise him in that position. In my opinion, he's a useful option for any of the positions behind the striker, from what I can remember though his best performances have come when he's been on the left.

3635~~~
I agree that this set up is ideal for him, but previous setups other than 3-5-2 were fine too.

It's up to him now to make an impression. He's had a few opportunities but something has been missing from his game this year in general. Maybe it's even just confidence? I dont know, but I hope he raises the bar.

3636~~~
Between Depay/Bale/Sterling, it seems most in here have given up on him.

Who would have thought that this time last year...

3637~~~
Only NOW people giving/gave up when it comes to Januzaj.

3638~~~
Unless you've got Ribery/RObben, Neymar/Messi or Bale/Ronaldo running down your flanks you'd be wishing for those kinds of talents in your team. That being said i'm disappointed with his progress, and lately i've been a bit underwhelmed watching the compilations from his u21 appearances. But he's only 20 years old and players rarely follow a straight line in their progression.

3639~~~
Van Gaal likes inverted wingers, he's up against Di Maria and Mata. Bale too, but I <i>seriously</i> doubt he's coming. Memphis or Sterling would play on the left.

3640~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UY44-mPP03Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He had a decent game against Burnley, showed some maturity and was generally more careful with the ball. 

I don't think one off season will hurt his development, after the hype last season i think it is good for him being out of the spotlight and keep improving.
He also have to adapt to a more possession based system, where last season he would be relied upon to make something happen, and he was given alot of freedom to do what he wanted.

LvG is the right man to polish the diamond, Januzaj will have to be patient and listen to the great man, i still feel sky is the limit for this kid.

3641~~~
I guess he would be pretty useful now when the team already clicked. Understand that VG will not change the line up as it's winning team right now and it's need to make top4 but he might give him some minutes at the end of season when we seal the second place against Arsenal..

3642~~~
His ball retention was the second highest out of all our players that day (88% pass completion, Blind was 90%, Di Maria 70%) 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://epl.squawka.com/manchester-united-vs-burnley/11-02-2015/english-barclays-premier-league/matches" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://epl.squawka.com/manchester-u...-2015/english-barclays-premier-league/matches</a>

I will be absolutely shocked if Januzaj doesn't make it at United. I mean he hasn't shown much on the pitch this year but if the likes of Giggs who have been watching him every week in training think he is deserving of the number 11 shirt then he must be showing some great talent during training. I remember reading that he actually managed to go on his first United tour because he was ridiculously impressive during a training session so he was quickly promoted to the tour team. 

I'm not sure why the club hasn't sent him out on loan though. David Moyes seems to like him so why not just let him play at Real Sociedad or something. I just wish Van Gaal would actually give Januzaj minutes instead of Falcao who isn't even going to be with us next year. It seems so stupid.

3643~~~
there is literally zero reason to play falcao at this point. whether it's januzaj, wilson, shaun wright-phillips or roger federer - all could provide more reason to play in a cameo than falcao. it's not that i don't like him, it's just that he isn't any good and won't be with us past may anyway.

3644~~~
The only reason for why we keep playing him is because of Jorge Mendes. It's the only explanation for giving Falcao minutes these days.

3645~~~
ah. yes, i suppose you have a point there.

3646~~~
Watching Grealish play for damn near an hour as a 10 for Villa made me wish our smart, wispy left-footed young prospect had been loaned out in January. Lots of teams would have taken him as their 10 or right winger.

3647~~~
Like who? It's not like the majority of the league are promoting their youth. Especially the second half of the season. 

Let him learn our style for a season like he has. Next season if his struggling to make an impact, send him on loan.

3648~~~
I just hope we can see him feature more as a sub and rotation option for Mata. Probably not going to happen a lot this season as the fight for a CL place will stay very close till the end of the season but he is still young and next season he definitely needs more playing time.

3649~~~
I was afraid that the way we play we won’t be able to find a place for Januzaj, but 4-3-3 is the way forward and I’m excited to see him on the right in the Mata role. IMO the inverted right winger is his best position. I still have great expectations for this guy, I hope he won’t go on a loan.

3650~~~
That's something that gives me a lot of hope. Either wide position in LVGs preferred system is perfect for Adnan.

3651~~~
I truly hope we can bag a top four finish as soon as possible so we could see Adnan get more minutes. 
Right now as the balance seems (almost) perfect I cannot see LVG change a damn thing.

3652~~~
Could be a good loan move, but not as a permanent deal

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/manchester-united-roberto-martinez-planning-another-move-winger-adnan-januzaj-summer-1495784?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/manchester...her-move-winger-adnan-januzaj-summer-1495784?</a>

3653~~~
Januzaj is already good enough to play for several of the teams desperate for points. Off the top of my head, Burnley need someone to play out wide opposite Boyd and Swansea are less desperate, but are playing Routledge in a sort of combo striker-winger role that would suit Januzaj well. Sunderland are playing Defoe, Wickham and Fletcher across the front 3. You have to think Januzaj would outperform Wickham at least.

3654~~~
Agreed, seems a good fit. Fellow Belgiums of Lukaku, Mirallas and young talents like Barkley playing with him.

If they utilize him how they used Deulofeu but with more game time I'd be really happy. Just hope he doesn't get a bit too comfortable.

3655~~~
Mirallas is a huge twat though. He publicly stated that he didn't want Januzaj on the Belgium squad for last summer's World Cup.

3656~~~
would be mental to sell him. if we've given up on our best youth product on a guy who's just turned 20, then what's the point of having an academy?

i'm sure he won't get sold, but perhaps loaned out. again, as i've always said, assuming we make champions league, and not lose 4-0 to MK Dons in the first round of the Capital One Cup, we're going to have a ton more games next year which will mean more time for guys like Adnan.

3657~~~
We're definitely not selling him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3658~~~
I think he'll be fully settled into the squad next year. If LVG gives him enough games then he will be a top player.

3659~~~
he just got a new official facebook and twitter account today. what a lovely chap.

i'm in love with all of our players. herrera and mata in particular are like human versions of carebears. i really could have used them while growing up.

3660~~~
I'm sure van Gaal is shaping up Januzaj to become a great player for us. We should keep in mind that he didn't give much match time to Alaba and Kroos at Bayern yet still contributed to their development into the players they are today. At the moment, looking at how Mata plays as the "inverted winger", Januzaj can be perfect for that role on the right side. I doubt that van Gaal will exile him given how much he's played him this season. I do think he'll come out a much better player as Januzaj doesn't look like a big-headed player. Plus, playing under van Gaal will help him develop discipline, intelligence, and a greater appreciation of the game.

3661~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/waORObeSHVU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3662~~~
We should only loan him there if Mirallas leaves anyways since we want to make sure Januzaj will start. Mirallas looks likely to leave this summer anyways, which would leave Everton with only McGeady as a real natural wide. 

If they only sign one winger like Lennon, then I could see Januzaj getting 30 stars there. 

The team I like for him if he does go on loan is Swansea, playing the role Routledge is in:

-------Gomis------
---------Januzaj--
----Sigurdsson----
---Ki-----Shelvey
-------Cork-------

could be a fantastic set up for him, looking to provide width and link up. Could play RW in a 4-5-1 when Montero is out left and one of the midfielders is dropped/rested/injured.

3663~~~
Mirallas will leave Everton in the summer

3664~~~
Agree completely. He just needs to be patient and find a good loan club next year.

3665~~~
I’m confused, I thought <a class="username" data-user="80898, @mazhar13" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80898/">@mazhar13</a> suggested that he should stay at the club and wait for his chance because he fits the inverted winger role that Mata plays. And I agree with him.

3666~~~
Yep, I actually agreed about the bit of him coming good. Still think he needs a loan if he's going to develop at the next level.

3667~~~
I think he has to stay, he looks like a perfect replacement for Mata in this system. Di Maria plus + 1 new signing will probably play on the left.

3668~~~
I can see what you're saying, but at the moment, I wouldn't be comfortable with a loan move until Januzaj fully understands and executes what van Gaal wants from him. Kroos only had one loan season during van Gaal's first season, and Alaba never left the club during that time. Honestly, I'd prefer that Januzaj only goes on loan once he absorbs van Gaal's methods, but by that time, he'd probably be ready for the first team like Kroos and Alaba were.

3669~~~
Comes across as a bit of a fanny on his Twitter <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 
"I follow you on Twitter as the prize" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> My God

<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/adnanjanuzaj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/adnanjanuzaj</a>

3670~~~
I think he'll look good in the 4-3-3 I hope he gets a shot in the coming weeks, altho young and blind are excellent

3671~~~
Just watched the West Ham videos above and good god he is so much better than that level

I hope we can find a way to fit him into a 4-3-3 with more regularity next season. He could grow into the kind of player that you can't buy

3672~~~
Said it from the start but I really can't see him reaching a world class level out wide as a winger. His explosiveness and dribbling just isn't at the necessary level to be one of the best in the world. Sterling/Firmino are some levels above in terms of explosiveness and there are still questions whether they could really ever turn world class out wide. 

I am hoping that Di Maria starts playing in the central midfield again - the only position he's worth what we paid for and is one of the best in the world. In that case Januzaj would be an excellent back up and rotational option. 

Januzaj's passing range and vision is way better than his ability to take on full backs in 1 vs 1's. Similar to Di Maria, so I would prefer seeing him there getting game time from the bench in most matches or to rest Di Maria. 

I think he could get plenty of game time if he continued also being played out wide when it was necessary. Not sure what has been going on this season though, seems like he's had some serious issues adjusting to LVG so we will see what happens with him.

3673~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3674~~~
What most of you on here see in this kid i have no idea. I don't see the potential at all, he's bigged up because he's come through the ranks but apart from his Macheda-like performance where he scored a brace against Sunderland i just don't see it in him at all to be honest.

3675~~~
I will have to agree. He's not the talent he is hyped to be. He's the most useless player to bring on as a sub and arguably the least useful player in the squad only more useful than Falcao.

3676~~~
Probably not the right situation to utilize him in. Mata could've stayed on.

3677~~~
Was worse than Falcao today and thats saying something.

3678~~~
His only impact on the game was giving the ball to Chelsea players.

3679~~~
Should have kept Mata on and brought on Van Persie.

3680~~~
On the pitch for 20 minutes down a goal at stamford bridge and this 20 year old didnt do enough to impress you. Makes sense.

3681~~~
He dont even have an idea of what to do.

3682~~~
Needs a loan move, what do people expect from a 19 year old lad who's played 2 games all season?

3683~~~
To be fair when was the last time he got any competitive minutes ?

To expect a rusty young kid to change it with chelsea bunkering was tough.

3684~~~
He needs to go out on loan next season and play every week. Atm he's not good enough.

3685~~~
Jeez, this is laughable.

Zero sense of perspective. Hes not played a minute in over a month and he failed to deliver in a 20 Minute cameo at chelsea. fecking bonkers.

3686~~~
Lack of games = bad decision making. No surprises there. Depending on our summer he either needs a loan, or way more games. The current situation isn't working for anybody.

3687~~~
Actually, it's bad decision making = lack of games

3688~~~
So overrated it's not funny, either loan him so he can get regular minutes and see how he goes or sell him whilst he still has some hype. Nowhere near good enough for United. 

Macheda MK2

3689~~~
Send him away somewhere for a season or two.

3690~~~
"=" represents transitive relation.

3691~~~
His lack of game time has stalled or even hindered his progress this season IMO 

Needs a loan.

3692~~~
Isn't good enough right now. Loan him.

3693~~~
Get outta here. Macheda my balls.

3694~~~
Clear lack of game time.

Doesn't really help that Van Gaal keeps him out of the team for long stretches. And when he doesn't do well in his rare game he gets stick.

Macheda comparisons though<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3695~~~
Let's loan him out after every sub performance that he hasn't set the world alight yeah.

People have ridiculous expectation.He was pushed out of the ball for many occasions.Once he grows that will improve.

3696~~~
Get him a loan next year where he play week in week out. Macheda comparisons are awful. Those people dont know what they are talking about. If he plays of the bench next season as well, he is done at United.

3697~~~
If we loan him out next season, he is done at United.

3698~~~
No he isnt. He needs confidence. He is too raw right now. He needs to be a bit more polished to make his way into this team. Playing week in week out will give him a chance to do that. He will stop making erratic decisions and will be more of a team player.

3699~~~
It will be almost impossible for him to get back into the team after the season he was loaned out with the "replacement" we brought in.Plus knowing LVG he won't loan out players that he think can contribute to the team so if he does loan out Adnan, you know what that means.

It will be difficult for him to make his way into this team now yes, but he still has plenty of times and this is Manchester United after all.

3700~~~
I agree, Mata wasn't having much impact without the link-up with Herrera but Januzaj wasn't going to change anything as he's basically a less experienced version of Mata in that RW role, neither have the pace to hurt a rigid backline like Chelsea's.

3701~~~
Yes because im only basing him on 20 minutes at Stamford Bridge...

3702~~~
My heart say loan him, but my head is telling me LvG might flog him.

3703~~~
He will have better opportunities to play than at Stamford to full defense. He was tightly marked/pressed and wasn't really able to make impression. It wasn't the best 20 minutes but I'm good with him getting on the pitch. It was logical to send him on as he's one of the most creative players in the team on his day..

3704~~~
<b>20</b> games all season. I mean it even says it on top of the page.

(Yes, quite a few were off the bench, but players like him should be able to make an impact when played. He did it last season, but not this. McNair, for instance had a good game tonight.)

3705~~~
He was garbage when he came on. I still think he has bags of potential though but he needs a loan move and should've gone out in January.

3706~~~
He was destroying teams in a reserve league but he clearly has to grow up to the adult level.

Good news is he clearly possess the talent. Time will tell. No need to sell him already but I think many thought he will do better.

3707~~~
Never understood the hype. Hope.to be proven wrong.

3708~~~
Big pre-season for him. If he can't force his way in, I'd loan him out until January then make a decision from there whether to bring him back or leave him where he is for the rest of next season.

3709~~~
Reminds me a bit of Macheda. Desperately needs a loan.

3710~~~
loan

3711~~~
Yeah and in those 20 games he's probably started about 5 times and on top of that he was played wing back on occasion due to the 3-5-2 we played earlier in the season. He's been poor partly down to form but also down to lack of match time, like I said he needs a loan.

3712~~~
Badly out of match fitness. Januzaj reminds me of Nani in that he really is a player who needs consistent gametime in order to shine I feel.

I could understand him coming on today, but it went roughly as expected unfortunately. This season is a bit of a write off for the lad.

3713~~~
A month ago it looked like he was playing himself into form then he got dropped and now this appearance off the bench. He was really poor today. With new winger/s expected in the summer I think he should consider sending him out on loan.

3714~~~
Buy Depay and send him to PSV on loan. 

Champions league, competitive good technical league and will get plenty of chances to score.

Prove me wrong, januzaj came in, scored a couple of goals everyone raved about him he looked the real deal which is exactly how everyone reacted to macheda when he did the same and look where he is now.

Fact is Januzaj hasn't got any better than when he first broke through a couple of seasons ago, He's just not good enough to play for us. He wouldn't stand out in a midtable team

3716~~~
Right now hes not a team player for the system he plays. Its like he thinks he has Di Marias pace. hes trying to run through people and hes not good enough for that or quick enough for that. And he doesnt pass the ball or wait for back up from the RB (valencia today) which meant he got dispossessed easily quite a lot of times. 

Im not surprised he was ineffective. I think he badly needs a loan to a team where he will play to a system rather than hoping he provides a bit of magic.

3717~~~
Not a bad shout at all. Depends I guess if we want him to get Premier League experience. Champions League experience would be very good for him though.

3718~~~
PSV uses similar formation. Could be more than good idea.

3719~~~
A full year loan to a side that will utilize him makes sense. He'd do well at a mid table Prem side.

3720~~~
I reckon Everton or Villa (if we class them as mid table) would take him on loan in a heartbeat and give him regular starts.

3721~~~
That's what I was thinking. Good shout.

3722~~~
What I liked when he broke through under David Moyes was he carried a sense of composure and intelligence to his game. I think he's a 10 in the mould of Cazorla who can drift around the pitch and dribble at players.

3723~~~
He might benefit from going out on loan. I actually don't know anymore. He still looks ridiculously raw. It's obvious that he has bags upon bags of potential, it's just his decision making at times can be way off. 

Doesn't play enough at the moment - probably doesn't help with how Mata and Young have been playing this season. Like ADM, maybe they just need to adapt their game a little to Van Gaal's system. How? I'm not sure, but it's just not clicking for Januzaj at the moment. I know it's just cameo appearances, but he doesn't seem to have stepped up from last season.

3724~~~
Overall poor this season, however was overhyped last season.
Anyway I still think he has a lot of talent and will come good. He has had a few decent to good performances this season, just not enough of them.

3725~~~
Needs a loan, preferably at a team that plays good football like swansea. At the minute he is only regressing.

3726~~~
What are his stats like when playing on the left vs right? Id be interested because it seems like hes much more productive on the left in terms of goals / assists where he can use the width and protect the ball.
On the right, given hes left footed, he seems to lose it more and cannot protect the ball at all meaning he cuts in so much.

3727~~~
Cazorla has played in CM controlling matches an awful lot, Januzaj is nothing like that.

3728~~~
Not sure what it is, but apart from like 2 or 3 sub appearances, he has been really poor all season. Looked pretty slow, weak, lacking ideas, lingers too much on the ball, constantly picking the wrong decision, and just complete void of confidence. Hopefully he improves next season because he was class last year and looked very creative and hard to handle for teams, and it wasn't just because the rest were shite. Definitely think it would have been better for him if he didn't go to the world cup at all because I think all the stardom might have gone to his head after last season, breaking in the team, being so good for us, and then going to the world cup at 19. This season he's just looked like he was disappointed at not being a starter and never properly recovered.


Also it's not that he's had a lack of games... It's the way those games are spread out which is the problem. He'd have a run of like 6 starts, then be out of the team for months. If he got a start here and there, but constant subs so he makes appearances in most games, he'd be a lot better off IMO. I doubt he has been working his ass off in training though, because he would play more if he was.

3729~~~
Seems like the type of player who would do well when a team is playing well, knitting moves together as part of a machine. Not really a super sub type as he can't really add anything that can dramatically turn a game around - i.e. roast a full back, create a chance through a great cross/pass or score a screamer from 30 yards.

3730~~~
He's been a lot better than Pogba was in his first team appearances, so we can just take solace in that

3731~~~
Looked like he has added some muscle to his frame. Don't subscribe to all the negativity, he played for 15 mins for the first time in weeks. Let's continue to build with the youth and they will come good.

3732~~~
He really needs a run of games. Looks awkward and not making the right decision on the field. A loan move would do him good next season.

3733~~~
Number one on my list to go out on loan next season. Not that i dont want him on the team but he desperately needs playing time to improve and progress as a player. Time is still on his side of course.

3734~~~
Needs games.

Needs a loan bad.

3735~~~
He needs games somewhere. At the moment he looks like he's getting left behind with the development of our play.

3736~~~
These above. I'd loan him to a counter-attacking team, where he would learn how to defend when opposition have the ball and improve his decision-making, as counter-attacks are meant to be thought and executed quickly.

3737~~~
Yep agree

3738~~~
Dunno what to make of him really....

Not just on today but, I really don't know what he brings to the table.
He's not a great crosser, not a great passer, he's not exactly fast for someone who plays out wide, he doesn't offer much of a goal threat....I'm not really sure what people are seeing in him to be honest.

Having said that, I'm only a supporter and an observer. I don't know what happens on the training ground or how a manager identifies strengths in a player to suit their "philosophy"

Maybe a loan....Unless Big Louis decides to ship him off

3739~~~
Wow, some embarrassingly shit posts in here today.

3740~~~
Funny enough I pretty much agree with those statements, although I think his talents are still there for all to see, and he is a goal threat, he always looks like he can make something happen in terms of scoring a goal, sometimes though he makes the wrong decisions (shooting instead of passing)

He has great ability on the ball, quick feet, is a very confident player who plays very positively (not afraid to take his man on and go for goal, take responsibility on his shoulders to make things happen)

I think he just needs a good season under his belt, probably on loan, and he'll be ok.

3741~~~
He needs to sort himself out in the summer. For a player with such a wide range of abilities he does the same thing time after time whether it works or not - take the defender on one on one, try and beat him with a burst of pace, fail, repeat.

Hopefully we see a better adnan januzaj next season. I'm still confident about him becoming q fine player. Just needs a run of good form to get his confidence back up.

3742~~~
He's not a winger, not a very good one at least.

His form hasn't been helped by Van Gaal freezing him out for long stretches and then again bringing him back from nowhere. 

Talent is blatantly obvious though. Macheda comparisons are laughable.

3743~~~
Think he needs a loan next season. Get playing some football week-in-week-out so he can develop. He was frustrating against Chelsea but he would have been very rusty so it is understandable in a way.

3744~~~
He has to go back to doing the simple things right, and then build on that. He seems to lose the ball almost every time he gets it, because he wants to try and take on his man even when there's practically no chance of it succeeding (probably because he knows he failed earlier and want to redeem himself). Just accept that occasionally you have to play the boring pass and get back into position, and maybe you'll have a better chance next time. He's trying to dribble through players, kick the ball ahead and trying to outrun a fast full-back etc. He's obviously not in form, but he needs to learn how to play when he isn't because he's been pretty much useless almost every time he's come on this season.

3745~~~
Where is this talent though? honestly I don't get the hype that surrounds him at all. I can't see what he offers to us. He loses the ball constantly, offers no goal threat, can't create anything through a pass or dribble. Right now he's nowhere near good enough to play for us.

Anyway he will be off out on loan next year So see how he goes.

Tbh though I think he will just end up like cleverly.

3746~~~
A loan to the Holland or Germany would be best I think.

3747~~~
Yes, the usual kneejerk stuff. Adnan is clearly a promising young player who needs more development, which will ideally be realized through a loan with a club that will use him.

3748~~~
Wasn't expecting him to contribute much against a tough Chelsea team that was parking the bus in a 15minute sub to be honest. Hopefully once we have secured top 4, he will feature more and actually start games that will give him the opportunity to grow in confidence again. He has the ability, there is no doubt about that.

3749~~~
How many loans actually work out? Welbeck, just about, but who else?

It just feels that as soon as a player goes out on loan, he's passed around before being sold for a pittance. I don't see a loan move doing anything for him, if he's going to be good enough for us then he needs to be training with LVG and the squad and getting first team minutes.

3750~~~
He's an excellent passer. That was the thing that stood out in his early first team appearances above all in fact. His decision making is the problem at the moment. 

And he was absolutely capable of scoring a screamer in the reserves, not like you just lose that. I do think he needs games though, maybe in Portugal or Holland if not the premier league, though I'm pretty sure there'd be english teams falling all over themselves to get him if we made him available.

3751~~~
Evans, welbeck, Cleverley, Beckham, pretty much the majority of youngsters who've ended up playing first team football for us have gone on loan at some point.

3752~~~
For younger players, unless they are Cristiano Ronaldo or Wayne Rooney who are going straight into the first team, loans are essential to develop their skills in a starting XI setting. Januzaj is never going to reach his potential with 10-15 irregular cameo appearances with us. He needs consistent football every week to gain confidence against real time opposition as opposed to just training and reserve matches.

3753~~~
He has played ahead of Herrera and Mata at one point and LVG said it's due to who's better in training.Do you think he can do that without working his ass off?

Not sure why anyone could claim they have watched him enough and said he's not a good passer.He's a very good passer.That's one of his best attributes, more so than his dribbling.

3754~~~
He probably was overrated last season, but some act as if he was shit last season, whilst he was amongst our best players almost every match in his debut season. He has been poor this season, needs a loan.

3755~~~
There's a lot of players having good loan spells - we have some going at the moment. Out of the current first teamers, Evans had a good loan spell at Sunderland. Unless you're ridiculously talented there's no other way really, not with the way youth football in England is currently "working".

3756~~~
I said this then as well. There were actually some comparing him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time. He was very good last year and should've probably gone on loan to build on that this year, although I can imagine LvG wanted to keep him around after Nani went on loan and the effectiveness of Ashley Young was a question mark.

3757~~~
That's something that really annoys me about him. Its like he's trying to play as a flying winger, beat players with pace and strength when that just isn't his game. He's got average pace but has loads of ability on the ball, he shouldn't be trying to kick in run past an opponent because they'll out muscle him easily and outrun him.

3758~~~
Avoided this thread because I knew the reaction would be over the top. Safe to say I wasn't disappointed.

The only thing yesterday tells us is that he needs more games. He's like Di Maria in that he always wants to take his man on but I think they're both low on confidence at the moment and that is something they will only get back through playing.

Having watched Adnan thought the U18s and U21s I will always believe in his potential. I still think he will be amazing but he needs games. If Everton are willing to take him on loan next season that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. Deulofeu did ok on loan there. Selling him though shouldn't even be a consideration.

3759~~~
Said it last summer, needs a loan move to a foreign CL club or Saints/Everton.

3760~~~
Yeah im sure it's a phase. Most young players who aren't rooney or Fabregas or messi go through these phases.

3761~~~
Same boat as you, he's having a poor time but having watched the youth for so long, if someone with his talent cant come through here then we might as well shut the whole thing down.
Right now it does look best if he could get a loan to someone who'd give him a run of games, particuarly if we bring in a Depay or similar this summer.

3762~~~
Holy Crap! The negativity on this thread surrounding Adnan is mindblowing. I have no doubt in my mind that he will shine for us. 

I'm still not sure about the loan though. Considering that we will be in the CL, all the cup games and league games next season, we may need all the right talent at our disposal if we hope to do a treble. 

Yes, I believe we will be capable of it with some brilliant transfer market activity.

I also hope that our medical staff does some root cause analysis on our string of injuries...

3763~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

How about challenging for the title first?

3764~~~
A loan might not be the best option unless he feels confident about it and his english has improved a lot. It might not be easy for a kid of refugees to adapt constantly to a new environment. I also think that the whole situation with deciding which national team to represent has not been helpful. He was under a lot of pressure to make a decision. Ultimately he (or his parents/advisors) decided what would have been in any possible case a makeshift decision, since their was not an obvious choice. I don't know whether he fully accepted the fact that he'll play for Belgium now.

3765~~~
He speaks perfectly fine English.

3766~~~
Okay, I wasn't aware of that. In the few clips I saw from him he wasn't talking a lot so I assumed that he didn't feel comfortable enough communicating in english.

3767~~~
He needs games. Barely plays and comes off the bench when he's not in form and people expect magic.

3768~~~
Not sure where people just pluck random clubs from to loan him to. But yeah it seems clear that he needs to be playing on a consistent base somewhere, In the Premier League preferably to as it will be no good him going abroad and doing well but coming back and struggling to adapt to the EPL after. If we bring Nani back next season as cover then that would probably be the best scenario for him to go out on loan.

3769~~~
Bags of potential but definitely worrying that he seems to be going backwards pretty quickly. Obviously largely down to a huge lack of opportunities.

Not the biggest fans of loan moves myself but it's looking increasingly like this would be a good option for next season. I'd rather keep him for the first half of the season though just because there's many more opportunities to get a game with the FA Cup games, CL group stages and League cup also.

3770~~~
Thought it was a strange sub to bring on, he lacks so much composure in the final third at times.

Might be best for him to spend a season or two on loan, somewhere where he can start the majority of games.

3771~~~
I still don't get the notion that he needs games. He's coming on and he's clearly struggling, that to me says the last thing he needs is games because he's not fully adapted to what he's supposed to be doing. Playing well for this current side is a lot different to playing well under a lacklustre Moyes side last year. He's only recently turned 20 and he's pretty much always picked in the squad of 18, I think he's exactly where he should be at the moment and we'll probably see the best of him next season.

3772~~~
Send him and Pereira to PSV as a sweetener for Memphis.

3773~~~
Should have been sent on loan in January, don't want him to go on loan next season. There will be enough games going around next season for him to get his share. 

I am not worried about him. He has plenty of time on his side.

3774~~~
A lot of whats being said here is similar to what was being said about McNair and to a lesser degree Shaw before Saturday and now people are raving over them again and saying they should be first choice. Its as if people judge a player entirely based on the past month of his career or often the last game. Januzaj has shown how talented he is now its about kicking on and becoming more consistent in the good things he does. He has looked anxious at times this season especially when he's come on in games as if he has to prove himself which has meant he hasn't played his natural game but this is nothing new with young players. There's some ridiculous revisionism going on here with some people saying the only game he's done well in was the Sunderland game last year and comparing him to Macheda which is blatantly not true considering he was man of the match in 5 or 6 games last year and has made a positive contribution in games this season including a very good cameo appearance off the bench against Sunderland at the end of February. The funny thing is that as with McNair the next time he plays and does well people will be hyping him up massively again rather than accepting that inconsistency is normal with young players and just as a few good games doesn't mean someone is the new Messi neither does a few bad games mean someone isn't up to it and never will be.

3775~~~
Adnan kind of reminds me of a young Nani, not necessarily in skills & talent, but in inconsistency of results. He definitely shined last year, but then seems to have been found out by EPL defenders and needs to make the next step in his progression. Nani's problem was that he tended to try to do too much by himself and not as much in a team situation (i.e. tracking back, workrate, etc.). Nani did progress, and so I hope so for Adnan. He needs to learn to release the ball a bit quicker, instead of doing by himself. He was allowed to do so last year because we were so short of talent, belief, & ideas, but now that the team has added better players and progressed under LVG, he still hasn't gotten the whole team/LVG philosophy thing yet. It's much tougher since it seems he sees himself as a #10 instead of a winger, but at this time, I don't think he's our best #10. Best he play a similar role to Mata (i.e. false right wing), but at this time, Mata is definitely outplaying him.

3776~~~
So is the way of a big club like United.  What this will really come down to is a decision that Van Gaal will have to make.  I am not convinced that he needs to go out on loan but I am convinced that he needs game time. 

I don't think you can get a feel for how someone will perform long term until they are thrown to the wolves so to speak.  We were having this same conversation about Mata, Fellaini and Young months ago when they were getting 20-30 minute cameos.  Now they have had a successful run of games and all our of tunes have changed about each of them. If LVG feels that he a player isn't worth the look to start 4-5 consecutive games then they need to be cut loose.

3777~~~
He is rapidly turning into one of the least threatening wingers in the Premier League. I've got nothing against him and we all want the best for him, but he shouldn't be anywhere near our first team plans for next season and, given how poor he's been off the bench for over a year, a loan would seem the most sensible approach for me. Even Clevs' has started to resemble a professional footballer again lately, give Adnan a full season with a confidence manager and I'd bet on him coming back twice the player he currently is.

3778~~~
Needs to hit the gym, gain some muscle. I think that will help him to keep the ball better and also gives himself enough time to see whose around him. We've seen very little of him this season so naturally his progression has stunted but once he bulks up a bit, I'm sure he will be able to adapt to LVG's philosophy of possession style football.

3779~~~
He's a developing player and needs to go on loan to develop further since he isn't likely to play much for us next year. McNair is as well, although defenders are obviously held to a different standard than creative attackers. Shaw on the other hand is in a different category in that he has had a full year or more of Prem time and has managed to establish himself as a very good player worthy of starting role.

3780~~~
He should have gone on loan in Jan. 

Definitely needs to be going on one in the summer.

3781~~~
The negativity here is sad. He showed that he has immense potential last season but obviously needs more games. It is also clear that his learning curve is not linear and that there are ups and downs

3782~~~
Im not sure of the logic of sending a player who is in the 18 for every game out on loan when 1 or 2 injuries could mean he would be starting games regularly and especially when were going into a season where there will be more games than this season. Its all well and good saying he should have gone out on loan this season since he hasn't played much but if we had an injury to Mata or Young people would be questioning why we sent him out on loan and left ourselves short. Its all well and good saying he would develop better on loan but thats not always the case as we've seen with many of our players in the past.

3783~~~
The logic of sending players on loan is self-explanatory - to develop their skills and give them playing time. Having Januzaj languish on the bench in case 1 or 2 injuries happen in his position is completely counterintuitive and would prevent him from gaining experience and confidence to move his game to the next level. A good number of our younger players go on loans including the likes of Welbeck, Cleverley, and others so why should Januzaj, who has obviously regressed from last year, be immune from taking the same path.

3784~~~
A confidence player with no confidence. Its glaringly obvious that the lack of play time and some poor performances have seriously hurt him. I don't want him to go on loan but maybe it is best that he does.

3785~~~
bingo.

i see he's playing with the u21's today. hopefully he has a good 90 minutes today.

3786~~~
Not sure a loan would be the best for him, especially since he's close to the cusp of being a regular, at least on the match day 18. Maybe going out on loan helps build back his confidence, but if he plays on a lesser team, getting away with dribbling around players all the time, it doesn't help him for our needs. LVG obviously sees something there since he kept him around instead of loaning him out, but I don't think Adnan has a full buy-in or understanding of what the next step up that is required of him. It's possible all the training with the first team will do just as much for him as loaning him out, especially if he gets the system and what is asked of him.

3787~~~
Is it possible to loan a player and recall them if you get numerous injuries in that players' position? I'm sure that used to happen quite regularly, but I've not heard of it happening for years.

3788~~~
He should get a season long loan with a break clause if he isn't getting enough games after a certain amount of months. A string of games and he'll come good.

3789~~~
injured his ankle today, was brought off in the 55th minute or so. didn't look terribly serious.

3790~~~
Needs a loan, we can't afford to bottle his development. This year has taken him absolutely nowhere.

3791~~~
He has actually taken a step back in his development during this year.  We all know that except for the elite of the elite, that there is always a little luck involved for a 19 year old to be part of the first XI in such a big club.  As much as anything Adnan has been a victim of circumstance.  New coach with a new philosophy trying new things.  Once the squad started finding a little form the players in that squad were always going to stay on the pitch.  This scenario plays out every season all over the world.

How many of you would have laughed if I told you in early August that come May, we would be 3rd place and two of our best performers will be Fellaini and Young..or even Mata for that matter?  These were two players which we were screaming for the club to get rid last year and early this season.  In the end, this is still a team sport and the best individuals aren't always the puzzle pieces needed for the team to perform at its best. 

On the other hand, we could have easily still been 3rd with ADM and Januzaj playing much bigger roles with people still screaming to get rid of Young and Fellaini.  There is so much timing and luck involved to force your way into an XI.  Rafael is a prime example of this - he is not a worse player than he was a few years ago when starting in Europe...its just that once he was injured, it has been difficult to take others off the pitch and shake the squad up for no reason.

3792~~~
Would send him to Swansea next season. A year in a good footballing side, playing regular Premier League football and where he 'should' standout at the level. Failing that if Steve McClaren heads to Newcastle as rumoured, I could see that working out.

3793~~~
quite a shit season for him, at first we didn't play him as we didn't play with wingers, then he got a sniff in as no8 where he did quite well for one game and some other comeos were more or less average at best. Seems like he lost all his confidence, not really going past players for under 21..

But he will be good with proper full next season. Loan would be good but then we would need one more winger than depay.. Although with Young, Depay, Januzaj and diMaria + Mata we are well covered for the whole season..

3794~~~
Hence he needs a loan where he can play as a 10 and develop further. His talent is there to see. We just need him to develop physically and tactically and we'll have a world class player on our hands.

3795~~~
Im well aware of the logic but both of them were nowhere near the team when they went on loan where as Januzaj is and has played 20 games this season which isn't exactly bad for a 20 year old. Not every case is the same either certain players develop better purely from getting game time while others develop better from training with better coaches and players every day and learning the style that is actually wanted by the manager. The main difference from last year is that he was essentially given a free role last year to go and influence play and was given very little tactical instructions where as under van gaal players are given very specific jobs and if they don't do them they won't play. So if he goes out on loan he might develop certain things but if he comes back and still isn't doing what the manager wants then he won't be any closer to the team than he is now.

3796~~~
Let's be honest, he doesn't have a chance given his current form, and his lack of playing time can only be attributed to a lack of progress in training, which of course Van Gaal and staff have awareness of and we don't. He's not going to displace Mata, Di Maria, or Depay next year so it would be utterly counterproductive to have him languish on the bench another year when he could be playing elsewhere.

3797~~~
On loan or permanent?

3798~~~
Loans.

3799~~~
He doesn't have to "displace" anyone to be worthy of a place in the squad next season. No harm waiting and seeing how he does in pre-season. Sometimes it just clicks and he's already played lots of games for the first XI. Doesn't need a huge improvement to nail down another season with the first team.

3800~~~
The trouble is he's already with the first team and isn't playing. How would 2 consecutive seasons of not playing consistently affect his development in contrast to a loan where he could actually get 30-40 plus starts.

3801~~~
He's not had a good second season. Which can happen to young talents. It happened to Raheem Sterling, for example. Like I said, no harm seeing how he does in pre-season. He's well capable of training on and being a key player next year. Seens premature to dismiss his chances just yet.

3802~~~
Good comparison, couple of my Derby mates reckoned they were close to nabbing him on loan 18months ago, then he just clicked and the rest is history. (though good be argued Sterling hasn't got the competition that Adnan is facing). 

Still think Adnan has a chance, but we do look pretty determined to buy a winger, if that ends up being the case I struggle to see him featuring regularly.

3803~~~
I think the problem was mainly how those 20 games were spaced out. Not very ideal if you look at it. That's without considering the positions he's played.

I'm not a fan of loaning him out but it would be criminal for us to waste another season of his development. If we can't assure him a reasonable amount of game time then he should be out on loan not sitting on the bench just in case we might have a big injury crisis.

I know I'm in the minority but I'd rather we not sign Depay and show faith in Januzaj.

3804~~~
Can somebody with a Sun+ membership maybe copy+paste from this artcle: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/6432583/Youve-Ad-it.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/6432583/Youve-Ad-it.html</a>

3805~~~
Played well for U-21s last night.

3806~~~
He's also been poor again this season.

I don't see how a kid with Adnan's ability won't make it.

3807~~~
They want him on loan.

3808~~~
very creative player, great vision and pass in him but we know it. I'd like to see him to get rid of his sloppy dribbling at times. He needs to try harder to beat his players and doesn't lose the ball so often. He looks like he thinks he's got everyone in his pocket and he hasn't.. 

I hope he will feature more in the next season, he was unlucky to suffer under system with no wingers for 3/4 of the season..

Adnan Januzaj’s immediate future at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> is in the balance, with Louis van Gaal considering whether the 20-year-old should go out on loan next season.

The forward has struggled to establish himself under the new manager after last year’s breakthrough campaign under David Moyes. Januzaj had to wait until 20 October to be given a first start by Van Gaal – in a 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion – and he has made only eight in total.

Despite signing a new five-year deal last October which the Belgian’s agent claimed rewarded him better than “Ronaldo and Messi when they were 18” and being handed Ryan Giggs’s iconic No11 shirt for this term, Januzaj’s career at Old Trafford has stalled.

With four matches left of the season he has made a total of 20 appearances for United and has yet to score. Last year he made 35 appearances of which 19 were starts, scoring four times.

This lack of regular football and the <a class="externalLink" href="http://preview.gutools.co.uk/football/2015/apr/21/manchester-united-memphis-dupay-psv-liverpool" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">potential arrival of PSV Eindhoven’s Memphis Depay</a> may convince Van Gaal that Januzaj should be allowed to consider a temporary move, at least. Depay is PSV’s top scorer in the Eredivisie with 21 goals in 28 starts.

This return helped fire PSV to the Dutch championship and is an impressive tally for a player who, like Januzaj, has thus far operated mainly as a wide player. As Depay is only a year older than Januzaj his arrival would offer a further threat to the latter’s first-team prospects.

3810~~~
Loan would be best for him and if he has a year at Everton under Martinez that will be a very beneficial year - as long as he actually plays.
He just isn't good enough for us at the moment. Not saying that he can't ever be good enough in the future, but sitting on the bench isn't helping him any..........

3812~~~
I hate to be redundant, but I just hate seeing him play in a position that requires him to get chalk on his boots.  Would love to see him in a more free role in which he can find pockets and channels to work in and run at people in the middle of the pitch.  I really think that we will find out that he just doesn't fit LVG's systematic way of playing - he will end up elsewhere and setting the world on fire.

3813~~~
He's quite clearly a level above the reserves level. Also who is the number 7 in our shirt? Two terrific and composed finishes there

3814~~~
Joe Rothwell <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3815~~~
Yeah, I don't like how he stays so wide at times. I think playing the role more like Mata will benefit him a lot more and he can always mix it up and stay wider a bit too.

3816~~~
Completely agree, he's one of those players that thrives on having a free role. Then again, lacking discipline is a common trait among young players.

3817~~~
I suppose a more interesting question would be - has Januzaj earned the right to play in a free role ? And should we experiment with the squad just to shoehorn him in ? Is the development of one player more important than the evolution and solidarity of the squad at large ?

3818~~~
This season was one with a lower margin for error. During normal service, we've always placed great emphasis on developing young players.

3819~~~
Well I'd say yes and no. We shouldn't be shoehorning him in or anything but we don't really have to. Mata already plays a free role so when Adnan does come in he can play that same role without having to change around the side to accommodate him.

3820~~~
Agree. Not only Januzaj but Pereira as well, they both need to play in midfield, Pereira as the B2B midfielder and Januzaj as the #10, that is where they will unlock their full potential. I understand why they are playing out wide in U21 now due to the lack of options but the sooner they move infield the better. With the addition of 2 or 3 young players we could potentially be sorted for the future in midfield + Attack. Adding players like Tielemans, Depay and Dybala/Carrasco to likes of Pearson, Goss, Rothwell?, Pereira, Januzaj, Wilson and Henriquez (if we keep him) we would build a solid future for the club.

3821~~~
i agree, LVG couldn't really have played him much more than he did this season. Maybe at the beginning of the year, a couple of occasions come to mind, namely against MK Dons when he should have been given a start but whatever.

He's clearly too good for U21's and next season he'll either have to play more with us or go somewhere else for a loan. I don't favour a loan move, as it's clear he is capable of playing at the highest level with us based on last year. A "sophomore slump" is nothing new.

3822~~~
I wouldn't mind him leaving as he definitely needs consistent games for his development but Everton? After all the nonsense of two summers ago & hard balling us for Fellaini I'd tell them to piss off.

3823~~~
We needed results during a difficult period, we found a temporary solution (i hope) due to teams not understanding how to deal with Fellaini, a limited player doing his job very well on the pitch but now he's been found out and so has our style of beating the pressure. 2 ways to deal it, man mark Fellaini out of the game and the other is for teams to sit deep and hit us on the counter. Now IMO we shouldnt continue playing the same way we have, its time to switch thing around again and that could bring Mata or Januzaj to a more central position where they would become far more effective. That's my opinion anyway.

3824~~~
Yewh, I don't mind him playing on the wing if he's allowed to drift inside as well. He's capable of beating a full back and putting good crosses in so I don't think he need to play as a 10. Some of his best performwnces for us have been from the left rather than the right in fact

3825~~~
Agreed. I don't understand why some people think talent is 'wasted on the wings. Giggs,, Hazard, Robben etc caused/ cause devastating damage on a regular basis.....

3826~~~
Had the same question and I now see who it is. Excellent finishes tbf!

3827~~~
Those players are better dribblers. Januzaj's main weapon is his passing and vision. Just look at 48 seconds into the video. He had a brilliant touch, but wasn't able to capitalize on it. He could definitely play on the wing, but I think picking and choosing his moment to dribble will benefit him. He's not a natural winger that should stay out wide, dribble past players, and put in crosses. That's a waste of his talent.

3828~~~
I don't disagree with you.

I think the fact that he has played well from the wings speaks more to his talent and versatility.  No doubt he can be a good winger, but I don't think he will offer our squad as much from out wide.

Hazard and Robben are not wingers - they play on the outside of a narrow 3.  They may drift outside to find space to get touches but no one would ever call them true wingers.  I'll give you Giggs but his game was about pace and that pace was best utilized out wide in that squad.  Giggs couldn't have done what Keane and Scholes did through the middle - he wasn't that kind of player.

3829~~~
Another Everton link...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/story/2425931/adnan-januzaj-being-monitored-by-everton-sources" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/story/2425931/adnan-januzaj-being-monitored-by-everton-sources</a>

3830~~~
I'd let it happen. Bobby's Brown Shoes has to at least show up a bit at the start of the season, though.

3831~~~
It's on loan right? Wouldn't want to lose Januzaj just yet. This season was of course too risky to play him due tour our need to qualify for Europe but he needs consistent football and loaning him might be the best option to get that.

3832~~~
The loan should be part of a deal for Stones.

3833~~~
Actually I think the best role for him is the role Messi is playing or Barcelona right now. A playmaker coming in from the right hand side and drifting in. He seemed to play that role in the game above as well. He obviously won't give you those goals, but his style of play for me, suits that role best. Mata has been playing somewhat similar role for us of late. 

I still am not sure that we should loan him. In form he could be brilliant for our 1st team.

He would need to work on his long passes though. He played a gorgeous one at about 5:00 minutes in that above clip which is really Messi-eque, but he needs to work on his consistency of course.

3834~~~
Me neither. He has the talent and ability to make a difference right now to us provided he's not playing 1 game in every 5 or 6.

3835~~~
It's all about confidence. I wouldn't be worried one bit about putting a confident Januzaj in our first team. He'd do great. Just needs one decent run in a first team, ours or whoevers, where he plays like he really can.

3836~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3062396/Manchester-United-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 18px">Manchester United want to convert Adnan Januzaj into a striker as part of Louis van Gaal's long-term vision at Old Trafford</span></a>

3837~~~
At last !

3838~~~
Not a good idea.

3839~~~
Whatever his role, I would like to see him feature against West Brom.

3840~~~
He was great as a striker for the reserves in 2013, but he wasn't a goal scorer. His control and technique was just so good that he was able to bring others into play brilliantly. We already have Wilson who is a fantastic prospect.

3841~~~
A loan to PSV would be a good deal for us and Januzaj, I feel.

3842~~~
He's too good to go on loan. He just needs a couple of good games to win a place in the first 11, he has the quality. 

If he is to go on loan, I'd rather see him go to Everton or another midtable PL club than to PSV, surely he'll have a lot of offers.

3843~~~
Has he done anything this year to make you think he's "too good to go on loan" ?

3844~~~
Part of any Depay deal? Januzaj to spend a year on loan there perhaps?

3845~~~
Would be a fantastic deal for PSV, as they'd get money plus a fantastic young player for a year. Would be fantastic for Adnan as well as he'd probably play a good bit. Not sure if he'd get as much time at Everton.

3846~~~
Might give us the edge if we are trying to get him in terms of PSV's preference though ultimately the player will decide.

But yes, I'd rather him go to PSV on loan than Everton personally to get Champions League and European experience.

3847~~~
I think that seems quite likely, yeah. Would be a good deal.

3848~~~
Interesting. I can certainly see the benefit of a 6 month loan for Adnan out there at least. Close to home - Eindhoven to Brussels is 1hour 41 mins according to Google by car.

Instantly a star player. A flowing style in which he could thrive - score goals and run the show creatively without overburdening on the defensive side too much. Massive confidence booster potential with European football included - something Premier League options may not offer.

Would prefer him to head to Everton, Swansea or a Steve McClaren managed Newcastle so he could hurt title rivals but if that's not on the cards, this is very welcome as a Depay downpayment.

Out of interest, Brussles wiki says 9% of the population speak French and Dutch, Adnan has a very multicultural background, if he's already familiar with the language - this makes adds to the logic too.

3849~~~
Was all very predictable this, so many on here were pushing that he'd still get enough game time despite the signings and LvGs early formations. 

Now it seems the consensus is he's moved from amazing to stalling but that's nothing more than an indication of his limited game time as far as I'm concerned. 

If he goes out on a loan I'm not sure we'll see him again, its up to LvG to nurture him, the lads certainly ready.

3850~~~
We all agree its because of his limited game time. We're not going to play him at the expense of the squad just for experimentation purposes, which is why there seems to be a growing consensus that he needs a loan.

3851~~~
Would be a good deal for all parties if included in the Depay deal. Give them the money as well as adnan for the season, he can get some confidence back and develop with proper game time.

3852~~~
Fairly sure he speaks both.

I'm on the fence of if he should go on loan or not. I'd rather not but if we sign Depay then his playing time will still be low so I'd be for it. I'm against him going to PSV though, I don't think an Eredivisie loan does him any good. He'll still be inexperienced in the PL and still have to get more used to the physicality of it. He'd easily get playing time at a place like Everton especially if Mirallas leaves. He is miles better than Lennon or McGeady. <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> has also said that PSV play a counter style which is the complete opposite of us so there is no point him going to a side who play a completely different game to van Gaal.

3853~~~
I'd prefer to have a 20 years old player, working on his technique and tactic than adapting to the physicality of the premier league.

3854~~~
Because the PL is only about physicality right? No technique and tactics on show here. I'd rather a 20 year old getting experience for what he is actually going to need to play.

3855~~~
You are the one who used the physicality of the league as an argument for him to play in PL. I think that any team who can provide him coaching in decision making, Technique and Tactic is more important. I also only see Southampton and Everton able to provide him that in the PL.
I don't put Swansea because I believe that he also needs to play at the top end of a league, because the pressure of the results is higher, seeing him gain some experience in European competitions is also a good thing.

The interesting things with PSV is that next season, he could play cups finals every weekend, he could play in Europe and the dutch coaches are good.

3856~~~
Yes the added bonus of getting used to dealing with the physicality of the PL. Obviously it isn't the only plus of a PL loan, there is still loads of good technical and tactical talent on show in the PL and there are some great coaches as well. Swansea is higher than Everton in the table. I also think 30+ games in the PL is better experience than what would likely only be 6 in the CL.

3857~~~
As long as there's no sale clause involved, that would be a good loan. Still feel he could have a big impact but lvg knows what he needs best.

3858~~~
PSV?Forget it.They're a good club but Dutch league is shit, he needs to face proper oppositions at this stage of his development.

3859~~~
I don't see that prevents clubs from signings players from the Netherlands. Maybe us with Depay as well...

3860~~~
And many of them have failed.Also it's irrelevant to the average quality of the league.Many players signed from Belgian league as well.The gulf in quality between Dutch top clubs and the rest is shocking.We should send him to an as competitive as possible environment, whilst ensuring that he can get enough game times.If there's a PL club that fit the bill, why bother send him to another league?

3861~~~
Of course the right PL club would be the best option, it always is. But those sometimes just don't exist.

3862~~~
So I did a little research about Brands' (does the transfers at PSV) quotes about Januzaj.

It's behind a pay-wall but I've read most of it thanks to copy-and-paste sites. Basically they talked about the upcoming departure of Memphis and how they want to replace him. They gave him 5 options:
-Promote youth
-Buy from subtop in the Eredivisie
-Buy from top in the Eredivisie
-Loan a player from a topclub
-Loan a player with an option to buy

He replied to all those options and said Januzaj is on the list for a possible loan (probably without buying, like PSV currently do with Rekik and Isimat-Mirin). He realises the ED isn't what it used to be but also said it can be a good opportunity for young a player to show themselves and get confidence back, he hopes with CL he can convince some top players (which Januzaj would be in the ED) to play in Eindhoven.

I read nothing about them already informing about him, or if they even are going to. They might promote Bergwijn, buy Corona or someone else, move Locadia there or loan someone else. Nothing is set in stone, it's just that PSV would <i>like</i> to loan him - it will depend on Adnan and van Gaal.

3863~~~
LVG will undoubtedly want to keep him in the PL, one way or another. The only way he would end up at PSV would be in a deal for Depay imo.

3864~~~
I'd love to see Januzaj take a loan like that. Would show intelligence and the right attitude in my opinion. If he kicks up a fuss about not getting time here or wanting a loan elsewhere I'll be disappointed.

3865~~~
I know van Gaal prefers to keep talents at the club, since they'll learn nothing about his ways if they're at a different club (no matter what league). When he doesn't have a place for them at the time he might loan them out, although I'm not convinced he will loan him out yet.

Atsu from Chelsea got loaned to Everton and only played a handfull of matches, at PSV Januzaj will get much more. It's difficult to find a PL club which will play him alot. Of course it'll be a step down but it might benefit him in the long run, another year mostly spent on the bench won't be good for him.

If there's any news about PSV which is ManUtd related I'll post it. Brands' named Pereira in that same interview, they might loan him too (or just him). Again - nothing done and dusted yet (at least not on the copy and paste sites <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>).

3866~~~
I'd expect the likes of Pereira, who is further from the first XI than Januzaj, to be more likely of being sent abroad. Although if Mitten is to be believed he doesn't even want to send him away from the PL ideally. 

I do completely agree that a loan move would help his development (certainly compared to stagnating on the bench) but I imagined it being to a club like Everton in the Mirallas role.

3867~~~
They're probably comparably far from the first team right now in that neither are likely to play much next year, so a loan would suit both.

3868~~~
Atsu isn't as talented as Januzaj though (i think). Januzaj is known throughout the league for his talents, i'm certain he would be a starter for every bottom half team.

3869~~~
Yep, Zaha is getting good game time at Palace.

3870~~~
He's there permanently.

3871~~~
I'm actually quite a fan of Atsu, he's one of the few talents I expect to make it at Chelsea if he steps it up a notch. Great player when he was at Vitesse and for the national team of Ghana too.

I personally think van Gaal will keep Januzaj though since he doesn't like to loan out players, but if he is going to be loaned out a PL club where he will get alot of games will be preferred ofcourse. PSV wouldn't be a bad choice if those clubs can't guarantee him game time though. I just posted what the article said, I'm not trying to advocate he should go to PSV (even though I'd like it <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>).

3872~~~
Van Gaal really doean't seem to like Januzaj atm.

3873~~~
We got 3 injuries so there was no sub left for him, Wilson or Andreas.

3874~~~
Yep, our Subs get blown on injuries too often.

Or Di Maria is on the bench to come on ahead of him.

3875~~~
PSV would be a great choice for him next season. He desperately needs playing time and the dutch league is a good place to play and progress as a player.

3876~~~
No questions. I think Januzaj should have a loan spell at PSV too if he play on a regular basis with an approach that has many similarities with Van Gaal's. He's wasted on the bench right now IMHO.

3877~~~
Agreed.  Another point is that competing for titles requires consistency, which is always an issue with younger players.

3878~~~
He needs a loan deal that will guarantee him a first team spot. There is absolutely no benefit to sending him on loan to Everton to be a bench warmer.

3879~~~
Just read that back and completely agree with you. This over-inflation of 4 goals in a terrible campaign last season needs to stop. He was one of few positives last season, we all agree but there's a magical level he's reached amongst some that is simply unjustified.

He's "too good" for what  exactly? A premier League loan to any team right now? No. PSV? No. Quite frankly, as long as he can get game time and work on his attacking and creative play, delivering consistency in particular, then he should go to whoever offers at top level. If a club is happy to conform to position and even formation requirements of Louis or are in Europe, the better.

He needs a loan to any of those options because right now he's nowhere near the first team and can barely make the bench. That's not even mentioning this season's form has been woeful. Second season syndrome perhaps but if Louis can't see the potential and value to include him next year and ships him on loan, he'll only have himself to blame.

3880~~~
It's funny how easily people forget how good he was last season. He stood out last year as one of our key players at 19years old. He stepped up,  when the majority of players didn't. That talent didn't go away suddenly, just needs game time right now.

3881~~~
It's unfortunate for him that the rest of the team isn't strong enough, as we can't really risk playing him and letting him develop. He has probably deserved a few more starts/minutes though. 

Think a loan deal is definitely the best option next year.

3882~~~
I'd like to see him go to PSV or a similar club on loan. He desperately needs game time to continue his development so LVG needs to decide if he will get that here or elsewhere.

3883~~~
PSV are also in the Champions League. That would be great if he does go there on loan.

3884~~~
I thought his performances last year, although very good, were also a bit overrated because he's a youth player, and lets face it, we're all a bit desperate for a youth player to come through and set the world alight. The fact that he wasn't able to do it again is ample evidence he needs a loan where he can get minutes and develop.

3885~~~
good game from him today with the u-21's... goal and a great assist. him and wilson are clearly a cut above the rest.

any idea if he got injured?

3886~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52qhLbvQtDE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3887~~~
With Depay coming, the competition with Di Maria and Mata, even Valencia, I doubt that he will be here next year... For his development, he needs to play regularly. He has the potential to play with the Belgian team in the next Euro, and should take a loan somewhere else. 

I like him very much. His style etc. And would like him to develop in a terrific player, but I'm afraid that this second year has been too hard for his development

3888~~~
A loan to PSV makes all the sense in the world. I hope it happens when Depay arrives.

3889~~~
I would too but i'm not sure he's goid enough to play for them.

3890~~~
I wan't him to go to a Premier League side. I think he will be forgotten if he does go to PSV. Moving to PSV will just make his confidence low because he is just a item in the Depay deal.

Edit: On loan ofcourse.

3891~~~
I always thought he was left-footed. Is he right-footed? If not, that assist was fantastic for a pass played with his weaker foot.

3892~~~
Well, he did score his debut goals against Sunderland with his left foot, and they did seem like comfortable shots.

3893~~~
He's left footed. It was an exceptional pass with his weaker foot. 

Also we shouldn't loan him. We need a bigger squad for next year and he's easily talented enough to force his way into the side if given chances.

3894~~~
Nice ! Very well taken goal in traffic, and defense splitting assist for Wilson. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3895~~~
I'd loan him to a lower PL team, give him regular game time in the league he'll hopefully be playing in long term. 

Some nice stuff in that video, don't think any of the 'elite development squad' (lol) will be breaking in to city's first team any time soon though.

3896~~~
I agree with this but seem to be in a tiny minority on here.

3897~~~
Don't get fooled by Valencia. Most footballers have a decent weaker foot.

3898~~~
Yeah but LvG seems very different to Fergie when it comes to 'chances', i.e. rotation. It's very difficult for players to force their way into his team, in fact it's mostly happened this year due to injuries. The likes of Herrera and Mata got dropped earlier for having one or two bad games and couldn't get near the team again until others got injured. Januzaj is young and I'm still expecting him to be largely inconsistent next season so I still think his chances would be quite limited.

3899~~~
Assuming we're sticking with the three man attack, he'll have to get past Depay, Di Maria, Young and Mata to get a start. Having five wide players in the squad is too much.

3900~~~
a loan deal to a PL club is always preferable, although PSV always sounds like an interesting move.

if it is a PL club then i hope it is going to be a 6 months loan deal first, just in case we need to get him back in mid season or worse situation, he is not playing like rossi at newcastle years back.

3901~~~
Nope. Not many footballers could play that pass with their weaker foot.

3902~~~
We've played so (relatively) few games this season we haven't had any need to rotate. Will be a different story with European football and (hopefully!) more Carling Cup games.

3903~~~
Will be a shame if he gets loaned out while we play a fancy Dutch import, who is likely to have a tough time in his first season.

Adnan needs a regular chance to showcase his talent, which he has plenty of. Loans are no guarantees. He needs to train with the first team and get game time, which we would have plenty of next season.

3904~~~
PSV would be the perfect club for Januzaj.

Cocu is a good young manager who has a great working relationship with Van Gaal (played under him at Barcelona) so he can keep the trainer coach updated on Januzaj's progress, and maybe we can implement a specific training/ nutrition for Adnan in Eindhoven. He also professes an attacking style of play which will help with Januzaj' development, and has the experience of playing at big clubs, that's something which helps young players along the way.

PSV have a vacancy in the wide-ish attacking midfielder spot with the departure of Memphis and Tadic in consecutive windows so Adnan will get a chance to start sharpish. The Dutch school of football is renowned for training wingers/ wide midfielders (something that Gary Neville pointed out in a recent segment) :

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MLSNE162yo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Januzaj will also get the chance to play in the Champions League and maybe content for the Eredivisie title again next season vs Ajax. And he will have a low pressure environment to hone his craft, something that gets overlooked in the bottom line-oriented approach of mid table Premier League clubs where a lot of managers have no time for longer term perspective or player development, and will have no problems in consistently starting a more experienced player over Januzaj just because he might help scrape an extra point or two. There is no intrinsic benefit to loaning him out to another team in the league.

At PSV, Januzaj will likely get more playing time, potential title deciding game experience (vs Ajax or Feyenoord), will get to play in the Champions League, train under Cocu  alongside other young players in their team, and just develop his game in a low pressure environment away from the media glare. Seems ideal.

3905~~~
You must be joking? They have already confirmed they would love to take him on loan.

3906~~~
I guess that a move to PSV makes more sense. They play in a higher technical level than most of EPL teams, play in UCL, and will fight for the title there. Better than going to the likes of Sunderland, Stoke or similar teams, especially considering that if they're fighting for relegation they may drop him for a tall and strong player.

Southampton might be a good option, but not sure that he'll start for them.

3907~~~
It's a fair point, and <a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> post above is certain very convincing, I just feel that loans abroad don't always work out as well as ones where the player stays in England, plus PL experience is always good.

3908~~~
as long as we don't meet Leeds or MK Dons.

Yeah we have played feck all games, that's true, but still, we've just signed Memphis, and I'm pretty sure both Young and Di Maria will be here next season too. I'm not sure being our 4th choice winger (potentially 5th, if Mata is here) next season is enough for Adnan, despite the extra games. He's also very Nani-esque (dare I say it) in that he seems to need a constant run of games to hit form, something I'm just not sure will happen very often.

EDIT: And invictus has made such a convincing case for PSV there that it seems a no brainer!

3909~~~
Very well put, I'm sold. Loan him to PSV.

3910~~~
I'm always wary about loans abroad. For young footballers, a bit part of their adaption to English football goes beyond playing football and is about feeling settled and happy between training/games. I guess a lot will depend on his home circumstances (which I know feck all about) but I would worry that spending a season in Holland would set him back in terms of the non-footballing progress he's made in feeling at home as a PL player. In terms of players going abroad on loand and coming home ready for the first team there's not many good precedents. Courtois would be one but I don't think he spent any time in England before he went to Atletico? Loads of examples of player going on overseas loans, never to be seen again though.

3911~~~
I agree with this. We hear a lot about the Premier League and it's physicality. I think he still needs to adapt to that, which won't happen if he goes abroad. I'm sure it could still be a fruitful investment of time, but I think a loan would be best spent in the Premier League, and at a decent side who will play him. Like Welbeck at Sunderland, who weren't a bad side at the time. 

Our loans have been a bit disastrous in the last few years, and we need to choose where our loanees go more carefully. Preferably not relegation fodder, and/or circus clubs like QPR, but rather teams who will play decent, expansive football. Januzaj is good enough currently to be getting games at Swansea or Everton

3912~~~
Honestly did not know that. Great news if true. Think he could benefit from that greatly. Away from the circus that is the prem. Lots of gametime at a very good level.

3913~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> - Tadic was at Twente. I think you meant Mertens.

3914~~~
He's been very patient this season, I'll give him that.

3915~~~
Oops yeah thanks for the correction. Should've been Dries to Napoli. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Plus Jozefjoon is injured and Bakkali will likely leave in the summer transfer window. Narsingh is probably their only reliable winger as things stand.

3916~~~
I honestly think we can write this kid off - here is the scenario I think will play out.  He will be loaned to a side and play very well, start garnering interest from some of the other big clubs and one will make a splash offer for him.  He will think long and hard about it but in the end heads off due to not getting his chances at United.  I am a fan of the kid, but like DiMaria, I just don't see him fitting into LVG's systematic way of playing football.

3917~~~
Hope this year has not stalled his development. We all expected him to push on from last season and be a massive threat but it just hasn't worked out. I'm not sure LvG has faith in him to start, how many Premiership games has he started?

If he doesn't play to give him the minutes next season then he should go out on loan. It's always risky but if he's in the right environment then it can be a great move, and hopefully we don't have to many injuries so he's not needed as much.

3918~~~
Thanks for the insides, Nostradamus

3919~~~
This season might be the best thing that ever happens to him. Let's not forget all the 'drama' before he signed a contract. This season has grounded him and he's worked on his strength. So, he will be a better player for it. He knows what he has to do to play week in week out. He's got great potential.

3920~~~
Could be a good point that. My only concern is his first team appearances seem to be getting worse not better, which is why I'd like to see him go somewhere domestic and start most games.

3921~~~
Not that its saying much but for me he looked the most lively of any attacking player today.

3922~~~
Played well, didn't have much support or movement to work with though.

3923~~~
Nearly got through after that Mazy run.

Still and will always have faith in the lad.

3924~~~
That's the good thing about having young players in your team.They always look like they have some hunger in them regardless of the circumstances.

3925~~~
Yeah made a few bursting runs and then looked around to find no one was anywhere near him. Most of the team looked like they just cba today.

3926~~~
Looked lively when he came on and was our only real attacking threat.

3927~~~
I can't believe he's only rated .2 higher than Wilson at the moment.

3928~~~
Talents always there. A tough second season. Does anyone know if he's involved for Belgium in the summer at all? Did there u21s qualify?

3929~~~
One of the biggest disappointments this season was his stagnation.

3930~~~
Decline, he waa 3 classes higher under Moyes than this season.

3931~~~
Looked pretty good today, hopefully he can have a good pre season and come back full of confidence next season and hopefully recover his form.

3932~~~
Difficult to come into that game, especially after not being played for some time

3933~~~
Lots of talent and you have to wonder how true LVG's instructions of "no creativity/dribbling" are? Janujaz needs to be developed and given more playing time next season. Whether this is sending him on loan or dropping Fellaini/Mata/Young to accommodate him is another matter.

3934~~~
Unfulfilled talent. Hard to judge him not having a run of games. Young and learning. 

4.5/10

3935~~~
He has felt absolutely toothless the last 30 times I've seen him play. No threat whatsoever.

3936~~~
Showed promise but didn't provide one cross today.

3937~~~
Not true today though. Initiated two really good attacking opportunities with two great long range passes aswell as a few driving runs almost going through on goal. The lad's got all the tools to be an awesome player, great passing/vision aswell as pace and dribbling makes him a threat in any sort of scenario. Its just a matter of belief.

That's probably because he was almost only attacking from a central position. Played some really good passes to set up chances.

3938~~~
Hes'a class talent. Wish this sort of game had come a bit earlier in the season for him. He would have gained a bit of confidence from it.

3939~~~
Agreed, he's a good young talent.  I'd hate for him to go on loan next season.

3940~~~
1 assist in 1 year, like Rafael.

3941~~~
Well he's not a natural winger so not sure why you would highlight a lack of crossing.

Januzaj will be back to his best when he starts playing centrally and is able to better find pockets of space. He has good speed for a #10, a great first touch, and can pass. He also has more empty space to dribble in the middle of the pitch when the opportunity arises.

3942~~~
It's not his forte. But the fact that he showed promise is in itself a good step forward given his confidence levels.

3943~~~
Not really a surprise with absolutely nothing to play for.

Was never gonna be a good game to play in against a side fighting for relegation either.

Plus they had to go to Hull and nobody ever wants to visit Hull.

3944~~~
We need to use him or lose him.

3945~~~
Still see a big talent. Lots have lost faith in him but I'm confident he'll come good.

3946~~~
I would like to see him develop into the left sided CM, he definitely has that in him to play a di Maria esque game, just with more composure and can play at a lower tempo.

3947~~~
Yeah, I noticed this as well. Kid hasn't played for ages but showed up with good spirit and a will to make things happen in a dead rubber match. That's not for nothing.

3948~~~
He played this nice flicked lob pass to (I think) fellaini which was reminder of his eye and weight of pass when he's confident. It was one of the things that stood out about his last year. Despite his low confidence this season and hence over eagerness to dribble dribble dribble, the kid has got potentially got an excellent passing ability.

3949~~~
Funnily I was going give him stick for naively trying to dribble past 8 defenders which usually ends up in a soft free kick claim or a dive but deleted it. I hope he grows out of that habit, it might have worked in U18 but in the PL.

3950~~~
Should be loaned out next year if we are only going to play him sparingly.

3951~~~
This. #10

3952~~~
I thought he was very quiet when he came on, I don't remember him doing anything at all.

3953~~~
Loaning him out would be the best option for us but I don't think he wants that given that PSG have already been sniffing. Not sure LVG will play him enough next season though. The boy needs to pick it up too though, he doesn't want to be another Macheda

3954~~~
Funny how he's gone from the next Ronaldo to Luke Chadwick circa 2001. Best not to hype the kids up next time ehh.

3955~~~
We have better number 10s though. And with the demand for success as it is in football at the moment, we don't have time for him to learn his role in the first team.

3956~~~
On the one hand, with CL games next year he would probably get more gametime, but he needs to be playing regularly and consistently, so a loan may be best.

Its a shame because if he had a good season this year, he could potentially have been our first choice #10 going into next season, which would be an ideal situation.

3957~~~
The hype surrounding Januzaj was and is justified, and comparisons with Luke Chadwick are inherently silly.

Injuring permitting, Januzaj will develop into one of the best forwards in the game over the coming years. Whether that is at United remains to be seen, but he's still as sure a thing you will see. He needs regular game time to do this, though. A good loan next season is of paramount importance.

His skill set is brilliantly unique, and I don't think there's a young player (20 and under) that is as well rounded, with as many strings to the bow, in the game today. Big calls, but I'm somewhat unshakeable in my belief on this one.

3958~~~
The key will be whether he has a football brain and an aptitude towards continuous self improvement. Personally I'm not yet sold on either.

3959~~~
He's already demonstrated a variety of passing and as a result, clever vision, which dictates that he does have a football brain capable of being aware of what is around him. Knowing when to shoot and when to pass has been lacking in his small amount of game time this season, but decision making was noticeably mature for such a young age the season prior, so I think confidence may be the bigger issue here.

As for the latter, his attitude, I have no idea. He appears to be fairly driven fella' to me, but that's just guesswork, I suppose.

3960~~~
It's better for him to move on to a smaller and faster playing club.

3961~~~
He demonstrated it last year, but has struggled to this year. In fact, we have scarcely even seen glimpses of last year's glimpses, which is quite troubling in the football brain department. No one is questioning his talent, it's all about his desire and aptitude to improve at this point.

3962~~~
But it's fair to say that this season has hardly been ideal for a young player breaking through. No consistent formation, the pandering to three largely pointless centre forwards for half a season, horrible luck with injuries throughout the squad.

I don't think Van Gaal has found a position for Januzaj yet. And by the time the squad started to settle into some kind of consistent rhythm, it was Mata and Young who were given the nod out wide, with Fellaini through the middle for balance.

If anything, what has happened to Januzaj this season may be the making of him. If he doesn't have that desire right now then I doubt he ever will have. I'm positive, however.

3963~~~
He is our 19th most featured player in the premierleague which is far from deserved. I am not that big fan of him, but IMO he should have at least got one decent run of games when the team improved. I mean, he has just 7 starts, someone like Falcao who was injured(and poor) for lot of time has 14.

Saying that, he is not the only one, Wilson has a case too.

3964~~~
All true, although I suspect it won't get any easier for young players to come through since the pressure is on LvG to win, mainly with high priced incoming transfers. If anything, this year's injury crisis should've afforded young Adnan more, not less, opportunities to get minutes, when in fact the likes of McNair got a bulk of the youth attention this year. Its quite clear LvG doesn't believe Januzaj is ready, which is why the discussed loan spell makes good sense.

3965~~~
To be fair to LVG Januzaj really made a mess of his early chances. Hes improved a bit in latter games but theres no shock hes not featured more and that hes up for loan.

3966~~~
How did he mess it up at the start?

His first start of the season was West Brom away where he was understandably rusty. Before that he had already played in multiple positions as a sub including a game at right wing back. He followed that up by being our best attacking player at home to Chelsea. Look sharp against City in the game following that until he had to be withdrawn due to Smalling's brain fart. Wasn't great against Palace but no worse than any of our other players. After this "run" of games he wasn't seen for 2 months at which point he returned to play as a Left Back against Stoke.

3967~~~
He has a great football brain, but he's regressed in that area the more he's gotten to play as a winger. It started to happen last year under Moyes. I've said this countless times, but in the youth team whether he was a #10 or on the right wing, he always came towards the ball and had a bit of freedom. He shined. At this point everyone was pointing out how intelligent he was compared to everyone else on the pitch and he had the touch, technique, and passing to always stand out. This is why I wish there were more of his games from 2012-2013 on youtube to show how drastic his play style changed.

I don't know if he started to receive instructions from Moyes or Giggs, but he started to really emphasize dribbling under them. He always had the ability and he showed it in the youth teams, but he chose to do so a lot less. This was despite playing against smaller, weaker, and slower players in the youth teams. In the first team, he started to dribble a lot more despite playing against men. Why the sudden change? I don't know.

As the season went on, he started to come towards the ball a lot less and frequently found himself waiting for the ball to come to him on the wing. This is a completely different playing style than what he showed in the youth teams. I'm sure he was instructed to do this, because that isn't his natural playing style. That is why there were a lot of games where he was invisible towards the 2nd half of the season.

His game became all about dribbling and waiting for the ball. You can see how that's a problem this season. If his dribbling is on point, he becomes really dangerous. If his dribbling isn't working, then he becomes a one trick pony who frustrates the fans with his bad decision making. This on top of receiving the ball a lot less. This trend has continued and it's obvious that LVG likes his wingers to keep the width.

I think it's important for the coaching staff to realize what kind of player he is. As a young player he isn't going to refuse to play a position. Pereira and Januzaj have both stated that they will play whatever position the manager asks of them like all young players would say. They'll take any playing time they can get. I also understand that he has better players in front of him that can play the #10 or at least have freedom to be on the ball, so he'll have to deal with playing on the wing like a lot of young players start out. It obviously sounds silly that my post makes it sound like I know more than the coaching staff (I don't intend to come off that way), as they obviously know more from watching the players in training, but it's just frustrating seeing him play so differently than what made him originally stand out in the youth teams.

3968~~~
Good post.

3969~~~
He looked like a kid again at the start of the season who was trying too hard and making the wrong decisions. Taking people on when he shouldnt have been and picking the wrong passes.

With LVG concentrating on getting everyone well drilled that was never going to fly.

3970~~~
Glad to see his positive attitude after a difficult season, I still think he will be a success here.

3971~~~
Can't see where he says he's not interested in a loan though.

3972~~~
Thought he was decent vs Hull, gonna post individual highlights below. Didn't make any mistakes really apart from once when he slipped. He's direct and looks to do something with the ball so it looks like he's making more mistakes than others, when in reality he is at the times the only one trying something. Was even more of a breath of fresh air last season but still love the lad

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XcGbjb9mjSY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3973~~~
Ew... highlights of the hull game.

3974~~~
One of the very few that actually drive at opponents and look to create.

3975~~~
By the sound out of it he seems to believe he can develop the best while staying with us.

3976~~~
Both him and Wilson deserve plenty of game time next season to develop consistency if we focused on strengthening midfield and defense in the transfer market.

3977~~~
Good post. The way he plays at times is just ridiculous and you have to think he is being instructed to do it as he never used to play like this before. He spends half his time just standing on the sideline. He doesn't suit that and imo no one is going to be effective playing like this. Especially with our slow possession style we are taking him out of the game ourselves. He stands on the sideline and gets the ball played to feet and the defenders just stand off and jockey. You can only go one way when you are on the sideline and you aren't going to do much that causes danger and it usually leads him and all our wingers to just pass it back. He is even looking invisible at times for u21s with this retarded playing style.

He doesn't even need to play as a #10, we have Mata on the RW playing a role that Adnan would thrive in. Why is he not being told to play the same way when he gets in? One of my favourite things about him in the 12-13 season was his ability to beat his man with his first touch and sometimes with no touch. His feints and fakes fooled every defender and he turned them with ease. You can't do that on the sideline as the defender just stands off and lets you turn. If we don't sort this out then he isn't going to get better, world class players would struggle with the way he is being expected to play. There has been times where we have the ball on the left and he'll be on the right sideline, its idiotic.

3978~~~
We need to start playing him as the furthest forward in a midfield 3. That's the only position he'll ever develop into a world class player in. All this other stuff we seem to be doing just isn't helping us at all. Stop trying to turn the poor lad into Giggs for gods sake. Once he develops fully from a physical standpoint he should be star, sadly that doesn't look like its going to be the case with how he's being utilised.

3979~~~
No it's not, he has potential but just not as good as those who hyped him up as one of the finest young player in Europe out there, who is comparable to young Ronaldo.
I remembered it's also the case when people used to hyped Jones up as next John Terry or even new Duncan Edwards back then. It just needed to be stopped.

3980~~~
This is one of a very few videos from 2012-2013 season. I think it does a good job of explaining what I was talking about. Where in that performance does it scream "januzaj is a winger?" 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQs31vriCaw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3981~~~
Good post. Boggles my mind when people question his intelligence as that was exactly what stood out when he first burst into the scene. You are spot on in your observation that he started to suffer when he was asked to stay out wide and maintain width. Players like him need that little bit of freedom to excel; he is neither a traditional winger nor he has the pace to shine strictly as a winger. In order for him to show his talent he needs to be play with freedom as one of the three forwards or as a number #10.

His stagnation has been one of the major disappointments of the season along with us settling for 4th.

3982~~~
He is one of the finest young players (20 and under) in Europe. That's not hype, it's the reality of playing for Manchester United regularly at the age of 18, being one of the best performers at the seventh best team in England (no easy feat). Then going to the World Cup with one of the strongest European squad's represented not that long after his nineteenth birthday. That's his CV. Alongside his unique skillset and countless pieces of very interesting play in two short seasons, he was awarded hype and praise because very few young forwards were doing what he did. If you can name some then press ahead, but after Raheem Sterling the list starts to dry up.

3983~~~
There are tons of fine 20 and under players who failed in their career over the years. 

Point being he is not as good as he is being hyped (some even suggest he is better than young Ronaldo) and this season already proves that. But not saying he will fail in future, he has his strength and shorting comings even in his first year, but people tend to ignore all his shortcomings because of his young age and then hyped him up assuming he will improve and develop his game accordingly as he grew. 

Fair enough though but every young player develop their game in different pace and we never know (Rooney was supposed to be better player than Ronaldo when they were in their teenages)

3984~~~
Just because a player doesn't develop as expected doesn't mean to say that the initial hype was unjustified. You make a point about Rooney which doesn't make a great deal of sense. He <i>was </i>better than Ronaldo during his teenage years. Just because Ronaldo developed into the better footballer doesn't negate that fact. 

Define the hype, anyway. What is it, exactly, that you so vehemently disagree with? If people are calling Januzaj one of the best young talents in the game today then they'd be correct, because that's exactly what he is given the reasoning I've outlined further above. Comparisons with a young Ronaldo were also fairly sensible in context, given the way they both burst on to the scene during periods of uncertainty within the team. Nobody is really suggesting that he will be as good as what Ronaldo became. I've never seen claims that like anywhere, and rightly so.

3985~~~
i think you have confused "early promised" with "hype". No one doubt Januzaj has shown early promise with his natural talent, but that doesn't equal to high chance of future success. When a player being hyped as next best thing, there will be huge expectation generated from the hype which goes unrealistically high. Anderson was once regarded as best young talent and next best thing too, but look at him now.

For Januzaj case, I have raised questions before on his shorting comings during his first "promising season" (too selfish, poor decision making, tendency to dive, always held the ball too long and slowing down attack play etc) which I regarded as flaw, but people would tend to ignore all these and only focus on his hype instead.

3986~~~
As I said before, he was unlucky this season, he struggled a bit with confidence but the biggest blow was the change of system, we haven't played wingers for more than half of the season so he didn't settle well, as b2b he's done quite well at one point and the other game he was quite poor but it wasn't only him who was poor, but he was easy target for some people here..

We got used to some terrific performances from season one. When we finally picked form and started to play something, since Spurs game, Mata and Young both picked fantastic form so it was difficult for him to get gametime, Van Gaal didn't want to rotate much as he's seen that the team worked well, so it's understandable and off course there is always 65 mil. player ahead of you in the pecking order, by his performances he should never be head of Januzaj IMO. We should have definitely tried dimaria back in midfield when fellaini started to pick up poor games, if start dimaria at all and Januzaj could get some gametime.

However I guess it's just unfortunate season for him, he'll come stronger next when we finally start to play wingers from the day one, it will be a big competition for him so I hope he will do his best to improve over summer. With full preseason it will be also better than coming back form WC.

3987~~~
Where is the confusion? You disputed that the hype surrounding him was justified. I think it was justified, primarily because he has one of the most unique skillsets I've seen. I think what he's demonstrated so far <i>does </i>raise expectations and I think that's only right. Nobody knows for certain what he will or won't become, we're only here to offer opinion. Personally, I'm absolutely convinced he'll be one of the better attackers in the game one day, albeit I'm not sure where that will be. You probably don't rate him as highly, which is fine.

3988~~~
Still some rumors in Dutch media about Januzaj joining PSV for a loan. What do you guys think of that?

Our Eredivisie is shit but Januzaj will play a full season and 6 games i the CL.

3989~~~
Frustrating season for the lad, but we often see "second season syndrome ".

I definitely think he has the quality to make it as a first team regular but im a bit worried by the way he often dribbles into dead ends.  Maybe he is just trying too hard to impress.

3990~~~
Would rather he was loaned in the Prem.

3991~~~
That would be great he doesn't need to play in the Prem because he is already physically suited to the league, what he needs, is a league where he will have to make decisions and sharpen his technique, the Eredivisie is great for that.

3992~~~
A symptom of his lack of playing time, which he isn't likely to get any more of next year with all the new players we're bringing in.

3993~~~
True, although there will be more games. Other than Memphis i cant see us bringing in another attacking mid.

3994~~~
I rate him as promising young player with wonderful raw talents, just as he has displayed so far, as we've seen a lot  of those over years. Not the next best thing or at young Ronaldo level to me though, not yet I mean.

3995~~~
Never thought of this but it makes a hell of a lot of sense. He's playing completely like a touch line hugging dribbling wide man whereas he should be playing more like what mata has been, a playmaking wide player.

Lvg does have these stubborn ideas about the system though so it's a little worrying. For example, Rooney was told that he doesn't have to go searching for the ball but needs to do great work/get goals/make an impact in a few touches. That's fine for a centre forward but for a wide man who isn't electric and is really a number 10, it could hamper him.

3996~~~
Don't disagree with your overall viewpoint, but I'd like to know what's so unique about his skillset?

3997~~~
I think the way he can beat opposition players from a standing start without being an out and out winger is incredibly impressive. He isn't particularly fast but his dribbling ensures he can drift through player to player. He has definite traits of a wide man, but I think he has great vision, clever passing and bears all the hallmarks of a future #10. I'm hopeful he can learn to dictate games from the centre of the park, in the way we've seen Silva do so brilliantly over the past few seasons. That's no given, in fact it's very unlikely, but it's something to aim for. That he's a lefty makes all of it so elegant.

In theory I could be describing a player like Ozil above. He's one of few players I feel make a reasonable comparison in terms of playing style. Take Ozil's best traits and add in the effortless ability to breeze by opponents and you <i>could, </i>and I stress <i>could, </i>be looking at what Januzaj can offer to a team in the long run.

3998~~~
I think he needs a run of games in a free role.

A role where he can come and collect the ball and drop and move into positions without fear of being caught out of position as he will be covered by other players.

Then I think we would see him really start to thrive.

Unfortunately this principle goes entirely against Van Gaals philosophy.

3999~~~
It all depends on how they use him and how often he will play. If we can structure the loan in a way that gives the player every chance to benefit, it could be worth doing.

4000~~~
PSV lost their left winger to us so that position will freed up since they dont have any replacement at the club. Their right winger (Narsingh) is shit and his main quality is his speed but other than that he's nothing special. 

PSV plays with 3 midfielders. 2 central midfielders and 1 defensive midfielder. Wijnaldum is one of those central midfielders and will most likely leave PSV but i dont think Adnan could take over his position.

At the moment i think he would play just about every match at the left winger position. He would be allowed cut inside since Willems (very attacking left back from PSV) plays as a left winger most of the time. With his crossing, Willems provides a lot of assists from that left side. However Willems could also leave PSV.

4001~~~
What is the problem? Van Gaal doesn't trust a fellow Dutchman (Phillip Cocu) to teach Januzaj how to play the game in the best Dutch traditions and allow Januzaj to gain confidence?

4002~~~
Let's say Schneiderlin comes in. The main issue that people opposed to it seem to have with him taking over Carricks role in the squad is that he can't match Carricks range of passing. Do you think that playing Adnan in the "Fellaini (or Di maria) role" could be a solution to this, rather than having to search for another more passing-oriented midfielder to complement the midfield (such as for example Gundogan)? I think that the lad has a very good variety and range of passes already and with Schneiderlin behind him perhaps we'd be balanced enough to make that work aswell without losing stability. We saw a little bit of it against Hull where he almost set up Rooney and one where he switched it cross-field to Mata to open up the play.

4003~~~
No, too wasteful.

4004~~~
I'm hoping with the fuller schedule next season Januzai will have plenty of opportunities to develope.

But note to all the young kids...don't get kicked out the cups in the first few rounds if you wish to make it into the first team!

4005~~~
which has been said about every young attacking player ever. 

you can't possibly be a direct, attacking player and not lose the ball.

4006~~~
Well look at the likes of AOC, Reus, Draxler, Neymar, Hazard, Sterling aged 20, they were also direct and attacking but they lost the ball far less. Januzaj has good intelligence and vision, but it seems very inconsistent for him. He will get a player 1 vs 1 easily, but then afterwards make a pointless run and lose the bal unneccesarily.

4007~~~
I'm expecting big things from Janujaz next season.

4008~~~
Similarly, I am hoping that Mi Daria has a better season.

4009~~~
hazard was crap when he first got to chelsea and a lot of fans were asking for their money back. short term pain for long term gain. i'd say all in all they're pretty glad they kept him, wouldn't you say?

4010~~~
Crap? He didnt meet their early expectactions of one of the best young talents in the world, but not crap. And Im not really talking about being good or shit, Januzaj is just quite wasteful.

4011~~~
I don't think he was wasteful as a 10 or midfielder. Just quiet.

4012~~~
talk he will be sold...

hope not.

4013~~~
Fecking hope not. But a loan would probably be for the best.

4014~~~
Crap? How was he crap? He didn't have the kind of impact on games he's having now but from the moment he signed he become their most influential player only 2nd to Mata during that first season.

4015~~~
It's just down to whether he can get comfortable enough with the extremely detailed and rigid tactics of Van Gaal in time to be a factor next season. If not we should loan him out at the end of pre-season.

4016~~~
And then repeat that exact process the following year? Keep him and persevere until he's ready.

4017~~~
------------back 5-----------

-------Carrick--Herrera------

-----------Januzaj-------------

--Di Maria--Rooney---Depay

4018~~~
We would certainly have to pick his club carefully and make sure he was continuing his education in that style of football. 

Januzaj is a SAF type of player, you tell him to 'Go out and enjoy yourself' and he looks like a future star. Ask him to rigidly perform a tactical dance and he looks like a teenager inexperienced in his craft. 

I hope he progresses enough to be a factor next season. If he's not going to get to that point, better keep him happy with first team football somewhere, at worst.

4019~~~
You know what, that could be. My memory suggests that he was poor in his first season as he settled but I could certainly be wrong about that. Evidently I was.

4020~~~
Wonderful side that, depending on how quickly Depay adjusts to the league and how our back 4 perform we'd win the league playing amazing football.

4021~~~
He wasn't poor but wasn't great. He was good <i>for his age. </i>Underwhelming according to some which was harsh. Most here thought Oscar was the better player.

4022~~~
I haven't seen anything from adnan to suggest he could play a starting role in any position next season, and i'm not convinced that players like him are the type to provide squad depth. He needs to be loaned.

4023~~~
Not sure LvGs low risk policy quite suits Adnans game, where he likes to pick up the ball and move forward, rather than pass it to player X, in a deliberate way to build moves.
I don't know what will happen next year, It's tough to see which position he fits best in LvG's eyes,

I'd really hate to sell him, he has the raw talent to be a good player for us, it would be a betrayal of the Man Utd that I know if we shipped a youngster like him out, Sir Alex would have given him the time and games to develop.

4024~~~
Funny the contrast between the pogba thread where not playing him was marked as 'fergie's greatest mistake' and heavily critisized, and here we can't trust adnan to play any role because he gives the ball away too much. 

If we don't play him and he's a star for PSG in a few years the headlines write themselves

4025~~~
A few months ago there were rumours of LVG wanting to convert Januzaj into a striker - has there been anything further about that?

4026~~~
If he doesn't want Adnan to be as risky, don't play him as a winger as he will attempt more dribbling from that position.

4027~~~
That's giving the keys of the team car to a player who is just not good enough at the moment.

4028~~~
Swap Di Maria and Januzaj around imo. In reality, he hasn't done enough to be in our starting XI but I certainly think he has all the potential in the world.

4029~~~
Needs an end product to start in the team.

4030~~~
It's all Moyes fault. He was comparing Adnan to Cruyff. Everyone knows Van Gaal hates Cruyff.

4031~~~
He did what?!!?!! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

4032~~~
Hasn't shown enough to warrant a place in the team, its not uniteds job to facilitate him no matter what, its about him forcing the issue in training and taking his opportunities when he does get gametime. all the tools and facilities are there for him to crack on and forge a brilliant career at united, but its down to him. its not fifa where you just brute force him into the lineup and eventually he gets 90+ rating.

4033~~~
I get what you're saying but we kind of did with De Gea. He'll get more opportunities once the ship has steadied.

4034~~~
Didn't Van Gaal say last season that the youth side of the club would be left as is for the year because he was busy with the first team?
Think it was in pre season.

Hopefully the likes of mcnair, shaw, januzaj and wilson get more game time next year in cups at least.
I'd be disappointed to loan januzaj next season, forget selling him.

Throw depay and some older, wiser heads in around them 4 and we could have the skeleton of a good team for a long time.
Granted januzaj didn't have a great year last season but he still got about a dozen or so games, he'll get opportunities again next season.

4035~~~
I assume you think SAF was bang on to not play an 18 year old Pogba who under performed in his other appearances even if it meant him leaving the club?

4036~~~
I do.

4037~~~
Anyone who was around back then does too, just a lot of posts in other threads saying it was fergie going senile. Just hope people realise not putting faith in Adnan now is the exact same thing, albeit adnan has shown a lot more in his first team appearances than pogba did

4038~~~
Pogbas attitude at the time meant he didn't deserve to play also he's not worth all the hype everyone is making out. Adnan deserves more time from us. We'll battling on 4 fronts next season so there will be plenty of games for him to make his mark.

4039~~~
I Think that he meant that he wouldn't have time for evaluating and setting up the direction of the Academy because all of his focus would go to training the first team. I don't think that doesn't include the likes of Januzaj and Shaw who already were, and would be full members of the first team, and maybe Wilson.

I Think that we've probably has a bit more of a short term mentality in order to secure the top 4 position. Once we've established ourselves at that level we'll be able to start looking toward the future again.

But we'll have a lot of games to play again next year so I'm sure that he'll get a lot more opportunities to play next year compared to this, as long as he doesn't go out on loan.

4040~~~
I don't agree with this. Not based upon what he did when he was given chances this year. As someone else above said, it's up to him to force the issue. When given time, at least do better than others who play your position. He simply didn't.

4041~~~
Disagree all you want, sometimes you have to nurture the talent as well not just expect them to hit the ground at 100 mph. We all got spoilt with the likes of Rooney and Ronaldo being so good at a very young age. Adnan will get more time and more chances.

4042~~~
I strongly believe we should loan him out this season, preferably to a Premier League side.

He needs to be playing regular football and I don't think we can offer him that. We'll have extra games, but there's no guarantee LvG totally changes his side in these cup games. He put out some ridiculously strong sides against the likes of Preston and Cambridge and it is possible that's how he operates, unlike how Fergie did in games like that. 

Also, for him to be a fit in the current system we use he can either play on the left or right. We have Depay, Mata, Young and Di Maria currently vying for 2 spots already, it's going to be hard for him to get into the team as a sub, let alone a starter.

4043~~~

I don't know about playing style, but I see some physical resemblance myself, actually.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.khelnama.com/sites/default/files/previewimage/features/2013/Jul/Adnan-Januzaj.jpg" src="http://img.khelnama.com/sites/default/files/previewimage/features/2013/Jul/Adnan-Januzaj.jpg"/>

4044~~~
Sometimes I forget what a talent we have on our hands. Just looking at the Sterling thread, we easily overlook the fact we also have someone with similar potential on our hands. (Obviously Sterling is much more advance in his development right now) Seriously hope we don't mess this one up because this kid has real talent.

4045~~~
Been saying this for months. Shteve McClaren would gladly take him.

4046~~~
I'm for loaning him too. Seems a bit of a kick in the teeth after having a breakthrough, but it's probably for the best. 

I just find Premier League loans so dodgy. Is he a clear upgrade for the passing teams in the league? 
And the teams in the bottom third tend to have their own issues and usually prefer athletes and less risky players. He'll be seen as a wide man wherever he goes. 

People have suggested Everton. But would they play both him and Barkley behind Lukaku regularly? Delofeu only managed 9 starts their during his loan spell. He'd get 25-30 starts in La Liga easily. But I doubt he fancies a move like that, and it's a totally different style of play.

4047~~~
Good post. The bolded part is true. I think a lot of people here don't want to see him loaned out because of the Moyes season, but there is almost no way he is going to cement a spot in our side for 15/16 when our 3 forward spots (I assume we will play 433, or some variation of that sort where we have 3 midfielders, and not two) will have options like Rooney, Mata, Depay, Di Maria, RVP (possibly), with Young & Wilson both being predicted to see a lot of pitch-time. Also, if Chicharito goes (I know Januzaj is not likely to compete directly, as he'll be wide or behind the striker), we're likely to buy another forward. Adnan needs to go on loan so he can have regular game-time to both develop and prove himself for United.

That said, I don't know if the Deulofeu comparison is apt - Januzaj has been off-form for quite some time now, but has shown himself to be a better footballer. He definitely has more quality in him, it is just a matter of putting it all together on the pitch - he's simply too ineffective right now. If Everton could guarantee that he plays as much as possible when fit (within reason), i'm all for it, but it's too hard to predict whether he will kick on or not.

I'm undecided myself on where I think we should loan him to, but I do feel that he has to go for a year at the very least. He has huge talent that cannot be put to waste.

4048~~~
PSV wouldn't be a bad loan option. Everton wouldn't be bad either, keep him close enough to home which could be important to a player his age.
Still dont see why people think januzaj is a #10 and not a winger though.

Does he play as a 10 for the youth teams or something.
Always looked much better on the wing to me.

4049~~~
He has never really been a natural winger in the U21 and U18 mate. Certainly not from what I have seen either live on tele. He actually played as a striker for the U21 too.

I'd much prefer him to go to Everton/Newcastle than PSV though.

4050~~~
Still fully believe he will be a very important player for us in the future.

4051~~~
There is no need for us to even consider selling him. I think a loan in the prem will do him the world of good.

4052~~~
I'd keep him until Christmas, and if he isn't featuring by then loan him out.

I also don't think he's a winger, he'd be better suited centrally. I wonder how he'd do in midfield. I'd rather him there than Rooney anyway.

4053~~~
Think some people just need to take a step back, chill out, watch this and remember what a special talent with so much potential we have on our hands and that we can't just act so flippant about him leaving just cause of one bad season.

One bad season at 19/20 years old, in his second season of professional football, that hardly played, competing for spots with the likes of Juan Mata, Angel Di Maria, Wayne Rooney etc

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgI56dEUmxo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Cause everyone will be complaining just like they do with Pogba if he slips through the cracks too.

4054~~~
His long terms futures here but he's not won the trust that you can play him week in week out and he'll score or get assists. I know he said he was working on his strength so hopefully that aids his development but sometimes you watch him and he's an intelligent passer. He can slip players through and shoot from range. I don't think he will ever be a great goalscorer but he is creative and hopefully he can be moved in a more offensive central role. His ability to run at players is very good.

4055~~~
If he is loaned out, hopefully it will be a team like Swansea who play good football. Don't think it's a good idea to let him go abroad at the moment. He needs to develop in the Premier league, and a team which plays good football would do him a world of good. Hopefully Januzaj had time to reflect on the season he had and why he was not playing in the first team. He needs to get better with his decision making and work a little bit harder.

4056~~~
Such a brilliant talent.

4057~~~
Sterling is miles better then Januzaj.

4058~~~
Even Swansea's a tricky one. It's only really the bottom five or six clubs that loan in key players. The rest of them tend to loan in players for added numbers. Swansea are pretty stable, with quite a consistent first eleven.

Swansea would basically see it as them doing us a favour as much as we're doing them a favour, whereas you want the club you're loaning to to feel as if you've done them a huge favour by giving them a key player. I don't know. Maybe I'm underestimating how much game time he'd get at a Premier League team.

If he's not going to play consistently, then there's little point in a loan happening.

4059~~~
Uh, that quote's not from Moyes, but "Yannick Ferrera, Anderlecht’s youth coach between 2004 and 2010".

4060~~~
Thought this belongs here also (from the Twitter thread): <a class="externalLink" href="http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/exclusive-20-year-old-to-be-at-man-united-next-season-aims-to-be-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/...d-to-be-at-man-united-next-season-aims-to-be-</a>

<b>Exclusive: 20 year old to be at Man United next season, aims to be 'a legend' at the club</b>

4061~~~
Great news, he has the talent just needs the games and i would also say that when he gets his chance he needs to make the most of his opportunity.

4062~~~
Excellent news. Should hopefully start being groomed for the #10 position next season. I eventually see him as Rooney's successor but he needs to kick on pre season.

4063~~~
Never really understood why people were suggesting Januzaj to come on loan to us this season as we are well stocked in the positions which he would be trying to push for a place in and we look like we want to continue reinforcing it with someone like Deulofeu. It's best for him to stay with United anyway as he doesn't look out of place in terms of quality or talent and despite not getting an abundance of game time he is still in and around the squad and will get around 20 games this season due to the CL. He'll be playing in the cup games anyway i'd imagine.

4064~~~
There was a suggestion (I think from an Andy Mitten column) that Januzaj was being moved more centrally. So likely the attacking midfield role, or potentially up front. 

I closely watched Januzaj twice at the back end of last season, in the u21's against City and when he came on for di Maria vs Hull. And I think he was the best player in both matches. Would really like him to be given his shot. The links to attacking mid's such as Firmino worry me though, because it will limit his chances.

4065~~~
If he was a potential new signing and some on here watched that video there would be a jizz fest

4066~~~
Yeah, i linked to the wrong article. But Moyes did parrot that opinion as well. Just Google it.

4067~~~
Anybody ready for Januzaj the CF? 

More & More space opening up considering how many forwards look like departing. 

Januzaj at LM/RM is a hot prospect waiting to get cold. 

Consider two wingers both cutting in and a CF like Januzaj overlapping in to space from the centre.  Sometimes you really do have to Love van gaal.  What a genius. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3062396/Manchester-United-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...nited-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html</a>

4068~~~
I never understood why they keep placing him on the wings. It doesn't matter if we play with wide forwards, but it does matter a feck load if we play with traditional wingers who are considered midfielders. The distance to goal is huge, and thats where his lack of pace shows.

Give him the ball around the 16, let him beat his opponent and take a shot, give that deadly through ball or let him drive defenders nuts for fouls. He is a pure 10. If you position him somewhere else you simply do not understand where his talent lies.

4069~~~
He's such a beautiful string-puller and passer though, it's always seemed a waste to me to try and push him into any position which prevents him from showcasing the sheer variety of talents he has. He can pass and dribble like a #10, beat a man and cross like a winger, scheme like a #8, finish like a forward. You lose so many of those things if you just play him up front.

That said, if Van Gaal has shown one ability consistently so far this season it's to know where a player needs to play in order to perform. Look at how he's got the best out of Fellaini, Young, Herrera, has managed to get Mata and Valencia performing in what would on paper appear to be imperfect positions for them.

4070~~~
Number 10 is a key position and we have various players who offer something different, and better, than Januzaj does right now. 

He'll learn plenty from wider positions before he earns his starts centrally.

4071~~~
Precisely.  Its not only pace that he lacks but he lacks the ability to shoot from the wide positions.  

His best performances has come when he scored volleys and goals from within the 18 yard box.  Have him centrally and let him drift in to the left or right spaces created by depay etc cutting in.

4072~~~
It might be a important position but its not one for us.  When exactly have we played with a no 10? If we did; mata would definitely not have been put out on the RW. 

Slowly it looks as the strikers that are predominantly left behind are players who play through a combination of a number 10 &  a striker. 

The false 9 position is a bee's nest because of mr. Messi; yet both Rooney & Januxaj( if he plays as a CF)  will have the ability. 

The 352 is a formation of the 433 with a false number 9, while the 352 is the 433 with a false number 6.

4073~~~
Also, can we just acknowledge that no foul was given for 6:00 in that video. That's the kind of shit he's had to deal with for the past two seasons, and because the soundbite parrots got hold of the ideal that he's fragile and goes down easily, referees just consistently ignored it.

Yes, he is somewhat lightweight, but the defender who did something so blatant to Messi or Hazard would be looking down the barrel of a yellow card without a second's thought.

4074~~~
Well that's kind of the point. It's a key position, is Adnan ready to play ahead of all the options we have there let alone force us to play a different formation to accommodate him? 

For me, no. Not yet. Playing wide will teach him a lot. He might be a better 10 than wide player but right now we're more likely to pick up points with him wide than being the key man central to everything. Does that mean he won't get great stats or look amazing? Sure, but it won't affect Van Gaals opinion of him, he knows the score and how to bring him through.

4075~~~
I've never understood the desire to push players like that more centrally.
I dont really know where the lack of pace thing comes from either, hes not that quick but hes isn't at all slow either.
Playing on the wings gives players space and it makes it easier for them to isolate players and beat them, things hes good at. 
They have more time to get the ball out of their feet, less defensive responsibility (your not going to have a pirlo or the like you need to keep pressure on).
I dont see him as a striker really. I thought hes played better on the wing than the odd time i've seen him at #10 too.

I kind of prefer playing 2 cm and a dm in a 3 man midfield personally anyway but whatever, just a matter of taste.

4076~~~
I hate talking about pace because i end up sounding like a kid.

Alot depends on your view of what the wide player does.  Consider the front 2 of the 352 formation.  2 strikers.  Now consider the 433. That could be one striker with 2 wingers,  or 2 forwards with one false 9.

Can januzaj really play on the wing?  He can beat a man but what does he do next?  Does he cross the ball or does he shoot?  He doesnt really have the ability to cut in to space to take a shot on goal,  neither does he have pace to push defenders back.

We dont even play crossing style football all except for the involvement of fellaini.  So januzaj's core strengths are our teams negligence.

4077~~~
This report is from over 2 months ago and is based on nothing

4078~~~
Okay i get you now.  Having watched van gaal pretty closely; ive been waiting around to see the little tweaks he does with players,  the way he approached schweinsteiger & co back in their youth. 

Januzaj might not get alot of games there but lets not forget as things stand we are looking at having a very few strikers upfront. Your viewpoint could be equally associated to van gaals opinion of Mcnair at RB.

4079~~~
I knew it was old; i just bought it up as a possibility on to the reasoning that we are potentially losing 3 strikers in a matter of a month.  Its looking more likely that this may turn out to be true.

4080~~~
Video above says your wrong - you seem him beating players and making enough room to get a shot in repeatedly, you see it most time he plays. 
That dive against arsenal in the fa cup for instance. He took it after beating 1 or 2 players.
Ok he doesn't leave defenders for dead like di maria (or not all of them) but he still goes past them. 
Crossing is always going to be a part of football. Not having your cb's playing 40 yard passes to the big guy over and over is one thing. Not crossing is another thing entirely.

The thing with playing a 10 like januzaj or mata is it leaves less room for your wingers to cut inside, or for your striker to drop back into. 
Its not a role im fond of tbh. I think it drags your wingers back down the pitch and forces them to do a fair bit of defending. 
Regardless hes probably our 4th or 5th best #10 so its kind of irrelevant. 

I dont think the 3-5-2 is that relevant either or likely to make a return.

4081~~~
Well you'd think if we had plans to turn him into a striker he would have played games for the under 21s as a striker but he didnt he played on the wings

4082~~~
For me januzaj doesnt dribble at the defender when cutting in.  He is a fantastic dribbler who dribbles in to space. Now consider memphis & robben,  both attack the defender at an angle to open up space for the rest of the team.  Januzaj doesn't make space for the rest of the team; infact neither does Di maria since you did mention him.  Thats why Mata was used at RW rather than Di maria because matas mindset moves him centrally; creating space for midfielders and fullbacks. 

Just on the video,  there is pleanty of times where you can see how successful he potentially could be centrally and reminds me of Kaka the way he is more involved with the game and team movements throught the centre.

4083~~~
Thats true but considering all reports on him moving in centrally came on april 30th and that januzaj is training with the first team squad and only utilised as such for the reserves gives some sort of leeway. 

Furthermore that would mean dropping Wilson and completely undermining RVP,  Falcao and our first team strikers.

4084~~~
Why do we want him to learn a position which he will not play at? Its no use to create another jack of all trades. Let him master the right position for him. If thats not possible at Man Utd at the time then loan him out.

Or start giving him minutes there when we are up and safe.

4085~~~
I haven't seen much evidence he has the finishing ability to be a #9, false or otherwise.

4086~~~
I don't see Januzaj as a striker at all, but I don't really see him as a winger either. 

He'll be a #10 long term imo.

4087~~~
Yeah he's clearly a number 10 whether playing right in the middle or a playmaker out wide who cuts inside. He's neither an out and out winger like he's sometimes played and instructed to play, nor a striker.

4088~~~
We dont play with a number 10, our number ten is the striker who brings in the wide forwards in to play.

4089~~~
Rooney is a striker. Him wearing the number 10 shirt doesn't have any meaning when he plays there. 

We have enough positions from which one can perform the duties of a number 10 to a fair extent - that of Mata, Fellaini, from last season, in particular.

4090~~~
Needs a solid pre season to avoid be loaned out. Hope he kicks on when given the opportunity.

4091~~~
The initial reports were based on a reporters own opinions not anything from the club and were backed up by statements that Moyes made about how he could play there. Even in games for the u21s where neither Wilson or Fletcher were on the pitch and we had no striker on the pitch he still wasn't used as a striker. Hes missing a lot of the attributes Van Gaal looks for in a striker so it would be pretty strange if he does try and turn him into one

4092~~~
I think in this system we currently play he can only play on the wing which will mean he'll struggle to get game time with Di Maria, Depay, Young and Mata all ahead in the pecking order. 

Either we need to start playing with a Real nr 10 in which cases he'll be able to get games or he needs a loan.

4093~~~
I'd loan him. See if he can start producing consistently.

4094~~~
He can also play as the furthest in the midfield three as he did against Hull in our last game this past season. I think it suits him well.

4095~~~
The only reason I'd loan him out would be to see him get a chance playing in the hole rather than a winger. Just don't think the wings are for Adnan. Somewhere in the attacking mid/false nine (all of that central attacking region) is where he belongs.

4096~~~
Think this is a massive season if he is to stay here long term. Has to breakthrough further. 

Could see him being sold if he has another season like this one.

4097~~~
He might improve upon this season and I still do rate him. But I dont think he's a LVG player. He needs to play in a team which play with a lot of space for the attackers and where he will get the freedom to play his play. For now he's too wasteful to play the possession based LVG play, and because teams sit back vs us, he cant really get the space to roam. So I'm quite worried for him. With the likes of Depay, Mata, ADM, Young ahead of him, his playing time is limited. He should go for a loan. 2 non-existent seasons and even our highest rated talent could be sold.

4098~~~
I don't Think that he's wasteful by nature. Last season he was often thrown in at the most dire of situations where we had to make things happen. In games where he started or played for larger parts of the game he did much better. I Think he's one of the few players who can create space for himself and for his teammates when we face a sitting defence. Wether it being beating a opponent to upset the other teams defensive formation or by finding a clever through pass. I Think he will be alot better for us in those kind of games than for example Mata and Young who more often plays it too safely and predictably. I'd play him in most games against the smaller teams and let the likes of Mata and Young maybe take his place in the bigger games where you to play with more discipline and where space opens up naturally as the opponent also seeks to attack.

4099~~~
Fair enough, but I doubt those dire situations will completely fade away next season. And I think he will get even less starts.

4100~~~
And I think you might be right, unfortunately.

4101~~~
I hate this "too wasteful" tag at the best of times, but in Januzaj's case it's just ridiculous. Yes, he is wasteful - but "too wasteful"..? From my memory, the only times he played last year was when we were creating absolutely feck all and he was brought on to try and make a difference. I'm terrible with remembering specific performances in specific games but I remember Januzaj's performance against West Brom away where we were dreadful and he was the only one creating chances. I think in the end we drew thanks to a good goal from Blind, but aside from that nobody looked like doing anything - other than Adnan.

How many times did we complain about dominating possession yet we still lacked an incisive edge? How many times did we say that Mata was fantastic when we're on top, but when the going gets tough he fades away? 

Players like him and Di Maria are key to attacks. Yes they're not as "safe" as Young or Mata but you need these kind of players to offer variance and keep defenders alert. I don't think he'll get that many chances this season with Depay arriving, and I do think he should be loaned out  but I don't think holding a desire to create chances even when the team aren't performing is something that should be used against him.

4102~~~
It isnt that I have that against him, I doubt you could be arsed but I have defended him for that in this thread numerous times. But LVG has that against him, just look ADM who didnt get a look in once he started to lose the ball very often.

4103~~~
Not having a go at you specifically, I just find that "too wasteful" tag frustrating. And you're right, it might be too much for LVG but I'd much rather players expressing themselves and taking chances rather than strangling games with aimless possession (not that I think that's LVG's plan either)

4104~~~
Well I actually think having possession is his 2nd target for every match (after obviously winning the match). His press conference after Chelsea away confirmed that, we didnt create that much bar Falcao's chance but he thought it was our best game of the season. LvG wants possession and he wants to keep possession until the opponent cant really defend that tight anymore so that they get holes and openings in their set up. This is his aim I think, and that is something that's done collectively. I dont think he has eye for the individual that much, unless you are a top top player, he prefers you to play according to his philosophy.

4105~~~
We need to stop mucking about and utilize him in the best way to get the most out of him. We're going to regret this if we stick at it, talents like him tend to bite the club that misused him in the ass when they move on. He's a really big talent, as big as we've produced in recent years and I include Pogba in that. Play him as the furthest forward midfielder in a midfield 3 and we'll be on to something. Try turning him into giggs or some van persie like striker then we're barking up the wrong tree. Players like him save the club fortunes. We simply can't afford to make mistakes like this.

4106~~~
The only player van gaal allows to play in to space is the middle man.  Since guardiolas introduction of a false 9, this has made the need for a number 10 all the more worthless. 

Everybody else including the wide players are instructed as such to bring other players in to the game.  Thats why januzaj cant play on the wide for me because he very rarely takes a player on diagonally the way memphis or robben does.

4107~~~
Actually LvG doesn't like Guardiola's false 9 stuff, when he looked at the Barca team in one of his presentations he said that the line-up was perfect for him bar Messi as he preferred a proper #9. Taking that into account Januzaj would operate in the Iniesta role with Herrera and Schneiderlin/Carrick making up the midfield 3 with him, and Memphis-Rooney-Di Maria as the front 3.

4108~~~
Though I doubt he was the front runner in the false 9 position; he would be a fool to not see that it was an alteration on his very own style of play.  

Just this season he talked about mata and him being deployed as a false winger; to me that shows that through the stubborness of his ways,  he is still willing to adapt. 

I mean historically the biggest difference between someone like van gaal &  cryuff was their ability or lack off to adapt total football as a practised theory. 

Afterall,  these false positions does not have to be important to the team rather than importance to the player.  Messi on the shoulder of 6ft defenders would not work aswell as for when he creates space for himself from tracking back.  Likewise,  only when januzaj is deployed will he ever have to play that position until he gets good enough to make that position his own.

4109~~~
Except that he hasn't really shown an aptitude for improvement from the short run of games when he played very well under Moyes. Unless Van Gaal is planning on using him more this year, which is unlikely given that we have Di Maria and Depay, he really does need to go on a loan somewhere.

4110~~~
The man who turned schweinsteiger from an average winger to a legendary midfielder.  These changes will happen on occasion therough out his time here &  he hardly will get it wrong!

4111~~~
LvG has been fairly rigid in his views regarding the #9 and the role of the position within how he likes the team to play. Nothing we have seen from Januzaj suggests he'd even consider him for a striker role in his system, he has not shown any goal threat or great finishing instincts for starters, and LvG still requires that from a #9.

He accepted Mata's role last season as he didn't really have the players he needed for his preferred way of playing. Had Di Maria not fallen apart so completely I imagine he'd have been first choice on the right.

LvG only has two years left on his contract and I'd be very surprised if he has any plans to try and mess about with an unknown quantity like Januzaj in a role he's never played, he simply doesn't have the luxury of time to test this out. I think Januzaj played pretty well on the left of the diamond when he got the chance last season, if LvG gives him some games as an AM in the midfield 3 I think that would be his best chance of progressing this coming season.

4112~~~
if he's good enough a dribbler, space will me made for his teammates by attracting the defenders to him only

4113~~~
Yeah good dribblers irrespective of pace naturally open up space for others by pulling everyone towards them and taking them out of place. Di Maria has done this excellently over a number of years. And januzaj proved in 2013/14 that he is too. Both players didn't have their best season's last year so naturally its skewing people's take on them.

4114~~~
You could be right,  but for me the best performances of di maria was when he would overlap from the centre whenever one of ronaldo or bale dribbled towards the goal. That's dribbling in to space and that kind of player is better to be utilised in the centre while wider players make incisions inwards. 

His most succesful season came through the middle behind 3 forwards out of which whom 2 wingers would cut in,  di maria would then overlap ensuing that Madrid never lost their attacking shape. 

Di maria is a much better central player than he is as a winger; especially considering that our wingers are actually forwards too.

4115~~~
so who should be on the opposite flank of memphis?

4116~~~
I don't disagree that Di Maria's best season came as the left sided attacking tip of a central midfield trio, where he hurt teams both in central runs from deep positions right at the heart of teams, and drifted out wide to cross like a left winger would. It was a fantastic role he performed and I don't think anyone can claim to have seen him play footballer. It brought out the very best in him, and not just in an attacking sense, because his pressing abilities also were better utilized than ever before.

So yeah, I argue with none of that. Although it has to be remembered that even as a winger he has had a lot of success. Absolutely tormented Alves for example, something he did better than even Ronaldo at times because of his tricky dribbling and non stop running.

But having said all of that, I don't agree with the premise that Di Maria, and Januzaj, two very naturally gifted dribblers, require space. In a sense, every player loves space to work with. But generally, the better dribbler you are, the less reliant you are on space and more liable you are to drag defenders everywhere. And Di Maria in particular at Madrid has shown to be an excellent dribbler and a lot of the time in central areas, creating space for others like Ronaldo and Benzema. If you're less gifted as a dribbler (like Lennon) you require even more space to work with.

4117~~~
Having said that, of course pace is another way to create space and stretch the game.

Di Maria is someone who has both of course, so hopefully we see plenty of that next season.

4118~~~
Really like Januzaj and I think people forget just how good he was in his first season. For one reason or another he may not have getting enough game time but he is a special talent and one who we need to put time and effort into this year. 
Could be a brilliant player for us in years to come but he has to be in the side. Got great dribbling and passing and can score goals as well, would be a crying shame to see him fall by the wayside.

4119~~~
I dont think we should loan him out, they just make the players drift further away from the team, he should stay and fight.

4120~~~
How he progresses is entirely up to him. In reakity his first season was very like last season in that he had moments of brilliance interspersed with long periods of anonymity - it's just that the brilliance shone more in the general horror of 2013-14. What he needs more than anything else at the moment is to bulk up and work on his speed - he is remarkably slow for a player with a reputation for being fast. A faster, more physically solid Januzaj might be able to get more consistently involved in games and, unless he does, I don't see him having a future at the highest level.

4121~~~
Not true. He was just better that season. He still had bad performances that season, but he had a lot more great performances in 2013-14 than last year. Even if the players around him had a better season than their actual seasons, Januzaj would have still shown brilliantly. 

Januzaj doesn't need more speed unless United want him to be a pacey winger, which is just not the kind of player he is.

4122~~~
Speed matters in every position. It's a key discriminator when you're comparing ostensibly similar players.

4123~~~
Yes but he's quick as it is, so it's not that big of a deal. He just needs to perform a lot better and show more confidence then he did last season

4124~~~
Exactly.  I dont see how someone can say that januzaj doesnt havr a future at the top of the game when there are pleanty of quality sides who deploy 'slower'  wingers like chelsea for example. Hazard and willian arnt slow but they hardly rely on pace alone to beat their man. 

What we have to do &  van gaal in particular is to find the best way to utilise januzaj in to a system that suits us &  him both. He is young enough to adapt willingly to his own advantage.

4125~~~
Hazard and Willian are both rapid, but the key for Hazard is his explosiveness off the mark, this is where Januzaj is lacking, once he gets going he's pretty fast but his off the mark pace is not up to scratch at the moment.

4126~~~
Don't think you'll see his explosive pace change much at the age of 20, can be coached to a certain extent but you can't just make someone into an explosively fast runner without the right genetics.

He is pacey but not like Di Maria for example who just seems to fly past people with ease.

4127~~~
That's true, I just recall Adnan saying that he was working on it last season. If he plays central it will be less important, but as a winger that pace off the mark is a vital attribute.

4128~~~
Agreed. He's got bags of potential. We just need to be patient with him. No idea why people are so quick to write him off. He's just a kid

4129~~~
feck it... The lads are back training, the summer holidays are over for them the new season starts now. May I have the lurvly priviledge of starting a 15/16 thread for Januzaj considering Ive been deemed the official fanboi on this message board?

4130~~~
wait till the tour

4131~~~
A player like Januzaj doesn't need pace to be effective at the highest level. We should stop with this winger experiment, play him correctly and stop worrying about how fast he is.

4132~~~
Experiment? Has he either played as a number 10?

4133~~~
Yep.

4134~~~
bingo

4135~~~
Maybe this is a very "glass half full" way of looking at things. I feel like now that the media spotlight is not on him, the demands and expectations are lowered, Adnan will really flourish and start to fulfilling his potential. During the first season he gave us every reason to believe that he has the capability, all but potential, to reach the very top with us. In Luis Van Gaal and manchester united he has the perfect setup to make it to the top. Some times, it takes a few step backwards to really spring forward. Here is to hoping this season Adnan will be making positive strides.
