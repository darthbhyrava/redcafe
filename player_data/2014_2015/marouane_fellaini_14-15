Disappointed at the reception he received from some of our fans tonight. Fair enough if he reminds fans of the Moyes era, but it doesn't take much to support the players on the field. He put in a good performance against Valencia. Will that performance be enough for LvG to utilise him this season? I still think he can do a good job in midfield for us.

2~~~
As I said maybe LVG can make sthing out of him. 
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

Good performance rewarded with a goal.

3~~~
If Van Gaal keeps him, hopefully he has a stormer of a season. Rather him than Anderson or Cleverley. 

The fans can feck off too. Utter cretins

4~~~
28 goals and 13 assists for us next season confirmed (only if we boo him every game though)

5~~~
Had a lively 15 minutes I think. Put in some good tackles and put in a good physical performance and didn't look as slow as he did. If the best offers we are getting are loan deals for 50% of his wages then we should be keeping him. Gets a lot of stick but he is a decent player.

6~~~
If he is still with us, he has to be a lot more strong willed than he has shown in the past. Cameo performances like tonight helps but his personality currently (based on Moyes comments) doesn't fit well at Old Trafford which can be unforgiving place.

7~~~
He deserves another chance, last season could just be horrible mismanagement from Moyes (like with nearly every other player) so it'll be interesting to see how he'll do under great manager like Van Gaal.

8~~~
Can someone post a gif!

9~~~
You throw him on when Shinji and Mata can't break down a team where 11 men are sat behind the ball. He'll cause havoc in the box for you. If I had one sub to use in the 99 CL final 90th min and it was between all our No. 10s, Fellaini would get chosen every time and i'd lump the ball up toward him for fun.

10~~~
As I've said in the previous thread he's a far better player than he's given credit for on the cafe. Is he a world class elite CM? No. But he's better than Cleverley, at least as good as a post injury Fletcher and maybe even as good or better than an aging injury prone Carrick.

11~~~
So he's not very good then?

12~~~
Not his biggest fan but he did well when he came on and showed if you get the right service into him he will score goals, was much better than Cleverley tonight and his all round game was better than it ever was last season.

13~~~
He can give more than Cleverley or Anderson, but he will pay for being a Moyes' man

14~~~
He has to be stimulated in that way <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

15~~~
Louie may know how to play him and I wouldn't be surprised because everyone looks better under the new management.

So little time but the Belgian lad delivered in new system... it raise even more questions.

16~~~
By whom? Van Gaal? Not really, and he's the one that counts.

17~~~
Hope he's sold. 

Does not suit the system currently, does not offer much to the team either. We already have two wishy washy midfielders in Cleverley and Fletcher.

18~~~
His hair seems to have returned.

19~~~
Really felt for him. Delighted he scored.

20~~~
Maybe not but it's still highly likely he's our 2nd best CM when fit. And given that we don't know how Herrera will adapt to the PL he could make a run at being our best. Sure it might be damning him with faint praise but I'm not going to just discard him like many fan seem to want, not unless I'm replacing him with Vidal or someone of that ilke.

21~~~
We paid too much for him, but some people act as if you need a squad full of world class players. I don't think he's the problem. I think the problem is we've not added enough quality to the midfield (in addition to Fellaini) for a long time (Herrera aside). Crazy as it is, but we're too loyal. We stopped looking to improve but you had people judging him when he was injured. Idiots. I think he got lucky with the goal but maybe the ref gave him a break. We've got more important shit to do then moan about Fellaini.

22~~~
I mean, there's a huge gap between Fellaini and Vidal. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

Its like Blackett and Varane. 

He was fine today, a bit slow moving the ball but he found a teammate. The goal was just terrible defending

23~~~
I'd like to see Van Gaal give him a chance. Nobody should be written off after just one season, especially when that one season was coached by a manager who didn't really have an idea where to begin. If Fellaini can follow instruction and keep it simple, then I think he can be useful. He's got a great touch in tight areas, and the physical presence to retain the ball when pressured, which we are generally shit at. His passing is decent, though not brilliant, but probably better than Cleverley's.

If we don't sign Vidal, or a good quality DM, then perhaps Herrera and Fellaini could be a decent pairing, so long as Fellaini keeps his head screwed on, and doesn't go bombing down the wings like he often did last season.

24~~~
If he plays like that every time he comes off the bench we're in for a treat, was very, very good tonight despite the crowd <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

25~~~
Fair play, he played well and got into the position to score.

I thought he got rid of his afro tho?...

26~~~
Amigos, no one is going to pick up his 120/week wage and he's not going to agree to a massive haircut -- at least now a haircut of the monetary kind.

Get used to seeing Fellaini brought on late in matches when we need a goal.  You stick him on the pk spot and he can do some damage.

27~~~
True, I didn't mean to imply otherwise. I just meant that I'm not going to throw away our 2nd best CM, as many fans seem to want, unless we replace him with an elite CM.

28~~~
If he stays, Van Gaal might make him our Hernandez...I.e, impact/super sub

29~~~
But an elite CM ala Vidal or whoever isnt needed to fit into our play better than Fellaini. Someone like Blind has better close control and passing range and would do the job at a Carrick level. He wouldn't set the world alight but he'd make a difference and set the stage for our talented players better than Fellaini does.

In fact that type of player would fit in better than Vidal would

30~~~
To me replacing Fellaini with a player of Blind's level is a pointless move so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.

31~~~
fecking get in Maruane. Still don't like him as a player but if he brings the goods like he did today than fair play. Either it will help us in our success or he'll get a better price going to another team.

32~~~
Poor guy needs to have his name pronounced properly

Jim Rozenthal - "Maru Fellaini"
LVG               - "Fellaani"

33~~~
He's just a tall Cleverley/Fletcher. He's probably on more money too. Unfortunately for him he's also Moyes' man.

34~~~
I can hear the full engines reverse from the nutters who were trying to convince everyone he was barely a footballer. Absolutely appalling reception and I am glad he had the last laugh. Hopefully that will garner him a bit of credit with the fans if he stays on. He is definitely not as bad as some people are desperate for him to be.

35~~~
best cameo ever! Valencia were all over us until he came on and he bought a bit of presence back to midfield with a couple of decent tackles and passing was not too bad either

was brilliant that he got the goal given the ironic cheers from the crowd - will probably just perpetuate the myth that he is only useful as a targetman though - the reality is he came on in midfield and did well, albeit only for 15 mins.

36~~~
Thought he played well today.  Won the ball back a few times, his passing and touch was decent and the goal was a nice bonus.

If we sign another midfielder I think he is most likely to leave.

37~~~
Its clearly not pointless if it makes the team play better.

A football match isnt won by someone listing all the players and determining what "level" they are. Its won by a team playing better than the opposition team and scoring more goals to show for it. Blind and other players who pass the ball around quickly help you achieve that.

38~~~
£120k? Oh I thought it was £230k a week, strange.

39~~~
When everyone is fit he's at the very best our 4th best midfielder but it's a close run thing between him and Cleverley. Cleverley played a large portion of a title winning season in a midfield two alongside Carrick. If
We're going to harp on about what Fellaini achieved at Everton, then let's not forget what Cleverley achieved here.

40~~~
missed the match, did he play well other than scoring? where did he play for us tonight? CM?

41~~~
He gave the ball away with his first touch and then after that he did well. Had a good cameo.

42~~~
I can't believe people are claiming he has the passing range of Fletch and Clev!?!? I'm all for keeping him, but I will be incredibly surprised if he gets picked ahead of Fletch/Clev to partner Herrera.

43~~~
interesting, you reckon he will get a chance with us under LVG?

44~~~
Did okay, absolutely nothing special. Some appear to get a bit carried away with his better performances as his typical showing has been so poor for us.

45~~~
and some wont give any credit regardless of how well he plays <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

46~~~
He did okay, I said that. He was hardly great.

47~~~
still, encouraging that he wasn't as crap as he has been then! if LVG can get him & Young performing he is truly a god lol

48~~~
Fellaini can do a job, the same way Cleverley can.

I'm of the opinion he has the wrong skill set to become anything more than a squad player here.

49~~~
well, if we end up not signing a CM he's not the worst player to have, rotation of him & Clev when Fletch/Herrera aren't both available is passable if he is on better form

50~~~
Well 44% of people on here so far have voted him MOTM and he received the highest rating of any of our players tonight - it was only 15mins but okay is an understatement to say the least.

51~~~
Like I said, again, people are overestimating his performance tonight due to the fact a typical Fellaini appearance has been horrific. Also many felt sympathetic because of his unfair treatment from some of the fans in Old Trafford, did you read the match thread? A lot of posters gave him a ten! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

52~~~
I'd agree with passable, definitely. But that depresses me a little.

53~~~
'Did okay, nothing special'. Crack up.

54~~~
So much grudging praise through gritted teeth!

55~~~
Its fecking amazing that the OT crowd would make ironic cheers/boos (with every possession of the ball) at our own players! 

How deeply fecking embarrassing. I felt for him despite what I think of him as a player.

56~~~
He did nothing but take advantage of a GK error. He didn't lose the ball. Hooray! Nothing special. Blackett was MOTM

57~~~
Overzealous  as the fans who booed him. That's just ridic

58~~~
Booing and ironic cheers were disgraceful.

59~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/EnragedDefensiveDugong.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/EnragedDefensiveDugong.gif"/>

60~~~
He's a beast this guy. Hoping Van Gaal can help him a little bit positionally.

61~~~
There's spoiled idiots who support us. See this forum for proof.

62~~~
I didn't watch the game but it is IMPOSSIBLE to judge how well he actually played without watching it for yourself. The people who despise him will underrate his performance and others are probably too sympathetic because of the crowd response to him. Anyway, I hope he stays. I'm not surprised he was decent in the cameo. He isn't that bad a player. Certainly better than Anderson and Cleverley. Probably better than Fletcher at this point too.

63~~~
Any idiot would've scored that goal. It was a gift. He was hardly a beast last season. Im very skeptical.

64~~~
Nice to see Adnan get to him quickly too. They've become quite good friends it seems.

65~~~
Not sure when it became the done thing to boo/jeer one of our own. I certainly don't want any part of that as a United fan.

First rule I learned when attending matches was we never boo our own. I've seen a couple of people learn that lesson the hard way in the ground with a smack in the face.

66~~~
Anybody noticed Rooney slapping his head in the celebration? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

67~~~
To be honest I have no idea. I get the feeling that LVG is pretty fair and gives players a chance but then also doesnt mess around and will be up front with the players if they dont make the grade.

68~~~
I'm in the camp that is willing to give him one more year. He was horrible last year yes, but then again so was almost everyone else apart from DDG and Adnan. He will never be the new Paul Scholes, but if he shows what he did at Everton I think he could be a serviceable squad player. He will never live up to his price tag though, but I think most everyone knew that at the moment of his purchase. He had a good cameo yesterday and showed what he is capable of.

69~~~
Honestly he didn't impressed me that much. His passing was poor. He came at a time when everyone was getting tired so he could find space and the goal was one piece of luck.

I dont agree that he gets booed. That would act as fire power for interested clubs to lower their bid

70~~~
acting violently is stupid.

71~~~
He did well when he came on and won the game with a trademark chest control. I was against us ever signing him but he's here now. I hope he can improve and become a good squad player for us. I didn't like the jeers from the crowd it was so cringe. Probably the same idiots who were wearing Fellaini wigs last season singing come on David Moyes.

72~~~
He had all time in the world to score. FFS the defender knocked the goalkeeper out. 

He's probably squad player standard however

a) we've got too many of those in CM
b) no one keeps a 27m rated midfielder (with probably a huge salary) as a reserve

73~~~
Herera was fantastic today but I think all of our midfielders are benefiting from the safety net of three CBs. There's much more mobility and they are able to contribute more to the attacks.

Would love to be seeing Fellaini coming on and wreaking some havoc when the tika takas fail to break teams down. He offers a potent weapon and should not be sold IMO.

74~~~
Chuffed for him, well deserved goal.
It's nor fair he gets so much critisizm just because he's an icon of David fecking Moyes era.

People would be more comprehensible if Moyes paid 15m for him - well, he didn't, not his fault we got a clueless manager back then.
Then he was injured for quite a bit and our whole team was struggling, so it was very hard for Fellaini to get into it.
Basically everyone (bar DDG & Januzaj) underperformed, but somehow it was Fellaini who became our new scapegoat.

He's not a bad player and would do some decent job for many Premier League teams.
I still think he's not RIGHT player for us, as he offer many different qualities, but maybe Van Gaal can squeeze something out of him.

75~~~
Not convinced hes what we really need, but he is nowhere near as bad a player as some make him out to be, and he did alright when he came on last night. More bite than Cleverley for one.

He also didnt choose the pricetag.

I'd rather see him as a squad player this season, because we are likely to get a packet of crisps and an empty packet of Toffos for him after last season anyway, nothing to lose by giving him a go.

76~~~
there is a fine line between criticizing  a player/ team/ manger and supporting them during the game.
These two should never be mixed.

77~~~
Much as I am not a fan, he came on and spread the ball around nicely and got himself a goal. Can't ask for much more.

78~~~
I'd say the lines are pretty obvious. The key rule is don't go to the match and take the p*ss out of a player from your team.

79~~~
I think he fouled the defender just before he scored. Sneaky nudge in the back.

Good performance though. Loved the block tackle he won when a Valencia player steamed into the challenge on the deck. Interesting that Van Gaal obviously sees him as proper CM.

80~~~
Shut up spoiled idiot!

81~~~
The ironic cheers every time he touched the ball were fuc*ing embarrassing. I'm sure it started with only a handful of dickheads, but then the rest of the sheep joined in.

Anyway, glad he scored. I can't see how he fits into Van Gaal's way of playing, though.

82~~~
I would rather keep Felliani than Cleverley.

83~~~
Well yesterday kind of answered this for you.. He fits perfectly when you are trying to score the winning goal.
I thought he did very well yesterday we won back the midfield area and he added steel and presence, the winning goal was very cleverly done. As always perfect with his chest control! Not saying he will be a starter for us but selling him now for half of what we bought him for is plainly bad business!

84~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if LVG gets some half decent performances out of Fellaini if he stays with us.

He'll always be a lump but if the coaches can hone some of his other attributes then why not?

85~~~
It's a little difficult to work out exactly what happened but I <i>think</i> it's slightly less depressing than it first seemed. My take on it is that the handful of dickheads were actually booing him, not cheering him. The cheering started in an attempt to drown them out and caught on, in a generally good-humoured kind of way. It definitely got louder and louder the better he played. If everyone cheering was doing it to slag him off you'd think it would die down as he started to boss the game. Instead, the opposite happened.

Re Van Gaal's role for him, I reckon we saw it last night. One of two deep-lying midfielders. The same role Martinez was using him at the beginning of his final season with Everton. Didn't look to have the chops for it in a United shirt last season but it's a position he's apparently done well in before, so it's possible that the heavy touches and general cluelessness we saw last season were the temporary effects of a player in really poor form, struggling with the pressure of being the poster boy for a dead duck manager.

Either that or he's just a bit shit. Can't rule that out...

86~~~
I watched it on a shitty steam so the sound wasn't the best, but all I heard was the ironic cheering. Perhaps these started off as boos but I can't tell.

87~~~
Like I said, it's almost impossible to work out exactly what happened. Probably a mixed bag too. Some booing, some cheering to drown out boos, some cheering ironically, others trying to support him. I think it ended up as one of those things that can happen at a game, where a silly bit of "banter" takes on a life of it's own and everyone starts joining in, often for very different reasons.

88~~~
I wasn't debating that was just stating facts. That's what he's always been good at to my eye. Making himself a problem to deal with when you launch a ball up top. 
I agree with what you are saying but what are you going to do? I was saying these exact things before we signed him. If we can find someone to take him off our hands great but the reality is in desperation we have splashed 27 million and given a large contract to a squad player. It's going to be very difficult to find a club willing to pay a reasonable amount for him and offer him wages anywhere near the level he's on at the moment. Why is he going to want to move?

89~~~
I think he's actually alright and got a bit to offer going forward. It's just when we don't have the ball he looks so clueless. He has no idea where to be or what to do.

Most of the time it actually looks like he chases down players, with no intention to actually getting to them, just so he looks like he is doing something. I really hope LvG and his coaches and teach him some defensive fundamentals.

90~~~
I am skeptical too...no I am not. I gave up on him already. That doenst change the fact he took his chance well enough.

91~~~
He's played more time at a proper (or deeper) CM than in any other position. I don't agree with anyone saying he should be dishing off and rushing into the box if he plays in midfield but he can certainly play a deeper role, contrary to what people will try to convince you of.

92~~~
Classy. I won't apologize for not accepting rubbish. I've been watching United my entire life. Im hardly spoiled.

93~~~
I was being sarcastic.

94~~~
I don't think I've ever wanted him to stay more than now.

Go Fella !

95~~~
It hardly came off as sarcastic to be honest <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

96~~~
That fist pump after he scored. He released a few demons with that one! Well done Marouane. He has skeptics and rightly so after last season. When we signed him i thought he was the enforcer we needed. Obviously, it did not turn out that way. All he can do is keep trying to prove the doubters wrong by playing well week in and out. Fletcher will probably be ahead of him but LvG can get the best out of him i feel.

97~~~
Delighted for the guy. 

I was at the game and personally didnt hear any boos, but maybe the mics picked up a small pocket of fans.

Yes the ironic cheers were silly really, but I felt people did it in a lighthearted way. They started after he did something well, a hard tackle or an interception of some sort. After that everybody just carried it on with some of his neat passing and it spiralled from there. I personally don't think it was too take the piss, but purely in good jest that he's showing he can actually play.

The crowning glory was the goal. The stretty exploded, and chants of "oh Marouane Fellaini" went on for the next few minutes. 

As he walked off the pitch he got an excellent reception, he looked so happy. 

It's obviously too late in some fans eyes, but if he keeps those type of performances up when it counts, he will earn himself a spot in the squad.

98~~~
During this entire summer you'd swear he was a championship standard midfielder on here and Cleverly was streets above him. Funny what opinions fly about when there's no football being played.

99~~~
I will admit to being one of his few supporters from last season, as I spent the whole season seeing some ridiculous OTT statements about him, even when he managed to do some things right. Yes his price tag was at least £4 million over on top of less than what we needed to spend, but he is a type of player that we don't have elsewhere: a threat in the box. He's not a player I want starting for us every game of the season, but when we are struggling against the physical teams that are shutting up shop and our plan A/B isn't working, then bringing on a 6ft 3in Fellaini can shake things up with his height. I'm talking about a 15 minute cameo like yesterday where we can add a bit of height in the box. If he can cut out his elbow actions, which pretty much ruin any attack if caught, and puts as much energy into his games as he did into yesterday's, then he can be a useful asset for us. Not the future of our midfield, but a useful squad player at least.

100~~~
The worst thing about him copping the boos is that he is actually a decent guy away from the pitch (from what I have read). He's usually very nice to fans and so it's a shame that he copped it because there would be far worse people that are in the United squad.

101~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GVlvw0KHiU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

102~~~
Marouane has got incredible potential as a specialist target man when we're desperate for an equalizer for a match-winner.  And there will be times when we'll be desperate.

Still, if he can find a club who will take him all the better for all parties.

103~~~
By playing how he played yesterday. As strang as it might sound, the tempo of our game quickened when Fellaini come on.

104~~~
Your posts in his threads seem to be the same 'he's good at one thing and one thing only.. Can we sell?? I hope so it will be good.' I find that a bit strange..

105~~~
I was in the pro-Fellaini camp last year when we signed him. Obviously he has a poor season (who didnt?) but look at the circumstances;

1) last minute signing. Season had already begun and if memory serves he was carrying an injury. Remember Berbatov? He also struggled to fit straight in having been bought in similar circumstances. He has had a limited preseason due to the World Cup, but enough to make a difference.

2) rumour was that Fellaini was carrying an injury for a fair bit of last season (wrist, I think?)

3) again, the entire team had a collective 'mare last season


Fellaini may still be sold and he still has a lot to prove, but those writing him off after last season are likely the same people writing the entire squad off before the season has even begun.

He showed what he is capable of against Valencia. Only 20 odd minutes but he was our best player and changed the game when he came on (and won it for us). Playing in a new system, with a good player like Herrera next to him, I reckon he could well come good this year.

If you think the above is so outlandish I invite you to consider Ashley Young - most of us (myself included) wanted him straight out the door this summer. LVG found a role for him in the new system however, and he has looked like a different player.

106~~~
it is not even a rumour, it is a fact!

107~~~

108~~~
Good on him. I'd love him to fight and stay. If he can turn it around it would be brilliant.

109~~~
Of course I'd like him to prove me and many others wrong, but I just don't see it.

110~~~
If he can prove to be a squad player with a effective role, I don't have a problem with keeping him. I'd like to see him get another chance. It's not his fault that Moyes was so clueless as to think he'd suit the team.

111~~~
Past evidence shows that the chances of him turning it around are minimal.
I wouldnt ever boo the guy while he is wearing a MUFC shirt but we really should be selling him.

I'd much rather someone from the youth squad play and develop in his position.

112~~~
I wasn't even overly impressed with him at the World Cup, and I was looking forward to see how he'd perform.

113~~~
What is the past evidence?

On the bolded part; I would apply that statement to Cleverley.

114~~~
Id take Clev over Fellaini anyday.
Fellaini would probably do ok at Stoke or West Ham.

PS: The past evidence is whenever I saw him play for Everton, never once did he strike me as a Manchester United player.

115~~~
<span style="font-size: 18px"><b>Napoli-Manchester United, first official contact for Fellaini</b></span>

Benitez considers Marouane Fellaini the right player to reinforce the midfield. Van Gaal ponders, yesterday there was the first official contact between the clubs. Manchester United reflect, they will communicate to Napoli within 48 hours if and how Fellaini could possibly leave Red Devils. A small opening, Benitez is waiting. Napoli pursue Fellaini.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://gianlucadimarzio.com/en/calciomercato/napoli-manchester-united-first-official-contact-for-fellaini/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gianlucadimarzio.com/en/calc...r-united-first-official-contact-for-fellaini/</a>

116~~~
I'd like him to stay, he deserves a second chance.

117~~~
I'd like him to go.

118~~~
He's not good enough, a 2nd chance will not change anything. He can't run or pass, he excels when he's a target man. One of the most inappropriate and worst signings we have ever made.

119~~~
Last season was bad for everyone, he did a good job for everton, plenty of people here were happy he signed for us.

God knows i've made my share of jokes on Fellaini, but he fully deserves a second chance.

120~~~
I don't understand what you expect from him with a 2nd chance. He hasn't got the quality required.

121~~~
He does everything better than Cleverley except perhaps run and long-range passing. He offers more than Cleverley and I'd rather see him go first before Fellaini. At least Fellaini can change a game by coming off the bench.

EDIT: by "run" I mean speed over short distances. He is probably better at covering distance than Tom too.

122~~~
He had a good 20 minute cameo in a friendly and was pretty much gifted a goal by a defensive mistake, fair play to him he did well but it’s jumping the gun a bit to start getting carried away with his performance, just as it is to start saying how good Young looks as a wing back. Hopefully you are right but going on their past form and abilities (not just from last season) Young and Fellaini are both likely to disappoint next season.

No doubt he can be better than last season but he is still a very limited cm who is at his best when he can use his aerial abilities and is playing in an advanced position. Still don’t really see how he fits in to the team or style of play and his biggest contribution is likely to be as a target man brought on to make things happen at the end of games.

123~~~
His little cameo against valencia reminded me how useful he could be.

Last season nothing went right for him, his passing was terrible, his challenges were all mistimed, he clearly was low on the confidence, he was the only signing we've made, the pressure was tremendous on him and the entire team.

I just feel that van gaal can turn him into a very good squad player for us, let's see what confidence and good coaching can do to him.

124~~~
He displayed more "quality" in 20 minutes than Cleverley had in the entire tour. That's not knocking Cleverley - he just provides a useful benchmark.

125~~~
Cleverly is a better passer and is more athletic. That instantly makes him a better midfielder. People always say Fellani's a play B, someone who can change the game. We basically payed 27 mill for a tall guy we can lump the ball forward to.
Cleverly is English, homegrown and on a lower wage. I would choose Clevz over Fellani all day long.

126~~~
I think Fellaini is the better passer. His passing is nothing flashy but it is usually simple, quick and forwards. He keeps the game ticking and tries to be positive. Cleverley is safe, negative and doesn't provide any physical presence. The English/homegrown thing really means zilch to me if you are an inferior player. Especially when we have many other English players in the squad.

127~~~
You're being ridiculous now.

128~~~
Cleverly has been here for years and apart from few games 3 years ago he has been completely average, he isn't a good passer at all, has no vision and provides absolutely nothing. The only positive thing about him is that he's homegrown.

129~~~
I provided an opinion as to why I think that. It isn't like I didn't back the statement up. I don't think it is ridiculous at all.

130~~~
Fair enough. I guess in time one of us will be proved right.

131~~~
Cleverley is more suited to our system as counts as a homegrown player. While I'd probably agree Fellaini is the superior player, it's relative to Manchester United.

132~~~
Respect for him after the faux cheers. 

It can't be about money because he'd still be paid his wages from us and Napoli on loan anyway if he left.

133~~~
One day the midfield pairing of Fellaini and Cleverley will rule the world. Mark my words.

134~~~
Agreed. Cleverley can still improve his game under LVG, I don't see Fellaini changing his game much.

135~~~
He was very good when he came on, on Tuesday. That too with all the ironic cheers he was receiving. You can sense he really wants to fight for his place here. Whether that alone is enough we have to wait and see.

136~~~
Fellaini has been underrated since he got here. Fans have had it in for him since day one - the Moyes saga has certainly not helped him either.

There was more than one occasion when we played Everton and Fellaini bullied Carrick and our other midfielders off the park. He did this against others as well. 

In my opinion Fellaini is a better and more expansive passer than Cleverley, he is just as athletic, but obviously offers far more physically. If LVG takes a chance with him, Fellaini may surprise a few people this year.

137~~~
People have been saying that Cleverley can improve his game since he came back from loan. The bottom line is that, apart from the 3 games when he was an effective foil for an Anderson in brilliant form, he has slowly regressed. Year on year his play has become less and less effective. I'm not confident that LvG can reverse a trend that was already well established under SAF.

138~~~
That wasn't a ridiculous statement at all, unless you just base your opinions on watching no football at all and presume that the big lanky guy with the afro is a shit footballer and passer. 

Cleverly is hardly a good passer at all, aside from when he keeps it ridiculously simple.

139~~~
Cleverley's shown himself to be far more capable of being a creative/expansive passer of the ball than Fellaini. I mean, feck it, he showed this in the last game they played together.

140~~~
Those two descriptions and Tom Cleverly don't really fit well with me. I think that his passing is anything but creative or expansive.

141~~~
More so than Fellaini, that's for sure. He was pinging some lovely long passes around towards the end of the game against Valencia.

Also, has Fellaini got a pass like this in his locker?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-HESKnh0X5Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I suspect not.

142~~~
FWIW, I don't think Fellaini needs to be expansive or creative with his passing. That's not the sort of thing we need or expect from him. If he can get about the place, win the ball back a lot (without conceding stupid fouls!) dominate in the air and pass the ball consistently and accurately over short distances then he could be a really useful player.

143~~~
Pogue, I feel same about Fellaini apologists as I do about the Moyes apologists.
Bless them, their hearts are in the right place but they are terribly misguided.

144~~~
Does he have the tactical awareness to play in a holding role? I'm unsure he does. His abilities make him best suited to an all action box-to-box midfield role I think. Ah I really don't know with Fellaini, find myself repeating myself a lot on the subject.

145~~~
That was a good assist, Fellaini probably doesn't have one of those in his locker, but how often has Cleverly done that? his average game consists of low distance, safe passes and very few defense splitting ones. When he does attempt the risky ones, they're often misplaced and we lose possession, sometimes in dangerous areas. One Youtube video and a pre-season friendly doesn't really change much.

146~~~
They're just the only really concrete examples I can show you or remind you of. The rest is just my opinion from watching him for our reserves, Watford and during his earlier, more promising, outings for United.

I do agree he's stagnated a wee bit and this has made him really cautious and conservative. Especially last year (when he seemed to have a brief that was mainly focussed on defending) but I don't think it's accurate to stereotype him as only being capable of playing the sort of inhibited safety first football he resorts to when he's not on form.

147~~~
Some idiotic fans boo him now we have fans say he has unbelievable potential, or I was always pro fellaini. No matter if fans booed him, cheered him, reality is? He is just not good enough, which can be said for most of our midfield

148~~~
That Walcott fella is kinda quick, isn't he?

I too think that Cleverley may be the better, more expansive passer than Fellaini, but Fellaini has more physical presence on the pitch, no doubt. Right now, neither offers enough to be starters.

149~~~
He needs to stay if we don't sign another midfielder.

150~~~
Aye, he's rapid.

No longer the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/theo-walcott-reveals-that-hector-bellerin-is-now-the-fastest-player-at-arsenal-9666705.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fastest player at Arsenal</a> though.

EDIT: feck it, shouldn't have included a link. Would be a good guessing game. Anyone willing to guess without clicking the link first?

151~~~
The curse of being England's next big thing.

I'm rather glad the focus is on Sterling and Sturridge. Now they can take a world of shit off the tabloids after every England game.

152~~~
He absolutely does.

153~~~
Ryo Myaichi?

154~~~
Totally agree and I think he can play that role given the chance.

155~~~
When Michael Carrick played next to Scholes in his prime who was expected to spray the ball about? It definitely wasn't Carrick. When did Carrick start being recognised for the player he is? When Scholes stepped away and let Carrick start dictating games and spraying passes galore. If I have a 4 inch dick and a man next to me has a 10 inch dick, who should be the pornstar? Under both SAF and Moyes, Cleverley was never, ever, ever, ever expected to be the one who played the risky passes.

156~~~
The problem is, even in his first 2 seasons at Everton where he played much deeper he didn't put himself about and control the tempo of the game. He doesn't do it for Belgium either. He needs a player who is capable of controlling a game which allows him to get up and support the attacks. The goal he scored for us against Valencia was a prime example of it. The ball was being carried out by the back line where you would expect your midfielders to come and take it off them. Fellaini stepped up anticipating a ball in and it worked. The problem with this lies in the fact if we lose the ball he won't come charging back to help out in defence.

I honestly think if we need a goal in the last 5-10 minutes of a game, you screw the likes of Kagawa/Zaha/Nani and co, and you throw Fellaini up and ping balls up to him because even if he doesn't have a single touch in the entire time he was on the pitch, he'll still cause havoc in their box, kinda like Schmeichel in the '99 final.

157~~~
Apart from the possibility of losing out on a massive transfer fee from Barcelona, I see no harm in keeping Fellaini on the squad IF we cannot land a proper defensive central midfielder.  We can't strip the club of its midfielders until we've secured reinforcements.

Fellaini was never right for United, but he can be a useful tool when we're forced late in games to go longball.

158~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> no pun intended i guess

159~~~
I'd give Clev the edge on Fellaini re passing, mobility and first touch.  And after doing that would conclude that there's no hope for Fellaini, really.

160~~~
You shouldn't have <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Never even heard of the lad that was faster. He obviously must be rapid as hell, but there was no quote given as to his time. Do you know if United have ever published 40m sprints? 4.42 is blistering though!

161~~~
I don't see how, personally. Cleverley isn't really good at anything. Everything he does is at the absolute bare minimum required for a footballer. His passing, dribbling and tackling are all distinctly average, at best.

And to be fair to Fellaini, he has had two or three impressive seasons in the Premier League. Cleverley's best season came at Watford, and hasn't really impressed since.

Mobility, I'd agree with. Fellaini's passing is underrated though IMO. He's not outstanding, but he passes reasonably well. Cleverley seems to give away the ball needlessly with some awful passes, and rarely seems to opt for the forward pass. Also, Fellaini's first touch is probably his strongest asset. His ball control is very good.

162~~~
Shit, I just saw Fellani's goal versus Valencia.  It was very well taken.  He can be a handful further up the pitch and his ability to receive long passes on his chest are as good as I've seen.  Could this guy do a job for this season?

163~~~
It was encouraging when he came on in the friendly, he played reasonably well, I very much doubt he will be moving on in the next few weeks so he'll be a United player for another few months yet.

Hyperthetically, if Fellaini were able to consistently perform at the level he did against Valencia, would people be happy with him staying at the club and playing back up to whoever we end up with in midfield?

164~~~
To be fair, when he wasn't given the number 6 role for us he did quite well last season and his short passing is pretty good.

165~~~
He'll never live up to his price tag but he could definitely do a job for us.

166~~~
I agree completely, but we could of got him for £20,000,000 I feel, we only had to pay the price we did due to Ed's incompetence in signing anybody else before deadline day lol.

167~~~
Good luck with that since his buyout clause was  £23.5million.

Also the myth about Ed's incompetence last summer has been debunked with certain reporters attesting to the fact that they heaped disproportionate blame on his door while essentially giving our previous manager a free pass.

168~~~
If he consistently played at that level he'd start every week.

169~~~
Well if he's capable of it there's no reason not to expect someone of LVGs calibre to get it out of him. Here's to hoping!

170~~~
Definitely. If he can maintain that he'd be fine here. He won't live up to his price tag though, that ship has sailed and people need to accept that. It isn't his fault though, he didn't value himself as 27 million or whatever it was.

171~~~
If LVG can get the best out of Young, who I thought was completely hopeless, then we can at least hope that he can also get the best out of Fellaini. We'll see what happens, though. Liked the look of him against Valencia but a 20 minute cameo won't be enough to turn anyone's opinion around just yet.

172~~~
Really?  Thought it was more of a case of their GK and defender colliding and Fellaini taking advantage of their comedy of errors.  I'd be really worried if he or any of our players couldn't score from there.

173~~~
This doesn't debunk anything. It just means reporters ran with one angle over another but the truth is they don't really know one way or another what really happened.

174~~~
Elbows Ki in the face. Should have been sent off.

I cannot stand the thuggery of the man.

175~~~
One elbow, one knee..........par for the course.

176~~~
Has completely killed the momentum by replacing Herrera. Also what's with the ball watching for Gylfi's goal ? Mark your freaking man or atleast defend your zone... Ughh.

177~~~
Couldn't give a feck about Fellaini. I'm more concerned by how poor a lot of our other players have been.

178~~~
Does he get instructions to go up front every game, or does he just play where the feck he wants?

179~~~
He's ten feet tall yet he can't win a single header.

180~~~
Fecking hell, scapegoat activated. Good news for Fletcher and everyone else that has been poor. The hacked together defence is not a problem either.

181~~~
Another one where a decent 20 minutes in pre season made some people think he was a good CM <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

182~~~
Yeah it's really bothersome. Passes the ball around a couple times and just charges upfield, without any care for his primary duties as a midfielder.

183~~~
The problem is he just waits for the ball to arrive rather than attacking it. Attacking an opponent on the other hand comes so easily.......

184~~~
Yup. Van Gaal might have played him today but there's no way he's impressed him. Definitely one of the ones on probation still.

185~~~
Tbf, his substitution was the turning point in the game. LVG's fault more than his, but still...

186~~~
Yeah Marouane's the unfortunate scapegoat :

187~~~
What has him elbowing an opposing player in the face got to do with the rest of the team, win or lose?

188~~~
Why the hell did Fellaini come on when we were starting to play well?! I hope Van Gaal realises his error pretty quick.

189~~~
I don't know. Maybe you can tell me?

190~~~
If only he was as good with his feet as he was with his elbows

191~~~
No, you're the one saying his being made a scapegoat, whilst he is the only one on the pitch elbowing anyone in the face, so you tell me.

192~~~
Jesus, what he feck are you raving about. Go have a wank or whatever you need to calm down.

193~~~
Nothing to do with Fellaini being a scapegoat, he has just again proved that he is simply not good enough to play fast football, and again resorts to thuggery. Elbows someone, again. People will claim it's his height. It's isn't, he's just a scumbag. Won a couple of balls when he came on and I thought maybe he'd show something. Then did his usual thing of strolling around the pitch. Horrific positional sense for the 2nd goal, just shambolic. Lovely awareness then to be caught offside from a ball played up to him. Slows the tempo down any time he gets near the ball and doesn't win enough headers up there for his height. Better off, if we're going for that tactic, to put Jones up there. At least he has some drive and determination.

Most of the team were bad today. The difference is that we've seen good performances from those people before in a red shirt. Fellaini is just not good enough and is a thug, quite simple.

194~~~
Elbowing cnut.

195~~~
I'm not eloquent enough to emphasis accurately just how much his ball watching annoys me. It winds me up no end. 

He needs to leave. Nowhere near good enough.

196~~~
He's shit.  His half-assed running around is infuriating.  He never actually <i>does</i> anything other than foul because he's too slow to get there before the ball is gone.

197~~~
My GOD, the club record signing Juan Mata play like compelete shite and people what to bash Fellaini.

198~~~
'Raving about' whilst you're the one running in here claiming Fellaini is being made a scapegoat and then ducking my question?

And I'm far from irate, nor am I the one throwing out ad hominems when asked a simple question.

199~~~
When he's on the pitch we just give up on passing altogether. Added to the flaws in his game there is really no point in keeping him.

200~~~
As I said in the match thread, the tactics were to get the ball up to him. He won knockdowns but no one bar Rooney anywhere close to take advantage.

201~~~
Should have been sent off, again. Needs to go.

202~~~
You seem to be a having a psychotic break thinking I was referring to your post about the elbow. I wasn't. Plenty of other posts about Fellaini being the reason we lost, nothing to do with the elbow. 
I'm willing to be sympathetic as United have just lost, but you should really get a grip.

203~~~
Are people really trying to blame Fellaini here?

He was instructed to swap with Mata, he tried to get forward to y'know, actually score/provide a goal and win the game. He won a few headers but our attack was completely toothless.

And the "elbow" was a joke, he was getting fouled and raised his arm in the air in frustration, happening to catch Ki on the way up. No chance.

Not our worst performer today by a mile.

204~~~
He won some headers when we resorted to pumping it up but eventually Swansea started just letting him win them and closing off the second ball, other than that he offered nothing, was useless on the Sigurdsson goal as he was like a headless chicken in our box and also could have been sent off.

205~~~
I don't blame him per se. But I was pissed with his man marking for their second goal where he left Gylfi all free near our 12 yard box. And then we resorted to long balls with Mata dropping deep and Fellaini going forward. It was dull and boring and awful with no end result. Really feel if he leaves this will stop us from using this strategy which never worked even last season. Plus he was lucky not to have been sent off.

206~~~
I wish he.could stop kicking and.fouling other players

207~~~
I cant remember the last United player I dislike as much as Fellaini. Didn't like him at Everton, and don't like him much more now. He's a thug, and he doesnt even have any redeeming qualities like Keane had and players like Suarez and Costa have.

208~~~
There was no elbow, it was a fecking palm he touched his face with, reacted with aggression and probably could've been off, yes. 

Couldn't give two shits though, Voldemort was running around kicking the shit out of players who later on shat themselves like Lineker when they saw him. He should've been off but refereeing ( including that fecking penalty ) was a joke today.

But yea, it wasn't Fellaini's, Voldemort's or ref's fault, we looked like shit as a collective.

209~~~
Intercepted the ball a few times and looked handy at first, but one I don't care for us resorting to hoofing it up to him, hoping for it to break luckily. Otherwise, there just wasn't much meaningful dynamic interaction between the people in the front. Danny Welbeck would make this look a lot better... Not to mention RVP. Curious to see how he juggles those three, Rooney seems mainly nailed on, having become captain.

210~~~
For the love of god ship him out now.

211~~~
His contribution to the game was slapping and kneeing a couple of players, winning a couple of headers which went nowhere and ball-watching in the box for their goal. Who cares whether he was the worst? He was useless.

212~~~
In terms of the Fellaini sub, there's only one way I can redeem the disappointment of today: I hope van Gaal was using it as a final chance for some of the 'endangered' players in the team. If so, it might work out quite well because it means Young, Fellaini and Hernandez will be sold. Nani was the only one who gave a decent account of himself.

213~~~
Player about 4 foot tall -> Elbows cant reach, knee him

Player about 6 foot tall -> Elbow. See if you can catch him with your hand afterwards in the same movement

Ball about to be crossed in -> Stand still, there's no way the opponents will move and play you offside

214~~~
usual reaction from the usual dickheads every time we lose and fellaini plays... it s getting boring now...

215~~~
Elbow aside he wasn't to bad. Far superior to Fletcher today and probably on par with Herreras contribution.

216~~~
Spot on. I genuinely hate him. So, so much.

217~~~
Did very well. Played in a position where he's very effective. Looked by far most likely to win the game. LVG brave enough to play hoofball at home vs swansea, pretty sure as much as I liked moyes he simply wasn't ever brave enough to try that

218~~~
I can't believe felli insisted on us playing long balls when LVG was on the side line shouting 'NO.. WE PLAY MODERN FOOTBALL.. NOT LIKE MOYES.... MODERN, ATTRACTIVE FOOTBALL... STOP HITTING IT LONG TO FELLAINI'

219~~~
Was shite, again. We lost any control we had when he came on, not sure what he was covering on their goal but I wouldn't blame him, Young should have got the header. He did nothing though, aside the usual elbows.

220~~~
He actually played forward passes and tried to win the game, showed more urgency than most of the team.

He won heads in advanced positions and headed into good areas, but we had nobody anticipating them and moving.

221~~~
Actually I've come around on Fellaini. I think he should stay, and Cleverley should go.

What can Cleverley do that Fellaini can't? Fellaini is only a year older than "the young and learning" Cleverley.

But Fellaini does get knock downs when thrown forward. It worked at Valencia and came close to working here.

We are never going to get our money back if we sell him now. He could be a useful squad/utility player in the future.

It isn't his fault that he isn't Arturo Vidal, and he has that height and power which few other players possess.

The game wasn't lost because of Fellaini, so you'd be better off looking elsewhere for someone to blame.

222~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

223~~~
Just be happy in the knowledge that LVG is incredibly through in his post match analysis and nothing goes unnoticed.

224~~~
Very well? are you joking? He bundled around as usual elbowing people and failing to win a header, he has been fecking crap for us in pretty much every single game. Unfortunately he's another 'squad player' that we probably can't afford to get rid of due to our lack of other options despite being woefully below the required standard of a United player.

225~~~
The very average performance from the player and resorting long balls up to Fellaini were sort of to be expected.

The worrying part is that elbows, flailing hands and knees are pretty much to be expected as well

226~~~
Did I say it was Fellaini who did that? Stop acting like an ass and read before commenting. I said with him on the field we resorted to that crap. He was ball watching for the second goal. The sooner he leaves the better.

227~~~
Watching him and Fletcher out there today makes the need for another quality CM a necessity. No he wasn't as bad as others but this isn't pre-season any more. We need midfielders to be performing at a higher level than this. The question is, do we persist in the hope that he will develop and show us more than we already know? There are some elements of his game that will never change e.g. the repeated fouls. Today we were crying out for ideas and speed of thought when in possession. He's got to be better at pass and move football, then attempting to feed penetrative passes forward. We also needed to be boss that middle of the pitch and be quicker to track and close down their attackers. Our inexperienced defenders aren't getting protected well enough by those in front.

With him in the team there's the temptation for us to play a certain way and I died a little inside when we resorted to that option towards the end. It may well be in our best interests to remove it.

228~~~
he didn't catch one player with an elbow (altho his hand certainly brushed Ki's face, and gave him good excuse to run a minute down) and he won several headers. LVG put him on as the best way to win the game, and the most likely we looked to score was from his knock downs. I wish it weren't so but we don't have the ability to break down a team with 11 players behind the ball, not unlike last season

229~~~
He plays simple passes and wins the odd tackle, granted, but he has woeful positioning; doesn't know what's going on half the time and just jogs about looking lost. 

I've never seen a midfielder more prone to ball watching than he is. I don't know how some people can't see it either, it constantly annoys me during matches. Just watch him off the ball, clueless.

230~~~
We lost all momentum after he came on. Don't know what game you were watching where he was effective.

231~~~
I agree. 

Personally i can take the physical aggression, lack of dribbling ability or passing range BUT his laziness goes beyond Berbatovs!

232~~~
Once again, only one of us is throwing out ad hominems and acting in a manner that suggests they should 'get a grip.' 

A player that goes around elbowing and kneeing opposing players in the back and face is a complete liability.

233~~~
Did alright today.

234~~~
Nah. He was bird shit.

235~~~
just hilarious when people find a way to blame fellaini when we just weren't good enough. I don't know why you're trying to hide from that truth, but if everyone just accepted it quicker it would make for better conversation. We didn't do anything the whole game bar ten minutes when Januzaj just ran at people. We had a ton of free kicks and brought on our best headers of the ball, who won 3 or so knockdowns. Sometimes a quick transition is necessary when you're playing 11 men behind the ball. LVG not to mention mourinho are good managers that understand this. We should go back to moyes last season, trying to play little intricate passes until mata just gets pushed off the ball, it would be better to watch but just as ineffective as it was last season when every team got 1 up vs our awful defence and put 11 men on the edge of the box. 

Felli's head created the only chances we had the last few minutes. I guess you're suggesting if he wasn't on the pitch we would have blitzed them with beautiful modern total football, which we just weren't bothered producing the first hour of the game

236~~~
Its amazing we have posters who can come here and defend that performance. It was daylight thuggery.

237~~~
It's a sad time when any of that can be considered praise for a positive contribution to the game.

238~~~
Which chances are these which his head created? We created fck all with him on the pitch. The guy was pushed up top within 5 mins after their second goal. Mata so deep was even more useless than he was prior to that. We lumped ball upto him and he won a fee headers. That's the sum total of his total contribution apart from being a useless ball watcher in our own pen box and elbowing Kyi.

239~~~
So funny how Van Gaal put Fellaini off Rooney in the last 10-15 mins. Would've been a meltdown if Moyes did that. Either way, I thought he did alright when he come on. Certainly wasn't any worse than anyone else. It was actually nice to have someone in the middle who actually put themselves about. Before that, Shelvey and others were making our players look like kids.

240~~~
I never claimed he was brilliant, simply that he was far from our worst player, and those blaming him for today are just looking for a scapegoat.

241~~~
Turned into Stoke/west ham after he came in, which was horrible to watch. I love having him as another option, but for it to be our only option in the last 15-20 minutes, it really wasn't pretty. I don't understand why he doesn't jump for headers at times.

242~~~
If the ref had done his job, Fellaini wouldn't have been on the pitch for more than, what? 10 minutes?

It wouldn't even be so bad if your description of what Fellaini does was apt, but he doesn't even put himself about - he just fouls people in the most blatant ways possible and when it comes to actual body-strength tussles, he loses a lot of them, and, he's also very meek in the tackle.

243~~~
A few people have took this game badly today.

He did well enough when he came on and was a long way from being the reason for the loss.

I am more worried about Mata doing nothing for 80 minutes than Fellaini today.  This was not the toughest test we are going to have this season.

244~~~
The drop from Herrera to Fellaini was ridiculous. The worst part of Fellaini is that he actually IS as bad as he's made out. You'd think the elbowing and thuggery was an exaggeration but it's not.

245~~~
Our lack of depth on the bench caused this. It shouldn't be the time where we lump the ball. Save that for the last 5. Even then he won headers but no one close enough to take advantage. I recall once he won a header dragging Williams out and Rooney almost got in but that was the only time we made use of the knock downs.

246~~~
He was actually getting fouled and swung his arms as happens every week in dozens of games. 

Get a grip.

247~~~
If he had been sent off like he deserved he would have been a big reason we couldn't get anything out of the game. He got away with it but that doesn't change what he did.

There were very many other problems, very many other players who didnt play well enough and we had struggled in the game before he came on. But this is the Fellaini thread so the focus is on him and he went on that pitch today and assaulted opposition players, taking a huge chance of sending us down to 10 men. Thats unacceptable. 

He was the only one of our players (Swansea had Shelvey) who thought it was okay to risk getting sent off. A lot of other players played poorly but at least tried to win the game in an honest way.

248~~~
I think he was fairly decent to be fair. He won back possession, intercepted a few passes and gave us a different option at the end when we needed it. I think he'll be able to be a part of the squad and contribute if he continues down this road.

249~~~
Nobody is actually claiming he is the reason for the loss though are they?

Most of us are just saying he's a crap football player who doesn't belong anywhere near a Manchester United 1st 11.

We are also saying that he is a bit of a thug. Which would also imply he's a liability not just because of his sorely lacking football skills.

250~~~
In 10 minutes, he done more defensively than Herrera and Flecther who were completely anonymous when it come to protecting our defence. Either way, I don't expect you to agree, as Fellaini will always be used as a scapegoat when we lose - even if he doesn't play. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

251~~~
God knows what you made of Keane. 

I suppose this modern worlds is all about the hipsters - boring to me though, i still prefer football as a physical contact sport - yes with a bit of nasty sometimes.  

We do not earn the right to play anymore and it shows when teams just run through us.

252~~~
I don't think that what he did merited a red card in the slightest. Either way, he wasn't sent off so saying "if he was sent off he would be to blame for our loss" is completely moot.

253~~~
If Cleverley was fit today he would have come on before Fellaini but still, he was nowhere near as bad as people made out. He played some neat passes forward and people are still fkin' overlooking the fact we had 5 other forward players who should have taken their heads out their arses and made something happen.

254~~~
As I said before, he was the only player on the pitch electing to knee and elbow opponents and with that, he is at the mercy of the referee. He should have been sent off today for the elbow on Ki, and it's a running theme with him. 

I don't agree with what you're saying (he stood and ball-watched the 2nd goal) but that's besides the point.

I don't blame Fellaini for how we play when he comes on as it can't be a coincidence that we go long the moment he's on and that's down to the manager.

255~~~
So elbows and hands into the face don't merit red cards? He wasnt booked for clearly kneeing Montero in the back before that. Even if it was 2 yellows same result

It was like Heinze who used to elbow people often and made me feel guilty after each match that we still had 10 people on the pitch.

If that was an opposition player we'd be complaining about it for weeks on end

256~~~
Roy Keane is nothing like Fellaini. They have no similarities whatsoever.

257~~~
Not his fault LvG brought him on for Herrera instead of Fletcher. Not really fair to direct anger at him at all. 

Never understood those that go on about selling player, the issue isn't Fellaini it's that we haven't signed a World Cup midfielder. Fellaini is fine as an option and offers us a different route

258~~~
Is "hipster" the new insult for everything?

I've seen in used in arguments over everything from Palestine to Marouanne fecking Fellaini. I don't think it quite has the punch people think it does.

Plus I'd imagine the really "hipster" thing to do would be to contrarily <i>like</i> Fellaini.

259~~~
Not saying the result was his fault at all but he was undeniably shit. For a 'defensive' midfielder he is a fecking awful defender. Opposing players run past him for fun. Unless he elbows them.

260~~~
Honestly the knee and the elbow were both nothing "incidents" - if it wasn't Fellaini nobody would be kicking up a fuss about it.

The "elbow" especially - it looked to me like Ki was dragging him back and holding his shirt, Fellaini raised his hand in the air (gesturing to the ref in frustration) and caught Ki on the way up. Accidental and only a result of Ki fouling Fellaini.

261~~~
wow

The knee was obvious

Fellaini was being held and fouled yes. Fellaini elbowed him in the face and then extended his hand to catch him again.

262~~~
Surely he cant be blamed for our change in tactics when he came on, that was the managers decision. We had been passing it around all day long and we weren't making any inroads the moment Swansea took taylor off.

263~~~
With the polarized opinions obviously some group in here are complete idiots - is it the people saying he's okay (a few posters in here, moyes, LVG, Belgian national team coach) or is it the people who say he was the worst player on the pitch and the reaosn we lost HMMMMMMM

264~~~
Again, this seems more like Fellainis reputation doing him damage. I suspect if it was another player, everyone would be quick to jump to their defence.

Whatever the case again, Fellaini wasn't sent off and therefore his supposed fouls had no real impact on the result. He played OK - better than many of the team, he gave us an outlet in attack when LVG pushed him forward, and used his physicality a few times to win the ball.
Not brilliant, but definitely not a culprit for the loss.

265~~~
Are you being deliberately obtuse?

In fact don't bother answering, I pretty much knew me replying in the first place was a mistake - as you were.

266~~~
When he got his position ready, Januzaj and Nani let him down.. All the crosses bar maybe 1 or 2 were awful..

267~~~
Sense - quoted to give me a buoy in this sea of shit.

268~~~
Is it ? How so ? Can we not have a discussion without either side being the idiot ? Nothing wrong with stating you opinions.

Also stop sh*t stirring. No one said that. Scroll up and recheck !

269~~~
Funny, I mentioned another player who isnt Fellaini who I was embaressed by after the match. I must have been using Fellaini's reputation against Heinze each time he should have been off and got away with it.

270~~~
Or indeed is it the people who say he wasn't the reason we lost but he's still utter shit?

271~~~
I agree. 

As a centre midfielder, as I've come to expect, he was poor. He's lucky Swansea aren't seeking a retrospective ban for his hands up approach too.

But as a #10 he won a few knockdowns and was a nuisance at crosses. Fellaini can't be blamed for the fact Mata was also playing #10 and Fletch was alone in midfield against the Swansea runners. Our coaching staff wanted that. If not they'd have brought Fellaini on for Mata and left us with two proper midfielders.

272~~~
When did LvG say he is OK?

273~~~
This barely makes sense - I wasn't just referring to you however, but rather the usual suspects on the caf who will jump at any chance to blame it on Fellaini. Same sort of cretins who were ironically cheering him when he came on against Valencia, I suspect.

I wasn't "embarrassed" by Fellaini at all today. The team played poorly and he was a part of that, but on an individual level he tried to impact the game in a positive way, he used his strengths and on the whole played reasonably.

274~~~
Except people aren't saying that he was the reason we lost, that's just a strawman you have invented.

275~~~
He was average on the ball, won the ball when we didnt have it a couple of times, completely clueless of what to do in his own box on their 2nd goal.

If thats where his performance had started and stopped he'd have been just another on the list of players who didn't play well enough with a bunch of his teammates.

But that would be completely ignoring his hatchetman performance, which was different to any of our other players and why he deserves special criticism.

Anything for Fellaini

276~~~
Fellaini was horrible today and should have seen red. He kind of enforced why so many wants him out. 

Other players played badly. However this thread happens to be dedicated to him

277~~~
Sounds like some of our fans would have loved to see Fellaini sent off today.

278~~~
Well, I disagree, and this appears to have reached an impasse.

279~~~
It doesn't matter which way you're trying to slice it - the two players are nothing alike. 

Even Keane's moments of madness and/or thuggery were polar opposite to what we see from Fellaini in practically every game he plays for us. 

And correct me if I'm wrong, but Keane never even once elbowed -- , at all, never mind on the sly like we see Fellaini do. -- a fellow professional in a United shirt.

280~~~
Keane had moments of madness and sheer thuggery between fantastic imposing and inspirational performances.

Fellaini had moments of madness and sheer thuggery between average and poor performances.

281~~~
He should try luck in a different sport. This football thing isn't his thing.

282~~~
That's exactly why I like him!

He wasnt the reason we lost today, he won the ball a couple of times and passed alright - although it was a bit of strange sub, couldve understood for Fletcher but bringing off Herrera was a suprise

I dont particularly like to see us playing him at no10, prefer him to stay in mid

283~~~
That's what makes me want to defend him.  

I can't understand United fans with this attitude, loads of players have been poor over the years, I not seen anyone else get this much dog abuse and pretty much blamed for any poor performance.

Football fans usually get behind their nasty players and leave the bitch whining for the opposition.  So what if he gets a bit physical - let the opposition moan about it and the ref deal with it if he see fit.

Gerrard is a much nastier bastard but I don't see many scousers bitching about that.

284~~~
If I knew that we were going to lose then yes, I wished he saw red. Maybe he finally learn to play football the proper way or else such incident would convince VG to kick him out of OT

Rest assured that one day or another he will cost us big. He's got the unpredictability of Suarez - his talent.

285~~~
Moyes should have been sacked for this signing alone.

286~~~
First time I ever used the word and someone pulls me up on it!

It was actually code for fanny's/twats but I thought that might get me into trouble - is that not what people mean when they use?  If not then most of my reading comprehension on forums has just gone to zero.

287~~~
You're a "Frakki"

288~~~
Football fans do not usually get behind nasty players especially if they are pretty average. The reason being that these players are loose cannons who can cost you alot. He only need to find some shrewd bastard who knows how to manipulate the dumb hairy idiot to do something silly at the right time and bam. He'll end up seeing red, United end up with 10 players and we can kiss a CL final or crucial win goodbye.

289~~~
CL Final <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

290~~~
He's an average players brought up to play with average sides with no ambition. You cant have such players against the the shrewd players playing in the continent like Ronaldo.

291~~~
he played in a premiership game, probably doesn't think he's league 2 level

292~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

293~~~
Why not? Aren't we one of the biggest clubs in the world? Shouldn't that be our ambition for next year?

Mind, the EPL is attracting more and more continental players. Rest assured that they will exploit Fellaini's nastiness to their advantage and it will only be a matter of time before he gets himself into trouble

294~~~
Young ? Cleverley ? Valencia ? Fletcher ? Anderson ? Nani. Things is most of the players that under-performed today - Fletcher, Hernandez etc (who have been criticized in their threads BTW Fellaini's not an isolated case) have contributed positively to our success over the years. Fellaini has nothing to show for in comparison apart from the decent performances vs Palace, Weest Brom and the like.

Not when the player is a liability on the field from a disciplinary and tactical (doesn't mark his man, fouls unnecessarily, is pretty one dimensional) perspective.

Bit of a poor comparison IMO. Gerrard is a fantastic player overall that pulls some nasty antics from time to time while Marouane is a below par one that can't seem to control his appendages.

295~~~
One can close an eye when the bastard happens to have talent. We closed an eye to Ince and Keane, Liverpool did the same with Suarez and Gerrard. One shouldn't do the same with average players such as Fellaini.

And yeah we've got alot of players who are not up to standards and should be kicked out of the club. However this happens to be a thread about Fellaini so we discuss him

296~~~
Right so is ok to be a nasty fouling player if you are much better?  that's ok then because I was just wondering why our own 'supporters' continually bitch about his fouling as if he is elbowing them.

I just don't understand why he gets so much stick - not found of him as a no10 myself but I like the idea of a tough midfielder.

297~~~
There cannot be double standards, though. If say Mata was to elbow someone, whether he does it often or not, would you want him to get sent off?

298~~~
It's just scapegoating, don't know how people are so blind to think that's not what they're doing, blatant scapegoating. There are 100s on this forum that maintain he's never played a good game for us, whatever about opinions that's something that just isn't reasonable

299~~~
There's a difference between a tough midfielder and a thug. Its winning the ball not taking the man out in ways that can and should see you red carded.

Someone like Schneiderlin is a tough midfielder. Someone like Michael Brown (or Fellaini on a day like today) is a thug

300~~~
Are you getting paid for typing the word thug?

We get it.

301~~~
If its a one off (which in Mata's case is) then the answer is NO.

Let me find you a better example. Back in 1997 I felt that Beckham was becoming too vocal for his own good and this would cost him in the future. I hoped that shit would hit fan in some meaningless game. In my head I had the perfect script. He'll retaliate in some league cup game, he'll see red and hopefully SAF would knock him back to his place. Unfortunately it didn't happened and Beckham had to learn from his mistakes in possibly the worst way ever (ie after the Simeone incident).
Same thing happened with Rooney vs Ronaldo.

And there's always double standards. Players like Rooney and Beckham  has the necessary talent that made them worth investing time in and be patient even when they do mistakes (even when such mistakes are costly). Fellaini doesn't have that luxury. He's just an average player whose not worth wasting time on for him to 'learn from his mistakes'

302~~~
You clearly dont if you think Fellaini is an example of a "tough" midfielder.

303~~~
Ok. Well I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree. I just find it strange how a fan of Man Utd would like to see one of their players sent off, whether average or world class.

304~~~
Do you have a habit of exaggerating or is it only a case of when you come in this thread? A player can be a PL player and yet not be "OK" enough for United. Him coming on today is more a case of injuries and lack od other options. LvG playing him does not necessarily mean he rates him as good enough. If he plays when all our transfer business is done and most of our players in his position are available then you can make that case. Right now you are clutching at straws.

305~~~
Who said it's OK ? Please don't deliberately misconstrue the point. If you're a great player some of your indiscretions get overlooked. Case in point - Keane, Vieira, Ribery, Gerrard, Zidane - who could all be absolute douchebags at times if they so desired. Hell if you score 40 goals a season, people might even forget your racist, vampiric actions in the past - Like Suarez who received such acclaim from the media, fans and general public last season. In contrast to that if you're a poor player, the issues only get compounded because there's aren't enough positives to outweigh the negatives. In that case, not only are you a rather mediocre player but you don't also play the game in its right spirit. It;s a very relativistic point of view.

Harsh TBF. It's not cool to judge others and their quote support unquote over the internet when you have no idea who they really are. Can they not critique the players in their respective threads without the moral police quantifying their support ?

I believe the first paragraph addresses this a bit. He's :
1. Technically deficient. This can be compensated by being a busy body but as stated in 2. that's not the case with him.
2. Doesn't give his all (eg. vs Bayern when he was a prime culprit for Schweinsteiger's goal or today when he didn't track his marker for Gylfi's goal).
3. An absolute thug who likes to hack players right from his Everton days.
4. He's really one dimensional. The bread and butter move seems to be - pass to a team-mates and haul ass towards the goalmouth while abandoning your midfield duties.
He doesn't really have many redeeming qualities to make up for the flaws. No one likes to put down the players of a club they support. But this just seems to be a dead cause.

To the last bolded part, he'd not made for such a role. I believe if you down the 2013/ 2014 thread some valid points have been made against him being a central midfielder for United. His size is deceptive giving the illusion of being tough but the actual footballing performances don't back up the claim eg. getting out leapt by 5'7" Lahm. Still there's statistical evidence if you so desire in the the 2013/ 2014 thread as I stated before.

That said it's your choice. No-one's asking you to agree with their opinions. But by the same measure we're entitled to ours.

306~~~
You seem to struggle with reading comprehension, you reply makes no sense with my post.  I think it's better to leave it there.

307~~~
"you reply" indeed.

308~~~
Short term small loss for long term great gains sort of thing

309~~~
Why is this fool still playing for us and stealing a living? Give Napoli the 15M to sign him. Yes, give them the money to take this sorry excuse of a footballer off our books

310~~~
Things I still couldn't  understand

1. What Fellaini offers for United
2. Ebola
3. Religion

311~~~
It's not scapegoating. As I said, he wasn't the reason we lost today. But he was utter shit. As he has been in about 90% of games he's played for us. I'm sure he's a nice lad but he's way out of his depth at United and doesn't fit our style of play at all.

312~~~
Absolutely!

313~~~
He could play. No comparison.

314~~~
Biggest problem with him today in my opinion was that he replaced the wrong player.

315~~~
The big guy did ok when he came on. Stick he gets is shocking we should give him a chance.

316~~~
He didnt really have any impact on the game, no better or worse than most of the other players, stupid swinging his elbow again but he must have impressed LVG to some extent as he seems to prefer him to Cleverley.

317~~~
What is the deal with him, honestly? I was surprised to see him come on, but still was quietly hoping for him to have a decent cameo. Yet, he was poor. Didn't really do anything with the ball, was way off positionally, kept on running towards the opposition penalty area and then cost us the goal as well. 

He is, like, our Andy Carroll. A beanpole but still can't win a header. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

318~~~
This is completely spot on. He isn't cut out as a player at United. His only defence is not many players currently but while the likes of Young can fill a role, I can't see Fellaini doing anything for us of note except being a Peter Crouch like nuisance at best.

319~~~
He is crap.

320~~~
Got abuse again going off the pitch today from a small fee idiots, didnt react too kindly to it either. 

He done better today when he came on compared to fletch and herrera, he might not be the midfielder we crave but the abuse he gets is pathetic

321~~~
Doesn't deserve abuse, he is what he is, but he needs to go.

322~~~
Id prefer if we kept him for now and got rid of Ando. Cleverly is just as poor form wise, Carrick injured another while, it makes no sense flogging him until we get a midfielder in.

323~~~
Hoofing the ball to the tallest tower on the pitch is a sign of Stoke quality.

Improve style of play or simply get rid.

324~~~
Just doesn't offer anything for me, not that Anderson, or Cleverley do either, but Fellani will be easier to move on IMO.

325~~~
Yea, I taught this assumption that a plan B would work if plan A was not working. But, our plan B today was just pathetic and desperate. We shunned our creative players for  longball tactics that at the end of the day, did not work out. Fellaini needs to improve his style of play and not only become a target for longball football.

326~~~
Would be a good start to just create a sufficient plan A for now. Plan B for Van Gaal seems to be a 4-3-3 but we'll need players that will let us engage fluidly that kind of advanced tactical maneuver.

327~~~
Watching the game again and realizing how much if a thug this guy actually is.  He's on the pitch for z20 mins and he bluntly knees one guy in the back and lashes out with his fist to another.  All on the back of doing nothing productive to help the team - he never will be good enough for this club

328~~~
Seemed like he might suit 'our style of play' when the manager told the players to hit long balls to him today lol mybe you meant your favorite style of play

329~~~
He was much better in a deeper role, broke up play and dictated the defensive midfield. As soon as he went up field surprise surprise we conceded the secon.
I really do not like the style of 'dish and rush up' at all. He needs to stay in the hole and be defensive if we are going to use him.

Hoofing it to him was very grim.

330~~~
The biggest problem with Fellaini (on a long list) is that it's so tempting for managers to use him up top when things get desperate.

331~~~
At least pump it up to him if your going to hoof it into the box. Christ the last part of that game was shocking. crosses that were Sunday league quality.

332~~~
He couldn't have been that far upfield at the time. It was him who Sigurdsson ran off I think to score.

333~~~
The long ball tactic has never worked with him at United. At Everton he was a menace because their players were close together and compact. No wonder Fellaini was so good as he was forever in the faces of the opposition.

If we're going to play hoof to Fellaini at least do it correctly. He won the bloody headers most of the time but no advancing players to take advantage.

334~~~
Tuesday night against Valencia seems seems a far away memory now...

335~~~
we need to sell while he at least has a semblance of value. we could probably get 12m+ addons if we sold this summer. if he stays another year or 2 we will probably flog him for like 4m, its the united way...

336~~~
It was Fletcher. Fellaini correctly tracked Bony in and would have to be an absolute genius to be covering someone on his 7 oclock.

337~~~
Worried that the transfer window is close to closing and he's still here, just not suited to this club. We should be able to beat teams that come here with football, not physically beat them with elbows. He loses a lot of headers for his height too.

338~~~
Came on, was shit, rinse and repeat.

339~~~
He seems to be a player bereft of confidence, and has reverted to his earlier career trait of fouling a hell of a lot.  He was a vey decent player when Everton signed him, setting a club, and belgian player record, and receiving accolades for his service at Everton.  He was signed to us by a manager with no clear idea of how he'd set us up to play and how the big lump would fit into that.  

Fellaini is that bad now that I shudder when he makes his way onto the pitch, I know it will just be awful, as demonstrated today.  He needs to restart his career elsewhere, it cannot be recovered at old Trafford, just one of those things that didn't work out.

340~~~
There's a difference between being tough, and being a scumbag. Keane, Gerrard etc, they're tough players who have a mean streak. They go out and win the ball, they show effort. Fellaini strolls around the place, puts the odd challenge in, then has a history of elbowing people. I find it hilarious that people claim "That wasn't an elbow" etc, each and every time he does it. Not an isolated incident. At least the 3rd elbow he has thrown since he has been at United, and I'd guess I'm not even remembering at least one or two more incidents. He's just not good enough for us. This thread is about him, so people are going to discuss him. Go look at the other threads of players who under performed today and you'll see people giving out about them too. He gets stick because he's not good enough, and he ambles around. At least Cleverley (who I don't like) puts himself about and shows drive. Fellaini needs to go. I'd rather a youth player with ambition and drive.

341~~~
He didn't actually commit any fouls yesterday. So that is a bit weird, 'reverted to fouling a hell of a lot?'..
Good players can elbow, they play the game hard, but they elbow. Fellaini is 'not good enough', he also elbows therefore it is wrong and we must all get bitterly upset.

Solid logic that.

342~~~
Well he kneed someone in the back and elbowed someone in the face, so that is fouling in my book.

343~~~
The guy flailing around that went down then got up pretty much straight away and the other guy who was bear hugging him who was called for a foul?... More solid logic this is.

edit: I've just had a read back from the start, people are actually claiming he should have been sent off for reacting to a cynical bear hug foul? Get a grip you lot.

344~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Love your "solid logic"...someone "got up pretty much straight away" can't have been fouled, obviously.  

You have a hard on for Fellaini, even so you must admit his record for fouling is pretty prolific, no?

345~~~
Hey, since you're new here and I know the drill in Fellaini threads I'll give you a hint.

Don't bother. No matter what kind of game he has you'll most likely find such words/phrases as: 'oaf', 'elbow', 'foul', 'not united quality', 'i hate him', 'yellow card', 'moyes' and 'sent off'. It doesn't really matter if for 10 minutes he's made 10 interceptions and 20 tackles, if he'll foul somebody you'll instantly have 10 people jumping here saying the same shit all over. Oh, and be ready for Cleverley comparisons. It's always Fellaini vs Cleverley, the other is always better when the former is playing and reverse.

Enjoy your stay. Oh, and one thing more, this thread is a lot easier to read when you ignore some people.

346~~~
Yes, I must have a hard on for Fellaini. I honestly couldn't care less if he played 90 minutes literally stomping the turf yelling "SWEET CHIN MUSIC" and kicking people in the face at random intervals. If he fouls he fouls, it's part and parcel of the game. If people want to be outraged because they feel like it then good on them.
Seems my 'sound logic' remarks were made to soon. Thanks.

347~~~
You won't find much logic with these guys.  

I just tend to use the thread a great base point for using the ignore function.  

Keeps my experience on the site much more pleasant.

348~~~
I find that there is a great lesson to be learned in what you read and how you react to it. Some things deserve your time and some things do not. Sadly I don't agree with the 'ignore' function. I just say my piece and if I don't need to reply then I don't need to. But thanks for your advice as well.

349~~~
Yeah that's the easy coward's way out TBF. So instead of deliberating and trying to make a cogent argument - be it pro or otherwise, we should ignore anyone we don't necessarily agree with. Seems rational enough. Good luck with that. And let's all put anyone we don't see eye to eye with on our ignore lists ! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

<span style="font-size: 10px">Do you know </span>what constitutes a foul in football?  I've never heard of a "cynical bear hug foul before".  <span style="font-size: 10px">btw wtf is sweet chin music?  </span>

351~~~
I'm one of Fellaini's sterner critics but I thought he was okay yesterday. Certainly not bad.

At best he's a squad player, but therin is the huge problem we have.

We have 3 players (Fellaini, Cleverley and Fletcher) who are squad players at best and we won't get rid of 2 of them because they are homegrown. Is it any wonder why we don't sign midfielders when we have 6 of them on our books? For Christ sakes Anderson is still here.

353~~~
Is there a point trying to dissect what a foul is in a Marouane Fellaini thread? I see no point in continuing this discussion.
Having read your posts Kid_Moyes (Kid_Louis now?) I have to agree that this is a very good barometer of a performance. Because I agree that you are harsh in dealing out the punishment but if you thought he played well then that garners quite a bit of credit for me.

354~~~
Before you go I will say there is nothing cowardly about not wanting to read or react to every single person whether you agree with them or not. 

I just find certain things not worth my time.  I don't come on here for arguments, cogent or otherwise, I like reading want some people have to say, others I either skim or if they get my attention enough to annoy ignore.

Thanks for you comments, completely pointless but thanks anyway.

355~~~
Sly digs like this are what I expected. That's your prerogative and I'm no-one to say otherwise. But to come into arguments, put forth your opinion and then shut people out, be unwilling to fathom what they are articulating and having a state of "I'll only read what I want and respond to what I want because that's in accordance with my POV" is just the perfect solution. That's a great way of experiencing life. Let's just block random people out. Your choice TBF.

356~~~
Hoof to Fellaini to be our plan B under Van Gaal ?

357~~~
He'd only fall back in that tactic if he thought it was effective. Seeing Fellaini barely challenge for the ball yesterday will out an end to that.

358~~~
It gives us something different although hopefully we can win most games without needing to resort to long balls.

When we do use it we must show better quality than today with the passing.

I know I'm in the minority that thinks he can play as a CM but when you are choosing between Fletcher and Cleverly I think Fellaini has a shout - obviously I would prefer we just bought Vidal.

359~~~
Where did I say anything about Good players? I said tough. Please Have the decent to actually read what is written before attempting to be clever and sarcastically mock the logic.

360~~~
He won loads of headers and a few tackles, you really didn't see any?

361~~~
Then why did you mention Keane and Gerrard? Why not Shelvey and N'Zonzi? Who also do their fair share of tough physical tough play with a mean streak. Don't try to be obtuse, it was a stupid comment. Certain players should be absolved from physical play for one reason Fellaini for a completely different reason should be scrutinized.

Players make all sorts of tackles, deal with it.

362~~~
It reminded me of a game I watched of Andy Carroll for England two or three years ago.

It was when his stock was at it's highest and the commentators were frothing over him winning most of the headers he was challenging for.

It was completely ignored that none of the headers he won actually ended up at a England players feet or in a dangerous position.


Same with Fellaini today, got his head to the ball first (he's 7'2" what else should you expect?) yet nothing whatsoever came from it.

363~~~
I agree with you that for his size he should be winning more but him winning headers did create a couple of openings.

That Januzaj Volley that hit Rooney for example came from his knockdown at the far post. 

Think we need to get the ball wide early and cross from more dangerous areas for this tactic to be effective though instead of just hoofing from deep. Unless he has real beating of his marker like he did with Carrick when he played us. Also, we need to put men around for 2nd balls quick.

364~~~
I don't mind Fellaini for the most part but what frustrates me is that our entire game plan changed once he got on the pitch today -- we started hoofing the balls from the back to a Fellaini on the outskirts of the box so he could head it down to another player. Perhaps its just we remember his goal against Valencia where a hopeful long ball found him and resulted in a goal that we tried to do the same thing for 20-30 minutes or so. Ridiculous. It's not like we were put into any better position by having Fellaini win a header, let alone direct it perfectly into the path of another onrushing player. I'm not saying not to feed Fellaini with these long balls but they shouldn't be our primary form of attack. 
How much easier is it just to pass the ball to the edge of the box? At least then one of our forwards can turn and do something with it, not having to rely on the random bounce of the ball off of Fellaini's afro and worry about control the ball before making the next decision. Just a frustrating game all around epitomized by the way we used Fellaini.

365~~~
It's not my favourite tactic but as an option for ten minutes when Mata's probing had produced little why not.  It worked well considering the quality of most of the crosses, not enough people supporting or anticipating the knockdowns though.

He played better than Fletcher in midfield when he came on and it is there where he should fight for is place if no ones else comes in.

366~~~
I used Keane and Gerrard because they are tough guys, and because they were mentioned earlier in the thread. I used them as legitimate tough guys, not like Fellaini who someone (possibly you) called a tough guy earlier in the thread. As I said, difference between tough, and thug. Those two guys would routinely go in and win the ball for their team, then use it well. Fellaini simply does not do that. You can claim it was a stupid comment all you want, but it's my opinion and I will stick to it. Plenty of others agree with me. 

I'm not even remotely saying that players should be absolved from physical play, I would like you to point out where I have? Again, not even reading what I'm typing, then having the audacity to call my comments stupid.

One last time, please actually read what people type before you call their comments stupid.

Incidentally, elbowing someone is not a tackle.

Also, if we're talking solid logic, so elbowing someone after being "bear hugged" is ok? Man, Becks should have used that excuse in '98. Hey ref, it's ok that I tripped him, he fouled me first.

367~~~
It worked against Valencia, so he must have got excited and tried it again.

368~~~
That is what annoyed me to. It wasn't an instant change but I think it was definitely tactical from the top to move him up. He almost swapped with Mata which was just plain silly.

369~~~
Yeap. He annoys me because we have the tendency to go hoof ball when he is on the pitch.

370~~~
He loses an astonishing amount of aerial battles given that he's fifty foot two and has a microphone for a head.

371~~~
I vote for Sweet Chin Music. He's always going to get a lot of flack because he's tied to a bad transfer dealing and he's tied to the ill fated Moyes regime. 

He's also a unique player that doesn't do well if in the wrong system. 

The thing of it is that he's not really the issue but rather a symbol of the bigger issue of the unexplainable phenomenon that United refusing to acquire quality midfield pieces for 6 years.

372~~~
He should have sent off in 2 occassions ffs.

373~~~
No he shouldn't have.

374~~~
Yeah definitely didn't deserve to be sent off. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5s1HMzY13Sg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

375~~~
He elbowed a player and he knocked another with his knees. This is football and not mixed martial arts

376~~~
There was a moment in the game when Nani dribbled through the middle of the pitch, got to a good area and released him on the right flank with time and space to do something. The poor lad didn't even know what to do from there, he just passed the ball back to Jones at right back. I should have wept.

377~~~
Him and his elbows ...

378~~~
It's not 'exhale or you're getting sent off' either. Get a grip.

379~~~
Apologies if I am used to watch proper football. I am sure that Stoke supporters would have loved Fellaini's 'contribution' during the game

380~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

381~~~
He did exactly the same when Bayern equalized at the return leg in Munich. He lacks neccessary defensive qualities, like focusing on the players around him instead of focusing on the ball.

382~~~
I was yet to see full highlights, didnt realise this. Still though the amount of general abuse he got going down the tunnel was diabolical.

383~~~
Well, seems you haven't been around long enough either so I'll try to make myself a little bit clearer just for you. It's not about ignoring people who make a point about him whether it's a negative or positive one, it's about people who come here ( and came to the 13/14 thread ) every single day ( matchday or not ) and continue with their utter shite that's being repeated ad infinitum. Those cliches I quoted are the best example, go and read through previous Fellaini thread from the page one so you'll maybe understand it better.

It's not about ignorning people who I disagree with, no, it's about ignoring people who spout the same shit every single time, you simply enter this thread and expect certain names to pop up. I'm not going to go through the same discussions about Fellaini over and over again. Some people claim that he elbowed somebody yesterday, so really, what's the point in discussion when somebody's making up shit in order to make a boring, repetitive 'point' ? Fellaini's not United quality, yea, we fecking got that, but so is about 80% of the squad judging from last season and yesterday's game so jog on.

So yea, spend a little bit more time here and then talk about what's a rational approach and what's not.

384~~~
don't think he did awful yesterday to be fair to him, definitely think he can do a better job for us or someone else playing further forward, he really isn't a CM at all.

385~~~
i came in this thread to say exactly that. Hate that tactic and I think fella is the cause of it.

386~~~
Care to name and shame if you're positive certain posters incessantly chat shite when it comes to Marouane ? And please don't be patronizing from the next time. 5 months on here is more than enough for me to get a general feel of the posters. I don't need a lifetime worth of experience and 50k posts to arrive at basic conclusions. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

387~~~
If your first response wasn't in patronizing style with a little bit of silly sarcasm I wouldn't have responded in the way I did.

Want me to send you a screenshot of my ignore list ? I'm not going to name and shame here, it's not the thread for it nor do I feel the need for it.

388~~~
Please do. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

389~~~
Are people sure he was at fault for the 2nd goal? It looked to me like he was told by Fletcher about an opponent behind him and followed him in (losing him briefly) while Sigurdsson was being marked by Blackett who let him go and Fellaini just ended up the closest to him while Blackett stood at the back post marking nobody.

390~~~
Surely his peripheral vision is affected by his hair no ? Not that his game needs that much vision anyway

391~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/mZTdr1U.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/mZTdr1U.jpg"/>
He would have needed eyes in the back of his head and Fletch stands still for a long time.

392~~~
Just hope that this tall guy will be loaned to Napoli asap

Hope that they'll qualify to CL football this season in order to get their 25M from UEFA and pay him

Industrial error, he was again out of position (ok he had just two weeks of training), but he didn't had anything in his game

393~~~
The blind hatred is cute, but no he wasn't.

394~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Eyes in the back of the head.

395~~~
I was obviously talking about in general and not in this instance

396~~~
Yeah exactly. Blackett has Sigurdsson at this point and ends up losing him. Fellaini follows his man the whole way.

397~~~
Head over to the goals conceded v Swansea thread. I know Blackett loses him but from the moment Fletch enters the box until the goal goes in he doesn't move, which was strange. I don't think Fellaini can be blamed at all really. But it's all opinions. 

<a class="username" data-user="26211, @kouroux" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26211/">@kouroux</a>, well I was talking about in this instance. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

398~~~
People cannot be serious with these excuses ?

Who exactly is he marking ? Dude's just watching the ball throughout the goal... First for the cross from the left side then for the final ball.. What exactly did he contribute ? Bony even jogged into the area and our man showed little awareness of that... Yet for some reason he can suffice as a defensive midfielder...

399~~~
Good for you <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, let's not quote each other if we ain't talking about the same thing <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

400~~~
Some dutch football website made a big headline about how La Gazetta Della Sport wrote about that loan deal with Napoli again today. Got my hopes up for a second, but I assume it's just old news recycled and all.

401~~~
He clearly had no idea what he was doing there. But in this thread you will find people who would defend him if he controlled the ball in the area and smashed it into the top corner of his own net

402~~~
Classic case of ball-watching

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Young jumping for the ball

403~~~
Ye its voetbalzone.nl they tend to take paper talk as confirmed news.

404~~~
Compare the comments about agression and cnutishness in the Rojo thread with the comments on it in this thread and tell me Fellaini was not deemed a failure before he had even kicked a ball.
<span style="color: #ffffff">he is a failure though</span>

405~~~
Has a foot injury meaning his move to Napoli is in doubt. Another reason why we should've done all our business early and We now have Herrera, fletcher and cleverley as midfield options.

406~~~

407~~~
Are those his new Napoli trainers?

408~~~
Injuries after injuries <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

409~~~
Oh feck right off.

410~~~
What a waste of time he is.

He can't even feck off somewhere else without fecking it up.

411~~~
Oh ffs.

What are we doing that gets our players injured?!

412~~~
Wtf are we doing in training seriously ?

If this was Moyes everybody and that Raymond Verheijen fellow would have been moaning all over.

413~~~
Which injury is that, Rafael, Evans, Lingard, Danny, Shaw, Carrick, Valencia now Fellaini. Missed somebody ? It's getting fecking ridiculous, second week into season ffs.

414~~~
Cleverley was out with some bug as well first week,  Johnstone is out as well. James Wilson got injured in first team training as well.

Nick Powell is AWOL with some injury but that was from before seemingly.

415~~~

416~~~
If he's out for a while that is a huge blow to everyone. Nobody really wants him at United and he'll still be here till next year at least. What a waste.

417~~~
Isn't there anyone due back by the weekend ? We really need to catch a break with these injuries.

418~~~
Gutting. Have a go at that hoodie though - at it's limits.

419~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Do other clubs get so much injuries in training ? Are training sessions that intense ?

420~~~
Jesus. Tenth injury a week into the season, nice.

421~~~
Any chance for a GIF of his beautifully headed ball to Januzaj for a glorious chance to tie the match in injury time?

422~~~
He has been moaning. He commented last week LvG has been over training players.

423~~~
He won't be playing for us for a while? This is good news.

424~~~
Urgh.

425~~~
If he was fit there's a good chance he wouldn't be playing for us for even longer, if ever again.

426~~~
I think the chance was never as good as we liked to think. See the Nani to Sporting loan with us paying his wages for the length of the deal as to why.....

427~~~
Wasn't this something Moyes did too?

428~~~
Great, another injury. Despite what people say I hope they realise that leaves us with Herrera, Cleverley and Fletcher. I'd take Fellaini over two of them.

429~~~
I'd only take him over Cleverley.

430~~~
I don't think Fletcher will provide anything at all, but we'll have to wait and see.

431~~~
He's better on the ball then Fellani and he certainly offers some energy in midfield. I'm not saying he is the solution as we need to sign a quality CM to partner Herrera in midfield but I would take Fletcher over Fellani every day of the week. Fellani offers some physicality but that's about it.

432~~~
I've been over it in the thread but I think Fellaini is better on the ball. Maybe not technically but he's certainly more positive. Anyway, no point going over old arguments.

433~~~
Ya that's fair enough. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

434~~~
Another blow and we are now so short on numbers in midfield it's actually quite depressing... 

I would be getting close to pushing that panic button. McCarthy? De Jong? Osman? Anyone!

435~~~
Folks looooove McCarthy around here.

436~~~
Might force our hand regarding much needed CM options. 

Or we could go into the season with Fletcher, Cleverley and Herrera as our options.

Or we could just accept that 7th place finish right now.

437~~~
Remember when we talked about his injury record being a good thing, when he initially signed? Last season and this, we really are ridiculous in terms of injuries.

438~~~
Looking better each day.

439~~~
So now we can't even send him to Napoli, great! What a waste of time and money!

Who does actually pay the wages if a player is out for a while? Club or some kind of insurance?

440~~~
Shaw was out for like 3-4 matches total for two seasons due to some injuries at SOTON just to join us and start the season with an injury that rules him out for a month.

441~~~
I genuinely don't understand how a professional footballer in this situation can just watch the ball and fail to look for opposition players in space. Football is his job ffs. If the only football experience he had was a few games of 5 a side you'd expect him to know better. Its fecking maddening.

442~~~
Like I said, it's ridiculous and annoying. IMO the main reason we lost the title to Chelsea in 09/10 and City in 11/12 were injuries.

443~~~
Fellaini has injured his ankle, meaning he could be out for months.

444~~~
Well whether he's out for months or we loan him out, we'd still need another midfielder.

445~~~
Blackett should be following Sigurdsson there. He's doing absolutely nothing at the front post when Smalling is trying to block the cross. Simple defending.

446~~~
Not saying he was the only one at fault. You must admit he showed poor awareness/carelessness for an international midfielder. I'd be angry with myself if I got caught ball watching like that. To be honest it just wouldn't happen.

447~~~
The one ball watching in that clip is Tyler Blackett.

448~~~
I can complain forever about Fellaini but not really much in that instance. The only person he should really pick up there is Bony who arrives really late and quickly, and he does pick him up. Somebody should be telling Blackett to stay with Sigurdsson, maybe that somebody should've been that international midfielder. Either way it's a lack of organisation as we've seen for 12 months now.

We've conceded so many pathetic goals like that. 6 players and a keeper to pick up 3 men in the box and we can't manage it. We desperately need some bollocks and leadership or we'll just concede soft goals over and over again, starting on Saturday

449~~~
It's a complete fecking shambles from Nani and Young as well. They're not defenders obviously but jesus wept

450~~~
Actually your DM should be right on the penalty spot and covering the area to the edge of the box, leaving the defenders to cover the 6 yard box/attackers. He's not helping by going to stand next to them. Fellaini wanders past the area that the ball ends up, because he doesn't sense danger. A lot of players would have done just as badly especially our midfielders as Carrick is the only one who senses the danger and snuffs it out with good positioning

451~~~
Not when it's happening that quickly. You haven't got the time to organise yourselves to swap who you're marking so the best thing is to stay with them until the danger has gone.

That gif is so bad from everyone involved. I'd be surprised if I hadn't seen it all before. Blackett shouldn't be making his first appearance in such a game and he'll learn from it, but terrible management at the club has left us in this position

452~~~
He's not marking

453~~~
Seeing Fellaini on crutches is a rare boost in this disastrous Summer period.

Only downside is we won't be able to loan or sell him now, we're stuck paying him £120,000 a week to do f*ck all.

454~~~
Yeah reading reports of him being in crutches today.

Goal.com

455~~~
Anyone know how long he's out for?

456~~~
Rafa did sign Aquilani so there is still hope that he will bring in a crock...

457~~~
he's fecking shite. feck off.

458~~~
Nice

459~~~
Oh, come on! Why now when Napoli were so close to taking him off our shoulders.

460~~~
Aw, come on. Our injuries just keep piling up.

461~~~
As much as Blackett had Sigurdsson at that point, he did right not to move from his position once Sig moves back which was the right choice. However I have a big issue with Fletcher at this point, he came running into the box the stops, at this point he should have moved towords Sigurdsson and covered him. He never did. I can't blame Blackett for the goal.

*edit* Just re-read and you seem to agree that Fletcher was at fault. I agree.

462~~~
FFS, if he was about to be loaned, why have him train?

463~~~
He seems to have a black cloud following him around these days.

464~~~
I don't fecking know man.

Do you maybe know if Vidal, di Maria, Hummels and Benatia are training with us already? Because, just like Fellaini's loan, it was stated on twitter. Must be true then.

465~~~
Fletcher is the defensive midfielder who just allowed a Swansea player to sit free on our penalty spot, his position leading up to that goal didn't benefit us in any way whatsoever.

466~~~
Pretty sure that's his hair.

467~~~
You beat me to it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

468~~~
Doesn't make alot of difference he wasn't going to be sold anyway as we seem a bit crap at that.

By all account we were going to pay a fair wedge of his wages too, feck these tight clubs taking the micky, we'll patch him up & flog him in January for real money (maybe just not alot of it).

469~~~
Well played, sir! Fellaini also nominated David Moyes in his ice waterfall challenge thing which I thought was a bit funny.

470~~~
Funny thing is that when Swansea got a free kick further out which led to the goal , Blackett played the ball to them when the referee gave them the free kick. A more experienced player would leave the ball alone at that point and maybe things wopuld have turned out differently. Such small details that affects the game

471~~~
Please say he's leaving?

472~~~
He injured his ankle in training and could be out for a while. I don't think he is going anywhere anytime soon.

473~~~
Do people really think crap like this is ok? 
I know there's differing opinions but being happy one of our own players is injured, really?

474~~~
Looks like he'll be staying now he's injured.

475~~~
What was Young doing?? The most amateur mistake I see in that box that opens the whole opportunity for the goal.

476~~~
He's not a fullback though. Classic 'not a fullback mistake' leaving his man.
Have you not seen the state of some users in this thread?...

477~~~
It's so sad he got injured, now we can't get rid of him and have to pay his wages.

478~~~
You got it half right.

479~~~
Am I supposed to feel sorry for a useless thug who "earns" £120,000 a week and seems to try his best to get sent off every time he gets on the pitch? He's harming the club and the further we can keep him away the better.

480~~~
It's pathetic - best to ignore idiots like that

481~~~
Talk about an extremely bad timing, that injury really comes at the worst time in the current context where we are trying to offload him for a while and then make way for better players.

482~~~
It's called experience, some thing Blackett currently lacks but which his teammates have oodles of, one of which was Fletcher. However Blackett looked better than a lot of his teammates in the game.

483~~~
According to a Belgian journalist, his injury probably won't keep him out for long.
New tests have not shown any ligament damage. Still not entirely certain though.

484~~~
He was out for weeks last year with a wrist injury.

485~~~
Has looked pretty good imo with his cameo's, we dont have many midfielders atm, would keep him.

486~~~
the only thing that makes Fellaini more useless is him not being able to play.

487~~~
You must be a real joy to watch football with.

488~~~
Obviously a fairly nasty wrist injury. Unless you think he was malingering?

489~~~
He was carrying a back injury too. I think that hampered him most, particularly his movement. I hope he isn't out for too long.

490~~~
This relaxation over players like him and Cleverley is why we're in decline.

491~~~
No it isn't.

492~~~
It isn't the primary reason but it sure is a contributing factor.

493~~~
Someone please take him.

494~~~
The fans getting behind players in the team rather than verbally abusing them at every opportunity, desperately trying to convince everyone that they are awful and can't play football is a contributing factor?.. Okay then.

495~~~
I guess Fellaini will lead us back into the CL. We don't need or want players like Vidal!

496~~~
They might, if you are<i> prepared</i> to give them a chance. What more can you do?

497~~~
A chance to do what? To prove what everyone knows, that they are not good enough? We're giving turds chances while our rivals are buying real quality players. This is why we keep falling behind. Fellaini is 27 in three months, Cleverley is 25. These players have shown nothing to suggest they'll ever drastically improve this team.

498~~~
Well, dealing with absolutes won't get you very far. So, what if Vidal comes in and gets injured? Or performs poorly? Do we just spout the same rhetoric over and over until we sign a player who comes good? Players grow, adapt and change all the time. I see a clear fan disconnect when dealing with absolutes. You feel they have nothing to give or to prove but it isn't because they don't, it's because you desperately don't want to see it. You'd rather have your team play badly just so you can tell everyone how terrible the players are.

Grim.

499~~~
Thank feck his injury is not serious. Just get him out of here so we can bring in someone.

500~~~
Fellaini could come in very handy as a second striker in Carling cup games to give Rooney a rest etc...As a second Striker Fellaini is awesome for a long ball team and he would kick lumps out of the opposition in the Carling Cup games....but the best scenario for Fellaini and the club is for him to get a move as far away from the club as possible to some mid table long ball team where he will be worshiped again....he needs to get that loan move so that we can recuperate some of the astronomical dosh we spent on him next summer

501~~~
Nope. You're far from the truth. I was one of Cleverley's biggest advocates and now I know how to manage my expectations with him. Fellaini on the other hand i've never rated, and his performances have done nothing but vindicate my initial reservations about his signing. If these guys have something to give its very little, and not near good enough for what a club of this stature needs.

502~~~
Absolute fact. People making excuses for this kind of average midfielder is exactly the problem.

503~~~
Spot on. I've mentioned many times in the other Fellaini thread, look at the midfielders I've grown up watching - Robson, Ince, Scholes, Keane, Beckham. That's the level we need to strive for. Not "Ah sure, Fellaini might actually come good". No, we need players who simply are good enough. Fellaini can loiter around for a squad player (personally I'd rather we sold him for 12-15 million and re-invested that money) but he's not a good enough central midfielder to be a regular starter for a team that wishes to get back to glory days, as we supposedly do.

504~~~
It's not fact at all, merely hysterical fan myths in desperate attempts to justify their opinion on a player.

505~~~
So, you think fellaini is up there with the level of midfielder I mention above? Look at the midfield talent of recent championship winning sides. You won't find many playing players of his calibre.

506~~~
Up there with past United legends? I suppose now every single player we have is supposed to be of that standard then?

507~~~
Still can't believe he's a United player.........A £27 million United player.

Grim!

508~~~
Those players aren't earning £125,000 a week though (well apart from Ashley but the supporters' disenchantment with him is well documented). The performance to expenditure ratio is unjustifiable here.

509~~~
You're a Scouser are you not?!

510~~~
He's a scouser......Look at the name

511~~~
There is a big jump between feeling happy and sorry. You're not bipolar are you ?

512~~~
No I am not...?
It makes no difference what he earns, unless the club is going under and needs to get his wage off the books for fear of bankruptcy (which they would, and/or would have) then I think it's a non point. Especially in a 'performance to wage' scenario which is in itself laughable garbage.

513~~~
You sure?!.....Someone else, who is a Liverpool fan on here, has pretty much the same username.

Makes no odds to me if you are or not

514~~~
Great minds think alike, fools never differ?

515~~~
As an aside, by selling Fellaini now United could probably recoup :

125 x 52.25 x 4yrs = £26 million in wages.
£15 million transfer fee.

So around £41 million in total.

Adding just £10 million to that we could sign Sami Khedira - a proven, world cup winning box-to-box midfielder :

150 (his wage demands) x 52.25 x 4yrs = £31 million in wages.
£20 million transfer fee - this is the upper estimate mind, could be significantly lower.

Or we could give De Gea a fresh contract on par with Neuer (he currently earns £52,000 while Neuer is on £105,000) ensuring he's at the club till 2024. Now that would be money well spent.

516~~~
Very good....I'll give you 7/10

517~~~
Good hypothetical math there.

518~~~
Exactly this. Some people need to get off their high horses about certain players who will never make it at this club or any other big club.

Thats what you think. You can't lump all of us who criticize those players in the same group. The fact is Fellaini will never be good enough for United. He's 27 FFS. Don't you recognize a good/bad player when you see one? It slaps you in the face every time he puts on a red shirt but you refuse to see it. 'Give him more chances, he'll come good'. In the meantime he's one of the highest earners on the team and not measuring up on the pitch. This is the same mentality some have had towards Nani and Anderson even when it was painfully clear that they'd never live up to their price tags. People like you will persist with mediocrity for several seasons and continue to make silly attempts to belittle those who call a turd a fvcking turd. Fellaini is shit! He's on his way out.

519~~~
I think a fit Fellaini playing as a CM and not being given license to just run up-field for long balls would improve our midfield. Is he at the caliber of Vidal and the others? No. But neither are Fletcher, Cleverley or Anderson (who I think are further away from that level than Fellaini). So i'd get rid of those three before Fellaini.

520~~~
Uhh, are people not making themselves clear?  Get rid.  Quickly.  Giving players like him a chance is how/why we found ourselves in 7th last season.  Well that, and Moyes.

521~~~
Jesus, guys, do you know what 'fact' actually means?

522~~~
It's not what I think. The guy is a professional footballer getting payed to play football. He's done it nearly his whole adult life. That is a fact. Whether or not you think he's good enough isn't fact but a possibility whether you like it or not. If he's not given the chance to prove that he's good enough then it fits with your negative bitter rhetoric of 'NOT GOOD ENOUGH GET RID'. Which not everyone is advocating. As you can see there are some people who are happy to be patient and see what happens. It means absolutely nothing that some random fans around the globe actually might think he can improve on his time to date at United given the chance. Shocker. His wages mean absolutely nothing as well, if the club didn't think that over the life of the contract they would be able to afford it then they wouldn't have paid it. If they are in a bind financially and can't afford to keep him then I am sure he would have been offloaded by now.

Football management and squad harmony isn't as cut and dry as 'get rid of this, move this guy along that' as it is plainly obvious with some of the players you mention. You need to just calm down and realize that whether or not you think players are good enough isn't the be all and end all. Just because you say it, it doesn't make it so.

People like me?... People who don't throw toys out of the pram when the big money signing isn't delivered by the manager and fill pages and pages of a forum ranting and carrying on about how terrible our players are? Get a grip you wally, support the players and the team and you might just get a bit of a enjoyment out of supporting United. You're incredibly bitter.

523~~~
What did I just read ? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

524~~~
Em, I certainly think those are the calibre of players we should aim for, yes. You think we should settle for less? I think we should be after the level s Of players who will help us win titles and progress in europe. Where does it end if we start to settle now? So now, we go a few levels lower than those guys (which fellaini definitely is). That generation Lasts a few years. Then we start biting guys  level lower than fellaini. People like you justify it "Does every  player have to be as good as fellaini?" and on goes the circle as we slip further into mediocrity

525~~~
I agree that none of those are particularly useful but I think fletch is at least on a par with him and I think cleverley, who I don't rate highly is better. But to be honest, we should not be arguing about the merits of such average players, not if we ever want to get back to winning titles.

526~~~
Apparently we've dodged a real bullet, let's take advantage of our luck (for once) and ship him out.

527~~~
I can't help but notice how three successive posters from Australia have spent so much time defending a player who looks so much like a fish out of water at United..Maybe his roughhouse style goes down well among fans of NRL and AFL.

528~~~
Nah man, <b>people like you</b> who accept rubbish and chastise the rest of us who don't kinda grind my gears. Manucho, Bellion, Djemba-Djemba, Liam Miller, Obertan, Kleberson, Ralph Milne, Darren Ferguson, Jordi Cruyff, Porborsky, Forlan, Diouf..whats the difference with these players and Fellaini except the fact we paid a shitload for him? Some of them were signed with bigger reputations than Fellaini but they just couldn't cut it at United and it was painfully evident regardless of how talented some of them were. It matters how much a player is paid, good players get paid well to do a job and to do it well, Fellaini's performances don't reflect his salary.  <b>Get a grip you say? </b>Why don't you get one instead and realize this guy is a serious misfit at United? I bet you'd have given Moyes another season as well. Fellaini is shit, he's on his way out.

529~~~
Hahahah wow check you out all mad. Your nuts pal. Totally bonkers.

Regardless of there location, it's great to see some people defending him.

530~~~
Not mad at all...and everything I stated in the post is the reality of the situation. You must be another Fellaini sympathizer.

531~~~
Regardless of there location, it's grae
Good reply though, you expressed you point well. I like Fellaini, so that in my head rules him out from leaving.

532~~~
I guess you'll just have to deal with it when he does leave.

533~~~
As regards location, I was just pointing out the remarkable coincidence. I lived in Sydney for a couple of years and don't recall a huge community of Belgians or indeed Moroccans.

534~~~
No, I think it was just that those aussies probs were more patient with Fellaini ?

535~~~
After 6 years of playing in the premier league and never looking like a United player (despite the odd time he bullied our makeshift defence)? And after looking second-rate in the World Cup? Maybe...

536~~~
'Fellaini sympathizer'

Deary me, is this the new Moyes Apologist? I don't understand why posters have to come up with these ridiculous labels. Can't someone just disagree with you without falling into a group?

Im a Fellaini-afto-admirer-who-is-not-sure-he's-good-enough-but-thinks-he-might-be-an-okay-option-from-the-bench-er.

Hmm not quite as catchy!!

537~~~
Yep, that's it...you caught us out <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

538~~~
Yet you don't mention the poster I was responding to lumping me in the group of 'negative' and 'bitter' people who want to be right and see Fellaini fail. Rich

539~~~
I wasn't referring to you (didn't even know you were from Australia). I am fine with people defending Fellaini, I just find it strange how certain people (two now banned) have devoted around 80% plus of their posts to this one topic. I mean, whether he stays or goes, it's not that critical to the future of the club, and, in terms of his status in the pantheon, it's not as though people are criticising Bobby Charlton or Eric Cantona.

540~~~
Yeah...i wonder why people are not able to calm down over this. I made up.my mind about ages ago. I post about him once in a while.

541~~~
It's not even a case of defending Fellaini though. Saying 'look we're light in midfield and he can bounce back and give at least something, surely the start he's had can be made better if we give him time' isn't defending him. There is only one group trying desperately to convince people that their reasoning behind why they think he's shite is gospel. Whatever people think positive or negative the guy is a United player for now and there is no point getting all upset about it. It literally makes no difference to anything to go losing your rag about your own players.

That is personally what I find very strange. Personal crusades against certain players as if everyone feels the same way and thus must be in on the little 'lets all hate on Fellaini' bandwagon.

That and nearly every proper conversation broken up by 'hi my names UnitedfanBusby101 and I think Fellaini is shite and will never be good enough is he sold yet? thanks for reading please by vidal'.

542~~~
Fingers crossed we can get close to half our money back for him.

543~~~
I wouldn't really mind if we kept Fellaini in the squad. We've had a number of players like him in the past, ie honest hardworking lads who weren't particularly good in football. One can make a list of these players (at United we always had a surplus of them) from OShea to Philip Neville right to Nicky Butt and the new MUTV Legend Quinton Fortune. The trouble is that Fellaini happens to be paid as a first teamer and that's a hell of a lot of money.

Some may close an eye to that but honestly we shouldn't. First team players are highly paid employees and a club can afford a very limited number of them. If they aren't good enough then they are probably blocking the way for other players to come at the club. Also they may have some nasty clauses in their contract which makes them earn more money if they aren't played. Some will probably laugh at this but it may really be the case that our inability to offload the long ball merchant may be the reason why we're not able to land a quality DM. As Lou Macari said (and this happens in many other clubs who dont have infinite funds such as Shitty) we've well overstaffed in CM and we probably have to get rid of players before we can add to more.

Not to forget the psychological effect of keeping sub standard players have on the people around him. What message does it give to other players the fact that United are keeping, on top dollar, a player whose clearly not good enough?

544~~~
Nicky Butt was a much better player than Felliani, I would swap Felliani for Nicky in a heartbeat, he's just what we need. 

We don't need him in an attacking or creative role so it's all down to his defensive abilities and aside from adding height in the box at set pieces he isn't up to scratch. He never picks up runners and ends up in useless positions. Playing three at the back means whoever is going to be our defensive midfielder will need to be top class.

545~~~
Why are we signing more players for the first team a la Shaw, Herrera, Mata etc if Fellaini's fan murdering wages are to high? These arguments literally make no sense. People arguing over hypothetical situations that don't effect them in the slightest.
I am literally laughing. It makes no sense at all we've spent shit loads of money since we signed him - get used to it. This signing has not broken the books at United. Continuing to argue about his wage and squad status is reaching of epic proportions.
'Top dollar'......?

546~~~
He's a liability in midfield. Hope he goes

547~~~
People hate on him way too much

548~~~
You're really disrespecting those legends by comparing them to Fellaini. You really are. 
Nicky Butt, Phil Neville and Fortune were all better than Fellaini

549~~~
I have been around here long enough not to involve myself in discussions about the so called legends. Players who should thank their lucky stars that they found themselves at OT as they would win jack shit elsewhere. The internet is one beautiful invention and everyone can check for himself what these great players did when they couldn't rely on the quality players United had during their era. Nicky Butt went to Newcastle were he was pushed down the pecking order by magificent talent of Parker, Faye and Emre, Quinton 'the legend' Fortune was picked up from the mighty Atletico Madrid B side and then he ended up his career at Bolton. Philip Neville on the other hand did fairly well at Everton (I still think it was a shame that we allowed him to go). However none of them had a career that was even close to that of Fellaini at Everton.


The difference between Fellaini and the former players are two

a) the former were reserves and they were paid as so. Fellaini was brought to be a first teamer, he's paid like one (salary is nowadays the biggest expenditure and not the fee)

b) Fellaini lacks the skill set needed to be useful at United. For example Philip Neville would run and tackle all day. He was a great marker and he could cover a number of positions. Fellaini is a long ball merchant whose not particularly good unless you play him as no 10 and have him showered with crosses. That's not what United way

550~~~
Honestly, how many ex United players, non youth, went on to have better careers at other teams? Forlan? Fellaini will NEVER contribute to United what those legends did. Never. The guy is going to be sold to shite serie A

551~~~
Great players remained great even when they left United. The likes of Beckham, RVN and Ronaldo had a great career away from United. I guess is one got talent then he's able to show it even when there's no Roy Keane covering your arse and Paul Scholes create wonders out of nowhere. 

However that's not the point. No one is saying that players should have a better career when leaving United. What I am saying is that its very easy to look good when you're playing in a star studded side lead by a genius. It happened to many players even in other clubs (ex Rossi at AC Milan who still retain the Serie A record for clean sheets).

True worth is shown when the player is expected to be a protagonist to the side rather then piggy bank on the talent of others. There again, as said, I've learnt long ago not to put in doubt the 'legends' talent.

552~~~
We miss him.

553~~~
You don't get the point. RVN, Becks and Ronaldo maintained the stat Quo. Great at United and great at other sides. You make it sound like Fortune, O'Shea, Neville and Butt just got in where they fitted, just blended in and hid behind great players. If they were so bad they would never had got as many games as they did at United. Each of those players had several MOTM performances for United even when it mattered. You don't have to consider them legends, that's another debate, but they were great servants to the club. You're seriously downplaying them. Piggy bank on the talents of others, my word!

554~~~
That's exactly what they did. SAF was a master of these things. He would get 3-5 World class players and then fill the rest of the teams with normal ones whose characteristics allowed the others to focus on their job and do the damage. Take for example Ronaldo. The boy was an absolute genius however he wasn't keen to backtrack. To counter for that SAF brought Tevez and Park whom, alongside Rooney, Fletcher and Carrick provided the necessary steel for Ronaldo and an ageing Scholes/Giggs to focus on their job.

Quinton Fortune, Phil Neville, Butt and OShea weren't United quality. That was clearly before and/or after leaving United. However they were cheap (in terms of both fee and salary) and fitted in SAF's plan. When things got tough, SAF could bring these players in because he knew that they would close the gaps and keep the fort safe. If injury hit the club, rest assured that OShea or Philip Neville would give their 100% irrespective if they are played out of position. If the team was fully fit, rest assured that they will sit on the bench without complaining. However dont think for one second that these players could have won anything without the WC players. In fact when the time came for them to become protagonists at another club many failed to match the hype surrounding them. Also note that when they start losing their work rate they were shown the door. Scholes and Giggs remained at OT until they became ancient. The likes of Park, Phil Nev, OShea, Fortune etc werent given that luxury because once the work rate starting to decline they had little else to offer.

Fellaini can't take that role. The man doesn't have the versatility those players have and he's paid on top salary. His best position is that of no 10 (and in that role he had done pretty well at Everton) but that means leaving Mata/Kagawa/Januzaj out and play a football style that is unsuited for their game.

555~~~
For crying out loud, we get it - you don't think he's good enough. Stop hooting it out at the top of your lungs trying to make the point every time it's brought up.

556~~~
Not sure if this was sarcastic but he's certainly better than Cleverley and Fletcher.

557~~~
Not as a CM or CDM he sure isnt.
id take fletch over fellaini anyday.

558~~~
NO

559~~~
This is a clear example of the way United fans overreact after a poor performance. No one in their right mind will say that he is a better footballer than Fletcher, he just isn't and really as much as football is about opinions, it's not really up for a debate. I know we are disappointed with Fletcher's performance but we don't need people saying bloody Fellaini is a better footballer.

560~~~
I'm sorry but I can't believe people would still take Fletcher or Cleverley over Fellaini. No way would a fit Fellaini ever play <i>that </i>badly, especially against a low opposition (who he has actually performed well against). At this point in his career, he is a better player than Fletcher. I know people will disagree, and that's fine, but after that horrendous midfield showing my mind won't be changed.

561~~~
He played that badly all last season.

562~~~
He really didn't.

563~~~
The guy has no future at United

564~~~
That remains to be seen for me. I would just prefer him to Fletcher and Cleverley. Although Fellaini struggled against the top sides, he did look comfortable against the mid-lower teams in the EPL. The other two don't even look comfortable against them anymore.

565~~~
hes pony. He couldn't lace the boots of most our former midfielders.

566~~~
Well Napoli are in for him. For the right price he'll be gone sharpish.  He was only sharp last season against Crystal Palace twice and against Leverkusen. When up against stand offish teams he looks decent, but against teams that apply pressure (which these days is every other EPL team) and deny him space we see him for what he truly is, a limited pretender.

567~~~
Seems the Napoli rumours were just that and fizzled out. Looks like he's staying then?

568~~~
he is injured, thats the problem apparently

569~~~
They're out of the Champions League too, that can't have helped their cash situation.

570~~~
Luckiest man alive right now, has an injury just before deadline day and saved from the chop

571~~~
Still half an hour to go...

Seriously, though - he ain't lucky at all if he's as bad as people claim. Because if he is, then LVG won't play him. And then he'll be rotting in the reserves. Fellaini, everything else notwithstanding, doesn't strike me as the type who'd be happy stealing a living. I think he wants to play first team football and prove himself.

572~~~
He probably pushed himself down the stairs.

573~~~

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Fellaini set for shock place in Manchester United team, Van Gaal relies on him</b></span>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/fellaini-set-for-shock-place-in-manchester-united-team-van-gaal-r" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/...ck-place-in-manchester-united-team-van-gaal-r</a>

575~~~
I hope he loses that reliance very quickly, as Fellaini simply isn't good enough.

576~~~
Would be intriguing to see how Van Gaal would deploy him. 

I suspect its bollocks but we'll have to wait and see.

577~~~
Probably nonsense. I hope it is true though, because I hold that opinion.

578~~~
Off the bench at most.

Lets be real here

He couldn't play the 10 role before because we had Mata and Rooney who wanted to play there and RVP and other strikers to fit in too. We now still have Mata and Rooney, Ander who played the 10 last year and Falcao.

Fellaini is probably even further away from playing his best position now because we improved the quality of our front players even if we have less of them. He's not getting in front of any of them.

In midfield we have our record signing Di Maria, Ander who is better than Fellaini at everything bar heading and maybe tackling (both too rash) and Blind who will do a miles better job sitting in midfield and adding defensive cover.

579~~~
Maybe its just a Belgian newspaper trying to sell copies to Belgians by talking-up a Belgian.

580~~~
I can see Fellaini sticking around for quite a while, though not featuring that often. At the end of this season Carrick, Fletcher and Anderson are all out of contract; right now it looks far more likely that each will go rather than stay. While it is highly likely that a high profile midfielder will arrive, there would still be a need for a squad player in case of injuries. None of the reserve team midfielders are close to making a breakthrough at the moment.

581~~~
Transfer window is shut now and there is no point in kicking him out of the squad when we're still paying him a wage and he still has transfer value. He was clearly told he could leave pre-injury and it meant that he survived the cull, now Van Gaal has to keep him sweet until the next transfer window opens. He'll be gone in January.

582~~~
I can't really judge anyone based on last season alone. Everything at the club was a complete clusterfeck. If he's as bad this season as he was in the previous, he deserves all the shtick he's getting. Until then, I don't think it's fair to say anything conclusive about what happened under Moyes because everything was just utter chaos and upheaval. Imagine arriving and having to settle under those conditions. Even Mata, one of the very best players in the league, was far from brilliant.

583~~~
Exactly, we'd be shot of him to Napoli now if he hadn't hurt his foot, once January hits I'm sure we'll finally be rid of him.

584~~~
Is that you, Shteve?

585~~~
I don't know what you're inshinuating.

586~~~
Only reason he is still around is because of his injury and the difficulty in getting someone to take him off our hands but he is still here and it would be short sighted of LVG to dismiss him as we may need him at some point. Having said that I don’t think he will get many opportunities and given his lack of form and confidence the chances of him making an impact are pretty small unless we have lots of injuries. It might be harsh but his best chance to make it here was last season; he had a manager who rated him highly, limited competition and a style of play more suited to his game. He is in a similar position to Cleverley in that he has a lot to prove but will struggle to actually get many chances because he is well down the pecking order, we don’t have many games and from the players that have been brought in (and probably more to come) it is clear LVG doesn’t rate him that highly.

I would be amazed if he is still here this time next year and I think we could easily end up losing £20m when we do eventually manage to sell him.

587~~~
Well that's our midfield taken care of then.

588~~~
Most likely we'll move Fellaini on at that point because why keep someone on high wages as a squad player? We'll get a squad player for that

589~~~
He would be very difficult to replace as our human victory cigar were he to move on.  Was made for the role, really...

590~~~
I'd actually forgotten about him ha 

But yeah, we'll need someone to take Welbeck's place on the bench. Vital role

591~~~
He did okay, maybe even well against the lower ranked opposition. He didn't look out of place and looked quite good at times. Against the top sides, he got exposed, clearly not that level of player but I think he's decent enough cover to play against some of the weaker opposition from time to time. I certainly prefer him as an option to Fletcher and Anderson.

592~~~
He wasnt even that shite, every time he makes a bad dribble/pass it gets 'vined' and go on about how he is shite, even though he hasnt played much for us, he was better than lets say Carrick last season, or Fletcher.

593~~~
I'm willing to give him a chance. If LVG thinks he can use him, then great, but if he's still crap then I'm sure he'll be on his way. It's a win-win situation for us.

594~~~
He's better than fletcher and cleverely. which makes him our 3rd best central midfielder. shocking as that is.

EDIT forgot blind feck.

595~~~
Yep he's never been awful and already there's been players this season who have put in performances way worst than anything Fellaini done at United.

Cough Darren Fletcher Cough .

You never know how things will work out in football but at the moment he's at the very least a plan b. A big and hairy plan but a plan none the less.

596~~~
Can he play CB?

597~~~
Cleverley plays for Aston Villa.

Herrera, Blind, Carrick, Di Maria, Fletcher =/= Fellaini,<span style="color: #ffffff">__________________________________________________________________________________</span><span style="color: #000000">Anderson</span>

598~~~
I have seen this question before and normally the first thought is penalty.

599~~~
Seems like a bad idea to play someone who has no idea about marking, tracking or positioning as a CB

He'd clear some crosses out though

600~~~
He was poor last season, he did have three or four decent games but most of the time he looked completely lost and even when he was fit he wasn't first choice even for moyes. I don't think he was better than carrick or fletcher and they both had bad seasons as well but his problem now is carrick, blind, Herrera and di Maria are all ahead of him so it might be a while before he gets to start a game.

Impact sub is probably going to be his main role and then he will be loaned out or sold in January to make way for strootman unless he somehow manages to force his way into the team.

601~~~
I knew LVG will love Fellaini. He is complete target man, the best in the game. He is big and strong, have very good first touch and vision, he is the best header in the game and his chest control is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. One of the best players and massively underated.<span style="color: #ffffff"> Just joking, he so bad that i don't want to see him in United shirt again. Even his "chest control" and areial play was bad last season.</span>

602~~~
Yea if it was oppisite opposite day

603~~~
I would not take either, even if someone give me a choice, there is no option, all of them should be gone

604~~~
Is he feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

605~~~
I can't see him ever breaking into our first XI but I can see him being the first in line for the box-to-box roles in a midfield diamond if Di Maria or Herrera are out.

606~~~
Jamie Jackson on Guardian today:

Very happy with his attitude and Im certain we have not seen the best of him in a Unites shirt yet.  Would have been great if Welbeck could have shown the same appetite.  

For so many reasons, some of them not of his own doing, Fellaini had a shocking season last year, it simply cant get worse.  With some encouragement and clear instructions upon his role and what is expected of him, Im sure fellani can do a job for us.  

Given that we are anyway lacking in the middle with an injured Carrick, an ineffective Fletcher and a useless Anderson, we could anyway do with the cover.

608~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Honestly, people cry about the entire Caf mourning Welbeck and then we've got to read the same inane bollocks about how he now "hasn't got the appetite." fecking hell, it's horseshit.

It has nothing to do with Fellaini either. And as for his attitude, ay it's cracking. I've been fair to him as a player here and as a central midfielder at Everton, but he's just waiting around on a once in a lifetime wage to get hoyed out, and I struggle to see the nobility in that.

609~~~
I never mourned Welbeck one bit.  Always thought he was either over rated or not yet fully developed his potential.  Likewise, I'd have preferred he stuck around and proved his worth via performances and not as a virtue of his birthright!  

Anyways - this thread is not about Welbeck, its about Fellaini, and Im happy with his attitude to fight for the right to play.

610~~~
I didn't come here to discuss Welbeck. But on your final point, I have more respect for footballers that know when they're not wanted and actively pursue the opportunity to get minutes. Cleverley was crucified for what seemed like turning down the chance to play at a good club like Villa and rightfully so. He isn't here now and it's a good thing for his career.

Fellaini is a better player and is understandably, possibly, more wanted by the manager, but I struggle to see a future for him here given his wages and standing in the pecking order. He'll get another year then I expect him to leave. Fourth and fifth choice midfielders don't earn triple figure sums.

611~~~
It's just standard footballer talk, he'll be off in January if we can manage to find a taker.

612~~~
Well, at least he's got the right attitude, if not the talent.

613~~~
I seriously think that LVG will turn to him in the final few minutes of games if we are pushing for a win, as he did with Huntelaar in the World Cup. He already tried it against Swansea.

Not saying I approve of the tactic but I can see it happening.

614~~~
Its depressing that we havent gotten rid of him yet.
He, Young and Anderson disgust me.

615~~~
Why the hell would we turn to Fellaini as an impact sub, when on most occasions the bench will probably comprise of Januzaj, van Persie/Mata and Wilson. Far more dangerous players in an attacking sense and it means we don't have to resort to long punts up the pitch in search of victory. No doubt, van Gaal would favour an alternative approach to the long-ball game.

616~~~
Really? Fecking hell the things that disgust me dont involve footballers who dont live up to expectations! Think you need some perspective in life!

617~~~
He did it at the world cup.

618~~~
Respect for players who want to leave the club because the fans don't want them and are giving them a hard time? I'd fecking detest any Untied player who shits himself because the fans are giving him a hard time. If LVG has said he has a place in the team, and as a plan B I don't see why not, him wanting to move forward is exactly the right thing he should be thinking.

619~~~
He may or may not prove himself worthy of a place at United, but I can't say he's ever given me a reason to doubt his professionalism, and for that reason I don't begrudge him his wages, nor his decision to stay and fight for a spot. He signed a contract, he's doing what's best for his life and family. Fair fecks to him, if we have bad feelings about the money "wasted" on him we shouldn't have signed him in the first place. 

On the other hand I can respect Welbeck for pushing a move to a big club where he is guaranteed a genuine chance in his proper position to fight for a starting position. It depends on the specific player's circumstance.

620~~~
It disgusts me as well. Fvck Felliani!

I'd rather give Powelll a chance in midfield than make do with toilet brush

621~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

622~~~
Perhaps we could give him a full season under a competent manager before we write him off as <i>disgusting</i>, or whatever. I don't think he got a fair crack of the whip, as the whole team bar DDG was shite last season.

Give the big lunatic a chance.

623~~~
I'm willing to give him a clean slate for this season. I've said my bit about him before but I guess he deserves at least one more chance.

624~~~
The fans have nothing to do with it. It was Van Gaal who told Cleverley he would struggle for minutes and that he could leave. I'd sooner see him do that than sit on his arse like Ando and I'm sure you would too. I still believe that Fellaini would have been on his way had he not succumbed to injury, albeit that's just a theory.

Either way, all I'm saying is that I don't think Fellaini's attitude is any more noble than any other player, whether they have left the club or not.

625~~~
It will be interesting to see what happens. If Strootman is signed in January then that would change the whole dynamic too. Glad he wants to stay and fight for a spot though. Too harshly judged on here.

626~~~
I loved him when he was at Everton- obviously, he's been found out technically with United but I still think he can do a job for us.

627~~~
watching him play football makes me sad.

Nude photos? Interesting international break. Doesn't sound like that previous article about LvG "needing" him was accurate - not that that is a shock.

629~~~
He will either become a first team starter under LVG or he'll leave in the coming windows on loan or permanently. 

Bought as our record signing at the time, he'll have wages to reflect that and if LVG wants more faces coming in like this summer, he'll be getting rid of players on wages like Fellaini's to make room for them. Thats just how it is with expensive buys, they are paid well for the pressures of living up to their pricetag and if they come nowhere close like Fellaini has its going to be a problem. He's certainly capable of being a squad player but he'll be getting paid twice as much as a squad player and at some point something will have to give.

I expect he'll go out on loan in Jan or next summer as the months tick down on his long contract. Then in a year to 18 months time when he still isn't in our first team plans and his contract is down to 3 years or so we'll eventually bite the bullet and accept low offers for him and he'll find somewhere he can start each week.

632~~~
As much as I don't like him, he's saying the right stuff. He can do a job, for now. Said last summer I would have welcomed the signing should another midfielder be brought in beside him. Anyway, he's no worse than Fletcher or Anderson. He's behind Herrera, di Maria, Blind and Carrick though.

633~~~
I swear he never picked up this many injuries playing for Everton.

634~~~
One has to seriously question the proficiency of the medical staff. Ourselves and Arsenal are the worst when it comes to dealing with player fitness in the whole league - despite splurging millions on cutting edge rehab facilities and partnering up with Toshiba. Reckon these mass recurrences cost us atleast a dozen points each season.

635~~~
Reading between the lines it seems LVG has told him he won’t be playing but he can fight for a place and fair play to Fellaini he wants to try. He probably realises he will have to take a big step down if he leaves so he may as well give it a go, he got injured at a bad time though because by the time he is fit so is everyone else and it might be a while before he gets a chance in the first team or possibly he might not even get a chance and go in January. Ultimately I think he is doomed and it is a case of when not if he goes because to get the best out of him he needs to play in an advanced role or in a midfield three where he is the player with the most freedom and I do not see that happening here. 

I know there is an argument he can do as a defensive midfielder but I think he needs a lot of games there to improve his positioning, discipline and tackling and I don’t think he will get the chance nor can we afford to really give him it. And let’s be honest no matter how good or bad a player anyone thinks he is at his best making a nuisance of himself, using his physicality and aerial ability in or around the opponents box and as a defensive player he won’t get much chance to do that.

636~~~
Same can be said about every player that has joined us. We must be cursed.

637~~~
His future will be decided by the end of January. Either he'll play himself into LVG's plans or he'll leave for a decent but not top tier club. I think the latter scenario is more likely but, in any case, I see him as someone with pride and self-respect and can't imagine him doing a Bogarde (or an Ando, as it should now be called).

638~~~
A good summary. I think he may stick around for quite a while. From what Phil Neville said in one interview, Fellaini and his father regarded the move as achieving one of his ambitions, so I can't imagine he will want to go unless it is clear-cut that he won't feature in the medium term. With Fletcher, Anderson and Carrick all out of contract in the summer 2015, a squad place might well be available next season. His wages are out of line with his current standing, which would be problematic for any clubs interested in buying him.

639~~~
I believe that Napoli ridiculous demands were the reason why Fellaini didn't move. For such conditions (a loan with right to buy him up  for half the fee we bought him in the first place + we have to pay much of his salary) its only natural that the club refused to let him go.

640~~~
Whats ridiculous about that?

Napoli were the only club that showed any real interest. He didn't play well enough to justify paying half what we paid for him and he's on wages to reflect being our record signing last summer.

He only stayed because he got injured. Loaning him out makes more sense than loaning Nani

641~~~
I agree and personally, all this his professionalism he is showing blah blah blh, rubbish. He is playing well above his level and on massive wages. Id respect him mor eif he moved on, one of the worst signings in terms of fee, talent and suitability to our side we have ever made. I dont really blame him for that, he was to me at least totally the wrong player for us to sign, a Moyes master mong move.

642~~~
According to some sources he makes less than Nani.

Disregarding both salaries and injuries for the moment, Nani wasn't happy in Manchester. Fellaini apparently is. He wants to prove himself. Well, let him try, then. If he is as laughably inept as his most vocal detractors insist, he'll be found out and shipped out soon enough.

643~~~
That sounds ridiculous

Wouldnt you just fire your agent on the spot if a club wants to pay near £30 million for you and you were going to be paid as much as a squad player? All that pressure of being the record signing and you dont get compensated? Yeah right. He'll obviously be paid towards the upper bracket of our players and way more than Nani, who's contract we didnt extend for ages - it would have gone really fast if we had been willing to pay him a lot.

And you cant blame Fellaini for that, he'll obviously take whatever wages his agent can get him and he probably wouldnt want to leave after only a year, getting paid well and he will still believe he can prove a success here. I mean if he doesnt believe that, nobody will.

644~~~
I don't know, man. I don't have access to the actual numbers. But according to some Fellaini's wage boost wasn't immense from what he made at Everton. And according to some Nani is on a hundred grand plus per week. I have no idea if it's true. 

Seems moot regardless, doesn't it? If the sole reason Napoli didn't want him on loan was the fact that he got himself injured, then his salary can't be a problem for them, can it?

645~~~
We would have paid a lot of his wages like we did with Nani. Thats only to be expected when you loan out an expensive player

If he did well theres the chance they'd take him off the books completely

646~~~
A quick google search has brought up that Nani is on 100k and Fellaini 90k so he earns less.

647~~~
Well, Nani still has done more for this club than Fellaini ever will, so who cares if Nani earns a bit more.

Pls just tell me once Fellaini scores an important goal for us, wins us 3 points (or even one) or scores a penalty in a CL final shoot out under pressure.

Having failed all this pls tell me once he doesn't look completely useless against some half decent opponent in a non friendly game for United.

Now I know Nani hasn't set the world alight at United, but the sad thing is that Fellaini won't even come close to Nani. He doesn't have 1/10 of Nani's ability, neither does he have anything else to compensate for his lack of ability. He is just extremely lucky to still be here, but hopefully his luck will run out sooner rather than later.

648~~~
Nani is on 90k, Fellaini on 125 and is one of our highest paid players.

649~~~
Its wrong.

650~~~
I've seen that. I have also seen the 90k one for Fellaini. There is no real way to be 100% sure.

651~~~
The 125k one is more accurate because when he was linked with Arsenal it was rumored he wanted 100k a week and that ended Arsenal's interest. From the daily shit in 2013

The 25-year-old, who currently earns in the region of £75,000-per-week at Everton, wants a hefty increase on his current weekly wage.

From Arsenal's current squad, only Theo Walcott and Lukas Podolski are in the proximity of earning £100,000-per-week.

In addition to his wage demands, Arsenal would also be required to meet Fellaini's £22m release clause - which could see the cost of the deal spiral to as much as £50m.

There's no way he's only on 90k when he was on 75k at Everton. People will pick what suits their arguments but 125k is way more realistic.

652~~~
No one has any idea what salary he might be on - in fact it was suggested at time of signing by Moyes that Fellaini agreed to some kind of lesser deal to make the move happen

90k a week for Fellaini is not unrealistic

653~~~
He supposedly forfieted 4M but that had nothing to do with his basic wages, it was bonus money. From the Express, September 2013

United insist they have paid Everton no more than the £23.5m release clause that was in Fellaini’s contract – a clause that expired at the end of July – but Everton say the deal is worth £27.5m to them. <b>The difference is understood to be Fellaini’s own cash sacrifice</b>.

By submitting a written transfer request on deadline day Fellaini, left, has forfeited about £4m in loyalty bonuses that would have been due on the two years remaining on his Everton contract . That has allowed Everton to declare the deal as being worth £27.5m to them.

<b>Fellaini will make up for his lost bonuses over the course of the four-year contract he has signed at United, which has seen his wages jump by £50,000-a-week to £125,000-a-week.</b>

But the frantic deadline-day move, which saw Fellaini hand in a transfer request to Everton manager Roberto Martinez, underlined the player’s determination to move.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/426695/Cut-rate-Fellaini-forfeits-4m-in-United-move" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/426695/Cut-rate-Fellaini-forfeits-4m-in-United-move</a>

The 50k jump in wages correlates to the 125k from 75k he made at Everton

654~~~
He signed a five-year deal a year ago.

655~~~
Since we know he was willing to sacrifice bonuses for the move then it stands to reason that he would not have been pushing for a massive pay rise and would have been happy even with a slightly uplift - he was clearly desperate for the move.

All wage info from papers is pure speculation anyway, you can look at 4 different papers and get 4 different estimates - someone has already posted reports of 90k wage

It is all quite unimportant anyway, the main issue of interest is whether LvG gives him a chance when he returns from injury and if so at what position - it seems that he has been told he will get a chance to prove himself at some point.

656~~~
Everton directly refuted that newspaper report, stating that the full fee (£27.5m) had come from United.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11671/8905766/everton-insist-manchester-united-will-pay-all-of-marouane-fellaini-fee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...-united-will-pay-all-of-marouane-fellaini-fee</a>

Phil Neville's recent interview suggests that Fellaini was desperate to get his dream move to United so perhaps less likely to push his luck regarding salary. Even Moyes never suggested Fellaini was a star signing, so his wages are likely to be in line with other ordinary United first team players like Evans, who appear to earn in the region of £4m, more in a good year, possibly less in a season without CL.

Everton's accounts showed that Moyes was their top earner, on significantly less than £4m a year, so even the quoted £75K a week figure that Fellaini earned at Everton may be misleading. Everton's total wage bill would struggle to accommodate such an amount unless he was earning far more than other established players. Common sense suggests that at best, the £75K was an absolute maximum, paid only if various targets were met.

657~~~
So people syaing he's on more than nani 100%.... nani is on 120k ? So you really think felli is on like 150k? more than mata? or around the same as mata?

Figures ive seen are like 70k which is still a big increase from everton

658~~~
Can't see him staying beyond January or next summer at the latest. Ed has cut a ruthless figure, and Marouanne remains a haunting memory from last season's summer transfer travails.

Also seen a few mentions of him sacrificing a £4 million the loyalty bonus ? Am yet to read up those claims from a trustworthy source. Seems to be bollocks spread by Metro, Express and The Sun. Unless I missed one by BBC ?

But on the other hand a few reliable websites have refuted the notion of Fellaini forfeiting any portion of his wages :

659~~~
After looking like he was out of the door because his contract wasnt being renewed and he wasnt being trusted in the team. Did you read?

660~~~
Nani is on 90k, he asked for 130k on his last contract and United werent willing to meet it. Young is on 120 and Fellaini is on 125. Why is this so hard to believe?

661~~~
He is fighting Blind for the midfield enforcers role. However one is neat and tidy on the ball the other just gets his legs in a tangle. 
I see no place for him in the current squad. Swap deal with Strootman and £25m Roma?

662~~~
He's only third choice in the role that Blind played today. At best. As bad as Fletcher is, I'd still have him ahead of Fellaini.

663~~~
I really doubt he's in competition with Blind. 

LVG mentioned him with the forward players in the summer and I think he'll be competing mainly with Ander and Di Maria as one of the players who get forward, not with the likes of Blind, Carrick and Fletcher for the defensive job because he doesn't know how to sense danger or track players and although its true he can make tackles, as you saw today you can make tackles further forward like Ander was doing.

There's also his front position, which is his best position but competing with Mata, Rooney and our 2 out and out strikers Falcao and RVP he doesnt have a hope there. Wilson or Januzaj is more likely to play there than he is

664~~~
Agreed he needs to find another club in Jan, lets hope there are a few desperate ones about come the New Year. That or Moyes who seems to adore him is managing somewhere and buy him for around 15m.

665~~~
That would be ideal, if Roma want him. Fellaini's slow kind of game is more suited to the wasteland that is the serie A

666~~~
Have a feeling moyes will be at Newcastle by January and fellaini will no doubt follow. We will never see the best of him because he doesn't fit the style of play and he is a poor replacement for any of the players who played in the diamond today. He is better off elsewhere and we would be better off with a different player who can be genuine competition or genuine cover for our current players rather than just someone who can do a job.

667~~~
If we continue to play a diamond formation, I can see Fellaini rotating with Herrera.

668~~~
I see Fellaini watching us on TV.

669~~~
Roma are used to quality central midfielders, hence we are interested in buying them

Up front they tend to want creative players like Totti or people to get on the end of passes like Destro

Unfortunately for us, Fellaini neither fits Roma nor has the ability to compete with their players

Maybe Cleverley can have a word at Villa

670~~~
Touche. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

671~~~
Ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

672~~~
No he's not. Carrick is fighting Blind. 

Fellaini got lucky he got injured.

673~~~
he no longer has a place in this team. Thank feck.

674~~~
Please not let him anywhere near that midfield while it's working.

It would be like letting an elephant loose in the porcelain store.

675~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> going from Herrera to Fellaini is a massive technical drop. Good thing we don't have any need for rotation till after January.

676~~~
Do you really think Carrick has the defensive qualities of Blind then?
I Could easily see Carrick and Blind in the same Midfield but not Fellaini and Blind ever.

677~~~
What? 

Carrick has been playing the position Blind did for years with us. He's maybe not as mobile, but he makes it up with his passing.

678~~~
This is a LVG team - we have yet to see how he would deploy Carricks range of abilities - you are just guessing based on history and personal feeling.
I would see Blind and Fellaini battling to be the sitting midfielder in a 3 (if we play this way) and Carrick being deployed slightly further forward. 

We have missed a good holding midfielder for years and that person was never going to replace Carrick but rather complement him and give him more freedom. 

We will just have to see I guess.

679~~~
With Herrara and Blind looking decent today I think Fellaini is about as welcome in that dressing room as a rotten fart in a lift....he might come in handy in FA Cup games to give others a rest but i'd say LVG will make sure he is moved on in January

680~~~
Carrick has been our holding midfielder, though not limited and he is pretty good at screening. Atleast was.

681~~~
I think he will keep him as a squad player especially if we stick with 4-3-3 or a Diamond, Unless we manage to bring someone else (Strootman) in.

We don't really have a backup to Herrera right now.

682~~~
He's only really making up the numbers. I'd be amazed if he was here next year.

683~~~
Depends who we sign next summer, if there is to be more midfield reinforcements I can't see him staying. But then again he may prove an able understudy for Blind in van Gaal's system.

684~~~
Strootman seems nailed on though and I can't see Fletcher being sold so Fellaini seems the obvious departure there.

685~~~
Probably, buying Strootman would require another new setup so we'll see how the current formation does.

686~~~
Him, Anderson, Valencia, Fletcher and Young will be next on the chopping board next summer as LvG continues the shake-up. No room for technical wasters in our new side. Put any of them in the team and we'll instantly look a worse side (as happened today when Valencia stepped on the field).

687~~~
He's more a understudy for Herrera right now the way i see it.

Don't think Van Gaal has used him as a defensive mid at all so far. Carrick is Blind's first deputy and then Fletch.

688~~~
Not really. Our midfield looked great today but if any of the three was injured we would be far worse off than we should. We still need depth like.

689~~~
He's not expected back till what, the middle of October?...I really wouldn't be surprised if doesn't play again for United, and is shipped out as soon as possible come January.

690~~~
If the mop is used it will surely be as either a last ditch target man or in Herrera's role should the injury gods smite us. There's no way he'll play as a the holding CM, a role that requires mobility, passing quality and positional sense. Blind and Carrick will vie for that role, as Carrick is way too slow to play in the Di Maria or Herrera box to box roles in the diamond.

691~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

692~~~
Given that Welbeck was sold, about whom one could make a plausible argument that he was United quality, Fellani has zero future under LVG. As mentioned above-in a three man MF he is behind Carrick as Blind's back-up; he won't play at the top of the diamond as a 10, nor as the 8 backing up Herrera.

693~~~
When you consider the lack of options in our midfield you'd have to imagine he'll get the odd game as a wrecking ball substitute to come on for Herrera.

694~~~
Tbf, Welbeck wanted to leave and had much more competition.

And he will play as the #8 more than he will as a #6. That's his best position behind being the physical second striker as well.

If we bring Strootman or someone else in then ofourse he will probably leave.

695~~~
No reason why he can't compete with Herrera for that spot in midfield. If Herrera gets injured or something then he could fill in there. Probably could play Blind's role too but I suspect Carrick will be his main opponent for that position.

696~~~
From the way LVG has spoken about Carrick in press conferences, he is counting the days until he comes back into the squad.  That will put Fellaini behind Herrera, Blind, and Carrick (and maybe Fletcher) in the pecking order.  He has absolutely no chance, either, with breaking into the attacking spots where players like Di Maria, Mata, Rooney, and RVP already are.  What a waste of money.

697~~~
There's one massive reason I can think of...

Fair enough if Herrera gets injured but if Herrera is fit there is a reason why he won't be competing he's awful, Herrera's performance against QPR was better than all of Fellaini's put together for us. He is an attacking mid that suits a more direct style of passing which is not what Van Gaal will use and the only reason he is here is because he got injured guarantee he is gone in January

699~~~
Well first of all he's nothing at all like Herrera, and he's nowhere near as good? He's slow and cumbersome, he's not agile, he's a shit passer and can't do quick touches, can't go out wide occasionally like herrera did today. We'll see if Van Gaal gives him a chance to prove everyone wrong but I doubt he'll get many, and I suspect he'll be shipped out in January and we bring in Strootman.

700~~~
I know. But we have different views over this reason. 


No, it wasn't. Fellaini has also played well against poor opposition. He did so a few times last season. Herrera was good though and if he does continue to play well he will keep his spot - as he should. I think Fellaini can play a box-to-box role and play in a holding position. He won't be as good going forward as Herrera, but in certain games it might prove more effective to have a midfielder in there who is more defensively minded.

I kind of mentioned this in my above reply. Not similar players exactly, but that position could be modified depending on the opponent. His passing is fine, especially his short passing. People are too harsh on him over this. His passing is simple, quick, and positive.

701~~~
If he doesn't mind bench sitting I'd be happy to have him here filling in for injuries, coming on late to win headers, and playing cup games.

He's pretty useful and can play multiple positions. The new Oshea.

702~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">This I feel is a big misconception and something that has been addressed by others in previous Fellaini threads. His awareness in defense positions is quite poor to be completely honest, the technique to effectively tackle in dangerous areas of the pitch again subpar, positional sense and nose for diagnosing plays before they develop lacking. These are the 3 most basic traits of a defensively minded player. I think maybe because of his large frame people assume he can suffice as a defensive player or someone who play the Busquets role. He's anything but suited to that in reality.</span>

703~~~
Fellaini proved to be everything you dont want in "defensive midfield" last season.

Rash in the tackle in dangerous areas, didnt track midfielders supporting the opponents attacks, didnt move the ball around the team with any tempo. Basically the anti-Blind.

704~~~
The sooner we sell him the better. If he stays rotting longer he may not even worth 5m.

705~~~
I would rather have Pereira promoted and be back up to Herrera than have Fellaini there.

706~~~
Exactly. Fellaini has the positional sense of a kangaroo

707~~~
Whilst I agree with this, it isn't the Fellaini that was at Everton. Why is everyone so quick to completely write him off? If there is a manager to improve him it's LVG, and I still don't think he's played anywhere near his best in a United shirt. 

He may in the end be completely wank, but I just hate the idea to write off players after one year. So many have struggled in year 1 but then gone on to go good things for us.

708~~~
Just curious about the last part. Which player already playing in the PL for 5 years has joined us and struggled the first year followed by a stark improvement the next years? No one comes to mind. I can understand if he was coming from a different league but he has been at Everton and with Moyes no less for 5 years. Why would he struggle that massively after joining us and what makes you think he will suddenly improve?

709~~~
Fellaini does not have the engine to play box to box for us. He hardly ever showed up for the ball and he does not track runners. He is a big lump whom you can direct crosses to but as a box to box mid he is dud.

710~~~
Harsh on kangaroos.

711~~~
Of the top of my head, Carrick is one.

And there's plenty coming from abroad too. Granted it shouldn't happen to Fellaini but each player is different, maybe he needs more time.

The reason I think he could improve is, and it just my opinion, he was better in every single facet of his game at Everton. Some people here love to rewrite history and say he was always a shit player but at Everton he actually shower technical ability too.

He has his limitations - he isn't intelligent enough to be a holding player. Not is he technical enough to be our 10. But if we play a diamond, there is scope for someone like him as a backup to the two in the middle . I don't think he will make first teamer unless he significantly improves.

The big thing also is at Everton, he was a greyhound. He wouldn't give a player a minutes peace. At United, he has been so timid. If he can find that aggression back he could be useful in a Khedira type role against the big teams.

As I said this is purely my opinion and speculation. He could well turn out to be shit and if we sold him in january I wouldn't particularly care but the notion of writing players off so quickly as if we all own mystic balls is just wrong. Goes for any player.

712~~~
Carrick joined us in 2006 and was very impressive in his first season for us. I am absolutely gobsmacked you compared his performances with Fellaini's last season. I cannot take the rest of your post seriously if you feel Carrick struggled to Fellaini's extent in his first season.

About players from abroad, I have already mentioned that is understandable. Fellaini was in the PL for 5 years and playing under the same manager as well. The way he played clearly showed he didn't have the ability to step up.

About his ability for Everton. He was an average midfielder there and really did well as a second striker (battering ram) in his final season there. That he where he was productive. He was displaced by Phil Neville in their midfield. Even with us, he was ok against really poor opposition and was downright awful against any half decent team when he played midfield. He was perhaps told to try and play box to box by Moyes seeing the amount of time he spent in the opposition half. Only problem is he does not have the engine or the smartness to time his runs and get back when needed.

713~~~
Ok mate, you keep sitting on your throne. Learn to discuss like an adult. I disagree with you, accept it.

714~~~
I didn't mean to offend. But comparing Fellaini to Carrick's first season was insulting to Carrick. You can have an opinion and you are obviously entitled to it but that was bizarre.

715~~~
Pereira will understudy for Herrera. Fellaini is an Andy Carroll of a midfielder, and his name doesn't fit into the rhyming game with Ander Herrera and Andy Pereira as a consolation.

716~~~
Maybe you don't remember Carricks first season then. Also, just for the sake of debate, although clearly you'll manipulate any invalid argument to fit your agenda, what about all the players who go in and out of form? You telling me Carrick for example has always played consistently great football? But he's always played in England and he should have been settled at United... Your nonsense theory is that no player should ever be shit when moving clubs if in the same league when there are players who don't move and still have off seasons. The only bizarre opinions here are yours.

717~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

718~~~
Pereira y Herrera.  Sounds like a brilliant match.

719~~~
But Carrick did really well in his first season. He was a fixture in the side and though he wasn't as good as he was, say, in 2012/13 but he was very solid and worked very well with Scholes. He's a bad example for the point you're trying to make.

720~~~
Their first names are pretty identical too.

721~~~
I'm not quite ready to throw him to the scrap heap  yet. I'd like to see what Van Gaal could do with him.

722~~~
The crap which you have spouted was about Carrick. That is the only player you came up with. And it is you who should recap his memory or see the 2006-07 season again where Carrick was crucial to us. But hey, let's complete twist facts to make sure we all believe Fellaini was as good (bad?) as Carrick in his first season.

My question to you was simple. Which player who has already played in the PL for more than a couple of years has come to us and been as useless as Fellaini has been followed by such rapid improvement that he could actually play for us. Even the likes of Young/Valencia came and improved here, unlike Fellaini who has been abysmal in most of his outings. 

You keep on harping about how he can improve. There is nothing to back that opinion that he can cut it at this level as a midfielder. He was an average one at Everton as well and we don't need that type playing for us. So unless you mean we should persist with a log pulling us back in midfield under the garb of giving him chances, it is you who has posted nonsense.

723~~~
Shhhhh. Don't post sense please. Carrick was as awful as Fellaini in his first season with us.

724~~~
How about you read what I say? Look at Young and Valencia now. They're not doing so great, are they? But your theory is they've played for so long in the PL the should be, no?

725~~~
Wow, you're such a child.

726~~~
I asked you a question and you replied with Carrick. I think it is you who should read more carefully. Young and Valencia were not this poor when they joined us. They both did pretty well. Valencia was one of the best wingers in Europe at one time with us and had and excellent first season as well. You came up with Carrick as an example of a player who was poor with us in the first season, which is quite frankly bs unless you have set a very very high standard. Obviously players can improve and I am not questioning that. Simply saying comparing Carrick's first season for us with the horror show which Fellaini served up last season was laughable at best.

727~~~
I wasn't answering your question.

728~~~
Oh, how silly of me to think you are answering my question when you quoted my post and actually "answered" the question I had raised in that post.<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

729~~~
Maybe he could still do a job. Having said that, if given the chance, bog him off to Stoke/West Ham/Hull/Sunderland/Palace if we receive an offer of anything upwards of £10m.

730~~~
Odd thing to say. His fitness is one of his main assets. Last season there were many games where he had covered the most distance out of the whole team. Agree there were some poor defensive efforts last season but if he can switch on then I think he'll be a good defensive option. Herrera failed to track a few runners yesterday but we weren't punished. I have faith that Fellaini can improve.

731~~~
Your faith is commendable. For me, he is simply not very good. The only position he could play is the Blind role, and I'd rather have Fletcher as back-up.

732~~~
He does amble around a lot but when it comes to playing the box to box role, he does not seem to have the speed or stamina or for that matter the required drive to do it effectively. So many times one could see him ambling back from an attacking position while the opponents are on the counter. Then again he covered the whole length of the pitch at his own sweet pace which would obviously improve the distance covered stat, but was it useful to us in his box to box role? I think not.

Regarding Herrera, he was like a terrier. Snapping at heels. Going into challenges and helping us win the ball back. There was one instance I do remember he didn't track a midfield runner which led to their opening in open play but apart from that he was pretty much awesome in that role. Not to forget he had made more successful tackles (8) than anyone else on the pitch. That does say a lot about his ability in winning the ball back vis-a-vis Fellaini.

733~~~
I'd accept that his pace is a potential issue in a box-to-box role, not his stamina though. Fellaini had games last season when he lead us for interceptions, tackles, and clearances. I think his ability to win the ball back matches if not exceeds Herrera's. But that's just my view, I know a lot disagree.

734~~~
Watching yesterday, I just don't have a clue where people think he might fit into this team.

735~~~
I think at this point the only debate is whether he's a suitable back-up for Herrera at # 8 as Carrick will back up Blind and we have more than enough coverage at #10. 

I don't see it, but others disagree.

736~~~
Chalk and cheese though. Herrera covered every blade yesterday and was in the thick of the short passing and moving as well as providing width and doubling up on the right to help Rafael add some width.

737~~~
It's a strange one, think you need to be a lot more mobile than Fellaini is to do Herrera's role yesterday which is why I suspect Pereira would be the better bet if Ander was out.

738~~~
No argument from me.  I assume Fellani would have been shipped out but for his injury.

739~~~
Standards are much lower at Everton, our fans didnt watch him every week and his best season was not in midfield. It was playing off the striker

740~~~
I think his only realistic role in the diamond would be the base role. He isn't clever enough or mobile enough to play either of the wide slots. 

If he could work on positioning and reading of the game he could be decent there, but right now Blind and Carrick are ahead. If he want's to stay he need's to be mighty impressive when he gets the chance.

741~~~
Actually his perfect role would be at the tip of the diamond, allowing him to get into the box for every cross. However that puts the creative burden on everyone else and relies on quality delivery from the wing. Which, could work because Di Maria, Ander and Blind are creative enough to do that job. But it simply means Mata doesnt play

742~~~
We can only hope that Moyes gets a new job at a club with a competitive budget and buys him for atleast 15m. 

His style just doesn't suit LvG and I really doubt he can improve that much.

743~~~
I think we might struggle to offload him. I mean, who in their right mind would buy him? He's crap, overpriced and presumably on high wages.

744~~~
Somewhere - most likely in a Chicken Cottage - Sam Allardyce's ears prick up.

745~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

746~~~
Easily the most satisfying part of yesterday was actually forgetting Fellani plays for us.

747~~~
Yeah, not sure why didn't loan or move him. Probably because we didn't have time to do so with Blind only having been signed at the end of the window. I can definitely see him moving in the winter window, especially if we get Strootman.

748~~~
That's completely illogical, in fact it's paradoxical.

749~~~
Carrick had a really good first season alongside Scholes. There's no comparison.

750~~~
Works for me, and I'd love to see it in action as I firmly believe it could work!

751~~~
Really? You'd like to see Fellaini over Mata in that formation so we can play it in the air to him?

I genuinely have no idea what to say about that.

752~~~
You don't have to, as I believe it would not happen. Just saying I would like to see it, and that my opinion is that it could work.

753~~~
I don't think he fits into any position in the diamond. He can work in a 433 or even 4231 where he doesn't have to also cover the wings. Herrera and Di Maria are fine as they have bundles of energy. In all honesty, I think those are the only two that will be able to play as the 2 CMs in the diamond.

754~~~
With his position, I think he plays best as the tip of the head in a 433, or a 4231 as the player behind the striker. It was best shown when Belgium played it at the WC, although the personnel wasn't great and didn't work. They forced their best player - de Bruyne - into a deeper position, almost as a #6 which didn't work. He also played with Witsel, both of these aren't the quickest, added with Fellaini made for bad viewing. I do think though, that is his best position, and he really will not recieve that here. I don't think he can replace Herrera as a RCM in the diamond, or is good enough as a CM in the 352, or cover for Mata as Januzaj is far better.

755~~~
pretty sure he is going to be back-up to our centre-back's back-up from now on.

756~~~
Do not want him anywhere near our bench. He will ruin our beautiful diamond.

757~~~
Blind, Carrick, Fletcher and Fellaini - in that order for that CDM role in the diamond formation.

758~~~
I can't see any other role for him at Utd other than sticking him up front as a battering ram for the last 20 minutes if we've tried everything else and it hasn't worked. He should only be used as a total desperation emergency move.

£28m for that.

759~~~
Blind if he continues in this form, do not think he has competition in his role. Carrick is out for a while, fletcher is past his best, fellaini is just so bad you cannot even put into words how terrible this buy has been, and anderson does not even deserve to be even mentioned. So in all blind is a guaranteed starter, in all I do hope the club moves on all of fellaini fletcher anderson carrick in the summer, and hopefully young joins the loaned players permanently of nani zaha cleverley and hernandez. That is wages off the books, and we can continue to rebuild

760~~~
Yeah, having read the last few pages, I was thinking the same thing. As it currently stands, he'd be a poor backup to Blind at the base of the diamond, while Carrick would probably slot in there to spell him. If we had 2 man midfield, it would probably be those 2 or Herrera, depending on how defensive we want to be. Maybe he could be used as a defensive substitute for any of the other 3. 

We have too many #10's as it is, so he wouldn't be at the tip of the diamond, unless he was being used as a target man, like he was at Everton, but that's a tactic we would use late. So seemingly, a midfield start seems to be out of the question. 

I wonder if he could've been used as one of the 3 at back. He'd be a better passer than the other CB's, one would think. But with Blind (& eventually Carrick), the 3 at back becomes rather moot, it seems. At least we wouldn't have to see Carrick be used as a stop-gap CB when Fellaini is healthy. He'd offer more than enough physicality & height to be more effective than Carrick.

761~~~
Not good enough to play at the top of the diamond, lacks the positional intelligence and passing accuracy of Blind or Carrick to play at the base. So that leaves him covering for Ander or Di Maria and I'd honestly rather play Januzaj or Pereira in either of their roles if feck forbid, either picks up an injury. With only 1 game a week until January I don't see any use for him, by then Newcastle will have hired Pulis and he'll give us £12M for him.

762~~~
Fellaini is a ball watcher. I'd rather see us try Rojo there if we were that short of numbers. Or a youth player if we needed Rojo in defence. Just not Fellaini.

763~~~
Try him as a defender. If that won't work then I really don't know what to do.

764~~~
It's the same as with Moyes, once he leaves apart from a couple of posters everyone will admit what a huge mistake his signing was from beginning to the end.

765~~~
He's better than Fletcher.

766~~~
Easily, the guy should be given a chance in this team to show what he can bring to the table and not be judged on last year when many fans directed a lot if their irk for Moyes onto the direction of Fellaini. (I'm not holding out much hope for him but I think he does deserve a chance)

767~~~
Fixed.

768~~~
This.

769~~~
You half fixed it. He's fitter and better. Obviously his superior fitness contributes to that but it doesn't change the fact that at this point he is better.

770~~~
Nope. Fletcher is still the better footballer overall. Better defensive awareness, better passing ability, better first touch and so forth. Most of his current problems stem from a lack of fitness. That's about the only area apart from aerial presence where Fellaini has an upper hand. But that issue can be managed.

Darren's problems this season stem from playing almost every single game under Van Gaal since his appointment and that has brought him to his knees. However the remit of a backup midfielder once Carrick returns to fitness will be to sit on the bench and come on sparingly. 

Fletcher doesn't quite have the stamina to start 5+ games in a single stretch. But if he's given short rests and brought on in certain situations to shore up the midfield, there still plenty left in his locker.

I know who I'd rather trust in the big matches if one of Herrera, Blind, Di Maria or Carrick are injured. And that's Fletcher because he's cerebral and can literally put in a shift as and when required. I don't trust Marouanne in those type of matches at all. 

The gulf in technique is too vast for him to make a significant contribution. eg. Bayern where the poor guy looked woefully out of his depth against genuinely world class midfielders.

771~~~
He used to be one of the key players for Everton. I think that he's at least good enough to play as backup for our team <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

772~~~
That's not saying much is it ? Ashley Young was arguably Villa's best player. It's relativistic. Infact I'm not sure he'd get into the current Everton side to be honest. Martinez had them playing some great footballer with the basis of 2 technically proficient midfielders in Barry and McCarthy. Is Fellaini even better than Besic on a purely technical or tactical level ? Can't say with certainty to be honest.

773~~~
I disagree on the defensive awareness, passing, and first touch. Have you seen Fletcher lately? His first touch involves the ball bouncing off his foot 5 meters away from him. Darren's problems partly stem from a lack of fitness, however the main issue for him is that he is just not up to it anymore. As I said though, his lack of fitness all contributes to his issues. He can't put in a shift anymore, well not from what I have seen. Yeah, Fellaini looked out of his depth. So did Carrick and nine other players that night. I can't remember if Fletcher had played but I guarantee you he would have looked out of his depth also.

774~~~
Everton and the way they played suited Fellaini perfectly and any team who replicate that will get a good player, any team that doesn’t will not get much out of him. 

When Everton deployed him in midfield he often played as the most attacking player or had a free role, they hit lots of long balls into him from the keeper and the back four, his job was to chest it down and lay it off, win headers etc which he is very good at. He would feed the ball to the likes of Pienaar and Baines then make his way into the box to get on the end of a cross or long diagonal ball and he could cause problems for any side. Take that sort of service away from him, play it to his feet, try to get him to pass and move, expect him to track runners, play passes more than 10-15 yards and he is half the player. Unfortunately for Fellaini at Utd he is never going to be used as he was at Everton and he will never be the same player no matter how many chances he gets.

I don’t see the point in doing anything other than selling him ASAP to get back as much money as we can, I know a lot of fans think it is unfair and he should be given more chances but that is just the way it goes, if he isn’t good enough and doesn’t fit in then it’s time to move him on whether he has been here for 1 year or 10 years. I don’t think LVG can rate him as anything other than backup judging by our signings and the strong interest we have shown in other players so I expect he will be shipped out on loan in January.

775~~~
Like some said, we wont play him to his strengths, even as a squad player he doesnt suit us. I cant see van Gaal throwing him on and changing his philosophy just for Fellaini, even in the last minutes of the game and is that really what he wants? No. Use the money to buy Strootman in Januray.

776~~~
We're underrating him quite a bit on this forum. I don't like him playing for United, he doesn't suit us, but I don't mind having him as a substitute or replacement player in our squad. Our other squad options compared to him would be Anderson and Fletcher, and I think Fellaini would be chosen ahead of them when fit.

I don't think replacing him with a top midfielder would be a priority in the January transfer window, I'll be happy if we managed to get a good defender into our team instead.

777~~~
Let's just agree to disagree. I'd rather a burnt out stallion than a healthy donkey.

How about we get both a central midfielder and a defender ? What's the use playing him close to 100 grand just to be sat on the bench ? We could get someone like Saul who has 200 % more potential for 15 million and pay him a quarter of Marouane's wages. What's the use just keeping him on ? Let him go and find regular football elsewhere, playing for a team more suited to his talents.

778~~~
I think we might want to wait until the summer transfer window to purchase a good midfielder, like Strootman? Unless we can bring him in during January, of course.

779~~~
Fair enough.

But who knows - maybe someone like Schneiderlin is available in January and going by Koeman's recent comments he very well might be. I'd prefer him over Fellaini in fairness. If we stick with a 4-3-1-2, a quartet of Ander, Di Maria, Blind and Schneiderlin + some academy product like Pereira or Rothwell would be good enough IMO.

780~~~
I'll throw it into the fire.

Van Gaal said we needed to keep possession, which is true, but I was also thinking we needed a bully in CM today (and might need again if another situation like this arises). So, can Fellaini be THAT guy? And yes, I do think the problem was further back, but I feel Leicester would have been less comfortable had we had a Fellaini stating right there in front of the CBs.

781~~~
No.

782~~~
Fellaini isn't very good in that position. And gets out jumped by midgets when he is defending. 

Carrick would have sorted us out.

783~~~
I was expecting a call for him to play CB when I saw the thread bumped.

784~~~
Of course. But then again, Carrick isn't a bully.

785~~~
I dont think doing what he did vs Olympiacos works for like 30 minutes.

786~~~
Forgot he still played for us ffs.

787~~~
We don't need a bully. We just needed someone who can keep possession.

788~~~
Also means we dont have an intelligent player in there making 8 interceptions and tracking back to clear the ball out of his box 6 times

They were also dangerous from set pieces and Fellaini gives away too many in dangerous areas

The last thing we needed defensively would have been this guy

In attack though? Probably would have had more of an impact than Januzaj and Mata

789~~~
Shocking today. Shouldn't play for the club again after that performance.

790~~~
Me too. At least we've got better options in midfield now though, no matter how poor the result today was.

791~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

792~~~
Sorry, I was just trying to be in keeping with the theme of the thread.

793~~~
<i>IF </i>he can get form and keep possession well then he would have been a good sub for the game I think. We needed someone to come on and slow things down. I'm not sure he could do it, but if he could then he would have been handy.

794~~~
Well he wouldn't speed things up, that's for sure.

795~~~
Once we went long ball, he'd have been a better option than Mata. Is very able to hold up play and retain possession. 
All i see now about him as a player now are petty digs at his ability. The guy has attributes & strengths that could be utilised from time to time. He's a proven very effective footballer in the Premier League. Never his fault the berk who bought him tried to convert him to a position he isn't good enough to play at United. He should be used as a target man for however long he's at the club, some times we'll have to go long ball, it's the nature of our league!

796~~~
He's too slow to break down play really and he's not even good at breaking up play when its near him. As far as being a bully, he's really more of a fanny.

797~~~
Funny thing that, you know, shipping five goals and all. We certainly needed something a little bit more than 'keeping possession'. Seems we probably could do with some players that can stay in shape and defend.

He has played at the base for Everton in the past and done very well. He might not be the most mobile of our midfielders but pound for pound defensively to tie up a ragged game he (on form) would probably be our best option right now. A like for like for Blind who could probably do a job with his alertness and pick up around the deeper player. There is no real need to be fantastic in possession spraying the ball around in the last 30 minutes of a game if we are trying to stabilize. 

He's not far away from returning so at least that is an extra body for lack of nothing better.

798~~~
The only question Fellaini is the answer to is "Who should we sell next?"

799~~~
Unless he was a world class CB all along and only played as a midfielder in Everton to bamboozle his future club, I don't see him improving our game the slightest bit. He's a major step down from Blind and Herrera. Di Maria doesn't even belong in the same sentence as him.

800~~~
Same here. But now that I think about it, it isn't a very bad idea and it might actually work out well. Not sure if he'd be willing to play there though.

801~~~
If that's the case, then he better just shut up and obey orders because he probably knows by now that his career at United hangs only by a thread.

802~~~
I'd like to see him tried as a center back, I know he likes defending (said himself defensive midfielder is where he prefers to play).

What is there to lose?  Jonny Evans is too lightweight to lead a defense and Chris Smalling for a guy who's 6ft 4, I don't think there's been a bigger pansy in football.

803~~~
Tried it once in FM. 

Didn't end well.

I prefer an intelligent, resourceful passer a la Scholes in front of defense, not someone who is likely to give the ball away. 

I think he'd be better utilized as one of the shuttlers, he can run around like a tenacious giraffe unsettling opposition players and help us win possession further up  the pitch.

805~~~
One of the issues with him being a CB is that he would give away penalties. It's pretty obvious that referees target him. Some of the time he probably deserves this but there are times when he is unfairly punished.

806~~~
Are we talking 38 year old Scholes? Or prime Scholes?

807~~~
Honestly would rather have both over Fellaini

808~~~
Ppl will be suggesting soon we should try him in goal.

No matter how badly we do, Fellaini is never the solution for a non hoofball team.

809~~~
38 year old Scholes could barely defend at all.

810~~~
I don't think putting him at CB should be on the cards whatsoever. We need some consistency and reliability at the back currently.

I would like to see Fellaini at the base of the diamond however. He can break up attacks and provide aerial dominance in that area of the pitch. The impetus is not on him to drive forward and create chances, he can simply get the ball to Herrera, AdM, Mata or one of the strikers. 

Fellaini is the type of player who will do well when there are better players around him. He struggled last season when we were playing a typical 4-4-2 and had the likes of Cleverley in CM. Fellaini has suffered from being a Moyes man and bring the only CM we bought last season (and not the one we needed) but he can still be a good player for us, he needs creative players around him that he can lay the ball off to though. We have that now, and if hope he is given a chance to show what he can do.

811~~~
100%. Also he's a great player to come on a sure stuff up. Certainly wont be bullied. The other midfielders are a bit lightweight....

812~~~
Funnily enough, he would've done rather well yesterday I assume, given all those hoofs from Leicester and us losing every first and second ball in the midfield.

As an ardent defender of his though, he's not really the solution to our problems, neither in CM or CB. The trio that's being played there (midfield that is, CBs are clowns) at the moment is comfortably better.

813~~~
I think he deserves a try instead of Blind. We haven't really seen what Fellaini can do when he is playing alongside actual midfielders yet.

814~~~
You're having a laugh if you suggest we drop Blind for Fellaini. Blind was fine yesterday, what is wrong with you guys?

815~~~
He's more of horses for course type of player imo, used when needed. His height would have been helpful yesterday when we were getting bullied by all those long balls.

816~~~
Don't make me laugh, Fellaini is a much better player than Blind and certainly would be a better defensive midfielder. Blind is incredibly light weight and gets bullied and run through way to easily, Blind is pretty much a stop gap signing anyway.

Fellaini get's way too much hate, if he wasn't the only player Moyes signed, people wouldn't come close to giving him so much slack. He's shown he's a pretty good and useful player for Everton, when playing in either the no10 role or the midfield role he played much earlier at Everton. At least with Fellaini on the pitch, we got a player who won't be bullied like a little boy and can give some elbows and kicks back at the opposition.

He might not be the best out there, but he's a better option than Blind at the base of diamond imo.

817~~~
No way in fecking hell.

Blind made 8 interceptions, 6 clearances and was not dispossessed once.

818~~~
If Fellaini was actually beastly in the air and aggressive in the tackle, he'd actually be useful. Problem is he has been nothing but a pussy in the United shirt.. I don't get it.

819~~~
I don't really think he would have the intelligence to play at centre back at all, as he'd be culpable to give away penalties like you say. He could be mildly effective against a side that doesn't offer much of a threat and plays long ball football where he can use his height to head the ball away, but he'd get ripped apart against a top side.

820~~~
Could he ever be molded into a central defender? He started out his career at centre back. The one thing Fellaini has that Jones, Smalling and Evans don't have is the fear factor. Forwards would hate playing against him as they hated playing against Vidic. Smalling is a pussy and Jones and Evans are too injury prone to rely on. This is what Fellaini said in fourfourtwo magazine a year ago..........

'When I started in the reserves at Standard Liege I played centre back," he told FourFourTwo.
"But centre back was a good position for me because I am tall and good in the air, but I can also pass the ball.
"Maybe it’s a position for me in the future."

Rafael-Fellaini-Rojo-Shaw !!!!!

821~~~
Rotation.

822~~~
We play one game a week, why would we rotate?

823~~~
Erm no. He lacks positioning and brains + his nasty streak will get us into trouble.

824~~~
So Fellaini, Januzaj, Shaw, Fletcher, Carrick, Wilson, Valencia and Young (and more I'm sure) will never start a game this season apart from injuries?

I've been all for keeping a more constant XI thanks to our lack of games this season, but we have a big squad even with the departures. If we didn't plan on playing some of the above players, why not just loan them out?

825~~~
I hope the bolded players never play for us again.

Rotation for rotation sake is pointless. We have one game a week so play our best team week in week out, it's that simple. If players aren't performing, then you swap them out, just like we should do with Blackett for Shaw next week.

826~~~
I can't think of a single thing Fellaini is better than Blind at. You'd think he'd be better in the air but he's not really, Blind actually jumps you see.

The idea that Fellaini is better than Blind is laughable.

827~~~
Wut ? Fellaini doesn't get bullied ? Erm what about being in 5'7" Lahm's pocket for 90 minutes ? A player hardly renowned for his physicality.

People are putting way too much emphasis on Blind's lack of stature - which is by no means slight btw - he's almost 6' tall. Some of the best defensive minded midfielders in modern football were smaller than Blind in size - that includes Matthaus, Makelele, Davids, Cambiasso, Mascherano, Deschamps among others. Fellaini doesn't have the discipline, tactical nous or perception of space to play in a holding role. Being 10' tall doesn't make him a better footballer than Blind.

828~~~
Blind had a poor second half but he is way, way better than Fellaini.

829~~~
People really want to see Fellaini play CB? What a daft suggestion <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ! Haven't you not seen the amount of fouls Fellaini commits? He'd give away a lot of penalties. Fellaini cannot tackle properply nor can he muscle somebody off the ball without giving a way a foul

830~~~
There is no problem that this team has/will ever have for which Fellaini is the solution, except maybe generating revenue from afro wig sales.

831~~~
Fellaini better than Blind? 

Then I am better than Messi!

832~~~
And when we need to bring in these players due to injuries or form, how do you expect them to perform if they haven't had a game all season?

You can't simply expect 5+ players to sit out for an entire season. If LVG didn't see a use for them this season they would have been sold or loaned anyway.

833~~~
We need them if we get injuries.

Play your best team, it's that simple.

834~~~
You are out of your fecking mind.

835~~~
And WHEN we get injuries (not if) we will want players who can slot straight in, not players who haven't played for months and are out of shape/match fitness.
The team with the best squad will more often than not, win the league. SQUAS, not first XI - this very club is the most blatant proof of this that you could ask for.

No, it isn't that simple.

837~~~
Fecking hell.  Really hope you're wumming.

838~~~
Haven't seen enough of Blind to know for sure that he's a better player than Fellaini, though it'll be unbelievably crap if he isn't.

I do know that A) Fellaini isn't anywhere near being a good enough DM to ever play in that position for us, B) at no point in his time here has he looked like someone who wouldn't be bullied, he has actually been fairly timid beyond picking up a few needless yellow cards and C) being a DM is less about being a physical beast and more about being intelligent, disciplined, aware, and defensively secure. Even during his time playing in CM at Everton I thought Fellaini was overrated defensively and he has been worse again any time he played in midfield for us.

839~~~
Agree with this minus one notable exception, Fletcher's testimonial.

840~~~
It seems it's impossible to give Fellaini a compliment without a backhand comment.

841~~~
Blind made 8 interceptions yesterday. To me it is clear who the better DM is.

842~~~
Comparing Fellaini to Blind in central midfield is a bit like comparing Cascarino to Van Bommel.

843~~~
It is though.

844~~~
This is quite a forthright and bold claim. I can understand where you are coming from but this thread is not where you need to be making such a claim. The fashionista's who are desperate to convince themselves and other United fans that Fellaini is not even a competent footballer will be all over this.

On the other end of the scale, people just simply have to stop saying such idiotic things as 'not intellegent enough', 'cant pass well enough', 'not tactically aware' and 'would prefer Scholes instead'. These people have simply lost their way and are making things up to try and convince themselves that Fellaini is not a good enough player. People are crying out for a player that defends comprehensively, can pass 10 yards and 40 yards perfectly, is always making interceptions and never loses the ball. Players like this simply do not exist, in your own fantasies and in the real world. 

When you're playing at the anchor you have to sacrifice one thing or another. A defensive player who closes and duels, or a player who sits in the space and mops up for the defence. Either have their uses but both are far from perfect. This emphasis on passing and keeping the ball are more important than defensive ability has to stop as well. For shites sake they are playing as a defensive midfielder, their first port of call is to defend, not be able to pass and retain possession.

845~~~
A) Retaining possession in key areas is part of defending.
B) Fellaini's main weakness as a DM is the fact that he's actually not that good defensively, not his technical skill set.

846~~~
<b>Winning</b> possession is part of defending. Retaining possession in any area, from any player is part of attacking. You can't be defending if you have the ball, as ludicrous as that sounds.

This is part of my point that the needs and abilities of the a defensive midfielder has been muddied by fans in a desperate attempt to classify and tag some players as great and shite. Lets get back to basic's as the fans and realize that defensive midfielders need to defend first and foremost, subsequent passing/ball retention and tactical smarts are a bonus to the role.

847~~~
I'd have thought years of watching Barcelona would have proven otherwise?

Guardiola: "Sometimes you have loads of possession but do not create chances, just to defend and defend – because when you have possession, you have the ball and it is impossible the opponent can score a goal".

Keeping the ball properly in key areas <i>is</i> part of defense. Why do you think LvG highlighted our inability to keep possession on the weekend? He wasn't complaining that we weren't doing enough <i>attacking</i>, was he? He was saying that our inability to maintain possession and control led to the team defending badly as a unit.

Similarly, someone like Klopp would argue that pressing without the ball is an important part of his team's attacking football. The divide between attack and defense isn't always as black and white as you're making out.

848~~~
I don't watch Barcelona. I find possession football as boring as knitted animal sweaters.

Yes, it may well be part of <i>defence </i>if and when the defenders have the ball. But it isn't <i>defending </i>in the way that I am implying, as in when we don't have the ball. When your team mates have the ball we aren't taking up defensive possessions or looking to win the ball from your own team mates, that is just being obtuse to suit your argument.

He probably said that because it's true. We should have kept the ball a little better at 3-1 but ultimately United over the years gets a head of steam up and continues to attack. Especially under Sir Alex. We, funnily enough continued to attack and almost scored a couple more before we were undone by some pretty shite defending as a unit. The parts of the game where we should have been a lot better. Individual defensive ability and it's effect on the players around you as a unit.

Something that we have lacked is a proper ball winning midfielder and it has shown for years. It is no coincidence that things like this and the 5-5, and many 'fall apart scenarios' under Moyes. I am not saying Fellaini is that ultimate player but there is more to being a defensive midfielder than what you do on the ball. What you do off it is far more important. Leave utilizing the ball to the two supplementary midfielders (in this scenario, as in 3-1 up trying to see out a game) just ahead of the DM.

849~~~
The idea of playing him CB... He doesn't sense danger and position himself well enough or track opposition players to play in midfield. And you want him at CB?

He's a direct frontplayer where none of that matters. All that matters when he plays up top is that he's big and quite good in the air and has shown he can score a bunch of goals from that position.

850~~~
He'd be fine to try as a CB in a stable defence. He wouldn't be this all magical defence fixing player who solves all our problems but I can't see him being a world shattering liability at CB.
He's played less time in his career as an attacking player than he has as a central or defensive midfield player. Just because he ran up field and banged a few goals in for 30 games doesn't mean that it is the only way we're going to ever be able to utilize him and the world is going to cease to exist because some United fans think that he can't play any other position than a target man up the field.

Relax, he can't do any worse than our current crop of midfielders has been producing. One has already been banished, one rarely plays and another has gone out on loan. If he's sat on the pine in a position to deputize for Herrera, Di Maria (who I would prefer to see as more of a 10 than a deeper player in a 4-3-3 if I am being honest) and/or Blind(Carrick) the sky is not going to come crashing down on you. It's okay.

851~~~
Fellaini as a CB <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This place has gone mental.

852~~~
I thought they were taking the piss or something but to my disbelieve they are serious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

853~~~
I keep forgetting he plays for us, it's great.

854~~~
Who is suggesting that this is a legitimate solution and must be tried? It's no different to central defensive players playing at fullback, wingers playing centrally and strikers playing withdrawn roles. I see nothing wrong with having a crack at putting him at CB and seeing what happens. It may not end well but how do you know if you don't try?

What if while Blackett is suspsended Rojo and Smalling pick up simultaneous injuries? Is it mental to try and move other players to CB before dipping into the reserves for another 18/19yo?

855~~~
And hes played less time in his career as a £20 million+ valued footballer who attracted a top team

1 season, 1 big move.

He didnt convince anyone to sign him when he was playing as a central midfielder, theres a reason for that

He's a more versatile Andy Carrol, and the thing about versatile players is that they still have 1 position where they are best and the others not as good. He is best as a forward

856~~~
Player is transferred for a sum of money and gets payed to play football, shock horror. Alert the press, it's time to start panicking, reality is shattering and the demon world is bleeding in on the real one. His fee and price tag have no effect on his football. Lets see him injury free and contributing properly before we start lighting the torches and amassing the populace to march on Old Trafford to oust him.
There could be (are is more likely) many reasons. You've just decided to grip tightly onto your perceived notion that he is a terrible footballer and you're not letting go of it.

"He must play as a forward, best as a forward, scored goals as a forward lalalalala not listening"

'A more versatile Andy Carrol', jesus wept. Lets see him fit and playing in the shirt for an extended period before we go into meltdown mode.

857~~~
You are amazing at missing points.

It was his work as a front player that led to his big move. So it doesnt matter that he's played there less than he has as a CM. As as CM he was staying at Everton

858~~~
This. Aside from his ability in the air he has zero other traits that would make him even a competant CB.

859~~~
You're amazing at denying Fellaini existed before July 2012. Chelsea were actively interested and apparently Madrid were offered a 25m Euro price in 2012.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZMeaorRiKzU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This was posted the other day in another thread and it is an interesting watch, there is barely any hoofing going on really. Apart from the odd one, Moyes looks happier and hey, he won a MOTM award, good on him. A lot of cut backs though.

There is no denying for Belgium there is a lot of dishing off and legging it into the box for the cross. A simple 'don't do that' would probably suffice to keep him in a deeper position.

860~~~
Fellaini gets a lot of unfair stick and I still think he could go on to be a very useful player for us. Not as a CB though. Just no.

861~~~
For sure, nobody on the opposite side of the coin is saying he is a legitimate solution to playing at CB though. If worst came to worst and he was fit and 'in form' he'd probably be tried before one of the ressies.

862~~~
So rumours are transfers now. You really went off the deep end

863~~~
It would have to be a helluva crisis for him to get games there. Above him in my pecking order would be: Jones, Evans, Smalling, Rojo, Blackett, Shaw, Carrick and Fletcher. Obviously most of them are defenders anyway and Carrick and Fletcher have done the role in the past.

Fellaini's biggest issue is sensing danger. The amount of times his man just makes simple runs off the back of him and he just doesn't know what's gone on is frightening.

864~~~

865~~~
Exactly, it wasn't great but nobody is suggesting it was complete madness. It was what it was.

So far, injured are Jones, Evans and Carrick. Blackett is suspended. (Mind you Fellaini isn't match fit, although I have seen him training lately). He's literally an injury away from possibly having to step in and play there, would that be classified as madness? Extreme worst case scenario of course.
What are you on about? Off the deep end?... I answered your question. Two teams enquired about him while he played as a central midfield which was prior to the 12/13 season. I've literally stepped into a puddle and I am floundering in the deep end, well played.

866~~~
I stated the fact that he got his big move after playing as a forward. He stayed at Everton after playing seasons as a central midfielder

You refuted this with rumours of going to Chelsea, missing the point entirely

867~~~
I think it's somewhat irrelevant what he was doing immediately before he got his big move since the thing that got him his big move wasn't his play as a forward, or his play as a central midfielder, but the fact that Moyes went to United and wanted to take 2 of his favourite players with him.

868~~~
Real Madrid never inquired about Fellaini from Everton fwiw. None of the more reliable media outlets (BBC, Guardian, Telegraph etc) reported it. The gist of it is laughable in itself :

Yeah ok Metro. That seems believable.

869~~~
Thats definitely a factor, but we'd have paid half as much for him the season before when he was playing as a central midfielder

He raised his profile and interest in him by being more effective as a forward player than as a central midfielder.

870~~~
Probably having the goals to his name would be an extra bargaining chip but I doubt it would be that much less had they sold him a season earlier since Everton paid £15m on him and would surely want a decent profit to sell one of their players to Manchester United.

871~~~
And we'd have gone elsewhere because he's clearly not worth it as a central midfielder. 

With him being such an important player, scoring goals up front for Everton and causing us problems, we bit the bullet and paid a lot more for him than we should have.

872~~~
I reckon Moyes would still have took him to be honest. It seemed nailed on.

873~~~
It is completely irrelevant and probably goes to further point out that his last contract had the same price as a release clause of 25m Euro, which is something resembling his point that nobody else payed it. United however did. (Speculating, without actually checking, it's a moot point so I am not going to bother) I see that it makes little difference either way, it's literally clinging to some random speck of a particular argument and shoving fingers in his ears saying 'lalalala im not budging' like I said above. We payed the money, we have the player and he's struggled with various parts of his career to date. Simply saying certain things about him doesn't automatically make them true.

On the subject of Moyes bringing him in I believe we looked at other targets and probably wouldn't have signed him had Herrera signed. Plus if he had have stayed fit then we probably would have had a better player to complement Carrick.

Again, in this scenario it's hardly his fault, just gotta make do with the tools you have. It happened so there is no real point throwing a big hissy fit over it, in my eyes.

874~~~
I quite like him but he has his limitations. Plus I was responding to comments that wanted Fellaini to play defensive roles that require tactical nou; I want him to have an attacking one or an aggressive one. I--and I'm sure LvG too--prefer organised defenses but don't mind a few terriers in attack.

875~~~
Let Herrera and Di Maria be the terriers. I personally don't want to see him dish off and just run forward like he did last year and for Belgium. It makes his role near on pointless and as well buys into the phenomenon of fans vehemently abusing him.

A Blind role with a 'don't get forward and make sure to keep shape with the defense' private chat is all I'd really like to see him actually get a shot at. Anywhere else just gives me a 'well.. I guess' kind of feeling.

876~~~
Going back to the Blind comparisons, it isn't laughable to suggest that Fellaini is a better player. I know people are blinded by their hate but he did actually play CM for Everton and put in some good performances. Blind has had one good performance for us and did relatively well in the Dutch league. Blind will probably be the better player but I don't think it is as one sided as everyone here thinks.

877~~~
when did he play well for Everton at CM? It is like saying Valencia played well for us at RB. He had some games there, mostly average performances. Nowher near good enough to play there for us under van Gaal. His passing, vision and posiitional awareness are not good enough. The only position he could play for us is behind the striker or instead of Di Maria/Herrera as a box to box, both suggestions are laughable. He isnt good enough at DM and i dont want to see him at CB if he cant play the other positions. Sell him and get some decent money in or keep him to throw him in for the last minutes to cause some havoc with long ball tactics.

878~~~
Prior to 2012/13.

879~~~
This is what I was thinking, the same guy keeps re-registering and going down the same pro Fellaini rant path before being banned, the weird thing is how he keeps getting promoted so fast, almost like it's a sock account of someone with privileges.

880~~~
Yup. 

It's really sad tbf. Learning no lessons. Two things always give him away and are instantly noticeable in the posting style :

<b>1.</b> The word dish off and get/ run forward. Never seen anyone else use it to describe Fellaini's playing style. Trademark goldenstate/ phenix rising stuff :

Exhibit 1 :

Exhibit 2 :

<b>2.</b> Excessive use of ' ' when it's not necessarily required :

Exhibit 1 :

Exhibit 2 :

881~~~
This is some real Nancy Drew stuff here. Why am I tagged in this post? I've been reading these threads since we signed him last season and because I've pinched someone else's terminology and used it a couple of times I must be that user?

Weirdo.

882~~~
Does anyone think Fellaini could play on the wing for us, he can't be any worse than Valencia?

883~~~
Or maybe at centre back? The big lump

884~~~
Ok goldie.

885~~~
The entire squad probably fits that description.

886~~~
Because he has some sense of technical ability or pace that is hitherto undiscovered?

887~~~
I'm confused, are we playing him on the wing or at centre back? Or keeper? 

Can we just get rid.

888~~~
It is the afro weighing him down, shave it off and he'll be the new Theo - god forbid.

889~~~
Octagonal peg, triangle hole. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's going to return with a new hairstyle....

892~~~
He should go for dreads.

893~~~
Hope it's a pink afro and he'll get picked every match just to piss people off.

894~~~
Player we don't need returning from injury.

Yay ?

895~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

896~~~
Oh my God feck yes. Hammerhead, just before the match with the hammers, it's a sign.

897~~~
Seriously? haha. With that new hair and Di Maria cross, he will score a lot of headers.

898~~~
LvG should force him to shave it, he just looks ridiculous.

I wouldn't mind Fellaini being given a game against West Ham to be honest. It'll be a physical battle against there midfield, and we could use a bit of size and power.

Blind holding, with Fellaini and Herrera box to box and AdM as a #10

899~~~
Twat

900~~~
I'm so glad he's fully focused on football... *sigh*

901~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> What a joke he is!

902~~~
They looked quite fast in midfield against Liverpool with Kouyate pushing on and Noble holding. I think the pace of the match would be too much for Fellaini. He could be useful for defending set pieces if we're hanging on late in the game though or at least he would foul to break up their attacks, nobody fouled Leicester to stop their momentum last weekend.

903~~~
Elbows di Maria. Odd how suddenly some see Fellaini as our saviour all of a sudden.

904~~~
Kouyate is injured. It'll probably be Noble, Song and Nolan.

905~~~
I agree but what makes you think Fellaini offers that? He lost almost every header against a Guardiola team that probably doesn't practice heading the ball that often.

He'll give us great chest control and a guaranteed arm in somebody's face.

906~~~
He's a physical player. He had a poor year last year but so did everyone else. He's far more physical than anyone else we have in midfield, not that that says much.

907~~~
God I wish he'd feck off.

908~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I love how people use the Bayern match to say he has no heading ability, it is ridiculous. Yes, he lost a few headers in that game. But I can think of countless matches where his aerial ability was strong and he won headers, but sure let's focus on that one game and pretend like it is the norm.

909~~~
The guys hair in that photo is just pure embarrassing, he never has been a united quality player & never will be in my eyes. Fellaini, Young, Anderson, Valencia, Rafael, Smalling & Evans are all under threat in my opinion as there quality doesn't meet the standards we need to be meeting & then setting.

910~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> check out the fecking melon on this bloke.

911~~~
Some pathetic reactions in here.

912~~~
He will be sold at the earliest opportunity, January is possible as he won't be cuptied in Europe.

913~~~
Thats the problem with responding to something without knowing the full details.

914~~~
I'll give him another chance. If everyone else got one this season, so does he. Don't think he is a DM but he might have some luck with a few more midfielders around him.

915~~~
Stupid unwarranted hate for him on here. It's as if none of you have seen what he can do for Everton. As far as I'm concerned he's much better than the likes of Cleverly, Valencia and young. If we have room for players like that we have room for players like Fellaini.

916~~~
agreed 100%

917~~~
Eh yeah! Some of us have seen what he did for Everton and it's not how we play!

You want the best out of Fellaini? You put him up front, punt balls up to him and give him licence to elbow the shit out of defenders. A mate of mine, who supports Everton says he was only ever good for that and laughed at me when we bought him.
A Liverpool supporting mate of mine, whose actually decent, holds him and Moyes as the biggest frauds in football!

Cleverley, Valencia and Young, when giving the duty, have all stuck with their men! This clown goes wondering! No passing ability, no defensive discipline, no passing ability, no ability to read the game, all he has is use his elbows, his hair and bully boy tactics.

Ha, even then, we all remember when Liverpool strolled to a 3-0 win against last season? When Gerrard elbowed him in the head? Oh he wasn't up for it then was he?!?! No!! He shat himself and stayed quiet for the rest of the game.

He says he wants to emulate Keano, Robbo and the likes...Well, they wouldn't have backed down from that.....In 1999, Keane went up for a header with Viera. Veira tried to elbow him in the face and Keane went for him big time......You may say it's unfair to compare but, that's what Fellaini wants. His own words. Not mine

918~~~
<a class="username" data-user="48226, @SilentWitness" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48226/">@SilentWitness</a> can you tell us if <a class="username" data-user="66348, @.Rossi" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66348/">@.Rossi</a> here's mate is telling the truth?

919~~~
Honestly, he could not believe the money we paid for him. He laughed
He said, it was fine for how Everton played but, his best position was up top and that we'd be stupid to drop RVP, Rooney or even Welbeck for him up there. His own words

920~~~
Exactly. You haven't seen him play and go by what your "mate" has been telling you. Again with the "he only played upfront" myth. Go back and watch some of his games in midfield. He played box to box against arsenal and did pretty good - much better than the likes of Clevs, Valencia or Young do now a days. 

You haven't followed his career. You don't know how he plays so I'd suggest not to make stupid comments such as "all he has is use his elbows, his hair and bully boy tactics". It's evident you're just basing him on his performances on last season.

921~~~
Well it's hardly a stupid comment on my behalf when I'm basing it from when I watched him play, last season, for MY team now is it?!?!?! Don't be so patronising!!
My mate is a hardcore Everton fan. I don't follow them so, I'm going by his word! And anytime I watched him play for Everton, he wasn't exactly the stand out player

Box to box against Arsenal?!?! You are joking right?!?! The same Arsenal we bossed in midfield with Park Ji Sung?!?!

Oh, and let's not forget Fellaini's interview some weeks back...Which was very telling

922~~~
Well said, 90% of this thread in a nutshell.

923~~~
Oh Ok.....Drop RVP, Rooney and Falcao for him then.
Better yet, play him in midfield, protecting the back four, where he wants to be the new "Roy Keane" ....He wasn't very good there was he?!

924~~~
Nice thing he did for charity, still needs selling at the earliest possible opportunity.

925~~~
Please read what others are saying. No one has suggested that. He has the potential to be a very valuable squad player and gives us a different option for some matches. If you haven't followed his career there's no need to comment about his playing ability.



Exactly my point. The guy single-handedly won games for Everton against top opposition but he never stood out as the stand out player to you. It's ironic because he had a pretty decent outing once against YOUR team on an opening day of Sir Alex Ferguson's last season. 

Yeah so playing well against Arsenal counts for nothing. Unless he has bossed Chelsea in midfield he is not eligible to be a squad player for Man United. And tell your mate and every other Everton fan you see that it's nice to see where their club are right now. I thought they were finally "relieved" with Moyes gone and Martinez was the guy they needed? I can assure you that 90 percent of Everton fans would not want to see Fellaini leave. Now that he's had a terrible season their just trying to "prove" that they knew this all along.

926~~~
Oh Ok.....I must buy the boxset, "Fellaini, the golden years! U12s - U18s" before I can make a good judgement. Good Jesus......I don't follow Barcelona so, I best not make a judgement on Messi....He could be shit for all I know <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Single handedly.....Good Jesus. No one wins a match on their own!

Again, you are ignoring that Fellaini came out and said he's not part of the first team plan at all, at the moment in a recent interview. He said he's going to have to fight and train his balls off to get a look in.....Yet, we have a guy, coming back from a career threatening illness, who is part of the plan....Does that not seem at all off to you no?!

Listen, I admire your persistent defense of the guy...It's endearing if nowt else...But, sooner or later, you'll concede defeat

It's like saying "Oh this is Anderson's year" in 2013.....Which btw, I must check again to see who said that

927~~~
To be fair, Fellaini did dominate against us most of the time when we played Everton. We didn't have anyone who could deal with his size.

928~~~
<a class="username" data-user="66348, @.Rossi" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66348/">@.Rossi</a> You sound like a bit of a tool here to be honest. There is no need to get so snarky over your ignorance being called out. You keep repeating the same type of things over and over that make it obvious you haven't watched him, or know where his strengths lie.

I'm off to check on those comments as well. I am not sure he said he had no chance - I thought he just said there was competition and he aspired to be the best person for the first XI in the managers eyes. Not really sure what is wrong with that at all, if anything. Placating a bunch of toddler fans who are desperate to see the player leave would be very low on his priority list. I would think, anyway.

929~~~
Offensively I think he is good at heading (attacking the ball to head on goal) but defensively I'm not so sure, I haven't seen enough to judge in all fairness but I don't want to because I have seen too many times when the ref is not looking he just throws his arms in someone's face.

Last thing we need is him getting sent off.

930~~~
That's not true, i'm not trying to say bad thing against Fellaini but even in his best period he was at best, the 5th best player in Everton's team behind at least Baines, Jagielka, Distin and Howard.
Fellaini has been very good for Everton but never their best player.

931~~~
He dominated against us once, in that famous 2012/13 opening game. Where he bullied Carrick, playing at CB, in the air. 

Vardy also dominated us at the weekend but I certainly wouldn't want him at United.

932~~~
Blind obviously has a lot to prove in England, but hes also a completely different type of player. What hes better at, hes far better at than Fellaini. But hes not going to play as a forward and score goals

933~~~
If, based on his Everton performances, he was a United level player, it's strange no one activated his buyout clause until his manager at Everton was (over) promoted to the United job. If you are still playing for a top 10 team into your mid-20s, then, in the absence of a Le Tissier-like sense of loyalty, it means you have probably found your level.

934~~~
Yeah, while he was very good for Everton most of the time, I don't think I can really remember a lot of transfer windows where it seemed as if Everton were <i>really </i>struggling to hold onto him. Ironically, of course, in the season he left he ended up dropping down the table, compared to where he would have been with his old club.

935~~~
If he starts against West Ham and wins a few headers we might be lucky enough to have fat Sam bid for him in January.  I'd take £10m for him, prob cost us another few million to supplement his wages over the next few years though.

936~~~
Wouldn't surprise me actually, he'd be perfect for a side like West Ham. Considering how he's been here, £10m would be a good deal for us as well. No club is going to pay a lot more for someone who obviously doesn't have much of a future here, and it'd be great to get his wages off the bill.

937~~~
<a class="username" data-user="92057, @Smoke On the Water" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/92057/">@Smoke On the Water</a> 
You call me an ignorant tool, so do expect me to reply in a serious tone? Purely on the basis I haven't "followed his career" btw
For what its worth, I would be saying the same things if he was at Everton. . In fact, I did

938~~~
In terms of "best" player in skill and talent I don't know but there have been numerous matches that he was the "best player on the pitch" for them. BTW, Distin doesn't really belong on that list.

939~~~
If we had appointed any manager other than Moyes he wouldn’t be here, if he was regarded by other managers as highly as a lot of people like to make out £23.5m was a bargain. However other managers knew that to get the best out of him you have to give him freedom and make sure you hit lots of long balls into his chest and head. He is a wrecking ball you send out to rough people up, bully players in the air and cause problems by simply getting any player in your back 4 to lump balls up to him. That is what he did at Everton, that’s what he is good at, it doesn’t matter how many times we play him or where we play him if we don’t play to his strengths he is a waste of space, as a box to box or defensive midfielder he is only an average do a job type player but use him as moyes did at Everton and he is effective enough to cause problems for anyone.

Writing is on the wall for him, he will go in one of the next two windows, not because he is a bad player but because he doesn’t fit in and we don’t need him.

940~~~
Why is he being criticized for doing charity work <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> ? Wtf is wrong with some of you ?

941~~~
Welcome to Fellaini thread, sanity and common sense do not apply here.

942~~~
Aye, that is harsh

943~~~
Be nice to see the big man at some part of the game tomorrow. Had a very good game against West Ham last season, and has looked bright in the very few minutes he's had so far this season.

EDIT:

I'd like to see him come on for Di Maria if we've got like a two goal lead, having a midfield three of:

944~~~
I'm not his biggest fan, but I want him to be given a proper chance under a better manager than Moyes. Regardless, I think he could come in use tomorrow, if he's fit. I think Blind could get bullied at DM if West Ham play a physical game, and the centre back pairing we field is likely to be a very inexperienced one. Fellaini could be usefull dropping back and getting under a few lofted balls and crosses. Just as long as he doesn't assault anyone, he could do well there. Just sit tight, and don't maraud forward. Leave that to Di Maria and Herrera.

945~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/iktGuRp2pf4t0.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/iktGuRp2pf4t0.gif"/> 

Just stumbled across this, must be the first time I've seen this goal, pretty decent.

The lad get a hell of a lot unwarranted criticism.

946~~~
I'm not a Fellaini fan at all, just to make that clear.  Has he been cleared to play tomorrow?  If so, we could probably use his menacing demeanor to cope with West Ham tomorrow after we take a two goal lead on them.

947~~~
He's got some excellent highlights whilst at Everton. His touch and passing was often excellent. He had some great games against us too, and for more than just being a a physical clogger. It hasn't worked for him here yet, but I don't doubt his ability. He's a good player, and I still believe Van Gaal could get something out of him. If Fellaini can follow instruction, then I see him doing a decent job.

948~~~
I thought he was miles off been ready, could be useful from the bench if he is fit.

At least the guy isn't spitting his dummy out about his situation like a few have, and wants to stay and fight for his place, may not be enough but nice to see.

949~~~
Fellaini's good for Manchester United in Fifa 14 and 15. So far that's all I can say positive about his input in the new club.

Time for him to step up and just play the goddamn quality football.... in Manchester United. Please !?

950~~~
But but but I've been told by everyone here that he doesn't have a first touch <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

951~~~
Marouane is a good niche player that can look excellent with certain types of styles. The downside is that in the wrong style of play he's can look mediocre. The bigger issue is that he's being scapegoated for Moyes despite the fact that United offered him the money and transfer. What was he supposed to say? No, I don't think I'll take a pay raise or be part of the biggest club in England.

He's got value for United but given that the team hasn't figured itself out yet it's a bit harsh to run him off without seeing what he can bring to the table. Maybe it won't work out, but it's not like he has zero pedigree. He's capable of influencing games.

952~~~
I'd rather see Fellaini on the pitch than Darren Fletcher that's for sure.

953~~~
He can do a job in the midfield diamond, it'll help him to have competent midfield teammates like di Maria and Herrera.

954~~~
he played behind the striker for the goal, he would never be in this position for us. There is a big differnece in delivering for Everton and delivering for United. He would never score that goal for us. He has a lot of pressure now to save his career here, but in the end will be sold.

955~~~
Sense!

Not to mention when he was giving a certain role, he continuously lost his man and that cost us before

956~~~
The same Park that never gave Pirlo a kick of the ball also buddy!

957~~~
I hope he gets a chance as he has quality no doubt. Last year it was his first season (he had injury problems with operations) plus the team and club were in disarray hardly a great environment to settle in.

958~~~
I don't see what 'job' he could do for us. He's hardly the steel we need in midfield. He doesn't rough people up a bit and make his presence felt or intimidate the opposition, he just incessantly gives away niggly, pathetic fouls. As for every other footballing quality, he's inferior to the three we currently have in midfield positionally and technically.

959~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/456515644-marouane-fellaini-of-manchester-united-in-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=GkZZ8bf5zL1ZiijUmxa7Qfv8lEKRHsixiUHioG2UlJtQLrCVpeTEIaYkEwShpyW71JCY66T3Wbr3uSzL9Lkcdo5G4YPqeWjpzYfBsyeesD8%3d" src="http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/456515644-marouane-fellaini-of-manchester-united-in-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=GkZZ8bf5zL1ZiijUmxa7Qfv8lEKRHsixiUHioG2UlJtQLrCVpeTEIaYkEwShpyW71JCY66T3Wbr3uSzL9Lkcdo5G4YPqeWjpzYfBsyeesD8%3d"/>

He's back! If we play the diamond against Everton, with Herrera currently out, I'd replace him with Fellaini. I feel he's much more suited to the box to box role than Fletcher, as he's more of a threat going forward and has the stamina to get back. 

I would play a midfield diamond of:

960~~~
He should be as far away from the team as physically possible.

961~~~
FFS! He's not that bad.

962~~~
I suppose that is close to the position he plays for Belgium so could cover quite well for Herrera.

Im not sure which of Fellaini and Carrick are closer to full fitness though or even if either is ready to start on Sunday.

963~~~
Fletcher or Carrick will come in. This boy is finished at United

964~~~
Erm no, Fletcher is finished at united and Carrick should be phased out in the next 18 months/2 years or so. He has the chance to impress now (if fit) so hopefully we can see the better side of Fellaini to come. He is most definitely better than Fletcher and offers a lot more.

965~~~
I don't think so. Fletcher is finished and he still has more to offer than Fellaini. Fellaini doesn't have a future here, if he didn't get injured he'd be at Napoli right now. LVG clearly doesn't rate him, and playing him will only give him further confirmation after he sees how shit he is. He simply doesn't fit in with what LVG is trying to do here. Mid table team player.

966~~~
Fellaini's now got his chance to prove himself now that Herrera's injured. Most likely, against Everton, it'll be either him or Fletcher who'll play at the right side of midfield.

The box-to-box role on the right side is perfect for Fellaini. He won't have to worry about screening the defence (Blind), and he won't be the main man in midfield to create chances (di Maria + Mata/Januzaj). However, what he'll need to show is that he can dictate the game and provide options to others. In terms of technique, he can't offer what Herrera can, and in terms of dictating play, I doubt he can also do what Herrera can. However, if we play with Mata or Januzaj at the tip, then all Fellaini has to do is add passing options for others, keep the ball moving, link up with others, and contribute on both ends of the pitch.

With Fletcher not being his usual energetic self, Anderson being left-footed, and Pereira not having the energy levels (yet) to play a box-to-box role, Fellaini is the best replacement in midfield for Herrera.

967~~~
Too early to pass judgement based on Moyes era. He did have a good career at Everton and if best, he is useful as a backup. Lucky for him, he is making a comebakc when Herrera is injured. So can slot right into his slot. 

Let's see. I'm still undecided on Fellaini...for now.

968~~~
Fellaini for me should start the more I think about it. He isn't as good technically as Ander, but given a license to roam forward he'll be a bit of a battering ram on that side of the pitch. Him bursting into the box will give AdM options to cross into, along with Falcao and RvP.

Note, I'm currently taking tramadol for pain relief, so if I'm talking nonsense I blame them!

969~~~
I don't rate Fellaini at all but I would place him ahead of Fletcher right now. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I like Fletcher but he has been very poor in the games that he played and looks really past it physically. Fellaini can do a decent job without the spotlight on him and he will have lesser defensive and offensive responsibilities with Blind and Di Maria alongside him. Meaning he can be more economical and provide a bit of a physical presence and steel in the middle of the park. He hasn't managed to do it so far at United but he clearly knows he has a point to prove and has to play for his future. If he plays, I hope he is more positionally disciplined and provides cover for Di Maria alongside Blind instead of running around aimlessly like a headless Bebe... Hope fans don't sarcastically cheer him as well, that wasn't too nice.

970~~~
Fellaini won't be 'bursting into the box'. He's got absolutely zero dynamism to his game. He'll sit back pretending to be a defensive midfielder. He can't be and won't ever be a box to box midfielder because of his total lack of mobility and technique, and he can't and won't ever be a DM because he has awful positioning and horrific awareness; all of which was evident from watching him last season. I'd even start Fletcher over him.

971~~~
He's hardly had a chance to even play under Van Gaal.

972~~~
He's not nearly as bad as you make out, are you sure LVG does not rate him ? He will get a chance to impress and he will be playing a position he knows with a defensive shield behind him, Fellaini's worst asset should be his best (looking at him) and that's defensively but it's clearly not, with Blind behind him, he can basically do the same job he did in his best season at Everton. 
Bonus points are that if he does play well and get a run going we will have another asset this season the other being it will push his price up when the axe inevitably does fall.

973~~~
If Fellaini started the next 3 games and did well in them all there'd be plenty in here that'd still be calling him shit. There's barely any point trying to talk sense in this thread at times, the hyperbole in some posts is cartoonish stuff.

974~~~
He hasn't showed no where near his full potential at you lot so i can understand why everyone wants rid but he is easilly good enough to be back up. I have seen him dominate the game even from a deeper position against the leagues top teams so i know he has it in him. I hope he can turn it round at yous because i like him a lot.

975~~~
I'm willing to give him another chance to prove he has a place in the team, even as a squad player. With Herrera's injury it's time for Fellaini to prove his point.

976~~~
But he look so clumsy and useless everytime i watch him. Like Crouch in midfield. I really don't rate him, even less in LVG philosophy which is build on maintaining possesion.

Edit: LVG want from players to pass the ball and hoof it as less as possible and that take away Fellaini main strength (last year he was bad even in the air).

977~~~
I think we should give him a chance. Better than Fletcher and an aging and just recovered from injury Carrick.

978~~~
I Would give him a chance at least until we bring in some more midfield quality.

979~~~
As other mentioned, with Herrera out, this would be a great opportunity for Fellaini to try and win over his critics(myself included). I would love to see that midfield against Everton this Sunday and hopefully his presence will not disrupt our free flowing football from our midfield seen with Herrera the matches that he has done well in. Moreover, he lessen the defense burden for Di Maria and gives him more freedom/space to attack.

980~~~
Sounds weird saying it, but I'd like to see him over Fletcher.

981~~~
Fellaini has been out for 6 weeks. Since the World Cup he has had 2 sub appearances for us (approx 45 mins in total). Unless LVG tears up his selection guidelines, he won't be starting Fellaini against Everton after one week's training with the first team, though he could possibly be considered fit enough for the bench.

982~~~
Can say the same about Anderson. Should he get a chance under a new manager too?

983~~~
You know Van Gaal is either going to either play him or Valencia on that side. He wants a right footer. If he plays Fellaini, which I doubt because he's just returning from injury, I'd fear for lack of protection for Rafael. Herrera was excellent in covering that flank and making tackles defensively before the opposition overloaded that side. Valencia might actually be a safer option.

984~~~
He is a big lad and will stand up for his teammates (Januzaj) if got bullied.

That's the only strength I could think of what he could offer.

985~~~
Nothing weird about it at all. I do as well as I think Fletch is finished and will get bullied.

986~~~
Nothing against him but he doesn’t fit into the style of play or formation and the last thing we need him doing in the diamond formation is just running in straight lines up and down the pitch waiting for long balls and crosses, he needs to play with some awareness and intelligence but that isn’t really his game. Having said that with Carrick injured he is best option to fill in for Herrera though because there is no-one else, Fletcher and Anderson are both finished at this level so if Fellaini is fit he has to play.

He will need to be more disciplined but the writing is on the wall for his Utd career unless he improves dramatically, he won’t get time, he doesn’t have a manager that rates him highly so it is a case of either proving people wrong or being sold. I still think he was a poor signing who won’t fit in and he will go in one of the next two transfer windows but we are still short in midfield so I would be happy to be proved wrong.

987~~~
Play him at cb <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

988~~~
I hope he plays on Sunday, however I think he'll probably be on the bench due to not being fit enough maybe.
Whilst I don't think he is a great player, I find some of the criticism of him on here way over the top. He actually put in some pretty decent performances in CM last season, its not his fault he was then asked to play as a 10 and have balls hoofed up to him.
He is slow and a bit clumsy at times, however he is strong and always seems to look for the pass forward rather than the sideways pass, I think he can definitely do a job IMO, at the very least he is a lot better than Fletcher.

989~~~
I wouldn't. He's poor, he didn't even fit into David Moyes' plans and no one knows what they were! He's slow, lumbering and he would provide no protection for the full-back or anything going forward whatsoever.

990~~~
He has a big advantage over Fletcher. We've seen Fletcher recently, we haven't seen Fellaini recently. That's about it.

991~~~
He is one of the worst players to ever put on a MUFC jersey.
He just needs to GO

992~~~
I literally feel the hatred seeping out of this thread <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Give him a chance, new season, new manager, new tactics, new players might bring out the best of him.

993~~~
Seriously? It's not going to happen. He doesn't suit the way we play nor will he ever. It's as plain as day to see. He can't control a football, he hasn't displayed the ability to pick a pass, he loves elbows and he hasn't got the engine to be able to make it box-to-box effectively. 

But hey! He can chest it down with the best of them.

994~~~
Everton saw the best of him, I doubt we ever will here because we will never play in a way that will suit him. Just a question of whether he can play a role as a squad player or not and if he is happy being a backup player.

995~~~
The idea of seeing him play against Everton is really growing on me.

996~~~
If he plays and scores a winner by it spanging off his arse I'll take it.

We need momentum (although I heard he's tied down to a long contract with his current club).

Liquid lunch, soz.

997~~~
Is that not a significant point though? LVG will have a plan for him, and it might get the best out of him too. He's not half as bad as people on here make out. Fletcher has been absolute muck whenever he's played this season and I don't want him near the team. I'd be willing to at least offer Fellaini a chance on that note.

998~~~
Well Anderson played 90 mins against MK Dons and didn't impress. Plus, they're two complete different situation for me.

Anderson has been here for what, seven years, when our team was winning titles, and up to now hasn't really had a consistent season (obviously unlucky with injuries). Fellaini, on the other hand, has been here for one season, most of it which he was injured, in our worst campaign for a very long time. Hardly comparable. 

If it had been the other way round, I would have said the same thing.

999~~~
An argument whose better between Fletcher, Fellaini, Ando and Carrick. No wonder we're in such sad situation

1000~~~
Carrick > Fellaini > Fletcher > Anderson.

1001~~~
The fact that Valencia will likely be picked over all of them on Sunday doesn't make it any better either.

1002~~~
Not a bad option really, he can replicate what Di Maria does, of working hard, but getting wide to cross.

1003~~~
Same for me, I would play Valencia as the lesser of two evils.  Valencia is at least fast with the ball, he'll have Rafael to work with, and I actually think he defends better than Fellaini.  IMO we lose less when playing Valencia.

Fellaini has said that he wants to prove himself but the writing is already on the wall for him.  He would've been loaned if he hadn't been injured.  He will only get playing time if we are out of other options.

1004~~~
We will not play Valencia in the centre, never considered it as an option. We will play who ever is fitter out of Carrick and Fellaini.

I would like to see Fellaini be given a chance to show what he can do. I was also very impatient with him last season, this was mostly due to the direct connection with Moyes and the "we are not f*ing Everton" feeling that I associated with him when he was on the pitch, even if he was doing his job fairly well.

It's time to give him a fair chance. Watching back some of the Fellaini vs west brom, Fellaini vs west ham etc. videos on youtube from last season, he was not the appallling player I seem to have judged him to be. Big presence in the midfield, able to win the ball back quick. aerial ability, players hate to go in to a tackle with a player like Fellaini your gonna get a hard knock everytime you do, especially when he flairs those elbows out like an old cockney chimney sweep stage dancer. The stuff about a bad first touch is bollocks too.

1005~~~
I wouldnt trust Felliani in front of the back four, he is too dozy, we say it last season how he just switches off and ball watches, he is very much a reactive player rather than proactive.

1006~~~
Wouldnt Blind be the player infront of the back 4?

1007~~~
I'm all for him being given a proper chance, but only out of necessity, when one of Herrara, Di Maria, and Blind are injured/rested. We need to establish a first side that understands it's style of play, tactics, etc. Excessive rotation has fecked us royally in the past.

I like Fellaini. I hope he stays. If we get into the CL next season I want him in the rotation. He is a good player and he deserves a chance. Just not at the expense of our first 11 developing a rhythm.

1008~~~
Wouldnt you move Blind out left, Di Maria out right and keep some ball carrying/crossing ability?

1009~~~
Blind
Fellaini     Di maria

1010~~~
He's a reasonable forward for a West Ham or Stoke. Dreadful midfielder who gets caught ball watching constantly, can't pass, and fouls aimlessly and needlessly way too much.

1011~~~
Came on and did absolutely nothing. He doesn't even add energy to the team as a fresh sub.

1012~~~
He didn't do much wrong today to be fair to him, although didn't do much that was impressive either.

1013~~~
Was like 3 seconds off the pace, chasing shadows.

1014~~~
The man is absolutely glacial.

1015~~~
If he so had came on as a time wasting sub in injury time to play one minute there would have been someone who just had to bump this thread to criticise him.

1016~~~
Just confirming how shite he is. 

I was enjoying pretending he didn't exsist.

1017~~~
I can see him starting against West Brom.

But today he offered nothing as a sub and it was a very poor decision to throw him in for his first minutes in 2 months against the Everton tide. Didn't get close to Barry at all for that free kick at the end.

1018~~~
This is the type of match he should be coming on as a second striker, not a midfielder with defensive responsibilities.

1019~~~
I was gonna ask: what did he do? Valencia was levels above him.

Agree, we need to stop with this Fellaini in midfield lark. He is not a midfielder of any real quality. Put him behind the front man and we could've used him as a target for the last 15-20.

1020~~~
Why did he come on for Valencia who was doing well enough ?

Should have come on for Mata or RVP so we could hoof it to him and let Wilson play off him.

1021~~~
He didn't really do enough to gauge his performance I didn't think. He's obviously missed a lot of football and came back on and took a little bit to adjust to the pace, no surprise there.

1022~~~
Positionally he was so lost. 

They ran through our centre of midfield so easily when he came on

1023~~~
Absolute passenger. Didn't do anything bad, but didn't even bring anything positive to the table. And that's what gets my goat. 19 year Paddy McNair has shown more and had more decisive moments in 2 games than Fellaini in his United career.

1024~~~
Bit of headless chicken pressing left us open at times. He's dreadful in that CDM position.

1025~~~
Interesting that Van Gaal put Fellaini on over Fletcher, but it was hard for him to get into the game, especially as Everton were pushing to get the equaliser and had the upper hand. 

He's been out for about a month and has only been in training for a week. He's not going to be at his sharpest yet.

1026~~~
Poor sub by Van Gaal. Was he even completely match fit? You don't bring on a player like that to play an important midfield role in close game with only 1 goal in it.

1027~~~
Ok, he's useless. Offered nothing when coming on.

1028~~~
Completely let his man go on their corner (the guy Fellaini was 'marking' was free to make the shot that Blackett blocked).

1029~~~
I thought he started well when he came on. Sat beside Blind and shored things up a bit. Then he just started running all over the place.

1030~~~
I wanted him to come on for Valencia, but he's officially useless I see. Pointless player.

1031~~~
All he did was chase shadows and make odd off the ball forward runs at the wrong time.

1032~~~
He has absolutely zero awareness of what is going around him. He's come on the right side of a diamond and left Baines and Oviedo free to get at Rafael. Could easily have cost us.

1033~~~
Absolute shite. Broke the defensive line to go running after the ball completely aimlessly.

1034~~~
As soon as he is subbed on, we lose all control of the midfield. Happened against Swansea as well as today.

1035~~~
Maybe LVG was worried about the yellow cards racking up. Fellaini coming on was pretty depressing though. He didn't do anything useful.

1036~~~
Lumbering idiot. Adds nothing.

1037~~~
The guy came on after a long time out, he's obviously lacking in match fitness and is off the pace. He didn't cover himself in glory but people need to be realistic of the situation.

1038~~~
feck my life.

Was Naismith his player in that situation when Rafael had two players to challenge in the air in one of those chances at the end, I missed it?

1039~~~
What did Fellani do exactly?The new Mike Phelan.

1040~~~
How does he fit into this team?  From what I saw in his appearance today, he was basically just existing around the centre of the pitch.  Now, I'll give him that he's just come back from injury, and I shouldn't expect huge things from him this early on, but I struggle to see what he's going to bring to this current United formation.  You've got a midfield three of Valencia - Blind - Di Maria, and he replaced Valencia.  Valencia, today, was playing the role that we usually look to Herrera to play, that combination CM/RM which requires a lot of running due to one of the key responsibilities being to drift out to the wing, support the full-back, and play crosses in.  Does Fellaini have the energy, pace and crossing ability to do this?  I don't think so.

The other alternative is to put him in where Blind played, but then I don't think Fellaini offers an improvement on Blind's passing and tackling in that defensive midfield role, and if you do that then you have to push Blind out to one of those wider midfield positions, where he may well struggle.

1041~~~
He wasn't tracking back properly on the right side with Baines.

That led to a change in formation with 4-3-3 i think and Wilson had to be shifted out wide left where he struggled then tracking back and couldn't use his pace on the counter that much.

1042~~~
He must have got instructions to make himself a target higher up the pitch but we couldn't string 3 passes in the last 10 minutes. His problem is he follows the ball instinctively so leaves so much space available.

1043~~~
I thought Mata was marking Barry? You see Mata trailing him into the box on the replay (I think, may be mistaken). People are going to be overly critical but he hasn't played in ages. Cut him some slack.

1044~~~
This forum goes crazy in the Fellaini thread. He really did nothing wrong. What were you guys expecting? Him to come on and dribble past half of the Everton team to score some wonder goal? 

It was the last 15 minutes or so. Everyone was defending and so was he.

1045~~~
Get out !

1046~~~
No, Fellaini had him for the corner I think. He let him go and then Mata was closer as Barry shot.

1047~~~
He's so poor its unbelievable. Came on and ran around like a donkey.

1048~~~
It's because he is seen as a reminder of the Moyes era. Folk are so desperate to be proven right that he is shite, they will look for any excuse to criticise him.

Fellaini suffers from the fact that he was the CM Moyes bought, but not the one the fans wanted (or perhaps that we needed, at the time). It isn't his fault that we bought him instead of Fabregas, Kroos and Thiago.

1049~~~
This thread is embarrassing. You should criticise LvG if anyone for throwing him on in this kind of situation. Gets absolutely slaughtered for about 10 minutes of football after being out injured. I expected United to fade towards the end but I definitely didn't expect Fellaini to prevent that.

1050~~~
First action in a while. Not surprising that he looked off the pace.  Won't kill him based on today's performance.

1051~~~
Exactly. In those last few minutes Mata probably played worse. I bet he's also a "joke" now to these people. 

Agreed. I don't know if people just hate the man or expect him to perform like those mentioned midfielders. This thread today once again shows how much unjustifiable hate he gets.

1052~~~
He did fine today when he came on and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't like him.

1053~~~
It's hard to give him the benefit of the doubt because he did nothing last year, but I guess it's only fair to qualify any criticisms with mention of his return from injury and the breakdown in our play at the end. 

However, he certainly didn't help matters. I'm overweight and haven't played football for about 3 years now, but even I reckon I could have skipped past him today. He plays like a child, mindlessly running towards the ball with no thought for tactics or shape.

1054~~~
He didn't do anything at all, he didn't even defend that's what he came on to do and was useless at it. When compared to Herrera (and Valencia today - he did well but I'm still not a fan) He's not a UTD player. Its better to give Pereira the game time then to waste valuable minutes on this guy.

1055~~~
Right...

1056~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1057~~~
Elaborate...
Did he make a tackle, break up play, win a header? Did he do anything useful?

1058~~~
Not the game to criticise him really. We have to put that in some perspective. He didn't have much time and he's been out of action for a long while. We were mainly focused on absorbing pressure at that late stage. Admittedly he was fairly anonymous and looked a bit slow to close down and win back possession. He'll surely get more opportunities to impress Van Gaal and then we'll see where he stands.

1059~~~
Show me a situation where he needed to tackle, break up play or do any of the mentioned things? (besides I remember him breaking up play on 2 occasions in a span of 15 mins but I may be wrong)

In those 15 mins what did Mata do? What did Wilson do? Did they make goals or give assists since that's what they were brought on for? How come no one is bashing Wilson?

Just admit it. You and a bunch of others on here have come to the conclusion that he's shite and unless he does something amazing you'll continue saying that. He did absolutely nothing wrong today and if praising him for that is a bit over the top, criticizing him for not tackling and breaking up play like Arturo Vidal in 15 mins - back from injury - is just being plain unreasonable.

1060~~~
How is this thread embarrassing? people are just commenting on what they witnessed on the pitch. He offered us next to nothing.

1061~~~
If football was played with a 3 second delay, he would be fantastic.

As it is, he's utter shite.

1062~~~
He didn't do anything particularly wrong. He just sticks out like a sore thumb. A bit like Di Maria sticks out because of his intelligence and skill,  Fellaini sticks out because he's slow, lethargic,  positionally unaware and generally oblivious. 

He didn't look out of place last year.

1063~~~
Why did LVG bring him on then? he obviously felt he'd do a job. Nobody expected him to do a Vidal, but barring him from any criticism is ridiculous.

1064~~~
I'm not a hater. I always want him to do well and prove his critics wrong, even if it's just by looking like an adequate squad player (he could never actually live up to his price tag). It's just got to the point where I'm wasting my time and I'd rather go back to hoping it for Anderson instead.

1065~~~
He didn't do anything spectacularly wrong which is why his fans won't allow any criticism. But he will have to do a lot more to still be at the club beyond January.

1066~~~
Maybe because he could get a few minutes under his belt after Injury? Also so he could hold up the ball in case it came forward. He came on as CDM but went upfront later in the game. Last few minutes a big man like Fellaini can hold up play up front really well and he can do a job in defense as well. 

Eleven players were defending. Not everyone who is defending has to make a tackle or interception

1067~~~
You guys are harsh. He came on when Everton were starting to dominate. He didn't do anything of not but he wasn't giving away free kicks, being sloppy in possession etc.

1068~~~
Against Everton, in a game that we had to hold onto a vital lead? I highly doubt that. He was brought on to do a defensive job, which although not doing anything terribly wrong, he'll have to do a whole lot more to stay at the club beyond January. He looked clueless.

1069~~~
I'm a Fellaini fan, but I am also not blind so I will criticise one moment when he was marking Naismith on a cross and lost him and let him get a header. It was poor and he has to be better than that. But other than that and maybe one other moment people are just being harsh. He's not match fit and came on when we were sitting back as a team.

1070~~~
It was the wrong substitution, he's obviously not match sharp so couldn't get in sync with the game at such a late stage, that doesn't excuse his woeful positional sense though, he just runs around like a cab horse on glue.

1071~~~
It was a bit of both. Anyway, he didn't do anything wrong today as far as I'm concerned. I really don't know what you guys expected him to do.

1072~~~
M

1073~~~
Besides, like I said, if you're logic is that he failed because he didn't make tackles did Wilson also fail  for not scoring?

1074~~~
Don't be silly.

1075~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/FemaleFrayedDarklingbeetle.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/FemaleFrayedDarklingbeetle.gif"/>

That's pretty poor.

1076~~~
You can make logical replies or not reply at all. Just saying "Don't be silly" wont really help.

1077~~~
That post wasn't worth a logical reply. It's a stupid point.

1078~~~
So when you don't have anything left to say you just resort to "Stupid. Silly." <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> very mature.

1079~~~
I'll post what LVG himself had to say. 


Does that not tell you that he brought on Fellaini to do a defensive job? the wilson point is silly because he's fecking 18 and made his 2nd appearance for the first team. How can you not see the difference?

1080~~~
He was brought in to break Everton's tempo and failed.

1081~~~
The wilson point is to show that you can't be judging performances on fifteen minutes of play. I even mentioned Mata but you conveniently ignore him...

1082~~~
Damn I was wondering why Barry had so much space!

1083~~~
Fellaini hasn't been at the club for 15 minutes. Many posters on here have been saying for a long time that Fellaini is next to useless as a defensive midfielder and he showed that again today.

1084~~~
Exactly my point. He's being judged by his past (season) and not his performance today.

1085~~~
No, he's being judged on both. His cameo today unfortunately did nothing to prove a point to any of his doubters.

1086~~~
I'm seeing "He was _______ <b>today</b>" in most of the posts above so... yeah. And yes he did nothing to "prove a point". He's not bloody Zidane but a squad player who we shouldn't be criticizing for not setting the pitch on fire when the whole team was basically behind the ball.

1087~~~
Tbf, it was a small cameo, but I thought he looked really poor. He surely came on to provide some steel and cover to see out the game, and yet we endured our nerviest and least assured period. So whatever it was he was supposed to do, he didn't. Though to be honest, I never really have any idea what he's doing when he comes on. He spent half his time under Moyes playing in a sort of free roam false 10 role.

1088~~~
Perfect GIF to illustrate why posters like me are pissed with Fellaini. Ball watches all the time, shows little spatial discipline, zero sense of awareness and there's just no energy in his play. Dudes who played 90 minutes are mentally alert and a man with fresh legs and a long break shows sloppiness when 1 goal would've been the difference between 4th place and falling further behind the likes of City and Chelsea.

To give him some credit, he can provide good lip service, evinced by his declaration of being United's new Keane :

I tell you what Roy would've done Marouane. He would've marked his man and he would've blocked Oviedo's shot, even if he had to get his face in the way, and cough out a tooth or two. How about starting from there pal ?

1089~~~
Can't see a place for him here, hope that he is gone in Jan. His arrival on the pitch is always a downer. Bit of a shame really, especially the reaction he gets from the fans and he just isn't good enough. Are short on midfielders but rather not seen Fellaini at all. Such a lazy player too, at least try.

1090~~~
Thats standard Fellaini that. Has absolutely no positional or tactical awareness.

He's a lump of shit.

1091~~~
Was a daft game to bring him onto I thought. He's obviously desperate to impress/prove a point... and that just led to him charging around like a maniac trying to win the ball, when what we actually needed was a bit of control/composure.

1092~~~
He's natural position is that of no 10 in a team that plays direct football. He's not a bad player but he's not suited for us

1093~~~
As soon as he came on for Valencia I knew we would lose control. No matter how shit Valencia is playing as an attacker nowadays. But his ability to retain the ball, pace, strength, positioning and defensive nous are much much better than Fellaini's. That switch was as baffling as the one against Swansea when we brought that lump on for Ander. It cost us the game then and it nearly cost us today. I hope LvG is not stubborn and understands he is not what the team needs, ever.

1094~~~
The point is he is a friggin midfielder. And he has almost zero qualities to be one of United's standard. He was chasing shadows against an Everton game which played a midweek Europa League fixture in Russia. Valencia at least kept the ball and Blind was excellent with his distribution and recycling of possession. What exactly did Fellaini bring when he came on? He ran around like a maniac and was ball watching when DDG pulled off that save of the match!

1095~~~
Did you see how our "new Keane" turned his arse towards Oviedo when trying to close him down. What a clown!

1096~~~
Right, comparing an 18 year old in only his second senior appearance with a seasoned pro who has been with us for more than a year. Perfect.

1097~~~
Not my fault you can't read posts. I was comparing him to Mata as well because I was showing the <i>time period </i>in which they were playing.

1098~~~
Who here claims Mata had a good game? But he is given certain leeway as he is a world class player. Unlike that big lump.

1099~~~
Bench player at best. Daley Blind is already all over the pitch while this guy still looking for fitness and a smallest sign of his Everton form which never came to this day.

1100~~~
There was this one moment where he came charging out and past the man on the ball for no apparent reason.

He seems very clueless defensively. Seems always a step behind what's happening.

1101~~~
He was very poor and looked lost, I know you have to take into consideration he has been out a long time but what stood out for me Today was how he plays with no intelligence, no awareness and no positioning That isn't going to change, it's just not his game, he needs to be allowed to do whatever he wants rather than expecting him to fill a particular role or do a job. We would need to reshape the whole side to accommodate him, make him a focal point and give him very little responsibility and seeing as that will never happen I don't see the point in him being here.

1102~~~
Hasn't this been the case on countless occasions, with or without Fellaini, towards the end of games the last couple of seasons? Are people still living in a dream where United is a 90 minute rolling tank?

1103~~~
This.

1104~~~
Really poor cameo

1105~~~
Impossible to defend him anymore. He's showing nothing to warrant defending him. Unfortunate stuff really as I really wanted him to do well here - its obvious he's trying his best. Its just unfortunately not good enough whatsoever for us.

1106~~~
Only the caf could make Fellaini a major talking point of todays game....

1107~~~
How would he be a major talking point if the comments are just in one thread?

1108~~~
What can 1 say to 'well he didn't do anything wrong' putting it like that makes him sound good but in truth he didn't do anything so what could he do wrong. He came on the sure up the game, they created 3 chances bypassing the midfield with him present, we had to change formation so he could fit in better. Young Wilson had to play on the wing to accommodate him and as for Mata even though he didn't have a good game he got an assist and so he did do something unlike Fellaini.
When you can say and know the Fletcher is more useful as a squad player than Fellaini it says it all. I don't care how much we paid for him or what not but he's not good enough for utd, hes got to go along with Anderson and Fletcher. If our hands were tied and we had to keep 1 of them its Fletcher for sure.

1109~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1110~~~
Rekt.

1111~~~
The number of times he's behind the actual play and ends up having to chase back is staggering.

I was in the minority of people who thought he'd be a decent signing. Terrible player.

1112~~~
That decisive and honest conversation with Van Gaal may occur pretty soon if it didn't already.

1113~~~
I actually thought at the time it was a great sub, not only it would disrupt Everton's play, and he is more familiar as a Cm than Valencia, our biggest problem in the Second half was Blind was man marked by Naismith, and Valencia who is not used to play CM unlike Herrera, what Herrera does brilliantly is when Blind is man marked,  he gets the ball of Cb's and act as a play maker, which Valencia was failing to do although he was great defensively, hence it allowed Rojo and Mclair to pump long balls or play difficult balls which disrupted our momentum and we didn't create much chances in the 2nd half.

I thought Fellani will do that and he started by playing one two's off Center backs, and i was beginning to get happy and understand the change, but then i don't know what happened but he went far too forward which left Blind so exposed, atleast with Valencia we were solid defensively, and i don't even remember him getting close to their any player, for a player who is brought to disrupt their play and get tackles in, he was awful. Blind on the other hand, people think he is a soft player, is usually in the thick of things, and he is an exceptionally intelligent footballer always on the end of sweeping away balls and getting in challenges, it just shows you don't need a big frame, players who are half his size but with intelligence can do far much.

1114~~~
Napoli please come back in Jan.

1115~~~
At the start of the season I thought he could become a decent player for us, if we let him play in a more reserved role - see his performance against Everton (first half) last season. Even his performances last season under Martínez were far, far better than what he produced for us, though it's a small sample. I don't know what to expect of him now, and that GIF above is exactly why people keep referring to his 12/13 season and how he lacks positional sense. It's atrocious, and it doesn't matter if you're coming back from injury - you're fresher than most men on the field and should be doing much better. 

Fellaini's performances in midfield for us have mostly been below-par and he's playing as though he doesn't know how to play in midfield, which is perplexing because he was pretty good in 11/12 (a season many forget). Is he better than Carrick? No. Is he better than Blind? No. It'll be interesting to see how we utilise him, but he needs something <i>big</i> for Van Gaal to keep him after this season.

1116~~~
I'll presume this is some kind of hip 4chan English for 'owned'? 

To restate my point, you get a handful of player threads bumped after every match and the fact Fellaini in his small inconsequential cameo has as many posts as Blind, Rafael et al threads after their brilliant performances speaks a lot about the nature of some caf members. 

And that isn't a defense of Fellaini as he's cack, it's just a passing comment on how post match no ones focus should be on him. His performances was completely unnoteworthy

1117~~~
That's just awful.

You'd think he'd try to take the chance whenever possible as Herrera was injured but alas, only adds more fuel for doubt.

1118~~~
Fair enough but I disagree in all honesty. The cameo seems inconsequential now because we didn't concede as a result of his lethargy. But in the grander scheme of things, these momentary lapses can and will alter the course of games. It's always on to assess the final details. We've had a round up of pretty much every starter/ sub who played vs Everton in their respective thread so this is not exclusive to Marouane.

1119~~~
I thought he was very positionally naive today particularly when Everton were in possession.. Ran aggressively, albeit aimlessly, towards the ball no matter if the man was already being marked or not and left space in behind. At one point he blocked a teammate through doing this. Not his fault, he's a number 10 for a long ball team. He is definately not a DM.

1120~~~
That gif sums him up.....

January can't come quick enough!! I just hope Moyes has a job by then

1121~~~
The reason we're not talking more about him is because of De Gea's save and Blackett's block. He was awful on that set piece. What is worse is, that's exactly how he is most of the time.

1122~~~
He and Valencia look so limited on the pitch in terms of their technical ability. At least Tony tries hard though.

1123~~~
This sums it pretty nicely for me.

1124~~~
Very disappointing cameo. It was obvious he was brought on to help the defence but I'm not even sure he won the ball once.

Fellaini is a good player if he plays as an attacker - his Everton and Belgium performance shows us that.
Trying to shoehorn him into a defensive role just does not work.
He's too slow, he cannot mark a player and he's not much of a tackler.

1125~~~
Expected him to replace Mata, not Valencia.

1126~~~
For the people who are clued up on the U21s, is there anyone who can deputise for both Blind and Carrick instead of Fellaini? Pearson?

I'd rather see a kid promoted than see Fellaini play for us again. Like Moyes, he's just not right for us.

1127~~~
Pereira or Rothwell are the best of our midfield bunch.

1128~~~
Valencia is much better than Fellaini. Fellaini is in his own class of shit

1129~~~
In fairness that was possibly the most inept performance this season. Brainless, lazy and lacking quality all over. That's worth talking about IMO.

1130~~~
In terms of position it's Pearson, Pereira,Harrop and Rothwell are more of Herrera/Di Maria positions.

1131~~~
An over exaggeration I think. Especially since it was only 10 minutes he was on the pitch. There have been some bad performances this season, a lot worse than Fellaini's cameo yesterday.

1132~~~
I can think of some mistake-prone performances by the young players but none which displayed a distinct lack of quality in all areas and a complete unsuitability for the role and system asked to play in. Perhaps Smalling against Leicester? I really can't think of anything else.

1133~~~
Valencia isn't much better than Fellaini. Fellaini was more than decent at Everton.

1134~~~
Is there any hope this guy will come good? As terrible as he has been for us, i want him to succeed, but i just don't see that happening. He looked alright as an AM in Moyes' Everton side, but there is no way he is going to get that spot here.

As a CM, he is way to clumsy and immobile to fit the system we are trying to implement. Yes, he does add some physical presence and aerial ability, but that's about it.

Honestly, i think we should just cut our losses and get rid.

1135~~~
What has that got to do with anything? Valencia was more than decent at Wigan. 

Both are obviously piss poor but if I was forced to keep one it would be Valencia.

1136~~~
What do you mean "what has that got to do with anything"?
You said he's 'much better', which is a stupid statement.

Fellaini's better than he's shown here. He's not good enough for centre midfield here, but he's a decent enough player.
I don't know on what planet Valencia's much better.

1137~~~
And Valencia was brilliant on his first three years here, way better than Fellaini ever was. And now both of them are shit but Valencia is again a better player.

1138~~~
Valencia in his prime wasn't way better than Fellaini ever was. Both were good at their best. 
Completely different roles though obviously. 

Neither are good enough, but Valencia's not way/much better, in my opinion.

1139~~~
Where did I say he was "much better"? I don't rate either of them but would rather keep Valencia because he has pace and can play several positions. 

Only thing I reacted on was that you were using Fellaini's Everton career to justify that Valencia isn't better than him. Yes he was good for them but Valencia was good for Wigan and he was decent in his first couple of seasons at OT. Forget the past, look at the present. What has Fellaini done in his United career that makes you think that Valencia isn't better?

1140~~~
Apologies. It wasn't you who said Valencia is much better, and that was the post I was responding to.
I agree Valencia's a better fit for this club, but I disagreed that he's a "much better" player. 
When I'm talking about who's better, I'm not just basing it on their United careers. 

Fellaini's been crap here, but I still think he's better than he's shown.

1141~~~
Fellaini has an opportunity now, I think. Let's see how he does with it.

1142~~~
I noticed this. Just throw yourself in to stop the freakin' shot you idiot! How he can't be arsed in the slightest with all our players around defending for their lives is beyond me.

1143~~~
Does he have an opportunity though? If Carrick and Herrera are both fit after the international break and with Valencia’s performance yesterday things aren’t looking good for him still. He shouldn’t be judged on yesterday’s performance but it highlighted how he just doesn’t fit into any system when there is any emphasis on positioning, tactics and intelligence, he looked lost and didn’t have a clue what to do. I don’t mean that as a criticism it’s just how he plays, if he had replaced Mata it wouldn’t have been such a problem but he was a liability in any other position in midfield.

He doesn’t have a position or fit into formations, you just tell him to go and play his game and then fit others round him, if he gets that opportunity he might make an impact but there is pretty much zero chance of that happening

1144~~~
In theory, it should be possible to train him into being a really, really good defensive midfielder. 

In practice, I accept that it's a bit like playing Emile Heskey in that position at the moment.

1145~~~
Fletcher and Cleverley against Sunderland was quite awful. Particularly Fletcher in the first half, the worst 45 minutes I've seen from a united player in a very long time.

1146~~~
....and totally shit at United. Valencia is much better than Fellaini.

1147~~~
Fair enough.
For me, form at United (especially for just one year) isn't the be all and end all, and Valencia isn't a much better player than Fellaini.

Not that I rate either that highly.

1148~~~
Why should you care how he fared for a midtable team 2 years ago? Most Everton fans weren't even upset by his transfer. He wasn't highly rated there either.

1149~~~
Valencia's not much better in my opinion. Fellaini's been poor here, but how long has Valencia been poor for? People were giving him all sorts of abuse just a few months ago. 

I'm not claiming Fellaini's a great player, or that anyone should/does rate him highly. 
Just that Valencia's not a much better player.

1150~~~
But you agree he's better...ok I can live with that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1151~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1152~~~
Like people mentioned yesterday on social media, there is always something going wrong with him whenever he's on the pitch. We are inviting pressure every time he comes on. I can't recall the last time we have a player in his particular position being that flat when his job should be to provide spark and energy, defensively and/or offensively.

1153~~~
Inviting pressure at the end of games is the modern United if you haven't noticed. With or without Fellaini.

1154~~~
Not sure what he brings to us really. Doesn't have the intelligence to position himself when we don't have possession to pressure the opposition, and IMO this makes it look like he's always a second behind the play, always trying to catch up and react to where the ball is instead of stepping into a challenge or forcing the opponent into a less dangerous option.

1155~~~
I've always been one to defend Fellaini as a footballer because I do think he's a good player, sometimes very good. But this is just unforgivable, to be honest. No excuse for lazy, cowardly play like that. I'd like to think he gets a bollocking whenever the coaching staff get round to viewing this game back. Pathetic defending.

1156~~~
Van Gaal's already 63.

1157~~~
Are you on something or just a wind up? Valencia was our players and fans PotY in a season he equaled an in form Nani on combined goals and assists. Fellaini has never been half as good as that. .. ever! He just plays for flavor of the year dark horses Belgium and surprised people by scoring some goals the season before we bought him. 

He has his users but we have better players there in attack.

1158~~~
I'm fully aware of how good Valencia was three seasons ago. However Fellaini was also very effective a couple of seasons ago, and I don't think Valencia's a much better player than him.

Jesus. It's not like I'm claiming Fellaini's a great player or anything.

1159~~~
I'm the same. I rate him, but that is not good enough.

1160~~~
He's the most useless player in our squad and by quite some distance. It looks like he won a contest or he's from the make a wish foundation.

1161~~~
Seconded. But I like him just a wee bit more than Ashley Young.

1162~~~
He's stealing a living. Must have sold his soul to the Devil or some shit

1163~~~
He just gets badly exposed in our system. If he played for a team that played a lot of high balls to his head/chest and he didn't have to run, dribble or pass with his feet then he'd look like a decent player again. Unfortunately for him even Stoke and West Ham are trying to play a better style of football these days, I'm not sure there is a team around that plays to his limited strengths.

1164~~~
You mean with the San Antonio's Spurs he would be great 

I hope that we can sign a top midfielder this winter and we can offload him. He's just usueless if we managed to have two player per position in our midfield 

------------------------Blind--------------------------
--------Herrera---------------------Di Maria---------

--------Fletcher--------------------????????---------
------------------------Carrick------------------------

1165~~~
I don't give a shit if it was just ten minutes. His performance on Sunday was just disgusting and we won the game despite him, because he in no way contributed to the victory, and in actual fact, he almost compromised it. 

He's completely brainless, positionally indisciplined, and always 2-3 steps behind the play. He was a big part in us losing all composure in the final moments of the game because we ended up with no midfield as Blind was being marked out of the game. He's unreliable in every way and that gif sums him up. He just pauses twice during the FK to watch the play. Does he think he's a f*cking spectator? Meanwhile Barry had run to the other side of the pitch and taken a shot that we are lucky Blackett blocked. No one was expecting him to come in and put in a world class display but if he can't even concentrate and put in effort for 20 seconds during a set piece what use is he to us? 

People who were claiming he would "add steel" to our midfield and all the other rubbish that was spouted on here when we signed him are seeing what bullshit that notion was. His reading of the game is so poor that he will always be ineffective in midfield. LvG can't be far from realising that he has no place whatsoever at this club. I hope I never have to see him in a United shirt ever again.

1166~~~
Fellaini at his worst is like those monuments in the middle of a roadway where the cars and motorcycles speed right around it.  For all of his size, he is not imposing at all and looks like he has no idea of who to mark or what to do in our own penalty area.

A player with zero dynamic might have fit into our game plan last season when we were using a circa 1950s system but with the players we've recently gotten he looks even more removed from where LVG is taking this club.  Add the fact that Fellaini has been pretty much told by the club and fans that he's not wanted here (which I'm sure really encourages a 100% effort from him) and I see no reason to waste our time.

1167~~~
I want rid of him asap but sometimes I do feel sorry for him too. Against Everton soon after he came on he was chasing a ball out to the sideline, an Everton player was a few yards behind (maybe Besic or Oviedo) but was obviously much faster than Fellaini, he was trying his best to run fast but he just can't, he ended up having to keep looking back and using his arms to try keep their player behind him.

1168~~~
Here here!

Even his most hardcore followers are at a loss to explain his bullshit performances. I don't care if we have to pay someone to take him on, just get rid sharpish!

1169~~~
Poetry.

1170~~~
Belgium are currently playing Andorra, and it's 6-0. Fellaini, since coming on about 15-20 minutes ago, has made about 2 passes and 4 fouls. He's just an awful footballer.

1171~~~
Even Anderson is better than him atm. And Anderson isnt even playing.

1172~~~

Play the man Louie!

1176~~~
feck me Marouane!

1177~~~
Holy shit.

1178~~~
Very good goal, glad he has finally scored.

1179~~~
WTF, what a goal

1180~~~
Great stuff.

1181~~~
Prepare the humble pie. I'll eat it all up if he can keep impacting games like that. He'll deserve to stay here.

1182~~~
A big feck you to all his detractors.

1183~~~
I always believed in him...

1184~~~
Super sub <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1185~~~
Fairplay. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Coming from someone who lays into him on a regular basis, dude needs to applauded for that.

1186~~~
Meh, one goal doesn't suddenly change our perceptions of him. Still, delighted to score either way though.

1187~~~
I'm not a fan but I'm pleased for him.

1188~~~
Do you think Moyes is taking credit for that goal right now, wherever he is?

1189~~~
The amount of abuse Fellaini gets from the fans is disgusting. In preseason he was getting sarcastic applause from our own fans until he scored in the last minute.

I am pleased to have put my hat in the pro-Fellaini camp and delighted for him to (again) come on and have an impact.

1190~~~
Game changer?

1191~~~
Do do doo you're all fecking stupid.

1192~~~
He'll have the players at his next club studying that goal every Monday.

1193~~~
Best moment in a United shirt so far. Fantastic goal, happy for him and well done LvG <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1194~~~
He's much better up top. Not a central midfielder.

1195~~~
I bow to LVGs footballing genius

1196~~~
You had one job, Fellaini. One job to come on and put your head on one of those Di Maria crosses to get us back in the match, and you messed it up by scoring with your foot. Get out!

1197~~~
Nice one touch passing and all.

1198~~~
Good to see all the faith the fans had in him being repaid.

1199~~~
Agreed. Problem is that long-term, we probably won't want him to be playing in an attacking role for us.

1200~~~
Great goal and performance. He always does well against the smaller sides. The problem occur when facing tougher opposition

1201~~~
Aye he did very well against West Brom last year.

1202~~~
Happy for him, saved us a point there, great taken goal. Maybe some people will feck off from this thread now.

1203~~~
They'll be back soon enough I'm afraid..

1204~~~
What a fecking goal that was. Brought us back into the game

1205~~~
I didn't think he played well but did score so thats something.

1206~~~
Great goal and he made a difference in fairness to him

1207~~~
Played well. Not just his goal. His passing and retention of the ball under pressure was all very good, which he's always been good at, but people just see him as a chest and a pair of elbows. His goal was a beaut as well. Great strength to brush off Lescott, good touch, quality finish. 

He caused problems for them wherever he was. We were losing the physical battle with Mata and Herrera getting pushed around, but he put a stop to that. Good game from him. I hope he can build on it. I've always thought he was a skilled footballer. It's just finding a use for him.

1208~~~
He had a solid performance partnering Blind in the middle. At least with Blind covering, he has license to roam forward and make a nuisance of himself.

1209~~~
Happy for him to be used as an tactical sub.

He terrorised them for a 10/15 minute spell. Felt he dropped too deep after that.

1210~~~
Credit where credit is due, he had a very solid half. Great goal.

1211~~~
Great when he came on. Put himself about unlike half those on the pitch.

1212~~~
I thought he had a good half. Fair play to him.

1213~~~
No one ever doubted that he has world class chest control

1214~~~
Didnt do too much good or.bad today. Good goal.

1215~~~
he was very good I thought, didn't hide. Him and Blind were our best players I thought.

1216~~~
Fair play to him. Was probably our best player in the second half tonight.

He's also invented a new position 'deep lying centre forward'. Its revolutionary.

1217~~~
Was frustrated at times last season, we would have games very like this one where teams sat 4-5-1 very deep vs us and defended a lead and Fellaini wasn't used. Fellaini and Falcao on some of those Di Maria crosses first half could have been a different story tonight

1218~~~
Cracking strike! Good on the man, he looked absolutely thrilled to score it too.

1219~~~
Never mind his goal, the best thing about his performance today was that he actually tried to play football instead of intentionally trying to hurt the opposing players, and with that, he also managed to be a solid contributor on both sides of the ball.

Why can't he do that (not trying to mangle opponents) every time? Then we could get a gauge of him as a player rather than a complete liability. 

Enjoyed his performance today, and never thought I'd say that.

1220~~~
He was fantastic. Im not a huge Fellaini basher like some. I do think he may struggle against quality opposition but he's a very good option against mid table premiership teams

1221~~~
Did well, class goal.

1222~~~
Good goal, and won us a lot of headers in the midfield. Decent on the ball too.

1223~~~
Delighted for him - hopefully this marks the real start of his career here.

1224~~~
He did do really well when he came on. Got himself involved and on the ball. His touch was good as well. Great finish to add.

1225~~~
Untouchable for 10mins of the 2nd half. Ok after that. Good goal.

1226~~~
He can be very useful when we are chasing a game and need to change gameplans.

1227~~~
I still can't believe that he scored a goal like that.

1228~~~
Fantastic goal, exactly what we thought we were getting when we tried to sign him. That was the kind of thing he was doing most weeks for Everton as an attacker and exactly what he wasn't doing last season, using his strength properly to hold players off and being a threat to goal.

Other than the goal he wasn't much better than an injured Ander. Slightly.

1229~~~
Start him up front in our next two games if we want a chance of winning.

1230~~~
He has scored loads similar for Everton

1231~~~
He did well. Passed it safe and sound and got in the box. It's what he's here for.

1232~~~
By the way, to get a full picture now.



fecking mugs. Top bintz.

1233~~~
In Rooney's absence probably a better option at 10 than Mata. In, and around, the box his strength is such a problem for defenders.

1234~~~
That so classless. Bunch of twats.

1235~~~
Deserved another chance, really good performance from him.

Anyone else want to see how he'd do behind the striker? Could turn out to be better than Mata at least.

1236~~~
Are all Premier League twitter accounts ran by idiots?

1237~~~
Should play as a #10 against Chelsea. The amount of crosses Di Maria delivers, he is bound to get on the end of atleast 4 or 5.

1238~~~
Don't rate him at all but he was very impressive.

1239~~~
He seemed really nice in his interview. I hope he can be an assett. I stuck up for him loads last season but I gave up. I'm back Marouane!

1240~~~
Deserves to start against Chelsea. Will need him for set pieces along against Chelsea's giants.

1241~~~
Pleased for him. Good goal. Hopefully it gives him some confidence, looked like a massive weight off his shoulders in his celebration. Was solid after the goal too. Still have some concerns against good opposition but if he isn't 100% responsible for defensive duties (i.e. has Blind behind him) then he could be handy. Might be could against Chelsea, would certainly give them something different. Though Cahill, Terry and Matic would be well equipped to handle his height.

1242~~~
I'm usually one of the first to come in here and rip him to shreds when he's shit, so it's only fair I praise him when he's decent, and he was decent tonight. I wouldn't have him in the team if Herrera/Carrick/Valencia were fit/matchfit but needs must. Definitely his least offensive performance to date.

1243~~~
Exactly. A lot of people on here have been rating his performances based on last season. Fellaini is a class player. He scored goals like this often for Everton.


Great game from him. I'm glad that I always defended him and knew he would come good. 


<a class="username" data-user="66348, @.Rossi" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66348/">@.Rossi</a> , would you like to tell me more how much you are disgusted by this useless player?

1244~~~
Fellaini in his Everton days has terrorized the best of defenders. From what I'm seeing he's a confidence player - when he lacks it he sort of fades away.

1245~~~
Are you going to continue to keep following me?

One goal and one good half of football, in over a year, for £27 million and you're having a pop at me?!

Tell you what, take on the rest of the forum that had a pop at him since you have the cape on.

He scored an amazing goal and done very well tonight....What else am I supposed to say here?

"I knew he would come good".....After 45 minutes of football....In a year....Good God

1246~~~
The goal was great, but he didn't do much more. I am happy for him and hope that he can continue like that, but no, he shouldn't start against Chelsea. Not as CM and I don't know how people can see him further up the pitch with our options, that's just nonsense for me.

1247~~~
Most people here who dislike him have not personally attacked him like you have. Then there are others who say he is not suited to play for this club. In any case, I don't need to 'take a pop' at those who have different opinions - just those who insult our players like you have. Why don't you just answer my question? I thought he was a useless piece of lump?

1248~~~
Wonder what Anders was going on about but look at the top tweet from WBA:

<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/WBAFCofficial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">West Bromwich Albion ✔ @WBAFCofficial</a>
Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WBAMUN?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#WBAMUN</a>
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/ALindegaard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Anders Lindegaard ✔ @ALindegaard</a>
Complete lack of knowledge, class and respect on Twitter from <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/WBAFCofficial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@WBAFCofficial</a> on Fellaini!! <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/united?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#united</a> <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/karma?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#karma</a> <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/keepbelieving?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#keepbelieving</a>



<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well guess Fellaini got the last laugh!

1249~~~
Still got lots of love for Fellaini and that is what he is capable of. feck the haters.

1250~~~
Fellaini would be West Broms player which makes it even more idiotic.

1251~~~
I did not like it that Redcafe's official page Re-tweeted that (before he scored). Found it stupid from WBA.

1252~~~
Gimme a break.  Besides the goal, Fellaini didn't do much.  We need him to be a physical midfielder causing havoc and breaking up play, not in the box scoring goals.  Nice goal, but still useless.

1253~~~
I'm going to ignore this post because you are really testing my patience right now.

I've answered your question nicely, I've said he was very good tonight and scored an amazing goal...But that does not justify his other terrible performances, in the last year, at his price tag.....I have no idea what other way I can respond to your post as it's ridiculous to even say, "he's come good" after 45 mins in over a year. 

If he does this on a regular basis, I will be the first person to hold my hands up and admit I made an arse out of myself. 

Other than that, I don't get your anger with me....But, feel free to PM me as you clearly feel that strongly about it. 

I'm not arguing with someone, I don't know, on the internet, in public....This is a football forum, for discussing football

1254~~~
He was far from useless today.

1255~~~
Best take it up with the people who run the forum then

1256~~~
Let's be honest it was a class goal. Took it down, great second touch and a beast of a finish. Played well tonight.

1257~~~
Made me look like a mug today. Was watching with Dad (who does not follow football) and I spent the entire half time break telling him how shite and useless Fellaini was and then he does that<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Pleased for him though.

1258~~~
I think he made me, you and a hell of a lot of others feel like a mug tonight

1259~~~
He hasnt really done anything wrong this season. Came on in preseason and scored us a last minute winner, came on today and changed the game without a doubt. His physical presence offered us more of a threat than anything we had come up with in the first half, and sure enough he got his goal.

Thing is, regardless of what he does, there are plenty of "fans" on here and in OT who have nailed their colours so firmly to the anti-Fellaini mast, that they will point blank refuse to give him any sort of credit irrespective of performance. I find it pretty sad and frankly disgusting the amount of abuse he gets.

Here are some fachts;

1) Fellaini was signed by Moyes and thus is instantly associated with what was largely a very unsuccessful tenure.
2) Fellaini was signed instead of getting the world class midfielders such as Fabregas and Kroos, that we were linked with (I agree that we should have prioritised other players, by the way).
3) We paid over the odds.
4) Fellaini missed out on preseason last year and spent most of the first half of the season with a wrist injury, which he later had surgery on.

Now im not claiming that Fellaini is a world beater, nor am I claiming that he was/is the answer to all our problems last year or this. Fellaini offers us something very different to any other player in the squad, perhaps any other player in the league. He is a great option to have in the squad, and showed at Everton that in the right sort of setup he can be an incredibly dominant and influential player.

As I said, he isnt a world beater, but nor has he been given a proper chance yet to show what he is capable of. Fortunately, LVG isnt an idiot and seems to recognise the value of Fellaini, even if just to the extent of being prepared to give him a chance - which is more than a lot of the fans do. Fellaini didnt decide how much we paid, he didnt decide when we signed him and by and large he wasnt responsible for what happened last year. He didnt hit the ground running (but again, with no preseason and a wrist injury, is that really a surprise?) but the entire team was a shambles last season and you can pretty much write it off when assessing players.

Basically, he deserves to be given a chance without fans giving him abuse. So far this season he has played well when he has featured, and LVGs post-match comments imply that he [LVG] certainly sees a use for him in the squad.

1260~~~
Anders definitely my favourite tweeter in our squad.

1261~~~
Great goal, decent performance playing ....wherever it was he'd decided to play today.

1262~~~
Poor tweet from the WBA account. Glad Anders stuck up for him.

1263~~~
Happy for Fellaini but he still can't sh@g my wife … few more goals yet and we'll see!

1264~~~
He did well, and after Van Gaal's post-match comments on the importance of physicality in the Premier League, he's probably earned himself a place in Sunday's XI.

1265~~~
Hang on that's oppo fans - our 'fans' are much worse.  

Pleased for him tonight - added the steal and presence we lack in the midfield and was a pain to there cb's.

1266~~~
Anyone still watching … look at Chicharito playing Kagawa in 

What am I missing!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Really awkward when that happens. Happened to me and my Dad when we were watching the Spain vs Netherlands 2014 WC match as well. I was saying the Dutch have a poor team and Spain are going to rip them to shreds...

Great goal and a decent performance to go with it for Fellaini.

1268~~~
I'm certain we'll hear it at some point this season. If the limited game time continues, can see him becoming a bit of a cult hero.

1269~~~
3:0 up surely we'd have to win from there!

1271~~~
Exactly the kind of performance he was bought for. Great goal, dominant in the air and on the ground. Only committed 2 fouls I can think of (and one of them was a dodgy handball call). Seemed to cover a lot of ground with a lot of urgency as well. 

I'm only half-joking when I say that based on today's game he looks a better option as a lone-striker than Van Persie does at the moment. Better hold-up play, better workrate and better in the air.

1272~~~
It'll happen but I think he was a shoe-in for a starting place today's physical game … Sunday, not so sure. Hazard and Oscar will be falling like pins for the ref under challenges they'd never win anyway. Would have been better to start Janazaj next week than today IMHO but I'm sure we'll find a way to feck it up!

1273~~~
Wow what an unprofessional tweet from a football club who really should know better. Don't know why I'm surprised though, I've had to deal with their accounts department before and they're a complete joke too.

1274~~~
Don't jump the gun. He hasn't come good. This is so kneejerk. Good game from him though. Still not good enough for a title chasing team. We have stern tests coming up against Chelsea and City

1275~~~
Hear hear.

Some real kneejerk BS

1276~~~
Some refs would give a free kick to WBA, but it was a good goal. Felt he still was running around a bit clueless and he's really not what we need for a stronger first 11, but it was nice to see him finally get a goal.

1277~~~
Can be a real good plan B especially when we have Di Maria crossing the ball. Fantastic goal, glad a foul wasnt given on his nudge on Lescott.

1278~~~
Is that actually the official West Brom account? If so, that's fecking disgusting. Fecking had it with these small clubs trying to take the piss. Fecking out of order that is. Don't care what player it is. 

Anyway, rant over. I thought Fellaini did very well when he come on and provided us with a different option. Changed the game for us. Glad for him.

1279~~~
It is the West Brom account. Clearly the interns running the account wanted to make some 'cheeky banter for the lads', good thing it backfired.

1280~~~
And Fellaini had the last laugh as he scored 2 minutes into his substitution.

1281~~~
Pleased for him, always knew he had it in him.
<span style="color: #ffffff">bite
</span>
Anyways, I said before he's at his best as a forward or target man, and that's what he showed again. He's not a very good midfielder though generally though was decent enough today. His best work definitely is done in the attacking 3rd, the problem is he's not good enough to play there ahead of the others we have and just doesn't suit the style.

1282~~~
So who here thinks he should be starting ahead of Mata?

1283~~~
Can't convince people like you I'm afraid.

1284~~~
I was quite happy for him.  He came on and showed drive, desire and aggression, and got us back into the match.  At this point I would play him over a few of our "stars".

1285~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> A player has a great game and I can't say he had a great game because if I do it is "knee Jerk" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1286~~~
It's hardly a ridiculous view. He did well to get his goal and posed a threat today, but he's largely been a terrible player for us. One goal and a decent performance doesn't suddenly change the fact that he's not a very good footballer.

1287~~~
Not getting into the long term shit, he had a good half of football tonight. Looked a lot better playing the ball rather than trying to hand out thick lips.

1288~~~
He's alright to come in like this, but he isn't good enough as a midfielder. Blind was given too much to do with him on the field, as he cant run (either) or tackle.

1289~~~
Great goal and had a decent half, putting himself in the shop window for January.

1290~~~
In his 45 minutes on the field Fellaini made more tackles and interceptions than Herrera did in his 45. He also had more touches, a higher % of passes completed and was completely dominant in the air (as you'd expect). He also put in a huge shift and I wouldn't be surprised if he covered far more distance in the second half than any of the starters did in the first.

Obviously it means little if he can't replicate such performances, but after today's game its strange to criticise his defensive contribution or workrate when he was better than, or at least equal to, Herrera in those regards.

1291~~~
A Herrera who was playing with a broken rib or two, yes. He's nowhere near Herrera's level, nor United's. Lulling into a false sense of secruity after a few "decent" shifts is what we've been guilty of for a while now, it needs to stop.

1292~~~
That point could be debated at this point in time I think. Adnan, Mata, and RvP have shown <i>very little</i>. Fellaini could probably perform just as well as they have been.

1293~~~
Yeah but we still have Rooney and Falcao, and then Herrera as well if we want Carrick deeper. He was useful in a game like today but he's more of a situation type player, rather then someone who will be a starter or a key player.

1294~~~
He's better than Herrera at some things and worse at other things. Herrera's clearly a better fit for the position but Fellaini has proved in the past that he's more than capable of filling in, even though most of those occasions were for Everton rather than for us.

The performance he put in tonight was very good, and a sign that he might be capable of getting back to the form that made him an important player in his final season for Everton. If he can replicate that form he'll be an important part of the squad going forward.

1295~~~
Well done this man. Played with a real purpose tonight and was obviously given good, clear instructions. Good on him.

1296~~~
eh? he was clearly playing midfield tonight not forward or target man at all - it was the box to box role.

An outstanding goal and in fact great all round performance - several tackles and decent passing as well

A big feck you to all the haters out there - well in Marouane!

1297~~~
This is precisely what many of us argued for when people were after his head in the summer. There's no need to start with him, but when our plan A isn't working you bring him on and he'll cause trouble one way or another.

With this 'new' fondness for crossing, he could be an important player once again.

1298~~~
I was impressed with him winning the ball high up the pitch and sliding a ball through to Di Maria too. It's a shame his mobility isn't great because he's a real asset laying off quick, simple forward passes. Unfortunately, if they get by him then he really struggles to get back goal side of his opponent.

1299~~~
Played very well. As you say, he had clear instructions and that made the difference. Took his goal well and that will do wonders for his confidence.

1300~~~
You know what? Big fair f*ck to Fellaini for that. I'm not his biggest fan, but thought he did very well against West Brom. He can still have a future here. Happy for him.

1301~~~
Saying he was "useless" other than the goal is a ridiculous view. Also, how you made that a "fact" is beyond me.

1302~~~
Haven't seen the match itself, so can't comment on how he played over all. But cracking goal, showed great strength and control to edge his man under the ball and chest it down before putting it away. He is a decent player around the edge of the box for just that reason, and that goal showed all his strengths.

1303~~~
agree mate.

I think he has a future here. A number of our players are coming back from lengthy injuries. give them a chance.

I thought we did well..showed heart and belief. A couple more minutes and we would have won it...should have anyways with the chances we had.

back to the point. Good for our bog brush.

1304~~~
Credit to the big man. Came on with a point to prove and proved it he did. He won't ever live up to his price tag but he can play a role for us, especially as players like Blind and Herrera adjust to the physicality of the league.

1305~~~
Like many, I'm not a fan of his but was really pleased to see him score. A great goal too.

1306~~~
You didn't just say he had a great game, don't insult my intelligence like that. You said you 'always knew he'd come good'. He had a few games like this last season against similar opposition but he was and is still shit overall. Like I said, we have some really big games coming up. Lets see how things go from there.

1307~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/ObIqBV6wv2t/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1308~~~

1309~~~
Absolutely class goal. But we lacked someone in the middle when attacking. Fellaini was upfront causing some trouble but we lacked a Mata or Hererra a bit deeper and central to recycle/contest balls. A massive gap in formation for much of the time. Not Fellaini's fault, just a bit of chasing the game tactical naivety.

1310~~~
Fine. Let's wait then. I'm saying it right now that he'll come good over a season

1311~~~
It's the sort of goal that Obafemi Martins scored about three times during his stint at Newcastle

1312~~~
I'm a Fellaini fan but people are going a little over the top with praise here. They should just let him be and hope he can string a few games together. But he'll have another average game soon and this thread will be littered with people saying he is shite and asking the 'Fellaini lovers' where they are now etc.

1313~~~
Been a regular critic of Fellaini but he took on his role as well today. Cracking goal as well to top it off.

Unfortunately though I feel he'll go into hiding again vs Chelsea if he features.

1314~~~
It's not about whose fans are bigger twats though, it's an official twitter and not some fan-run shit, it's an embarrassment from their side. Glad that Lindegaard stood up to tell them they're cnuts.

Anyways, hope that Herrera is fit for Chelsea anyway, I suppose that no matter what the score is, he deserves another 15-20 minutes next game purely for Chelsea to adjust their tactic mid-game and bring in some chaos. Funny how half of my ignore list jumps here with their 'decent goal but he's still shit' bullshit, today the poor is rich.

1315~~~
It's something you'd expect from a random fan, not from an official twitter site. Unprofessional.

1316~~~
One good game doesn't make him a great player all of a sudden, but it does show that there'll be games and situations where he can do better than our other midfielders.  He deserves a chance just like anyone else. I'd much rather see him successfully applying his few talents here, than to be sold off in some ridiculous cut-price deal.

1317~~~
Im saying he won't, especially after we sign another player in midfield. We shall see.

1318~~~
Wait until he has a great game. Not just a great goal?

1319~~~
Confidence can be a powerful thing. Let's see what that performance will due for this season.

1320~~~
Very happy for him after everything he's been through.

1321~~~
Aye, it'd take a lot more than a nice goal to forget everything I've seen from him this past year.  Bar 45 minutes today and a bit of a preseason game, he has been absolutely woeful wearing a United shirt.  But fair fecks to him, it was a nice goal.
Let me clarify.  I meant he's useless in the sense that he's not what we need.  We need a physical, box-to-box midfielder who's able to break up play and runs around causing havoc.  While scoring goals is obviously nice, there's no shortage of strikers or attacking midfielders with more quality than Fellaini on the team.  I didn't think he did much otherwise than score today, but apparently as some have pointed out, stats say otherwise.  Felt like there were stretches in the second half where he barely touched the ball.  Hope he proves me wrong, but I have serious doubts he will.

1322~~~
Glad he scored yesterday, he's a decent guy and tries his best, he doesn't deserve the stick he gets from his own fans. He may not be United quality but still wears the red shirt and we should back him.

1323~~~
He is not the new Zidane but people who have been calling him a "bad footballer" do not have a clue.
He might not be the kind of player we need the most to fix our problems but to say he is useless is pure nonesense (and has always been - also before his goal yesterday).

1324~~~
I'd honestly start him ahead of Mata as a #10 against Chelsea. If there's an ever a time to do it's now. Mata's in terrible form and Fellaini is probably as confident as he's ever been for us. Chelsea have a very physical team as well.

1325~~~
His goal was very good, the rest of his performance was decent at best but actually make a contribution like that consistantly and people will get off his back.

1326~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So this week its Fellaini getting the praise and Jones getting the flack, I wonder what next week has in store for the fickle cafe.

1327~~~
Good to see him get a goal and a solid performance under his belt. His first season was a complete right-off, everything about it was woeful, and to be sarcastically cheered by your own fans must be the worst feeling.

I'm more than willing to give him a chance. Heck, who knows, he may even end up being the box-to-box midfielder we've been looking for.

1328~~~
Anderson will get the praise and Phelan will get the flack.

1329~~~
One of the few United players that looks really up for a battle...

1330~~~
That's just classless. And from official twitter page...

1331~~~
We are a fickle bunch but fair play to him, he deserves praise for this performance and he is getting it.

1332~~~

1333~~~
Its a bit fickle I guess. But on the other hand, if someone you dont rate that highly plays well, what are you supposed to do? Deny he has played well? You can only comment on the performances you see. Likewise, what if the players you do rate and do want to see in our team play like fannies? Do you just say they were good anyway? Or just not say anything? Or say, fair dos, I have always argued Mata is our best #10 but he was turd last night. Is that fickle? 

But yes, people have been very quick to write Fellaini off and very unwilling to consider the possibility that he could settle into a good player for us. 

Will be interesting to see if he can keep this up and whether LVG sees him as a viable option for a regular place.

1334~~~
I should dig up those posts I made saying he'll come good for us, I knew they'd come in handy some day. Once he plays crap I'll dig up the ones where I said he's shit. Win win.

1335~~~
Maybe we should start Fellaini as nr. 10 vs Chelsea just to make chaos in Chelsea's defense and go for every header possible.

1336~~~
Agree with this.

1337~~~
That doesn't seem like a bad idea. Swap between fast counter attack and bombardment of crosses. Might as well give it a shot considering we've got the players for it.

1338~~~
On the evidence of last night it wouldnt be a bad idea. But Id still go with Mata. Hopefully he has a point to prove against Mourinho.

1339~~~
Most of all the goals we have conceded are when teams have countered us. I'm pretty sure Jose will set his team up to play on the counter against us, lumping the ball up to Fellaini with Di Maria and Falcao running off the headers wouldn't be such a bad tactic.

1340~~~
Why would we play him as a no. 10? He obviously doesnt have the talent and I dont want to see us lumpl the ball towards him for 90 mins. Let's create something through our passing game rather rely on him winning headers

1341~~~
He could earn a spot in midfield over Herrera but can't see him playing over Mata.

Mata is nailed on to score in my opinion.

1342~~~
He looked good yesterday in that sense, WBA didnt know how to contain him for a while  in the 2nd half. It's just that he was a CM so he couldnt have been so much in the attack. 
With him as a nr. 10 and lets say Blind and Herrera behin him, or Carrick, he'll get more freedom to just run havoc out there. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1343~~~
For me Fellaini behind Falcao seems far more likely to give the likes of Cahill, Terry and Matic problems than Mata. I think Mata would get bullied, whereas a fit and on form Fellaini is one of most imposing players in the league.

1344~~~
Its helps to have the likes of Di Maria,Januzaj and Mata out there. They make up for what the big guy lacks.

1345~~~
Awesome, looking forward to that one.

I'm getting in early with - "I've always backed Anderson and I'm glad he's finally proving me right"

1346~~~
He had a very good game all round, not just the goal.

1347~~~
I dont think you'd be saying that if he didnt score

1348~~~
Might be because Jones played like shit and Fellaini played well and got us a point, while Jones did the opposite.

1349~~~
He did fine yesterday. He looked really up for it, and I think LVG chatting to him through the first half really made him feel important. I think it show's an arm around the back is sometimes better than a punch in the face. 

He came on and set the tempo right away with winning the ball and playing Di Maria behind the defense. 

His goal was fantastic, and was unlucky not to get on the end of a few other crosses.

Sure he made a few of his trademark clumsy passes and tackles, but IMO it's no coincidence we bossed that second half when he came on. Herrera was obviously not 100%, so it was the right choice to make. 

I am pleased for the guy, he will never dictate a game like Scholes or Pirlo, but he can be a thorn.

1350~~~
And of course we all know you only judge a player based on their last 45 minutes of football...

1351~~~
He did play well overall, not just the goal. As soon as he came on he made a difference in my opinion. I think the first thing he did was steal the ball from West Brom and play a nice pass through to Di Maria on the wing. His one and two touch passing looked pretty good too.

1352~~~
He's always been underrated in that regard. He's by no means a brilliant passer but he's very neat and tidy and has a good eye for those 10-20 yard through balls to find players in space between the lines.

1353~~~
Like last night, we won't always be able to use our fancy, technical players to create goals the way we would all love to. Fellaini is a great, yet very expensive, option to have. While he is at the club, we should use him the best way possible, which is exactly how he was told to play last night. Make sure he is up top when we're in possession of the ball, backing into defenders, and just being a general nuisance. In the last 10 minutes we probably looked at our most dangerous, playing lobbed balls down the middle into Fellaini and Falcao. It's very scruffy, but it's also incredibly difficult to defend when playing against such big strong lads.

I think this is the way to play against Chelsea, who will look to sit deep and prevent any penetration through the defence. Believe it or not, I think Fellaini is the answer to this type of defence. I've said this many times, but Fellaini's first touch when controlling the ball on his chest, and to a lesser extend, on his head, is quite simply, sublime. You could hit the ball from any angle, with any amount of power on it, as long as it is in the vicinity of his chest, he is almost guaranteed to bring it down perfectly. This could be a nightmare for Terry and Cahill to deal with.

Fellaini is probably the best player in the world at what he does. Almost unplayable when he is up for it, and he will truly be up for it on Sunday.

1354~~~
I wonder if Van Gaal will now be looking to start Fellaini against Chelsea, as he talked about having a physical balance in our team. Maybe he sees a midfield three of Blind, Herrera and Mata too lightweight for Chelsea. If he does start, he'll certainly cause them problems if we get it into the box. He can be a nightmare for any team on his day.

I also just want to say, yesterday, Fellaini wasn't playing as a number 10, he was playing exactly the same position as Herrera - a box to box centre midfielder, with I guess more licence to get into the box.

1355~~~
No, it's panifully obvious that people are referring to last match and judge those players on their last performance. Check this thread 3-4 pages back and you'll see several people claiming Fellaini is shit.

1356~~~
Of course I would - he had a great half all round; did some good defensive work with tackles, clearances, interceptions - passing was decent enough and topped it off with a stunning goal. His introduction literally changed the game as we were dire in the first half.

and contrary to popular belief, it is not the first time he has played well for us either.

1357~~~
If Ronaldo's legs can be insured for £90m we should take out a policy for Fellaini's chest for at least £40m. 

If he lost that chest we'd be in big trouble.

1358~~~
Players don't go from amazing to shite and vice versa after one game which seems to be the fundemental notion here.

1359~~~
He did very good when he came on and it was great to see. For me, Fellaini is a decent player but unfortunately hasn't fitted in here and Moyes made the big mistake of playing him in a two man midfield last season which was destined to fail.  Hopefully van Gaal can find a role for him so we can get the best out of him.

1360~~~
No, these days you make your mind up about a player, often before seeing him play, and then stick to that opinion no matter what. Judging footballers on playing football is old hat.

1361~~~
We wouldn't, but he would.

1362~~~
Credit where it's due, men. An effective 45 minutes. Everything about him was positive last night, won his headers, got in the box, his passing was crisp and had pace and I can think of only one that went astray. We take it from here. That's what the bench is about, isn't it? Having something different if things aren't working?

1363~~~
The whole team played better due to the manager getting into the players at half time. Fellaini played quite well with a fantastic goal contribution, he still made silly needless fouls and his general play wasn't of the level of the likes of Ander in previous matches. 

The goal changes everything which is why he needs to keep it up

1364~~~
Obviously he is a different style to Herrera, similar position but each is suited to different opposition - Fellaini gets more stuck in and offers aerial threat around the box, but Herrera is clearly the more creative player. Still Fellaini's passing was decent and I dont remember any issue with fouls, in fact one was given against him when he clearly won the ball - that seems to happen quite a lot with him unfortunately.

1365~~~
Thought Falcao coming on had a negative effect on him. With just the one up top he played in his best position for a short while.

When we had two strikers up there he reverted back to what we've seen from him previously. 

Wouldnt mind seeing him playing behind Falcao flanked with our micro midgets

1366~~~
He conceded one foul. I sometimes wonder whether people on both sides of these debates about players actually watch the games or just go on the usual cliches/countercliches (new word).

1367~~~
He was pulled up for 2. You don't get to decide how many fouls he made, the referee does. Perhaps you should have watched closer

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/829614/LiveStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015-West-Bromwich-Albion-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/82...4-2015-West-Bromwich-Albion-Manchester-United</a>

1368~~~
So a handball and a foul that was wrongly given. My point still stands.

Edit: It might have been the handball that was wrongly given. Either way, point stands.

1369~~~
Great goal

1370~~~
You just dont open up teams with Fellaini as a 10. Moyes tried it so often and it just doesnt work. He doesnt have the ability, as simple as that. He either brings physical domincance into our team or else I dont really see him being used often

1371~~~
Did you watch Everton at all in his last season there? He was their best player and contributed to 19 goals (12 scored, 7 assisted), which is pretty respectable given how utterly hopeless Jelavic and Anichebe were that year. He opened up plenty of teams, including us. Hell last night he 'opened up' West Brom more in 45 minutes than RVP and Mata did all game.

Fellaini has great ability and can be influential both as a CM and as a #10 if used properly and in the right games. In the Premier League especially you need a mix of different types of players or you become too 1-dimensional. Barcelona non-withstanding, teams that plug away trying to be purists regardless of the opposition or whether its actually working end up winning nowt (see Arsenal for the last 10 years).

1372~~~
You can't really compare United to Everton, can you?

1373~~~
Hated the signing. But all your sins are washed away in my eyes Fellaini after you saved the game for United.

1374~~~
He'll always be a waste of money but last night showed that he's not the worst option to have coming off the bench in moments of desperation, especially when Di Maria is firing in crosses like he was.

In other words, at least he's not Anderson, a player who now has absolutely nothing to contribute to this squad.

1375~~~
I'm probably one of the biggest Fellaini fans on here but I don't think he should start ahead of Mata in most games....except the Chelsea game. We need some physical presence against Chelsea to have a chance of getting a goal or two. Blind-Fellaini-Herrera can be a really good combo

1376~~~
I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, and in any case it doesn't constitute an adequate response to any of the points I made. At Everton he played very well and demonstrated his quality and his strengths for all to see. Those strengths haven't fluttered away on the wind because he wears a red shirt with a devil on it instead of a blue shirt with a windmill or whatever on it.

No-ones arguing that he's going to be as key for United as he was at Everton, but that doesn't mean he's not perfectly capable of playing very well for us, as evidenced last night. I find it difficult to believe that people can have watched last night's game and not grudgingly accept that he could have a future at the club.

1377~~~
I still think it's hard to see him making it here long term. A few more performances like that will vastly increase his value though. I've always said that selling him in the summer when his value was rock bottom would have been a terrible call. Even if he'd been sent out on loan just to boost his sale value. As it is, it looks like LVG has a role in mind for him.

1378~~~
He has his strengths but it's not that he's been a brilliant footballer before. He is rather limited and still hasn't found his position yet. He's not good enough to play as a 10 and we have much better players who are better equipped. To see us lump the ball forward to him is not what I want to see and I doubt that would be a winning tactic

1379~~~
I still dislike his style of play as a central midfielder and a a forward we can do a lot better than him. It could even be argued he fouled Lescott for the goal. In the centre of the park he keeps things really simple but he also goes and hides a bit. Often times his first idea is to jog to the box and try to get onto something but he doesn't really get onto much for his size.

1380~~~
West Brom's statement on the Fellaini tweet. It's a load of bollocks. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1381~~~
I agree with you. He listened carefully and carried out instructions with intent and it all paid off. He needs to continue the form before we can say more however it is a stepping stone.

1382~~~
Firstly he's very underrated technically, you wont see him nipping past players like Iniesta or pinging 50 yard passes like Scholes but he's certainly not 'limited'. You just have to look at the evidence in front of you, he had better passing stats than Herrera last night, both in terms of passes completed and in terms of chances created. His second touch of the ball was an interception-cum-first time-outside-of-the-foot-pass which set Di Maria off down the wing and he scored a great goal. He's clearly far more capable than many on here would like to admit.

Secondly, better equipped for what? The ability to shake things up is important in this league. You can't just plug away at the same thing and expect to win because you're better than the other team. This is why Arsenal struggle; when the fashionable one touch football isn't working they don't have a plan B and they suffer for it. Herrera is by no means inferior to than Fellaini but we looked far more likely to score after the substitution because Fellaini gave us something that Herrera couldn't. Having someone like Fellaini around allows us a completely different set of tactical options which, in situations like last night, will result in us picking up more points over the course of the season than we otherwise could have. No-one's saying he should be a nailed on first-XI player or that he's better than Rooney/Mata/Herrera. What they're saying is that he has attributes that the others can't offer, and that in certain games those attributes can be beneficial to the team.

1383~~~
Yup. Completely agree. He was simple and tidy with his passes. Kept possession when he had the ball. Scored. He wasn't brought on to be a number 10; not sure why people are expecting creativity. The way the game was going, his skillset definitely helped get us back in.

1384~~~
Maybe now we can add a couple more millions to his transfer fee.

1385~~~
Fellani had a nice game-probably best as a United player. But, why exaggerate?  According to Optima, Herrara was 27/32 (84%) passing; Fellani was 25/30 (83%). Yes, Fellani created two chances and scored a goal. He showed what many here think is his role-a plan B option when things aren't going well. Fellani didn't make the earth move for me despite his good game.

1386~~~
The stats I saw had Fellaini at 83% and Herrera at 81%, I'm not sure why there always seems to be discrepancies between different sources.

1387~~~
So statistically Fellaini either barely bested or just came short against a player lacking match fitness and clearly not at his best. Why does this matter so much?

1388~~~
I hope he keeps up this same motivation and hunger he displayed.

1389~~~
I still think he is not a good choice for CM role. I would honestly play him ahead of Mata for now. 

He is very useful when he is around the opposition box. As a CM, he still has all the flaws in his game, and a goal does not change that.

1390~~~
This is a brilliant post and sums up how I rate him as well. Especially the last part. I don't think any of us has said he is "better" than so and so but having different options for different scenarios can always help.

1391~~~
Not in a 2 man midfield but if he has Blind-Herrera next to him he can be very useful in certain situations.

1392~~~
Not a kneejerk reaction but I think he should start against Chelsea. He must have confidence now and we need power in the middle against them, who will inevitably play with a solid engine room.

1393~~~
Everton's team was build around him. Hoof the ball from every position to his chest. He did well there but he won't do as good here. Actually, he might, if we start playing like Everton did. It will result on a midtable finish though, regardless of Fellaini's goals and assists.

He may play some role here in games when we can't break teams by playing fluid football, but those games will be rare. Just because he hoofed the ball good for them, won't make him a good player here when completely different qualities are required.

1394~~~
In his first season, he was disappointingly weak on the ball. I was expecting him to bully people but he was eased off the ball far too easily. Looking much stronger in his limited opportunities this season, for some reason. I particularly remember a crunching block tackle against Valencia (I think?) in pre-season.

1395~~~
I'm seeing him as some sort of Wrecking bar of sorts. When our strikers can't get through, he might be able to offer some additional danger if he can get on the receiving end of crosses, which we know we have at least one player that is capable of doing so. So when our usual style of play won't work, he might be a plan B that might work instead.

1396~~~
I would play him against Chelsea, in that role behind Falcao.  He'd cause problems to the likes of Terry with his height, and his confidence will surely be up after his performance & goal against West Brom.

Mata, as much as I like him, just isn't doing it at the moment and Januzaj wasn't great the other night.

1397~~~
That first highlighted bit is a typical misapprehension of someone who didn't really watch Everton all that much in 2012/3. Yeah they went long a fair bit but they (including Fellaini) also played some great football, as has been attested to by our resident Everton fans. But whatever, I can see that this isn't a myth that's never going to die.

As for the second highlighted bit, see this excerpt from my last post in this thread:

I'm not really sure why you're arguing with me? Unless your view is that the benefits of having him as another option don't justify him having a place in the squad, in which case I respectfully disagree. I entirely trust Van Gaal to get the best out of him, especially given that he's managed to coax more out of him in one game than Moyes did all of last season. Fellaini at his best is both acceptable midfield cover and a great Plan B and if used right he can become an important part of the squad.

1398~~~
I don't think that it is a myth at all. I've watched Everton (obviously not every game) and all I can remember is that they wingbacks (Baines and Coleman) crossed the ball to Fellaini as often as possible.

Yep, I completely think that what he offers doesn't justify him having a place on the team and spending the wages for him. He was better than Herrera on the last game but don't forget that Herrera was playing despite having an injury. Herrera has been far superior than Fellaini on this season, despite that he is on a new team and a new league.

I hope that LGV gets the best from him, but ultimatelly I think that his best isn't even in the level of minimum requirement to play for us. When we sign Strootman, I think that his time will be over.

1399~~~
I thought his goal was brilliant, not just the skill but the desire as well and LVG had clearly sent him on confident and pumped up, I am not his biggest fan but he showed what he can do in and around the box.

I just don’t see him as a midfielder his passing, touch and most importantly positioning just aren’t suited to it, he lacks intelligence on the pitch and gets lost at times. His around game was ok on Monday though but in order to him to have a future here he basically has to score a lot of goals, that papers over his short comings elsewhere so we will have to see if there is a role he can play where he will get the opportunity to do that, don’t see it myself but you never know and there is an argument he should start against Chelsea which would give him a chance to really change some opinions.

1400~~~
Fellaini will be full of confidence but Mata will be extremely motivated to deliver against Chelsea

1401~~~
I'm sorry, but that is utter bollocks. It seems the only recollection you have of his performances are those in a red shirt. 

You don't need intricate, quick passes to open up a teams defence. Fellaini would almost certainly disrupt the shape of any defence as most defenders aren't used to dealing with such a player.

1402~~~
Hilarious amount of presumption. There has been no evidence at all so far this season to show that our inability to break down teams will be a rare occasion.

Strootman hasn't played a game in 7 months. There is a chance that he will not come back with the same tenacity that he had pre-injury. His ligament injury may also be a recurrent one. So many factors surrounding this potential transfer which effect the possibility of it happening, non more than the fact he is currently at a very good club with a good team (probably not the best time to be bigging up Roma).

1403~~~
He's always going to be effective in and around the opposition area. I said when we signed him that no-one really took a second look at him as a central midfielder, it was only when teams saw his contributions higher up the pitch that he was lauded as a £20m+ player. We need to use him exactly how he's most effective: bringing him on when we are struggling and allow him to win the ball and cause problems in the final third.

1404~~~
But not against Chelsea. Have you seen their back 4? Another reason why not: I dont like that particular style and I dont want to rely on a player like Fellaini. It didnt work last season either, why would we play a tactic that might worked 20 years ago or for some midtable physical PL team?

1405~~~
Exactly, why would we play purposely with 10 player + a target man, when we want to create a great team, Fellaini is not a big team material.
The goal he scored monday shows nothing, it's typically the kind of goal he can score but after that he is close to useless, which is a shame because he is good technically, good physically but positionally and defensively he is bad and a big liability.

1406~~~
Rubbish - he had a very good game on Monday all round, not just because of his goal. His passing was good and he did some vital midfield defensive work to win the ball several times.

He was not playing target man either so I have no idea why people keep talking about him as if we are going to start banging long balls up to him. He was playing in midfield and I wouldnt be suprised to see him start there on Sunday either.

1407~~~
I didn't judge his monday game, but his overall game throughout several seasons, he played well offensively monday but actively participate to our midfield disorganization (which was probably due to Van Gaal instructions).

1408~~~
It's not a tactic. Fellaini may be a tactic for Everton but not for United. United should have enough class throughout the rest of the field to carry on with their usual style of play. 

In my opinion, no weight can be held in last year's performances considering his injury problems  and the fact our manager was absolutely clueless. He played as an anchor to the back 4 most of the time for Christ's sake. The guy is a forward. 

Fellaini would cause problems to Terry and Cahill, of that I am very sure. Going by Mata's recent performances, there is no reason he should start over Fellaini, or signs to show he would offer more than Fellaini.

1409~~~
The style we want to play is not working. Mata has done nothing, Rooney is suspended and Januzaj is rusty.

Fellaini is probably feeling as well he's ever done at United. This is the ideal game to play him and his defensive ineptitude will not cost us with him playing as an AM. We've paid 27m for him, might as well use him while we have him.

1410~~~
I would like to see that at least once:

Falcao  Fellaini
<span style="color: #ffffff">----</span>Januzaj
Di Maria<span style="color: #ffffff">--</span>Herrera
<span style="color: #ffffff">------</span>Blind

1411~~~
Wow, this thread over the last few days. 

He scored his first goal for us in over a year and suddenly he's the answer to all our problems to some people? 

Give over.

1412~~~
In 7 games Mata had 2 goals and 1 assist and yet we want to replace him with the big lump who has just scored his first Manchester United goal.

1413~~~
Every dog has his day

1414~~~
Ignore the snobs. Anyone who thinks Fellaini offers <i>nothing</i> to us cannot have played the game and, in the nicest possible way, hasn't a clue what they are talking about.

Yes, he has his limitations (apart from Messi and Ronaldo, who hasn't?) but his strengths will be needed tomorrow. We cannot face a Chelsea side with Blind, Herrera & Mata as the "three" in midfield. Not to mention the aerial threat Chelsea pose at set-pieces. It'd be suicide.

Many are forgetting the excellent performances he regularly put in for Everton and Belgium as a midfielder, and also the good form he showed for us in spring of last season. He's not the oracle, nor turn out to be our Keane/Robson/Edwards, but he's damn effective and will give the opposition something to think about. It'll likely be a war of attrition tomorrow and we need people willing to put their bodies on the line for us. I like Mata but I don't think tomorrow's game will be played to his strengths, despite the fact he'll be itching to prove a point to Mourinho.

I think it's a no-brainer and Fellaini has to start tomorrow.

1415~~~
Insane people.

1416~~~
What strengths in particular? Excellent performances for Everton/Belgium as a midfielder, what games are these? Good form last spring, against whom? As for being effective, I agree he can be but not as a midfielder.

1417~~~
How so? I'd be wary of starting Mata tomorrow for several factors, including:

<ul>
<li>His form had dipped recently and he's on the periphery of games a lot more</li>
<li>His lack of pace. Yes, Fellaini's not quick neither but he has other traits suited to tomorrow's game. If Mata starts (as will van Persie), our two most forward players will have the collective pace of a banged-up Morris Minor</li>
<li>Tomorrow's game will be very physical and we know that Mata doesn't thrive in that environment</li>
<li>Starting him will likely mean we're quite small across the pitch, particularly in midfield</li>
<li>Mourinho and his team know him quite well. I think they'd have a tactical plan to nullify him which they'd implement with ease</li>
</ul>I like Mata, I really do, but I'm a firm believer in choosing XIs and systems suited to combating the opposition. I think starting Mata tomorrow has more negatives than positives, and it would be a mistake. 

Result > sentimentality.

1418~~~
You make a very valid argument. At home I'd just rather play Juan because I feel they are there to be got at but I totally see where you're coming from.

1419~~~
I'd be more inclined to start Fellaini and explore the possibility of introducing Mata/Januzaj around the 70 minute mark when the game opens up more. 

Starting Mata from the beginning, against an energetic and physically-imposing Chelsea side, is flirting with the possibility of him being suffocated out of the game alá how he was on Monday night.

1420~~~
I'd definitely start Fellaini in the #10 for this with Blind and Herrera in behind him. If we play our normal game Chelsea will kill us on the counter.

1421~~~
1 goal, 1 decent half of football and hes a starter now?? Wow

1422~~~
the one main thing he offers is agression. Yeah sometimes he oversteps the mark with bookings and fouls, but aggression is certainly one thing United lack at the moment.

1423~~~
It's a bit of a kneejerk reaction (and I'm a Fellaini fan). But I can see the logic in the argument for him starting. However I would probably be slightly in favour of having him come off the bench again rather than start.

1424~~~
We need someone to harass Fabregas from the outset and someone who'll overpower him in 50/50 duels. Fellaini isn't going to be our creative force, but defensively, as well as being an aerial threat in attack, he's an asset.

I can't believe folk are actually willing to go into tomorrow's game without the physical power and aggression that Fellaini will undoubtedly bring. It's not just because it's Fellaini either; if we had another player with those attributes (hence why we clamoured for Matic and Carvalho, for two), I'd be all for including them in the starting XI, too.

1425~~~
Can't say I agree. I think it's best to unleash Januzaj or Mata around the 70 minute mark when the game is open rather than bring on Fellaini then (should we be in a position whereby we need a goal).

1426~~~
I see what you are saying. I just don't think he has turned a corner yet with his form and if he was to start and struggle then we'd be back at square one with him and he'd not be useful to have out there. Mata when playing poor can keep the ball well, and better than Fellaini can.

1427~~~
We do need a bit of physicality in the middle of the pitch esp against a powerful team like Chelsea. You can see the likes of Terry, Ivanovic, Matic, Costa just steam-rolling us in the physicality stakes and just playing us off the park physically. Don't rate Fellaini at all and a huge fan of Mata but in tomorrow's game we need to start with Fellaini ahead of Mata or RVP. 

There were times last season when even the 'physical man-mountain' Fellaini was just a meek passenger in certain games, having just about no impact whatsoever, but hey at least he has the raw physical tools to do something. It's not going to be a physical scrap against a West-Ham or a Stoke and Chelsea can play good football mixed with physicality but having Fellaini there can give us a bit of bite (hopefully, not that he showed that last season though).

1428~~~
With Fellaini in #10 we will lose a lot of pace, i prefer to see him upfront, there we can exploits some of his qualities without his huges weakness.

1429~~~
Yeah, up front alongside Falcao with Di Maria in the hole. That'd be a dynamic front three and would cause Chelsea a lot of problems.

1430~~~
Fellaini is still poor defensively, still lets his man run off him and he doesn't read the game well despite a decent 45 minutes on Monday.

1431~~~
Lose pace? How so? Mata's pretty slow.

1432~~~
He scored a  good goal and made an impact which is for me his best role for us. 

If he plays a/m then I just think we'll lose a lot from the build up, we may get more in the box but not sure we'll create the same openings we could.

Playing deeper as well I think he causes problems again with the build up play. He's just too far up the pitch before the move has started. I think we could definitely have created more against West Brom towards the end had he stayed deeper and made a run forward once we were in a good position. What he did though and what he tends to do and really what a lot of our midfielders/fullbacks have been guilty of in recent years is just push so far up that the opposition just has to close down the deeper midfielder to stifle us.

So many times you see the only pass out is to someone having to run back towards our goal which immediately puts us on the back foot and reduces the passing options. It's not just Fellaini but I think he's particularly guilty at it.

Plus still gives too many silly fouls and Chelsea will punish us big time with some set pieces in good areas i reckon.

1433~~~
Januzaj instead of Mata, and the problem with Fellaini is not is speed per se, but the fact that it takes him a little more time to do everything (control, turn, pass) and he is good at creating chances for himself (very good runs behind the defenders) but he isn't good at creating chances for others.

Falcao--Fellaini
----Januzaj
Di maria-Herrera
-----Blind

1434~~~
Mata has been poor in the #10 role and comes up short physically.
Fellaini is confident and coming off the back of his best performance for us.
Playing at #10 ensures that Fellaini's defensive issues are not exploited.
Chelsea have a very physical team through the middle.

Combine all that and I'd like to see Fellaini start tomorrow.

1435~~~
Agree. Some folks are definitely getting carried away after Fellaini's decent 45mins. Decent is the right word too. He hardly set the world alight.

We were very dominant possession-wise in the second half vs West Brom and he had very little defensive work to do. I've seen some posters saying he should be in the box to box role to add some physicality, but that's no good when he can't get close to his man. I'd definitely still choose Herrera over him in a box to box role. As I've said in the match day thread I'd give Mata one last chance to prove himself in the #10 role before Rooney returns. Especially as it's against his old club. That leaves Fellaini on the bench for me, but hopefully he can do a job as an impact sub again.

1436~~~
Starting Fellaini against Chelsea would be hilarious. Yes, he caused problems against West Brom, basically because they shit themselves every time we lumped it towards him, and overall he did well. But Chelsea have far to much physical strength and height in their team for that to really hurt them. They would also embarrass Fellaini with their ability on the ball compared to him.

Tbh if we're already resorting to the 'lump it to the big man' tactics after spending £150 million on new players, then I'd be pretty pissed off, and disillusioned.

1437~~~
It doesn't have to be hoofing it to him or whatever though. He's more than capable of taking a pass along the ground with his back to goal and laying it off to someone in an intricate fashion. He's better technically than people give him credit for.

1438~~~
If that means we win the game then I'm all for it.

1439~~~
Seems to me we're far from ready to play our "normal" game against a side of Chelsea's current calibre. Trying to outplay 'em through possession football looks pretty much like suicide to me. So, if I were LVG I'd try something slightly different. I don't know if Fellaini is strictly speaking necessary for this "slightly different" approach - but IF (I say if) we were to field him in an advanced midfield role of sorts, what people normally fret about when it comes to him wouldn't be a worry. If he gets assigned more or less his offensive Everton role of old - basically being tasked with giving them hell in any way he can - with Blind and Herrera in deeper roles behind him, he wouldn't be a liability in terms of positioning and whatnot.

And, yes - he would be an asset on set pieces. LVG isn't a stranger to opting for the ugly option if he has to, unlike what some people who fantasize about champagne football seem to think. I just hope he - LVG - sets out to win this match no matter what the cost, rather than insisting on the philosophy. That can wait - I think a win here could mean the world to these players, whether it's pretty or ugly matters feck all under the circumstances.

1440~~~
I really don't see Fellaini causing Chelsea many problems at all. They have the physicality to deal with his aerial presence, and they'll eat him up on the ground.

1441~~~
Maybe but Mata doesn't exactly inspire much confidence does he? Why not try something that might work rather than something that's clearly not working?

1442~~~
I think Fellaini should start. He has done well every time he has played this season and his physicality can offer a threat to Chelsea.

Mata has been in very poor form, and I just cant see him doing anything against Chelsea - he will get muscled off the ball too easily by Matic and the defenders, and doesnt really offer much if the entire team isnt playing well.

1443~~~
I think he will start instead of Mata. He deserves it too, to be honest.

1444~~~
Has he? He did well to get his goal on Monday, but apart from that I can't think of one very good game he's had.

1445~~~
He's barely featured. He did well last week and the last time I remember him being brought on was in preseason when he scored as well.

I think he deserves a chance and will be more effective against Chelsea than Mata.

1446~~~
What are you talking about? He had a good appearance, I hope he does well against Chelsea if given the chance, but he is not a long term solution for any of our issues.

1447~~~
I hope he does well today. Its a big chance for him, he has an important role especially at set pieces and he has a little bit of momentum from last week.

Not going to lie if he doesnt do well though.

1448~~~
Hope he does well but he's utterly shit playing in midfield. But if Herrera is not fit then I don't think Van Gaal had any other choice.

1449~~~
He has been very good for me so far. Thoughts?

1450~~~
Think he's done brilliant.

1451~~~
Very happy with his first half performance. Needs to keep his arms down, but that wasnt the usual elbow in the face just a stray arm. He's had a very visible effect with his physicality and he's moved the ball on at a good speed

1452~~~
Excellent game so far. More of the same in the second half please. He's getting himself about.

1453~~~
A very good, solid performance so far.

1454~~~
Mostly man-marking Fabregas, keeping him out of the game well. Other than that a couple of clearances or tackling, nothing groundbreaking. Tidy like other midfielders.

1455~~~
Not really. He has been used as some kind of support for Januzaj but they aren't combining very well, altough Januzaj is having a good game. We are using him as our target man at times, van Gaal figured out quite easily he isn't really a cm, because Mata was probably more defensive than him through the game. Give me Herrera and we'll be much better.

1456~~~
Probably our best player so far, interesting. Van Gaal really is a genius

Not very good attacking-wise though

1457~~~
Take away any defensive responsibility and he looks, I don't want to say good, but a lot less shit?

1458~~~
He's playing with more confidence, but not sure whether he's meant to be ahead of Mata so regularly. Has made a fair few tackles and headers defensively so fair play.

1459~~~
This might be the key. We dont want him in Blind's position as we saw last season when we tried to use him in front of the defence. I recall he played a couple of times with Carrick but he still didnt play as well as he has done in that 45 minutes.

Maybe Blind's very slightly different style, and the confidence of scoring last week have combined to see a different Fellaini

1460~~~
It's deceptive that he's playing ahead, he's following Fabregas who's trying to pick the ball off CBs.

1461~~~
Been a competent midfield display, no more,but even that stands out at United these days. Blind has been a bit lax at times.

1462~~~
Surprisingly doing well and keeping possession. Big asset on defending set pieces and you can tell his confidence is up. Impressed that he is able to hold up the ball and play it to the wings. Might turn out to be the matchwinner for us if we actually can put in a dangerous cross/freekick/corner!

1463~~~
Playing very well if he can keep building and take his game a couple of steps higher i can see him being a very useful squad player who will get a fair few games.

1464~~~
Solid game so far. He needs to keep his arms down though.

1465~~~
He's done great to cut off the link between Matic and Fabregas. Showed a lot of desire and hunger, as well. Needs to move even higher up the pitch as the game progresses.

1466~~~
Doing a great job for us. Hopefully he can keep up the tempo in the second.

1467~~~
Can't fault him today, done really well for all his limitations, if other players showed as much desire as he did today we might well have won.

1468~~~
Probably been our best player tbf. Or one of.

I still have no idea what position he's playing at any given time, but he's done all that could be asked of him.

1469~~~
Most of the team were below a 7/10 for me today. Fellaini was a solid 7/10

However his moment came in injury time and made sure to win a decent header and make Courtois work leading to the goal. So I'll bump him to 7.5/10 imo behind only De Gea

I hope he keeps this momentum and goal threat up

1470~~~
Good game from him, his height at last came in handy at the best time possible.

1471~~~
Assist <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1472~~~
Brilliant performance today. Completely vindicated LVG's decision to start him and hopefully the gave doubters something to think about.

1473~~~
Fellaini is going to win our MOTM award against Chelsea.

Who'da thunk it?

1474~~~
He's like one of those kids who you play because he's big, strong and a bully, position be damned! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1475~~~
Superb game from the mighty elbow.

1476~~~
Pleasant surprised to see him do amazingly well in a B2B role, the kind we all wanted him to play as. 

There is still hope.

1477~~~
Looked like a United player today. His strength allowed us to match up to Matic in midfield

1478~~~
Just keep him anywhere else but our 1/3 of the pitch and he looks decent.

1479~~~
He's been getting stick but today he was our standout player and did not disappoint LVG when given the chance to prove himself.

1480~~~
He is so, so poor defensively and off the ball.

1481~~~
Thought he played well. Shame that header didn't go in. He deserved some more acclaim.

1482~~~
Fair fecks.

1483~~~
Our man of the match today! He's been great the past week! Hope he can keep it up!

1484~~~
Its so funny seeing people on here struggle and trying their hardest to avoid giving Fellaini praise - trying to come up with any sort of convenient excuse or reason other than the fact that they were just simply wrong.

Thats two consecutive MotM performances - and still there are people determined to try to slag him off. Its amusing, but its also really pathetic seeing that from so-called supporters of the club.

Well in Fellaini. I have always been in the "he will come good" camp and he should be one of the first names on the team sheet against City.

1485~~~
Very good performance. Good in possession and did well to close Chelsea down as well. If he can build on this he could become a very good player for us. Never thought I should say that!

1486~~~
Motm for me today.

I'm Happy that he's doing well looked every bit like a United player today.

1487~~~
He's fitting in when he don't need to be in the center of things. Made use of his physics.

1488~~~
He had a very good game as a Box-to-box midfielder. Shows what confidence, strong managerial leadership and a gameplan can do for a player.

1489~~~
My guy has done it again. Once again it has been proved: Form is temporary, class is permanent. What do you think <a class="username" data-user="66348, @.Rossi" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66348/">@.Rossi</a> ? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1490~~~
Fellaini is the bees knees.

1491~~~
It was the same shit with his last goal 'some referees would've given a foul on Lescott'. Who the feck cares though, haters gonna hate and all that. 

LVG's doing wonders to him.

1492~~~
I still don't think he's a very good football player, and he sometimes just kind of runs around without any positional awareness, but he can be effective in his own way. Good performance overall from him.

1493~~~
Smalling my mom, but Fellaini definitely thereabouts. Great performance. He's actually very good and composed on the ball and has the ability to go past a defender.

1494~~~
Excellent performance, seeing him go toe to toe with Matic was a pleasant surprise and he ended u salvaging a bunch of loose balls. Van Gaal got his usage spot on really.

1495~~~
He was a very good footballer today, so not sure what you mean.

1496~~~
LVG has really helped him.  Maybe he can keep his dream to be a big player for us. I'm happy for him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1497~~~
Very happy to see him proving people wrong. I feel bad for ripping on him, thought it probably helped him become a better player <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Would like to see him start against City, could give Silva a few problems.

1498~~~
A bit over the top. He did well to get his goal on Monday and was fairly troubling for their defence, but I didn't think it was a particularly remarkable or excellent performance either. Did well today though, so I'll give him praise for that.

I still don't think he's going to be very good for us long-term, but he's playing well at the moment and is being used to good effect.

1499~~~
Did well, and we got the goal from a set piece which actually went to him, should have been targeting him all day.

1500~~~
MOTM.

1501~~~
Good form atm. Winning tackles, keeping possession well and aerial balls.

1502~~~
He had a good game, but I'm not convinced that he's a very good player technically, or that he's positionally aware at all. Again though, good game today and he has his uses.

1503~~~
I see almost nothing but praise for his performance. He plays well, he gets credit. Its pretty simple. It doesn't change his past performances but gives hope for the next ones

1504~~~
So have I. We all saw his quality in Everton and knew he'd come good. Last season I was getting bashed for saying he is better than Cleverly.

And yes it is funny. Some posts on here saying  stuff like "He did well within his limitations" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1505~~~
I've been a huge critic of his, but he had a good game definitely. 

Showed work rate and controlled aggression. Last season he was far too languid.

1506~~~
Good for him, glad he is stepping it up and starting to prove people wrong.

1507~~~
Another good match from him, he's fighting well for his place.

1508~~~
My MOTM and I take back everything I said before the game about how he wouldn't benefit us defensively. He was very impressive all round. I'm very very happy to be wrong.

1509~~~
Whatever LvG is saying to Fellaini, its working.

1510~~~
He showed great technique today - even dribbled past a few players and had good close control. Also, his positioning defensively and in attack was good - so judging by this game he is a good footballer, but has been struggling at United.

1511~~~
Credit for the goal,  but I thought he look poor whenever he got the ball.  He first touch almost always lead to Chelsea posession.

1512~~~
Looks like I've been proven wrong, thought he'd be a passenger in big games like these just like last season. I hope his form continues on.

1513~~~
One and a half good games though don't suddenly make him a good player - if we were going by that then Anderson and Cleverley would be judged as top players. Again, good game today and some massive improvements from him, but I still don't particularly think he's a great player technically, despite some impressive moments. I don't want to seem too critical though because he was very good today.

1514~~~
Put himself about, a couple of nice tackles on Fabregas and Matic made sure they couldn't stroll around midfield, and used his strength well. Easily his best game for us, close to what he could do for Everton.

1515~~~
He was a good footballer at Everton as well...

1516~~~
The same people critical of him always ignore the fact he's been mostly injured since he's joined us.......some people. Today put in a good performance and as a team we have to build on it.

1517~~~
He's turning it around and I'm delighted for him.

1518~~~
His first touch was the reason we had precision balls from defence work today. 3/4 passes from Rojo were controlled and passed perfectly by Fellaini. Not sure where you saw him look poor

1519~~~
He was our man of the match today. First time he's really played well for us.He kept it simple, didn't lose possession and was great at at winning the ball back. He offers a lot more than Herrera in this moment with his major weakness being that he is not one for defence splitting passes which is pretty important for a box to box midfielder to be able to do from time to time

1520~~~
Our MOTM

1521~~~
It's like we've made a new signing out of the blue.

He did a great job today, motm for me, we now have a role for him that he's comfortable with, his confidence should be soaring now and i fully expect him to start against city.

1522~~~
He was a good player for them, but that was largely down to the way they used him. A lot of his uses come from his aerial threat, but at teams with ambitions to win trophies you're rarely going to see someone like him as a main starter. Not an awful player, but not one I rate particularly highly either despite his impressive game.

I'm open to being proven wrong and will happily admit I am if he has an excellent season, but I'm not going to completely change my opinion of him after one and a half games.

1523~~~
Man of the match! I am delighted for him!

1524~~~
I thought he was our best player on Monday (although looking back at the Match Day thread I see that Blind got MotM ahead of him admittedly). Not saying that it was a GOAT performance but if he is one of (or the single) best performer in our team, surely that should merit him keeping his place in the side?

Let me help you look;







Just from a brief skim. Plenty more veiled criticism and heavily guarded praise. If it were Herrera or Carrick who put in that performance, there would be much less negativity I would wager.

1525~~~
Marked Cesc out of the game. That, I didnt expect.

1526~~~

He's had about two seasons playing like that in Everton. Some people will just never appreciate.

1527~~~
Good game again. Love to see someone turn it around, but still too early to tell. Could well turn out to be an assett for us though.

1528~~~
Yeah, it seems like we have a new CM. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1529~~~
Fair enough thats too harsh

1530~~~
He is good when he is near the opposition box, just play him behind the forwards instead of CM.

1531~~~
I think it's just how clumsy he can look at times when he can't get his feet sorted out.

Played well overall today though. Would've been nice for him to get the goal at the end.

1532~~~
That's because Carrick has established himself as a very good first team player while here, and Herrera has shown some very promising signs so far. Guarded praise is understandable for someone who's been quite shit for the majority of their time at the club. Today, most posters are saying he's been MOTM. That's a massive level of praise.

1533~~~
You're barking at the wrong tree with my comment, it was made during half-time and I've had him as a MOTM for last two matches, also been a stalwart defender of his last season.

You could say I was fan of his before it was popular. <span style="color: #ffffff">i'll get my coat</span>

1534~~~
Thought he did really well today. And (something that amazed me) was pretty good on the ball too

1535~~~
I'm one of Fellaini's critics, but he has played well in the last couple of games. Keep it up Marouane!

1536~~~
Always thought he was a better player than he showed last season, certainly good enough to be a squad player here. The real question was whether he could deal with all the pressure he was under and actually contribute in key games as other squad players have for us in the past. The last couple of performances have been a good sign in that regard.

Was never and will never be good enough to be a regular starter for us but at least he is starting to look like he can be a useful option off the bench or in one off games. I'll happily take that from him at this stage.

1537~~~
He was fantastic today. Kept Fabregas quiet and contributed offensively. 

His best performance for us to date.

1538~~~
Thought he was one of the best players on the pitch today. Better performance then last week..

Are you going to keep harassing me?

1539~~~
I still didn't like his performance.

1540~~~
He's had about two seasons playing like that in Everton. Some people will just never appreciate.[/QUOTE]

Again though, very different situation. He was a very good player for Everton, but I don't think anyone really believed he was the type of player we needed when we bought him, or that he's what you'd refer to as a top class player. He has his uses - and is getting the most out of them at the moment - but that doesn't mean we should all be forced to turn round and call him a great player who's proven us all wrong. If he continues like this? Fair enough, I'll admit I was wrong. But until then, I'll still believe he's a fairly average player technically. He's hit some good form, but lets see if he can sustain it.

1541~~~
Been absolutely fantastic when he's played this season.

1542~~~
Fellaini did the job excellently today...

1543~~~
That's the sort of performance we want to see on a regular basis from Marouane, that goal last week seems to have given him huge belief.

1544~~~
Why? He was United's best player.

1545~~~
To be honest I missed the first half, only watched the second.  But he did nothing impressive for me in that half apart from the goal

1546~~~
I think some people form opinions on players before they've set foot on the pitch.

1547~~~
I did and still do believe. I was in the newbs then and had a thread about how Fellaini will be an important player for us.

He'll perform like this again but in 5-10 games he'll have one crap game and all of you will shite on him again.

1548~~~
If that amazed you then you never watched him play as a box to box midfielder at Everton then.

1549~~~
We were poor in the 2nd half up until minute 80, but he was still doing a good job winning balls in the 2nd half. The first half we completely dominated and he was a big reason for that, his hold up play and first touch were key in transitioning from defence to final third. All in all, man of the match today.

1550~~~
Nonsense. Herrera is a much better footballer than Fellaini.

1551~~~
Was a force today. He's at his best in a forward position. Where does he play when Falcao comes back?  I don't see him as a #10, or deeper in MF?

1552~~~
He didn't say he wasn't. Mata is better footballer than both but he doesn't offer a lot right now.

1553~~~
He was pretty good today. LVG used him quite well.

1554~~~
He was box to box today. Made occasional runs into the box.

1555~~~
Why is guarded praise understandable? If a player puts in a good performance then you should be able to praise that performance. If he had played badly today then I really doubt that people here would be holding back on criticising him on the grounds that he had a good game on Monday.

Im going to repeat something I have said several times - Fellaini was signed on the last minute of deadline day, he had no preseason and played half of last season with a wrist injury. He was seen as a "Moyes Man" and was also presented to us as the CM signing that we desperately needed, when most were expecting a Kroos, Thiago or Fabregas. We paid over the odds as well.

None of that is Fellainis fault, but pretty much from day 1 he has had the fans on his back and against him. He was not a popular signing and most fans made up their minds on him very quickly. Last season was an unmitigated disaster, and for most of the squad that seems to be good enough grounds for writing off their performances - "because the entire team was shit last year." Yet with Fellaini this logic isnt extended to him - his performances last year were purely because he is apparently rubbish, even though - as explained above - he had more mitigating circumstances than most of the squad (no pre-season, playing with an injury etc).

I could go on, but honestly im not going to waste my time because when it comes to trying to defend Fellaini on here, it is like talking to a brick wall.



edit: As others have said though those who are so surprised that Fellaini can actually control the ball well, pass well, tackle well etc - obviously didnt watch him at Everton. His all-round game is massively underrated on here.

1556~~~
Wow I'm surprised he's getting such positive comments. I thought he was frustrating today. He got some basic stuff right, but he doesn't contribute enough - he makes a two yard pass and then lumbers into the box and waits there for it to be crossed in. Defensively he was alright but far from imposing.

1557~~~
I remember one backheel to Januzaj I think and from a high ball too, wasnt that simple to do but he did it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1558~~~
Turned a corner? He had a good first half.

1559~~~
What game did you watch exactly?

Sesme like some people just wont let go, some even wont say he's been good.

1560~~~
Fair enough if that was the case,  I hope he come good though, but I still want Herrera start when he's healthy

1561~~~
Yeah. That's fair. He was all over. As an attacker though I think he's more dangerous in an advanced role.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps9e0878b2.jpg" src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps9e0878b2.jpg"/>

1562~~~
Good performance from him today. Didn't look out of his depth against a big team for a change. Almost grabbed the equaliser as well.

1563~~~
That's a good chart. From someone like him that's what I want to see. Just go all over the place and be a an annoyance to the opposition.

1564~~~
Thought he was crucial in help us match Chelsea today. The physical presence he gave us today was quite invaluable. One of the reasons why Chelsea couldn't assert there famous pressing game on us.

1565~~~
Was great I thought. Marked Fabregas out of the game and did well on the ball for the most part. Probably his best performance at United.

1566~~~
One of our top three players on the pitch.

1567~~~
Was our best player, simple as that.

1568~~~
Agree with those who have said Fellaini's all round game is underrated here, he proved at Everton that it was at least good enough to function as a midfielder at PL level. That isn't to say he's technically excellent or anything near it but neither is he the talent vacuum some people like to portray him as.

That said, his defensive capabilities were seriously overrated before he came here too so at least there was a nice balance to people's misconceptions of him.

1569~~~
He has his moments, there was a really nice flick on he did in this game for Januzaj to run on to for instance.

1570~~~
He was very good today, nullified chelsea's superior midfield mostly. Played box to box, any criticism is just cognitive bias.

1571~~~
I watched the same game as you. I gave my opinion and explained why. I was in no way derogatory towards Fellaini nor people who rated his performance - I was in no way degrading of Fellaini as a player overall. 

For the record, compared to most of this forum I am far from a Fellaini detractor. However I hate it when he is deployed as a box-to-box midfielder as he plays it in a way that I completely disagree with, and I personally find that frustrating to watch. If you have a problem with that then explain yourself - don't make ridiculous sweeping, personal assumptions and make smug, dismissive posts.

1572~~~
This 4141 formation might be the perfect formation for Fellaini. He had a great game. And if you are familiar with my (negative)opinion of him then you should know how good a game he had.

1573~~~
Probably deserves to play versus City, and could use his physicality. But not sure where he fits.  This as a front 6?

Rooney RVP/ Falcao

  Fellaini  ADM Herrera
             Blind

1574~~~
Excellent performance. Putting himself everywhere and causing chaos.

1575~~~
He was brilliant today, kept Fabregas quiet all game and definitely deserves to start next week against City.

1576~~~
He just isn't doing what I think central midfielder should do. Pretty simple things really, as a midfielder he should be controlling the things, be more involved in the build up and not just waiting for every situation to run in the box for us to hoof the ball instead of being available as an option for the pass. Blind had 58 passes, that's almost 20 more passes than him, Smalling and Rojo almost had double passes than him, all with more accuracy. As a central midfielder for Manchester United that shouldn't happen IMO, so I have no idea how can he get MOTM from some people for this.

Just to be clear, he wasn't bad, but I just can't understand how he can get MOTM for a average performance like this.


Well sometimes that's the case, but not always and not in my case. Whenever someone isn't happy with Fellaini some of you think it's because that person doesn't like him.

1577~~~
He kept Fabregas extremely quiet and competed well with Matic. I'm not sure what more you could expect of him defensively today.

1578~~~
Thought he was our best player tonight and did a great job on keeping Fibreglass quiet. His link-up play was good as well - didn't slow us down and kept things thicking. 

Credit where it's due - he was great against WBA and now against Chelsea. He deserves to keep his spot in the team for the City game, especially when we'll need physicality in midfield. Lining up with a midfield of Blind, Mata and Herrera against Toure, Fernando and Fernandinho would be suicide.

1579~~~
Surprising performance by him, it was very pleasing to see.

1580~~~
If you're insinuating that's what happened with him so far then that would be incorrect. If he performs regularly then he won't be shat on for one bad game.

1581~~~
He was good today and I do like that he goes into the box but IMO he does it too often, when we get the ball in their half he just runs into their box and just stands there, IMO a midfielder needs to do more than that. Would make a good player in a three man midfield though.

1582~~~
He played well but he completely switches off at set pieces. People walk away from him.

1583~~~
He was alright. Nothing really that was outside the range of ability that is already expected of him, but evidently Chelsea weren't man enough to give him a challenge.

1584~~~
--------------------Falcao----------------------
Di Maria-----------Rooney-----------Januzaj

-------------------Fellaini---------------
----------Di Maria-------Herrera-------
--------------------Blind-----------------

-----------------------------Falcao---------------------

all have their merits and weaknesses. And then there's Carrick still to come in as well. First time in a long time I've felt like we've had good competition for places through the midfield/attack. Lots of players, including Fellaini, deserve to start at the moment which can only be a good thing.

1585~~~
He was decent and that's a couple of promising games in a row, good for him. Defensively I think we're weaker with him in the side but he is doing better with a more forward role.

1586~~~
Dont be such a drama queen, my 2nd sentence wasnt about you in particular.It sasnt dismissive or smug or sthing. 

Today he wasnt frustrating to watch, quite the opposite, played a box to box mid and played very good, kept it simple, connected defense and final 3rd well and defensively was on mark to.

1587~~~
Second from that or the third one is what I want to see

1588~~~
He's a really strange player, obviously enjoyed him today. Will be very interesting to see if Van Gaal can get some tactical awareness into him. Seemed to know what he was doing more than usual for us today, although he still had a typical Fellaini-style game.

Herrera is a better and more creative passer, scored two nice goals for us too. But I reallly wouldn't know who to chose versus City. If Yaya is playing and has a good game, even Fellaini can't really contain him. And if I had to choose between a struggling Fellaini and Herrera letting the ball do the work, might go for the latter. Especially with Rooney back, we need good football, not Fellaini's present upfront.

On the other hand I wouldn't mind it at all if he played against City.

1589~~~
Excellent performance

1590~~~
People can recognise what's he done today, and can recognise that he's played well, so stop with the "brick wall" shite. It's my personal opinion that Fellaini is a fairly average footballer and that he's not what we need long-term, but he's playing well at the moment and I'm happy for him to be played because he isn't outright terrible and can be effective. I understand you rate him more, and that's fine - you've got every right to feel that way. You're not going to go anywhere in a discussion if you just write off everyone who isn't suddenly jumping on the Fellaini bandwagon as someone who's just refusing to listen. He's hit some decent form, but he has to actually sustain that now.

Being brought in last minute wasn't the problem. It didn't help him (you're spot on with that), but many felt from the start that he just wasn't what we needed. His technical ability and all-round game is better than what he's generally shown so far, but it's still fairly average in comparison to the level we aspire to reach. He's not a terrible passer, but he's not the sort of player who can be relied upon to control a game either, as Carrick has done in the past, or players like Blind and Herrera are arguably capable of doing. He can control a football, yes, but he's playing in the Premier League. The vast majority of players can control a ball, but I'm not particularly convinced that Fellaini is very comfortable or controlled when he's on it. He was better today, but again, that doesn't suddenly swing the entire consensus on him.

A good performance today, but I'm not going to get carried away with it. That doesn't somehow mean I refuse to praise him or that I'm a brick wall, because I'm acknowledging his positives.

1591~~~
Why was he rubbish?

1592~~~
I told you what a monster of a player we bought. A shame Moyes did not fit him in well at a big club. I am very impressed with him and happy for myself.

1593~~~
Strange. I think he did all those things. Against WBA he ran to the box too much. Today not.
It wasnt an average performance by any means.

1594~~~
Decent game. Looks like he's been instructed not to assault opponents and play football. His passing is very good, and his first touch is top notch. He really helped us win the midfield battle for the most part of the game. Played a big part in winning the aerial ball for the equalizer too. No complaints. I hope he can kick on and be a useful option.

1595~~~
My main problem with your post was the open line. "What game were you watching?" Arrogant and patronizing. Would you talk like that to someone in person in response to them explaining their opinion?

Why the feck are some people completely incapable of conversing in a civil matter on the internet. (Oh, but I don't mean you in particular)

If you didn't find Fellaini frustrating that's great for you. I did, as he lumbered slowly away from where he should have been and waited for a long ball. Call me crazy but I actually like my midfielders to contribute to build up play and to help work the ball into dangerous positions. If Fellaini could do that and arrive into the box late and cause problems, great. Him standing in the box whilst we try to maneuver the ball into a crossing position is ineffective and we will not score enough goals with this tactic.

1596~~~
Really good again. Van Gaal has found him a position in this squad and I think he can be a very useful player for us.

1597~~~
My main problems with him have always been how poor he is at tracking runners and how often he switches off defensively. With Blind playing deeper that's not as much of an issue.

He did well today.

1598~~~
Was he assigned to Fabregas? I didnt know the big guy could that.

1599~~~
Fair play to him. He had a specific job to do today and he did it well

1600~~~
Oh come ooon, it wasnt that bad.

I saw the game completely different. He'd done a very good job in midfield and contributed to our play a lot. As opposed to WBA game he didnt just run for headers, quite the contrary he did what a mid should do and did ti very good. 
But I guess we saw different things. Fair enough.

1601~~~
Decent performance. Did very well in the first half, sort of fizzled out in the second half. Wouldn't mind seeing him play as the advanced midfielder in a diamond, with Rooney+1 as the strikers.

1602~~~
So happy for him, valuable squad player to have

1603~~~
I thought this was one of his best games for us if not the best. Its a pity though that we are not taking advantage of his height with our crosses and corners.

1604~~~
Really?

Because I think of Moyes' two expensive purchases, Mata may be the better "footballer" (whatever that really means) but quite clearly Fellaini is the one who brings the most to the team right now.  The lad played well today, and I for one was glad Mata came off... even when we were chasing a goal (which in theory is when you would want Mata on the pitch)

Every time Mata tried to dippsy-doodle his way out of the back I cringed.  He was lucky he got fouled a couple of times, because I didn't need a repeat of Leicester out there.

1605~~~
Did well today, buoyed from the confidence of the goal from last week.  

I particularly admired his commitment to marking Fabregas out of the game as well as stamina to keep going til the final whistle; his contribution to Van Persie last minute equaliser was critical.

Hopefully the confidence will help him feel like he belongs at our club and he can put together a thing of performances.  

I'd like to see him to head to head with Yaya in the derby next week.

1606~~~
He has earned the right to start the next game.

1607~~~
Ok today but some of the praise is over the top, still doesn't contribute enough in the build up play and gets caught out of position a lot, he also needs to think about just going in the box all the time especially if mata is playing as well, at times the wide players and full backs were too isolated.

He is at least offering something now though and hopefully he carries on doing that.

1608~~~
Big fella was our best player today by a mile. Nothing more to add than hopefully a few give him a chance now!

1609~~~
Excellent today, keep it up Fella!

1610~~~
As opposed to all the bullshit people have talked about a player who's barely played you mean? In the last two games we've got two points. Wouldn't want to think about where we would be if he hadn't have featured ..

1611~~~
Very good today, comfortably our best player. Gave us presence in middle throughout the match, and that was pivotal in stopping Chelsea from running over us.

I still hate the "lump it long and hope for Fellaini to win it" as an offensive strategy though.

1612~~~
Is it just me or he hasnt been just running to the box as some of the posters think..

1613~~~
He did well today marked Cesc out of the game however I wouldn't get too excited as he is still technically sloppy. I think he would be great when we need strength in the middle until we bring in someone better.

1614~~~
Could have scored 3 goals today and people would still be loathed to praise him. Not many would be that effective marking Cesc. I think LvG likes what he brings to the team

1615~~~
Well he wasn't brilliant or man of the match as a lot of people are saying, it was a massive improvement but he still has a long way to go and needs to contribute more in other areas than just the opposition box. He did that a bit better today but it's still not enough.

1616~~~
Fellaini is the best we have in the position he was deployed in today. Should be starting most matches imho (particularly against the more physical and better teams).

1617~~~
Is it still possible that he becomes the better buy then the other Moyesenian?

1618~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ffs

Good game from him, not ashamed to give praise for a player I never wanted us to sign. I don't think he's a long term starter for us but I can't argue that he's making a case to be a squad man.

1620~~~
No, at times excellent. Fellaini being quite good with the ball at his feet isn't unusual and never has been. We need better and I don't see a real career here for him, but the downplaying of his ability has been rife and usually completely incorrect.

1621~~~
Whats odd is he rarely played that type of role for us last season, Moyes seemed keen on keeping him as a deep lying midfielder which i dont think is his game.

Still i'm happy for the guy as he looks like he wants to do well for us

1622~~~
Maybe some of the things he is doing are under instruction???

1623~~~
Arguably his best performance for us. He was good on both sides of the pitch and he shits on Fabregas.

1624~~~
You want over the top praise. Go to the Januzaj thread. not sure you watched the game because he was actually very good today. Linked play very well and made some very good challenges.

1625~~~
Fantastic performace, MOTM for me and it seems many others. LVG seems to be getting the best out of him, Oddly something Moyes failed to do.

1626~~~
1st half in particular he was immense, looked like he belonged in a United shirt today. MOTM

1627~~~
Maybe but maybe his isn't under instruction to do it all it the time and he has to contribute more if he is going to be a cm.

1628~~~
Finally delivering the performances I knew he was capable off. I remember Fellaini at Everton playing against us in certain games and we couldn't deal with him, he was a monster on the midfield, today and also last game remembered me of that Fellaini and remembered me why I wanted him at United at some point. I hope he can carry this on as he will surely win us games when he is in this form.

1629~~~
LVG doesn't have the relationship with him that Moyes had. Moyes was used to Fellaini being his most important asset, for LVG he's just one in his group of players.

Gary Neville said it perfectly on MNF. Moyes was fearful of using Fellaini the same or at least similar way at Everton because it'd be perceived as him replicating Everton.

LVG may not have him in his plans long term but while we're here we may as well utilize his strengths.

1630~~~
Clearly I did watch but I can look at it objectively, maybe you can't, his performance was good but no more than 7 out of 10, problem is every time he does something good or bad the reaction is over the top because people are either desperate for him to succeed of fail, in and around the opposition box he is a good player, in other areas he is average. 

He has had some good moments in the last two games and his performances have been better but he is and always will be a limited cm and he still has to improve to be worth keeping in the team.

1631~~~
Played well, fair play to him. Hopefully he stays focused like he did today and does a job when called upon.

1632~~~

1633~~~
Very happy with his performance today he gave us the physicality we needed from him. I respect him for wanting to do his best here and not giving up on his United career.

1634~~~
Did very well against West Brom and was our best man today along with DDG as far as I'm concerned.  It seems he's slowly turning some opinions about him.  Long may that continue.

1635~~~
The way some people were talking about him last season and in the summer, describing him as one of the worst players ever to have worn the shirt, portraying him as a footballer that has 0 qualities. Saying he would beter be playing at championship level, hoping he would get sold and would be happy to get £2.5m for him. The absolute hatred he got from some people over here for almost everything he did on the pitch, really some people just hated his guts, was totally uncalled for. Add to that some of our fans booing him when he came on in certain matches, it was beyond shamefull !

He is a decent footballer and he has his talents and if you use him the right way and show him a modicum of confidence and support he can be of great use for any team. The thing is he has almost never been entirly fit since his transfer, he has never gotten a fair chance to begin with from our fans, he was used in the wrong way same as Moyes used the entire team in the wrong way and last season wasn't ideal for any footballer to settle himself into the team. People just need soembody to vent their frustrations on and Fellaini was the easiest target, those people should be ashamed of themselves.

1636~~~
Fair points, I'd say.

Shouldn't forget that he struggled considerably with injuries last season either, though. He was strangely timid and tame compared to the player he was for Moyes at Everton - and that was partly down to him not being 100% physically, I think. In addition to being under considerable pressure to perform, of course.

He did well today - stayed on Fabregas, which was clearly his main task and managed to get himself into some good positions at times on top of that. Pleased for the big bastard - hopefully he can keep gaining momentum.

1637~~~
His all round play was good again today. His switching off to ball-watch whilst we are defending set-pieces is still a concern though.

1638~~~
Yeah, fair play to the guy. It was awful to hear him being booed in pre-season against Valencia. I still don't think he's good enough to succeed here in the long-term but he was excellent both today and against WBA.

1639~~~
Also a red card waiting to happen, every time he goes in I'm scared. 

I would not mind him as a back up option for our midfield, assuming Carrick and Herrera will be first choice for most games then that means Blind and Fellaini would be very good back ups.

1640~~~
This is a good point actually - if ADM and co had been on form with their crosses (as well as not being against arguably the best GK in the world at coming and claiming them) imagine what he couldve done?
It was only in the final minute when we actually put a decent ball in, and his header forced a great save from Courtois leading to the goal.


Fellaini obviously plays with instructions from LVG to get into the box regularly - as he should since his height and strength are great weapons. Why are people criticising him for this? Because he isnt an intricate 4ft Spaniard?

Fellaini did contribute to our buildup play, and when he deemed that there was going to be a cross coming in he got into the box. Whats the problem?

1641~~~
I wonder if he'll start against City next week. With Rooney, Falcao, Herrera and Carrick returning, the competition is stronger than ever. All of them are (significantly) better players than him. However, Fellaini was our best player today and was very good on last week too.

1642~~~
You will eat humble pie when you see Fellaini getting an extended run in the team at the expence of herrera. Herrera will be great in a year or two but we've been getting constantly over run in midfield with herrera in the team but Fellaini offers dynacism and atleticism and a physical presence that herrera is not yet able to offer. I thought we looked much more like a team with a decent central midfield today moreso than in any other game this season

1643~~~
He's the man at the moment, and good on him, just makes us look a bit more solid, and not quite such a bunch of wimps (Leicester!), deserves to retain his place atm.

1644~~~
Give over. I'm happy to accept someone's opinion but this just stinks of someone who didn't watch the game and if you did, with massively tinted glasses. Fellaini had a great game for us today, simple as that. No one is saying if he will become the midfielder we need who can be energetic, fierce, and box to box on a permanent basis, but I don't see how anyone can argue he was just "ok" today.

1645~~~
Credit to him today, thought he had a good game. Thought his movement when we had the ball was quite poor but in regards to his defending and when he had the ball, it was one of, if not his best in a United shirt, so it was great to see. Only 2 games but he is starting to earn a valuable spot in the squad.

1646~~~

1647~~~
I really enjoyed a tackle he made on Cesc, felt he did well. Good game hope it continues.

1648~~~
No not all I would question how you watched the game to be honest, he was nowhere near 'great', that's a poor use of the word, nobody was, it was a decent team performance all round, he faded in the second half so that for me isn't a 'great' performance. He was good in the first half, if he kept that up I would have said he was better than ok but like the whole team he faded so I don't see why anyone needs to get carried away or gets upset if he isn't lavished with praise. The tinted glass are from people who have been waiting for him to do anything decent and then when he does get carried away, 7 out of ten, he's getting better but nothing to get excited about yet.

1649~~~
His play back to goal was superb, he was picking up some really intelligent positions between their midfield and defense, was always a outlet for the defense and his first touch was much spot on today.

1650~~~
Fellaini had his best game today but faded after half time . Encouraging signs today but not enough to cement a permenent place in the starting 11 . 
He will need to keep going for 90 minutes before he can be considered first choice centre mid going forward .

1651~~~
Maybe he is a world class player...and Moyesey has just been holding him back?

1652~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1653~~~
He got the assist and was pretty good in the second half. He wont the ball numerous times

1654~~~
Happy for him, hope he can keep it up. Had a few good games last year aswell against Leverkusen for example but was found out vs City in the following game. Let's hope history does not repeat itself.

1655~~~
I thought the same but then I watched the game back again and on second viewing I thought he was very good in the second half also even leaving the header that led to the goal aside.

1656~~~
Had another good game. Was unlucky with his header which led to our goal.

1657~~~
LVG does love a transformation job!

Who needs Vidal anyway eh?

1658~~~
Yep. The way he nicked the ball from chelsea players feet a few times was very impressive. Last season he just commited fouls in those situations. His form can give the team a huge boost. His inability to make defence splitting passes will probably mean he is defo not a long term box to box solution but he is a very useful player to have in the team. I am happy for him

1659~~~
Also I think he is a confidence player.

Right after Chelsea scored I felt all our players were "down" a bit and Fellaini also went a bit headless chicken for a few moments. Luckily he grew back into the game. 

I feel like the goal midweek helped a lot as well. Before this he was just over-eager to prove something I feel.

1660~~~
Amazing that of all the players in the team - Di Maria, Januzaj, Mata etc. - it was Fellaini who was keeping us moving forward with his passing, particularly in the second half, when all the passes were going sideways or backwards. If anything we should've used him more than we did, especially from wide areas. Why did it take 91 minutes for a cross to finally find Fellaini in the box?

I still worry a bit about him defensively. Made some great tackles but at times he was not doing enough to get back. That was a problem created by the whole team though when we completely stood off Chelsea after the first goal. But he surprised me by how well he played today, and was our best outfield player (I chose to give De Gea MOTM). Glad to see he's performing well.

1661~~~
We have seen some highly touted players come to the club on large transfers and big wages, and then get off to an indifferent start, from which, they never recovered. I am impressed that after more than a year of uncertain times for him as a Manchester United player, and the heavy criticism, that he can still put in the effort and a solid, professional performance. It's a credit to his mentality because it can't be easy to see the manager who brought you in fired, your position reinforced with multiple signings, and then start the season ignored by the new manager.

1662~~~
he done very well today.  there is hope!

1663~~~
This is being slept on.

1664~~~
Good number of turncoats here - we all knew he could do this as he did it at Everton and for Belgium. He seems like a good professional to me and I'm glad it's going better for him this season. Confidence probably a large part of it.

I think he's helped immensely by the 3 in centre mid, really didn't think a 2 suited him but the way LVG plays means theres less space in there for opposition and he can get near players and surprise them, use his strength better. I never saw a huge problem with his technique but no denying it's looked more consistent this year. Still has the same box to box energy as last year, covered a huge amount of ground last year getting from defence right into centre forward, but hopefully we can pick him out a bit better this year with ADM and Shaw, Janu putting in balls instead of smalling/valencia/young/evra

1665~~~
Would be absolutely epic of LvG turns him into a £27m player.

1666~~~
Another good display today. We're playing to his strengths and that's proved to be useful for us.

1667~~~
Played well today and looked sharp. A bit of confidence and being completely fit has been huge for him.

1668~~~
A bit of confidence and he looks like a PL player again. Very good from him again today and long may it continue.

1669~~~
Tell yourself that mate. I was gutted to see him start but he played very well. Not outstanding but very well. I would say an 8 out of 10. Was one of our best players today.

1670~~~
Thought he was MoTM. Was really solid throughout and did a great tactical job on Fabregas. Seemed to be more assured and focused on what he was doing than in some other games. Won the ball back a few times in defensive areas too (one on Hazard in the penalty box early on springs to mind). Hope he can keep it up.

1671~~~
I'm just really happy for him, as it looks like he finally found his feet here. 

He noticeably made a difference against West Brom and put in another great performance in today. His work ethic was admirable and I really like his energy on the field. He isn't the most gifted footballer and is a little wild with his arms at times, but he certainly offers something different and is a much better player, than some people give him credit for. He is a good option to have and will play his part over the course of the season.

1672~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/15115/9536571/marouane-fellaini-played-an-important-role-in-shackling-cesc-fabregas-for-manchester-united-against-chelsea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...abregas-for-manchester-united-against-chelsea</a>

1673~~~
Can't work out if Fellaini is a defensive midfielder, creative midfielder, number 10 or a striker. He seems to be mixing/playing all these roles in a game at the moment. A big improvement from last season where he looked no better than a non league player.

1674~~~
He made a couple of great interceptions in the box, was busy and did an excellent job on Fabregas. Agreed it was a shame our delivery was so shit we only created a chance for him at the death, but it was a solid, very encouraging performance. 
His passing is never going to set the world on fire, but the flick out to Januzaj shows that he does have a few tricks up his sleeve and is far more than a David Batty-esque square ball merchant. Whether you like him or not, he is different and gives us options.

1675~~~
He's definitely not a defensive midfielder, I think we can safely say that!

He definitely seems to have invented a new role though. Last week I described it as a 'deep lying attacking midfielder. Best I could think of.

1676~~~
He's impressed me. I'll be happy to eat some humble pie here! Still not a first choice for us, but I think he's a fantastic option to have in the squad.

1677~~~
That's a pretty interesting and good description!

1678~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing this against City;
Blind
Ander - Di Maria
Fellaini
van Persie - Rooney

1679~~~
I never wanted fellaini here but we wouldn't have gotten the point today without him.
Great game and I hope he keeps the momentum up.

1680~~~
I never though he'd come good at United, but it seems there is hope. Did really well today.

1681~~~
I think he is a good palyer, but only when he is used the right way. He is a n10 guy that should be played to his strength - where he can use his size, strength and heading ability to be a danger to the opponent. He just doesn't work as a central midfielder or holding midfielder because he lacks the creativity and the positional awareness to be successful there. Moyes brought him to play as a CM and that will never work.

1682~~~
Excellent today. Only thing we can ask for is he keeps that up, certainly LVG seems to know what he needs.

Will feel better with him against Yaya if he plays like that.

1683~~~
He played well today but he has still got another level he is capable of, i hope he can turn it round at United or at the very least stops becoming a laughing stock.

1684~~~
Credit where it's due, I thought he was very good today. He finally started to use his strength and height in the right way, he put himself about but not in a snide way. He provides us with a much needed goal threat from set pieces too.

Still a long way to go but in the last week he's produced two very encouraging performances. Hope it continues.

1685~~~
Fellaini did well today and has been steadily improving for a while.
I think the slap he got of Gerrard last season hurt him psychologically and really knocked his confidence. He was just starting to find his feet and fit in a little and then for that... ABH to be brushed under the carpet like it was... was an extra kick in the teeth, excuse the pun. I think he, or anyone would be sickened by that. I am really glad for the lad. I am not his biggest fan but i might be his biggest backer.
On another board i posted... I can see no logic in slagging him off on here or jeering him in the stands. Love him or hate him. He is here for the foreseeable future so its imperative we back him up so he can improve. I argued(reply after reply) that he may grow into a position for us and do a job. Judging by today's performance it seems this may just be the case.
I hope he helps us win loads more games. He deserves that bit of backing and good fortune at least.

1686~~~
Where do you think he played best for you? As the advanced attacking midfielder in his final season or elsewhere?

1687~~~
He controlled Fabregas today, in central midfield.

1688~~~
Lets hope this confidence boost will spur him on. Theres a good player there, versatile in quite a few roles, if he can play like that consistently theres a place for him here after all.

1689~~~
He was excellent in his last season in the advanced role but for the 2 seasons before that he was just as good in the deeper role. I have seen him dominate the best teams in the league from that position so i know he is capable of it. Blind is the perfect type of partner for him also i feel.

1690~~~

1691~~~
Looks as if a big weight has been removed from his shoulders. 

He's not carrying Moyes, the burden of being the clubs sole signing, our only hope for the midfield...

Instead he's got his goal, a bit of confidence, finally looks fit and he's being used in a way that plays to his strengths.

1692~~~
All around better play from him.  Purposeful passing and movement; even challenging the ball well.  Good to see.

1693~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> wow.

hope this is the start of fellaini's united career.

1694~~~
I've given him a lot of stick, but credit where credits due he's been good for us these last 2 games and deserves to start at City.

The one thing I'm most pleased with is he seems to go out there knowing he's fighting for a spot and he seems up for the challenge and ready to give his all.

1695~~~
Question for you all....Especially <a class="username" data-user="56391, @shamans" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56391/">@shamans</a> ....

This is the 2nd game in a row where he has played very well. Particularly today...He was excellent.
LVG has quite clearly giving him instructions on what he wanted him to do and he implemented them instructions brilliantly...

Now, I still have a lot of doubts, but it begs the questions, what the hell was Moyes doing last season with him? Especially considering he knew the guy inside out

And not one elbow either!!

1696~~~
What the hell is LVG doing with Mata? What the hell was he doing with RVP before his goal today? Players have bad seasons and Fellaini was having a terrible season last year. I mentioned on here he is a confidence player.  He was low on confidence last year and it really hampered his game.

1697~~~
He is finally doing what we all thought we were buying him for. Bullying the opposition, disrupting their flow and forcing mistakes. 

Maybe his future role for us is as Ji-Sung Park Mk. 2 to generally annoy the opponent's best players and keep them from settling into a rhythm.

Either way, I'm happy for us because we finally have a player who can rough the opposition up, happy for him to be getting his career back on track.

1698~~~
Yep plus for Belgium he has played many a game like this. Said all along the big fella will prove to be a good signing albeit overly expensive.

1699~~~
Feck me this is not what is important in the slightest! Is this what impressed you most yesterday about Fellaini?

1700~~~
I think this is key. Some games Fellaini looks lost and not really sure what to do but it seems that when LvG gives him a task that he can focus on he executes quite well. Maybe that is what he needed and Moyes was just vague in his instructions (since Fellaini wasn't playing in the #10 role and floating around CM)

1701~~~
He was one of better players but the point I was making is he wasn't great or outstanding, just as he wasnt useless in every game last year but for someone who cost 27.5m and is playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world there was nothing special about what he did yesterday, big improvement and I hope it continues but he stil has quite a way to go.

1702~~~
For those wondering what role he plays, I believe he is doing what he does for Belgium.

A box to box midfielder and also our target man for long balls and crosses.

1703~~~
I don't like the style of play his presence will promote, and I'd much rather have Herrera in the team than Fellaini. But if he plays well, I guess I will curve my distain for the big mop head.

1704~~~
Well done Marouane - glad for the fellah. I hope all this "he is not a good footballer" or "he is not United quality" nonesense won`t appear again if he has 1 or 2 not so great performances.

1705~~~
There it is, the price! Was wondering when you'd bring it up, look everyone agrees that he was overpriced but he is now fighting for his place and it is beginning to look like he will prove to be a useful player to have around. No one is saying he is Vieira incarnate but if he can play his part in our revival then he deserves praise.

1706~~~
He did his job well yesterday and he could grow exactly into that role for us and play his part if we need that. What he needs to improve is his build up play though

1707~~~
I actually think he was brilliant in the first half, he played in a inside left position, and combined well with Shaw and Janujaz, in the second half however, i felt the reason we looked so lethargic, and easy to play against was partially down to him and then LVG subbing in Wilson. In the first half the formation was working brilliantly, we had Janujaz and Di Maria on the wings and Fellani and Mata dropping deeper in channels to receive the ball and play dangerous passes into Rvp which got us into very threatening positions. eg would be the Di Maria chance or the Rvp chance before the one on one in which Janujaz played him through.

In the second half he moved on top far too much and we never had anybody in the Middle of the pitch for the out ball, it was Janujaz and Rafael on one wings, then Shaw and Di maria on the other, then Blind closely playing with two Cb's and then it felt like Wilson, Rvp and Fellani were all on top, there is nobody dropping deep dictating the pace and receiving the ball in the middle, the Rvp chance in the second half came because Shaw went on the inside and played a good through ball and Rvp made a brilliant run. it made us very predictable that we were always gona go the wings route, if we had somebody in the middle coming deep then not only he would be in plenty of space, he could play quickly on the other wing, and try getting a one on one with the winger and their FB, or try a through ball, or a chip ball in the box just to mix it up. So overall pleased with his display but the other part of his job that is to dictate the play went missing for me.

1708~~~
Barney Ronay's take on his role is... interesting. 

"Here Van Gaal used Fellaini like a man very deliberately placing a platoon of traffic cones in the middle of the road to slow the rush-hour traffic, drawing from the Belgian a dogged and astute performance as a kind of <b>left-sided midfield obstacle-cum-distributional hub</b>. "

I guess it makes a change from "box to box", "pivot" or "trequartista".

1709~~~
He was the best player on the pitch yesterday, and that’s saying something given the talent both sides have. Fabregas had his worst game in a Chelsea shirt and that was thanks to Fellaini, he was also box to box the entire game, he didnt stop and came up trumps at the end with an assist.
I hate the way some bring up his fee all the time, he wasn’t the one who demanded it, don’t blame the player blame the Club.

1710~~~
Can we replace Anderson's name in the chant to Marouane's as the one who 'shits on Fabregas'? He deserved it after yesterday's performance. Fabregas really struggled with his physicality in the first half.

1711~~~
Really happy for him. Nothing better than someone proving everyone wrong. Hope he keeps it up.

1712~~~
If he played like that against that calibre of opposition on a regular basis I'd be happy.

1713~~~
within his abilities he had a good game, still didn't dominate midfield and he won't be the passer we are looking for but playing like this he can do job for us. Happy to see him on a bit of form. His attitiude is 100%, so no complaint, he gives us what we signed him for / what you can expect from him. Wheter we should have signed those qualties is a different question and he is not to blame if we answer that with no.

1714~~~
Like it or not the price is relevant to how a player is judged, we did overpay so he will never live up to it but overall he hasn’t even come close and fighting for his place and being useful are pretty much the minimum requirement. Yesterday he was one of our best players in what was a decent team performance, he wasn’t the best player on the pitch, he wasn’t great but he did well and is improving. I just commented that people have got a bit carried away because he still has a long way to go and he needs to contribute more in other areas which is a fair point. I don’t see why everyone has to be brilliant or terrible all the time, there are other ways to criticise or compliment players in between that and because he dropped off in the second half I don’t see the need to get carried away.

1715~~~
Did his job very well indeed. Getting the goal last week and then hearing the fans singing his name has clearly given him a huge confidence boost. Good on him!

1716~~~
Despite last weeks performance I was disappointed to see Herrera benched. I don't know if Fellaini earned it with his goal or if he got a shot because of Chelsea physical presence. Either way I was made up with his performance and hope it continues. It gives us another dimension. I'm not sure how much of a say he will get in the team when we play with Rooney & RVP or even Rooney RVP and Falcao but if he can put in a shift like that when called upon we will be fine.

1717~~~
We weren't as effective in the second half because Chelsea got the goal and parked the bus. In the first half Chelsea were actually playing football and trying to score which allowed us to exploit gaps in their midfield and defence. Once the famous Chelsea double decker is parked it's very difficult to find space and break them down.

1718~~~
I think size does have a lot to do with it, physically we are a pretty light weight team and you can't get away with that in the PL. Was nervous every time they got a corner or free kick, which eventually they did score from.

1719~~~
Absolutely chuffed for the lad!

Who needs Vidal when you have Fellaini? <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1720~~~
Who's laughing or booing now? Only a couple of games but the best teams are a some of all it's parts. There's no difference in Fellaini play, only difference is like when he played for Belgium, better quality players this year around him than Cleverley, Fletch et al. In the box, he creates really panic for the opposition. Also yesterday he was playing against currently the best midfield in the Prem. Interesting to see how we line up next week?

1721~~~
are you being serious asking me this question? haha.

1722~~~
At the moment having a player with some fight in him is what we seem short of. I'm as surprised as anyone that it's the boy Fellaini, but it's good to see. Perhaps more importantly, he's a big fella & that's precisely what we're definitely short of, especially against physically powerful sides like Chelsea. 

Good luck to him - I'd never have signed him and would have sold him by now if it was up to me. But I'll be chuffed to bits to be proved wrong on that.

1723~~~
Happy for the lad and he could have an important role while we're still in transition however I wouldn't like to see us play that many long balls in future.

1724~~~
Dang. Fellaini looks like our best CM at the moment. MOTM last night for me. I didn't expect that at the end of last season...

1725~~~
It was a bit of, 'I have bought you as a defensive midfielder and also told everyone that, but I also want your massive head which got me 12 goals last season in the box as often as possible'. Which probably confused the guy.

1726~~~
I know he did a good job yesterday but let's not get overboard, shall we?

1727~~~
Was very good both defensively and going forwards. Absolutely dominated the midfield and matched Matic in performance, which is great considering Matic is arguably the best CDM in the country, if not world.

1728~~~

1729~~~
I think it's no coincidence that Fellaini's best performance came when he was under obvious instructions. 

He was obviously told to man mark Fabregas, so while defending he followed him all the way. This almost solves his "spacial awareness" problem he has. 

When attacking he was getting behind the midfielders really well, and our defense/blind were finding accurate passes to his feet/chest which he likes. 

The thing that impressed me the most though was the lack of silly fouls he usually does, and he really ran his socks off. Loved the bit when he and Matic were wrestling over the ball. At first he lost it, but he worked hard and won it back - something our players have lacked recently.

Really pleased for the big man, he might just win people over if he carries on...

1730~~~
As good a big-game performance  I can remember from one of our midfielders in recent years.

Great week for the big man. Hopefully he can do the same in the Derby next.

1731~~~
People clearly had their blinkers on last season. For the most part, yes he was shite but I remember he put in decent performances agaisnt west brom away and palace away. Now granted they aren't the worlds best opposition but the point is he had it in him to play like that. He just needs a consistent run of games and more importantly, he needs to get his confidence back!

1732~~~

1733~~~
This. All the talk before the game was how Matic was going to massacre our midfield. What they didn't count on was Big Felli tussling with Matic. If ever there was a man who deserved the phrase - a big unit - it was Fellaini. His passing was good and he was a real handful for Fabregas, who couldn't handle his power. If he keeps this up, he's going to keep a few players out of the team! For there's not anyone in that team who can match him in the air or physically. So when he does a good job of marking and taking opposition players out of the game, Herrera will find it tough to break in with Carrick almost back into the fold.

1734~~~
He definitely adds something different for our team. We are a team of mini-men and Fellaini gives us height and strength. Also, having Blind as the more defensive player means Fellaini can get up with the striker.

I just hope he can keep improving.

1735~~~
I gotta hold my hands up.  I didn't expect him to put that kind of performance in and I thought he'd be gone come january.

Fantastic performance.  Very well utilized by Van Gaal and he'll be needed for that physicality of his in the big games.

1736~~~
That was a great tussle against a physical beast in Matic. More of the same against Toure please.

1737~~~
It's baffling that people didn't think he could put in a good performance, I know he had some poor games last season but they were in games where every one of our players were poor? He's been doing this for years at Everton and he walks in the belgian national team? I'm starting to think people just never watched him before last year's deadline day. Amazing how people can fool themselves into thinking he was the worst player in the league his whole career and LVG has just reinvented him. That said, obviously credit to LVG and to Felli himself but this whole season is like an experiment on self deception. We've just had our worst ever start to a prem season with a very easy run of games and having spent 150m and everyone is bouncing up and down - don't stop btw it is fantastic, but it really does show a predisposition to hate moyes and love lvg no matter what

1738~~~
He might do better this year with Toure's massive loss in form, last season I don't think anyone was able to tussle with toure but Alex Song yesterday made him look like an average player

1739~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> funny 'cos it's true!

1740~~~
The attacking tactical nature of LVG is much more exciting to watch than moyes's depressing, drowsy style.  Last minute goals against big teams rather than huge 3/4-0 spankings reminds me of the old united.

Id be disappointed in finishing below 4th this season, very.  But this team is a progressing one, Moyes's was a declining one.  That's why fans are happy.  There's belief, there's a CV of a manager, world class players, exciting football, and ever progressing football to back that belief up.

In context, we're 8th.  But before this game we didnt know what to expect playing the bigger teams.  Now we do, and its probably the best performance this season.

1741~~~
Good to see the word 'dominant' used in conjunction with one of our central midfielders again. Guaranteed starter next week on the back of that. Fair play.

1742~~~
That was really pleasing. Great fight and desire. Just read that Cesc only made five completed passes in the first half. Fellaini did a brilliant job.

EDIT: Also saw this "The Premier League tracking data shows that Fellaini covered 12.17 kilometres in the match, the most by any United player, and made 70 high-intensity runs. That was more than anyone else on the pitch and, tellingly, the most he has made in any game in a United shirt." He works very hard.

1743~~~
He proved me wrong yesterday, and i hope he keeps performing well.

1744~~~
I thought he still looked really slow and clumsy....gave us physical presence which was required so therefore not saying he wasn't worth his weight as also got assist. But defensively looked so slow and although it was a better game didnt think he gave Blind much support positionally and would 100% want Herrera back long term when fit, after this and we may need a physical presence vs city he should keep his place though. 

I hope he finds form, he just doesnt look up to speed with others around him, in my view. But improving and LVG using him in better way than previously.

1745~~~
Sometimes I'm not sure buddy with some posters and haven't really encountered you but point taken <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1746~~~
Oh god I'm starting to like him.

1747~~~
Was watching the match with fellow united mates, and I was surprised every time fellaini drove the ball forward and dribbled past players, was very dominant, and a key reason, for the first time in along time, we actually outplayed chelsea, and brang the game to them, instead of letting them attack us, and we sit back and defend as has been case last 2-3 seasons

1748~~~
He was very good yesterday. I, like many, have been a huge critic of his, and am still unsure whether he will ultimately prove good enough to be a regualar, but he was good. I have long complained that our team is too soft, especially in comparison to a side like Chelsea, which is why I wanted him and Smalling to play yesterday. Both did very well.

My only concern yesterday, is that he wasn't playing in 'central midfield' often enough. Too many times, Blind was in there on his own, with Fellaini and Mata 25 yards ahead of him. Perhaps that is as a result of instruction to go and press further forward. If we are to play Fellaini in a three, I don't think Mata can be one of the others. Blind, Herrera and Fellaini would have been much better yesterday I think, as we would have had two people actually in central midfield in Blind and Herrera.

I think Mata is really struggling to justify selection at the moment, and I'd say he's the odd man out. Blind, Herrera and Fellaini is a solid base at PL level.

1749~~~
I wish I could quote a certain post I wrote about Fellaini in the newbies. This thread is a breath of fresh air at the moment. So happy for him and so happy he is proving people wrong. If he carries on like he did yesterday he is well on his way to becoming a fan favourite.

1750~~~
This one?

1751~~~
Good to see he's changing opinions here. Feel a little proud at myself for standing by him last season while some people were utterly pathetic in booing and lambasting him over even the most trivial of things. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

He might not be "our Yaya Toure" but with proper tactical work on the training ground, he can definitely be an important player in our engine room. Physically he's an animal, he's a beast in the air and his stamina is ridiculous. When he was at Everton he frequently covered 10km distances in a match in his box-to-box role. Against Chelsea he covered a whooping 12.17km and made 70 sprints in total, beasting even the mighty Matic himself - <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2809395/Marouane-Fellaini-infamously-cost-27-5m-endured-year-misery-does-finally-look-like-Manchester-United-player.html/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">source</a><b>. </b>In the first half, Fabregas hit a new low in making only 5(!) passes in our half, and overrall had a game to forget. He just couldn't cope with Fellaini's athleticism.

1752~~~
Fantastic performace both today and agaisnt WBA. If he can contain Toure/Silva, I will never say anything bad about him every again.

1753~~~

1754~~~
Oh and remember the booing in the preseason game at Old Trafford? Right now, those fans look more foolish than they ever have.

1755~~~
That's the one. Thanks Summit. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I loved LvG's interview last week where he said that he has learnt that in the Premier League you need to have different types of player and you can't just have a team of 11 technical geniuses you need a player like Fellaini. I thought it was a backhanded complement towards Marouane. And his response? well yesterdays performance.

1756~~~
He's not and never has been 'shit'. And that's not just hindsight speaking.

I <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/woodward-old-thread.389465/page-95#post-16249064">said</a> in August that I 'personally think he could be useful for us', even if 'most don't rate him'.

He does have some great attributes. It's easy to be sniffy, but he's always a danger when played further forward. He can pluck balls out of the air with consummate ease, and then bring others into play or have an attempt on goal. He's a danger at set-pieces. He's big, strong, has a good engine, and is a decent ball winner - he easily matched Matic yesterday, and not many can. And his technical ability isn't as lacking as some have made out.

Two swallows don't make a summer, but if you forget the price tag, then he is a very handy player to have around.

1757~~~
I thought he did well yesterday, not oustanding but a decent performance. Won a lot of headers and really should have scored from the cross that RVP buried. Good to see him in there. He harried and chased the Chelsea midfield, Fabregas and Matic in particular. There's hope yet.

1758~~~
Some of the criticism Fellaini has gotten over the last year has been so absolute and bombastic that many probably feel compelled to keep it going, albeit in milder forms, rather than putting up their hands and admitting that he may actually have a future with United.

The fact that Fellaini can play a bit of football - and has a bit of talent beyond being a big fecker with big hair - has got nothing to do with either Moyes or LVG. It may well be that LVG now uses him more wisely than Moyes did (would be odd if he didn't), but Fellaini's most vocal detractors on here have never claimed that his problem was being used unwisely (by Moyes) or anything of the sort. They have claimed that he's a useless streak of piss who has no business being a United player. That's not even an exaggeration - it's precisely the sort of abuse he's been getting. And backing down from that sort of extreme position is probably impossible for some.

1759~~~
I know people joke about his chest control, and it probably isn't the first attribute you'd take if you were a pro footballer but his really is brilliant. He can kill any ball from any angle straight to his feet off his chest. Anyway, if he does continue this form and turn it around then he will be forever grateful for picking up that ankle injury when Napoli were looking at him during the transfer window.

1760~~~
Yeah, he has great chest control.

<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

Anyways, the biggest change from what he did last year is that he's finally able to impose himself. Instead of always lagging half a second behind, he's getting into situations and utilizing his physique. I think the stats from yesterday give a hint as to why as well, because he's playing with a completely different intensity to what he did last year.

 I still think his passing can look incredibly sloppy at times (less so these last two games than overall last season), but Blind's current role means that we're not relying on him to be the one who distributes the ball around from deep. It was always inexplicable to me why we would put Fellaini in that position, because he has a tendency to be aloof in his passing at the most inconvenient of times (doesn't strike the ball cleanly so it wobbles, over- or underhitting it and making it unnecessary difficult for the team mate receiving the pass), so he should never be the deep laying distributor that you require a very low-risk passing game from.

Hopefully this marks a turning point for him.

1761~~~
Not trying to compare them, but isn't that what Vidal is as well?  

Not sure who drops out when Herrera comes in. Is Fellaini just a player who comes in to do a job in certain situations?

1762~~~
Absolutely fantastic yesterday. Part of the reason was because we were playing with 3 man midfield so he didn't have to cover bigger spaces quickly than when he plays in a midfield 2. This compact midfield system will suit him. When Mata went off and we switched to a 442 he wasn't as good even though he was still good.

1763~~~
Fair fecks, the big guy had a really, really good game yesterday. By far the best I've seen him in a United shirt.

He offered a safe passing lane between the Chelsea lines and distributed the ball decently enough, but the number he did on Fabregas and Matic was what impressed me the most. And finally his work rate was great as well, which has been lacking in his game. 

If - and it's a big if - he can turn his fortunes around at United he's twice the player I thought him to be, both mentally and ability wise.

1764~~~
I don't rate him but he was very good yesterday. Battled well, kept Fabregas quiet and steady enough on the ball. He falls asleep at corners and free kicks though. He almost always starts with a player and ends up a free man.

1765~~~
Fellaini had a lot of injury issues last season (wrist, back etc) and Im pretty sure he played several times when he was not 100% - also Moyes sometimes played a system with him and Carrick both as no6s which did not work at all.

Plus, although many refuse to acknowledge it, Fellaini did actually have several good performances for us last season - not as good as he has been in last couple of matches though, which is why everyone is finally sitting up and taking note of what he can offer.

1766~~~
We look a different team with him in, our midgets no longer getting bullied out of the game and no longer toothless.

Could be one of our most important players this season, who'd have thought that?

1767~~~
So... he's pretty good, isn't he? A lot of us, myself included, may well be left with egg on our face. Good on him.

1768~~~
I wouldn't go as far to say he's pretty good, but he's something different to what we have and probably something we need when we go up against midfielders like Yaya/Matic/Dembele and teams like Stoke.

Offers a massive threat on corners too, it was his header from a set-piece that made Courtois save on RVP's goal, so could well have scored 2 games out of 2.

1769~~~
He just didn't get much of a chance last season , he came to us late,  was in and out due to injury but from what I've seen this season he's looking like an excellent addition.

1770~~~
He certainly brings something different to the pitch for us and his passing and marking has improved vastly from last season.
I still dont think he should be a starter for MUFC, but he can definitely be our super-sub.

1771~~~

1772~~~
I suppose it's only fair to overreact  positively to a good performance after all the over the top negative stuff from last season. But that's still what it is, a bit of an overreaction by some.

He's shown us he's capable of doing a bit of a destroyer job in midfield and use his height and good technique at bringing balls under control in the box. But he's still pretty indisciplined tactically if we're trying to keep a defensive shape. More importantly, starting him in midfield (especially with the instructions he has to get into the box) means we're almost left with no midfield when we attack, given the number of attacking players we put on the pitch. I think we saw this most in the second half, where all of our attacks ended up having to start and finish from out wide rather than penetrating through the middle at some point during the move. This might improve with Rooney as the n.10, he has the physicality to drop deep and basically function as a midfielder in possession, but we'll struggle to not be predictable with Fellaini in the middle.

1773~~~
This is definitely a worry if we persist with him. He's been effective, but because his game is relatively limited, teams will soon work on nullifying him if he continues to play and teams who are solid defensively will, in all likelihood, do it fairly well.

1774~~~
How did he flick that ball to the left side of field?

1775~~~
The other possibility is that he will raise his game. We saw the effects that scoring against West Brom had yesterday.  His confidence will be even higher after a MotM performance against probably the best team in the league. I haven't seen him operate at that higher level myself but I note some of our resident Evertonians say he still has more to give.

1776~~~
Yeah, but even if he continues to raise his game, he's still fairly limited in a sense, and opposition teams may work to stop him and nullify us through the middle.

1777~~~
Jedi mindtricks obviously, can't be his limited technique we keep hearing about.

1778~~~
I really noticed the difference yesterday. I swear at one point they did a close up shot of Fabregas and Mata right after Cesc had fouled him and he did a fake push at him. No idea if it was intimidation or because they know each other but poor little Juan just can't seem to get himself into a game lately.

1779~~~
I'm not going overboard. I honestly think Fellaini was our best player against Chelsea. Januzaj had a decent game, but failed with too many take-ons. Same goes for ADM. Blind were solid, but Fellinis muscle power took Matic out of the game. And Fabregas - I hardly noticed him being out there!

1780~~~
I think the bolded is pretty unfair. We were one badly defended set piece away from keeping a clean-sheet against the best team in the league and a lot of that was down to Fellaini's tactical role of stopping Fabregas getting on the ball. In any case, I don't think Van Gaal much cares about Fellaini's ability to 'keep a defensive shape', that's part of Blind's role and if LVG wanted two 'disciplined' defensive midfielders against Chelsea he could have played Carrick and Blind.

A key difference between LVG and a lot of other managers is that against better teams LVG's instinct isn't to set the team up to drop back, stay solid and let the opposition play in front of a brick wall. Rather he set us up with a plan to get stuck in, stop Chelsea playing and dominate the game ourselves, a gameplan which Fellaini carried out brilliantly and on another day (with some better performances from our big name players) could have won us the game.

I'd tend to put our lack of attacking impetus through the middle down to Mata's poor form and lack of physicality, as well as the fact that it's natural to want to get your best player on the ball as often as possible and it so happened that he was playing wide in this game. Stick Rooney in rather than Mata and you've got someone who is at least capable of challenging the likes of Matic physically.

1781~~~
He is another option in midifeld, one that's very different who may find a specialised role within the squad similar to Park under Fergie. The big question is will he retain his place in the team once Herrera is back fully fit?

1782~~~
The great thing about Fellani's new found form is that it gives Van Gaal options, as well as provides important depth in case someone gets injured.

1783~~~
He had a good game against the best team in the league and his confidence is improving as well. He certainly gives a different option when attacking, especially from set pieces. I think he will become quite important for us this season. Van Gaal certainly sees something in him.

1784~~~
Yaya dominated him last season so I'm not sure thats really fair on fellaini to expect him to hold his own against one of the worlds best CMs

1785~~~
I think he finally looked fully fit for the first time, showing the ability he seemed to have when he played for Everton. Very promising performance.

1786~~~
I also rated him before everyone else did.

1787~~~
The recent Guardian article on him gave an interesting spin on him. It was unfortunate that he was brought here by Moyes and suffered from the expectations that came with it. If he were bought by any other manager, I doubt we'd have been so harsh on him last year, maybe even giving him some time to bed in. But with Moyes, we expected DM to know how to get the best out of Fellaini, but I think he did him a disservice by playing him out of position a bit by asking him to be a strict DM, instead of a box-to-box or even a pseudo-#10. Heck, if Moyes wanted to put in so many crosses, then he should've had Fellaini in a more advanced role.

It seems LVG has given more detailed instructions to Fellaini and actually trusting him to do the job. Moyes seemed to hold him back and defer to the vets too much. Fellaini seems to have regained his confidence and gave a rampaging, bull in a china shop performance. Amazing what a bit of confidence can do for a player (see Alex Song, Sigurdsson, etc.).

1788~~~
They couldn't do it for around two seasons with Everton. In a club like Man United you have more people to worry about (Rooney, RVP, Di Maria, Januzaj, Mata). 

If you waste your "man marking" on Fellaini the other players will run rampant.

1789~~~
We could have won if we played him further up the pitch. What really annoyed me yesterday was the many times he was in the box and the cross was under/overhit. Shame that the one time Di Maria got it right, it was the last minute of the game.

1790~~~
I love the way LvG pronounces his name. "Fellaani" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1791~~~
you mean you also like him when he plays like shit?

1792~~~
I always rated him, and always believed in him… NOOOOOO not at all, I hated him, (the footballer not the man) since his time at Everton because he’s more a destructor than a beautiful playmaker. It’s true that last year we needed reinforcements but we expected more.

You’re all right saying that we were very hard with him for various reason but especially reasons he wasn’t at fault.

I mean we wanted Fabregas an Alcantara last year and we missed them, instead we had Fellaini and all the frustration we had from this missed window (we can add all the other targets we missed) went in Fellaini’s shoulder. Straight away, when we were still Fergiesque, he was ok, play safe balls and looks better than Cleverley and Ando combined (during his first game at home against Leverkusen).


But it’s true that he had (after the derby) a terrible injury with his wrist and when he came back, in New Year, he was the symbol of Moyes. And then he also had his back problems. And this image from his mentor, the man who brought him was his burden last year. He was the player who symbolized Moyes on the pitch, the same story, and a part of the hatred (or pain personally) we had for Moyes went to him. This should have been the same thingm but the team is better, and he’s not anymore the coach’s favorite (we turned to RVP) and his more free now we have less expectation with him (as Di Maria, Mata and co should do a lot more before him)

Anyway, I would be precautious with him. He was terrible last year and two good games cannot changed a chaotic year

1793~~~
He wont play every game. But a very good option to have. With Carrick also available...a good mix of midfield players.

1794~~~
No I mean I always believed he had the potential to do well for us before it was cool to.

1795~~~
Just some observations I would like to add.

1) His performance is promising, but we must not get carried away. The most important thing for Fellaini now is to get some level of consistency.
2) If he can maintain this level all the time then he will add a whole new dimension to our game. Give us a physical presence and provide targets for crosses and long balls. Like a lot of people are saying. He gives us options. 
3) His gameplan, I think, is simple. He plays a box to box role. When United has the ball, he runs forward to the opponent's box to be the target man. Same like he does for Belgium, I think.

1796~~~
Absolutely. I can't see him becoming a first choice, but as you say: He gives us options. Tidy squad player to have.

1797~~~
Yup. As I've said before. He's here already and it's not his fault that he cost us so much. That is sunk cost and we cannot do anything about it. He is, however, trying his best to perform for us. There is no harm in keeping him and seeing what happens. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by that. After last season, if he can turn things around and achieve that consistent level of performance and give us options, I'd consider it an unexpected ROI already. And if he can get even better, then ... even better!! lol.

1798~~~
The good thing is this year is that he doesn't have to be the main solution and doesn't have the weight of expectation. Also, helps to have players that are playing relatively well. All around him last year were players that just were performing poorly. Now he doesn't have to try and be the stand out player, he just needs to go and play. 

I don't think he'll end up being a sure starter under LVG because he like Herrera will be kind of those horses for courses type players. 

One thing unfortunate in a twisted way about yesterday and the performance against West Brom (the latter I just read), is there will be that level of expectation again on him and should he fail - which is entirely possible depending in City's mood, especially Yaya Toure, he'll end up with being put down again. Hopefully most of us and LVG keep in mind that Fellaini is going to be one of those really useful players over the course of his time here - even if he cost too much to be that but, that's not his fault.

1799~~~
Have to say, thought he had a great game yesterday, and I certainly have not been slow to criticise him in the past. Please God he keeps it up and leaves me with a healthy smattering of egg on my face.

1800~~~
he was magnificent yesterday, his best game for us.

sorta performance that he used to give against us before, which is the reason we signed him.

1801~~~
He was never bad as some people made him over here...it s just some people are simply clueless and internet fora are full of them.

1802~~~
Hang on, let's not go into full revionism mode just yet, after 1 good performance eh? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1803~~~
Are you joking he ripped us a new one and ripped Arsenal a new one (several times) for Everton and was basically unplayable at times. You can de-value that period or his specific role in those games as much as you like but very few PL players are unplayable in any given circumstances all that often.

1804~~~
the question is how he's been for us. Which has been undeniably poor.

He was effective for a lesser team.

Have you heard of a guy called Akinfenwa in the lower leagues? 16stone, 6ft 2 or so, and is pretty unplayable in his way. Doesn't mean he's good enough for a top club.

However, if Fellaini can play like on Sunday more often I'll quickly change my opinion. I'd be glad to.

1805~~~
I m not saying he s Messi but certainly not as bad as people said he is.  Even when he was decent, they didn t want to admit they were wrong and stuck to their position.  Afaik even before Moyes came, United were interested and so were Arsenal.  He also plays for Belgium - a side with a talented pool of players.  I prefer the opinion of people like Wilmots, Wenger and Ferguson, rather than that of some caftard. 
All player go through bad patches, especially when the go through long periods being unfit, and the least a fan can do in these situation is to support the player and not put more pressure on the same player.

1806~~~
This season I've been less worried at seeing his name in the lineup.

Last year, with a  2man midfield, in Europe, you just thought this is a red card waiting to happen job.

Arsenal at home, 1-0 up, 10mins to go, we bring him on, a 27m man, and people around were scared. Scared to bring a player of that cost on!!

1807~~~
Everton a lesser team but doing it against greater teams I say thats as difficult as doing it when everyone around you is top drawer and hugging the ball more etc etc. He was no poorer than most last season considering he came injured and was thrown into a team doing garbage. Now he's been introduced as he should have been at the beginning and its a fresh start and he's more than capable of replicating his recent displays again and again.

1808~~~
How many red cards he got throughout his career?

1 red card in 161 games...

1809~~~
I was so, so impressed with him yesterday. I'd go so far as to say I was humbled by his performance - pleasantly humbled.

The thought of him containing Fabregas to the point of Cesc being rendered pretty much impotent the entire game is something I would've scoffed at before the game.

And on top of that it was his power header that set up RvP's glorious equaliser.

He was brilliant.

1810~~~
As one of his biggest critics quite recently, I'm delighted that he's playing well and even getting on the scoresheet to save us from an embarrassing loss to West Brom. Reall happy for him and hope he keeps it up, especially this weekend against Citeh.

1811~~~
I thought he was quite good against some of the mediocre teams like West Ham, West Brom etc. The issue was he was mainly terrible against top teams. When you spend the sort of money you do on a player, you expect him to have more of an impact against the top teams, which he didn't. On a whole, his performances last season are being made out to be worse than they actually were imo.

1812~~~
Haha. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1813~~~
Christmas is coming early. Never thought that Mata would look like a flop, and instead finding that 'missing piece' for our team in fecking Fellaini. It's just amazing.

1814~~~
Lets calm our tits.

1815~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> No.

Yesterday was the BEST performance United have this season. And that's because Fellaini played like a fecking Edgar Davids out there: charging up and down like a bull, while pleasantly adding a lot threat going forward. For once, we look like a top team as in matching Chelsea's aggressive tempo.

1816~~~
That's the one thing that was pleasing to me, he seemed to have a lot more energy and drive to his performance. Rather than chasing, he looked like he was the one running where he wanted to.

1817~~~
I think it's because he's not constrained to one position, but was given a bit more freedom than last year in restricted midfield two.

1818~~~
Yeh, he had a little more freedom but on the other hand, his first job was Fabregas, so that might have limited him also. Whatever way we look at it, it's just good to see him put in a positive performance and contribute. At the end of the day, that's all we can ask for.

1819~~~
That 'missing piece' was a bit overstatement, but I wasn't expecting a performance like that from him and the team. Re-watched the recorded game again with calmer head, he did look more impressive than when it's live.

1820~~~

1821~~~
I hope I'm wrong and Fellaini does turn it around. I don't think he's good enough, but I hope I'm wrong.

Too many people in this thread seem like they want him to fail. Support the lad ffs, against Chelsea he was probably our best player.

1822~~~
No probably about it buddy followed by his fellow countryman and our DDG and Shaw and Rafael played well also! Great to see the newer and some of the younger squad members step up to the plate! Bodes well for us!

1823~~~
This is a brilliant stat.

Fabregas only completed 11 passes in the first half. 3 only in first 20 minutes. He was completely shackled.

1824~~~
Good article this.

1825~~~
Fellaini v Yaya. 

That's where we can have a look at whether he is the miracle that many suddenly think he is. 

Predictions?

1826~~~
Did not notice how well he was playing until I checked the stats & such after. Very impressed, here's hoping he can keep this form going and be a valuable player for us.

1827~~~
That stat about covering more ground and doing more sprints is interesting. Goes completely against the "lazy bastard" stereotype from last season.

1828~~~
I get shivers when I think of that comparison after the 4-1 defeat to City last season, in which Toure bossed us and Fellaini was completely useless. Hopefully things will be different this Sunday, especially since Toure isn't in the best of form. That, and we're not under Moyes with his shit tactics and instructions this time.

1829~~~
That stereotype was mostly because people were lazy with their observations, they allowed preconceived notions to taint their observations.

1830~~~
Tbf Matic has been in far better form than Yaya this season and Fellaini did pretty well in their individual duals. Last season he looked weak (probably due to injuries) but, as we saw at Everton and a little in the last few weeks,  a confident, 100% fit Fellaini can cause problems for basically anyone.

1831~~~
Won't find anyone happier at the U-turn than me but it's hilarious seeing how the opinion has changed.

1832~~~
I am really happy for Fellaini. It all comes down to support from the manager/teammates/supporters, confidence in yourself and of course form. I think he got a lot of these factors going for him now and hopefully, we will see the best of him this season forward.

1833~~~
his game changed a lot to so its normal that opinions differ

1834~~~
Toure's been shite so far this season (or the games I've seen). Fellaini has a bit of confidence. He can make it close if he keeps concentrated.

1835~~~
This quote?: "The Premier League tracking data shows that Fellaini covered 12.17 kilometres in the match, the most by any United player, and made 70 high-intensity runs. That was more than anyone else on the pitch<b> and, tellingly, the most he has made in any game in a United shirt".</b>

I think the part in bold says it all really. He is now getting praised because his performances in a United shirt have improved. It's not as if he was playing like this all along and people were just being harsh for the sake of it.

1836~~~
Never said he was.
btw in the games he played last year he was up in the top 2-3 players for us in games in terms of distance covered etc etc.

1837~~~
And if opinions doesn't change you will complain that a gang of s***bags, are judging him unfairly. He seems to adapt well to Van Gaal instructions, that's a good thing for everyone, him and the club.

Fellaini is known for his stamina, he just keeps running. The problem have always been where and why he is running. Fellaini have played without his brain for a way too long period, and i blame Moyes for that. Because individually he has more qualities than flaws but his lack of tactical nous was/is too important.

1838~~~
Ok...

First of all, if opinions <i>don't </i>change, I won't be complaining about any scumbags, I don't know where you got that from. I think you missed the bit where I said I am happy about Fellaini.

1839~~~
How many times before has he played 90 minutes against a team as strong as Chelsea? Stands to reason that his stats for this particular game would be right up there. Stats had him down as consistently one of our hardest workers last season too. Didn't stop the idea taking root on here that he was a useless, lazy wage thief.

1840~~~
Deciding that Moyes was 100% responsible for Fellaini underwhelming last season and Van Gaal is 100% responsible for his recently improved performances is (deliberately?) ignoring some really basic stuff here. 

Every new signing is likely to improve significantly in their second season at the club. Every United player underwhelmed last season, as part of a collective that was in free-fall for reasons that were not entirely down to David Moyes (similar reasons to those behind us having even fewer points now than we did at this stage last season) Finally, Fellaini himself did actually put in some good performances last season. They were generally against poor opposition and he struggled against the best teams around but the signs were there that he is capable of what we saw on Sunday, if you paid attention. Just needed to feel a bit more settled at the club and play for a team that has got over the loss of Fergie and finally started to get a bit of belief back. The goal has obviously been a big help too. So many examples of players who suddenly come good at a new club, once an important goal gets the monkey (and the crowd) of their back.

1841~~~
I tend to exaggerate, sorry.

And i didn't missed the part where you are happy, but i didn't understand the part where you seems to judge the peoples who have changed their minds in accordance to Fellaini performances.

1842~~~
If he does play against City then his performance will depend on which Toure turns up. If it is the recent Toure then i expect Fellaini to do quite well if he brings his best concentration and recent form. If Toure turns it on though, which he is capable of, then Fellaini will have a big battle.

1843~~~
Not jogging slowly back when we are being torn up on a counter marks a radical improvement.

1844~~~
You just know he will, he always does against us. I am just hoping he can keep close enough to him to stop him receiving the ball, a bit like Fabregas.

1845~~~
Yeah I'm going in with this mindset too. I don't care how poor he has been, he will likely play well.

1846~~~
LVG the emperor?

1847~~~
A fair opinion from Ogden.

1848~~~
thing about all this 'new man' stuff is that Fellaini was never actually as bad as many made out last season - many didnt want him in the first place and then he was just an obvious scapegoat for Moyes' failures. He took a ridiculous amount of stick both in the media and online so fair play to him for coming through that to prove his doubters wrong.

1849~~~
Kind of, although he completely contradicts himself.


How can his qualities make him "crucial against the likes of Chelsea" if they are "the opposite to those demanded of a United signing"? Smacks of the same mental gymnastics being attempted by many on here to justify praising a a player they previously slagged off as someone who will definitely never be good enough for United.

1850~~~
I don't like having Fellaini in the team because he confuses me, at his best he is a good player who is technically sound and has a positive attitude, but at his worst he is dreadful. That is why i think that he is not United material. What makes a great player is the consistency and the little gap between his best and his worst.
For me it's like Quaresma you can see the qualities but you can't trust them., now Robben was like that until he met Van Gaal, i was hoping for this kind influence from Van Gaal, i hope it's not a mirage.

1851~~~
Far too sensible.

1852~~~
It's true. His physicality is coming in handy atm against big teams, but his best attributes (bringing the ball down on his chest etc) are not those expected from a £27.5m midfield signing at Manchester United. Fellaini will probably miss out again when Valencia returns. The last game and a half haven't suddenly made him a brilliant player. I still don't think he will ever be good enough to be a starting player here and the money spent on him is ridiculous for a squad player, however I can admit when he has played well.

1853~~~
This is even more sensible.

1854~~~
It would be really nice if people could discuss signings without silly provisos like the one in bold. We paid what we paid. Get over it. He's not a potential signing, he's already part of our squad. So it doesn't matter whether his qualities are those "expected from a 27.5m midfield signing" those expected from a 17.5m signing, or those expected from a 7.5m signing. All that matters is whether those qualities mean he is worthy of playing for Manchester United.

Seeing he was arguably our best player against by far the strongest team in he league and now looks odds on to start against the second best team in the league, he is evidently "good enough to be a starting player here", which is the main thing. Even if that reassessment of his status means a lot of egg on the face of the dozens of people who wrote him off with indecent haste last season.

1855~~~
The problem he had was he was a new signing and didn't look that good. You can excuse a bad season from a Rooney for example as they've had years of consistency. Fellaini had come in under a manager under pressure and not performed that well. He was off to a bad start and it's hard to recover from that. It didn't help that he got a few knocks whenever he got going. He was scapegoated to an extent but that's alays going to happen with new players as they haven't got the history others have.

I hope he pushes on from this, he has shown at Everton he is a good player...I can't help but feel he's just a bit of a stop gap at the moment til January/next summer though myself.

1856~~~
Players prices are likely to be spoken about on a football forum. As well as their worth and value. I suggest you get over it. Fellaini may or may not cement his place in this team. I don't think he will. It's my opinion. I'm not trying to force you to adopt it. And the last line of your post is just stupid. I didn't like Fellaini as a footballer even when he was at Everton but as soon as we signed him I hoped he would do well here and prove me wrong. That is usually how it works when you support a football club. A good game and a half doesn't make him amazing all on a sudden.

1857~~~
If you're looking for "stupid" in posts I suggest you look no further than the strawman in your final sentence.

Obviously, nobody is calling him amazing but it's refreshing to see so many people willing to adjust their opinions on a player they decided would never make it before he'd even kicked a ball for United. You're obviously more pig-headed than most but each to his own.

1858~~~
Your reactions to people not sharing your opinion are rather bizarre and childish. I admitted he has done well the last game and a half but I don't have to like him as a player. It's not mandatory.

1859~~~
I would suggest that what's really childish is "liking" footballers as opposed to judging them on whether they bring something useful to the team.

And if it's bizarre that you want, how about moaning about not being allowed an opinion in response to a post which finished "each to his own".

1860~~~
If, and that's a big if, Fellaini starts against City then I expect him being used as an utility man playing Silva off the park just like he did with Fabregas, rather than the awaited duels against Toure.

1861~~~
Yeah 'each to his own but if you don't think he will make it here you're pig-headed' was the jist of your post. Which is a childish reaction to someone having a different opinion. Anyway I'll leave you continue this one yourself.

1862~~~
he is a good all round player and has some extra abilities common players doesn't have in his position. I'd think he can play a deep role he is not playmaker and can lose the ball easily, he can't be CAM as we really don't want to hoof the balls to him, he is not enough fast to palsy box to box in order to be anywhere his tackling is average, his finishing is good, his heading is overrated but he is still one of the best in the air if he wants and focus... still he can be very valuable player. I think if we can balance players around him he can be our dark horse. Look how much better we are in possession? Sometimes we lack directness and the opposite team have time to form up the defense and its his time to make runs to the box as we pass around the box and finding the way through and then if we have world class wing play we can ding in some great balls for him or anyone and we are not bad at wide play but it will get better. Not saying we should pay crosses but we can use him as the opposite team defends in 10 man. If we play some lower table opposition we could play him further the pitch to chest the ball and immediately set up the attack, why not if we have capable centrebacks or Blind who looks like one who could start attacks from the back why not to find him and save say 10-15 passes and some time. We can be more direct... but I believe we can balance this out with some good crisp passing once carrick is back it will get even better and we will be more unpredictable unlike with Moyes where there was obviously only one tactics

1863~~~
It's not about judging them, I too would like to see Fellaini involved again, something I wouldn't have said two weeks ago. But now, many believe he is a better footballer than Mata now. It's amazing how opinion changes so much, you only have to go a few pages back to see the type of comments he was getting from the same posters who are now saying they always believed in him.

1864~~~
Aaah! I didn't read it like that, you are right some are exaggerating a bit.

1865~~~
For me last season he always seemed like he had no idea what he was supposed to be doing. He'd aimlessly wander around, two minutes later sprint forward pretty randomly, but then seemingly not have the energy or inclination to track a simple runner right past him.

From what I've seen so for (which is a tiny sample size), he's being given pretty clear instructions. Against West Brom these instructions were to get forward and everything he did well was in the opposition half. I personally still saw negatives in his game defensively, as was the case under Moyes, but at least these were outweighed by his contributions. Against Chelsea he again had a clear instruction, which he carried out well.

I think it could be as simple as that. He certainly wouldn't be the first player to look at sea when not given clear instructions. Obviously having someone with mobility next to him in Blind is invaluable also. I said very early on last year that pairing him with our previous immobile midfield compounded every shortcoming.

I still think he'll only ever be a decent squad option, but realistically that's all he ever was going to be.

1866~~~
I've never had a problem with having Fellaini on as a squad player and a super sub in certain situations, but I'm mystified by the sudden praise for him in light of his performances against West Brom and Chelsea.

Let me be clear:  his goal against West Brom was a thing of beauty and he had a significant role in the RvP equalizer, but apart from those two plays there really wasn't anything in Fellaini's performances in either of those performances that rose above competent squad man play.

Certainly no one here on the caf is beginning to believe, I hope, that Fellaini should now be a regular starter for us???

1867~~~
This talk about Fellaini and his renaissance is reminiscent of the talk a couple of months ago about Ashley Young being "reinvented" by the genius LvG. I never thought Fellaini was as bad as made out last year and I have a lot of faith in van Gaal, I just think in this case it comes across as a desperate attempt at showering praise on the player and manager for doing very little.

1868~~~
The thing with Fellaini is that his strengths are now being best utilised by van Gaal with his weaknesses suppressed. That's helped him be more useful for us than he was last season.

Having said that, given how he was used, it's pretty much expected that he's at his best in a midfield 3 where he doesn't have the main defensive or offensive responsibilities. He was able to utilise his aggression and tenacity to unsettle the opposition when off the ball. He was also given the freedom to drift out wide to link up with and free the winger whilst also helping us maintain possession under pressure. Finally, he was given the freedom to get into the box and drag defenders away in order to create more spaces for the more dangerous players.

One thing I noticed in the Chelsea match was that Fellaini was perfect for one aspect of van Gaal's philosophy: overloading the wide areas and creating space in the middle. Against Chelsea, him drifting out wide with Shaw and Januzaj dragged 3-4 Chelsea out there creating some good space in the middle. It was a bit of a bummer that Mata and Januzaj didn't make the most of this space in the middle, but even then, Fellaini was very useful in creating space in the middle (reminiscent of his Everton days with supporting Baines and Pienaar).

I still don't think Fellaini can be a key player for us. His main attributes aren't those that really suit us. However, he is still a useful player, and he is still a nuisance to the opposition. If we set up like we did against Chelsea, Fellaini won't be as useless as he apparently was last season.

1869~~~
There's definitely a lot of people desperate to shower praise on Van Gaal. Everyone wants him to succeed so we're bound to look for any evidence at all which can help us convince ourselves he's Fergie's  heir apparent.

The opposite is true of Fellaini. He's been a figure of fun for at least 12 months and the whole of summer was spent hoping he'd be sold. That much was abundantly clear. If he's getting praise it's despite serious reservations, rather than people being desperate to draw positive conclusions from very little evidence.

1870~~~
You have to trawl through my posts on him since we signed him... Next time when I post something, take note.

A random, more recent example of my foresight - in the "Would Fellaini improve under a new manager" thread:

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/would-fellaini-improve-under-a-new-manager.389533/#post-15552237">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/would-fellaini-improve-under-a-new-manager.389533/#post-15552237</a>

<i>I believe Fellaini will thrive under a manager like van Gaal, so the answer is yes.</i>

Need I go back to my analysis of him at the start of last summer, months before we even signed him?

1871~~~
Fixed.

He was very good on Sunday, but lets give it a bit more time first. 
He wasn't ever as bad as made out, and he'll be a good squad player/plan B here, provided he's okay with that.

1872~~~
I find it difficult to understand how someone can have watched the last two games and make that statement. When was the last time we had a 'competent squad player' who was capable of restricting a player of Fabregas' qualities to 11 passes in a half? Failing that, when was the last time we had a midfielder full stop who was capable of getting something out of a 50/50 with a player like Matic? Probably Fletcher circa-2009. 

Whilst I wouldn't say that he's a better footballer than the likes of Herrera and Mata, it's certainly up for debate whether he could be a better option than either in certain games. On current form its not at all controversial to say that he could end up starting a lot of games this season, though it'll be up to LVG as to what happens when Carrick and Herrera are fully fit again.

1873~~~

Fellaini vs Chelsea.

1874~~~
Or will Van Gaal put Fellaini on Silva?

Silva's the one we've gotta keep shackled imo.

1875~~~
If you don't mind, I'd like to chuck in my 2 pence worth on this.

Here's what I think. No one's denying that Fellaini is overpriced. And I don't think many, if any at all, are saying that Fellaini is suddenly world class. Most people are just happy that he is playing well.

To me, his price is sunk cost but we need to remember that this is not his fault. Right now, he is contributing to the team. He's proving himself to be of some value and he is now giving us options in midfield and tactics. That's more than a lot of people could have predicted at the end of last season. Long may it continue.

Well said.

Definitely. We need to make sure that we don't get carried away, lest people start getting disgusted when he doesn't make 100 blockbuster tackles, win 100% of his headers, make 100 out of 100 passes and assist and score 2 goals in a game.

1876~~~
One thing he did establish during the Chelsea game ... he's more technically sound than people give him credit for. He didn't do his "chest thing" at all, he just moved the ball along very smartly when we were on the attack. No defence-splitting passes, but many neat tidy passes which kept our attacking tempo.

This doesn't make him a great player all of a sudden, but i suspect he a better footballer than what many people thought. Forget the 27.5 mil. He had a release clause of 24mil that was meant to deter bids, and I think the footballing world was in agreement that it should have succeeded as a deterrent. He was a 16-18mil player at the most, and i'll be happy if he becomes that for us.

1877~~~
Here's the Big Oaf giving (an admittedly weaker) City all the trouble in the world in 2010:

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/57694849" width="500"></iframe>

1878~~~
I love the piroutte he did at the end. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1879~~~
Im not convinced. Shit players have good games too. I expect more of the same over a sustained period of time.

1880~~~
Delighted for him with his last couple of performances - he showed real tactical awareness and intelligence in his movement and whilst nullifying Fabregas he still managed to find space well 

In saying that Manchester United should have players of the quality of Vidal, Modric or Fabregas and I can see Fellaini only playing a squad role in the medium term

1881~~~
wut? why? It's not like we should have a superstar in every position!

If Fellaini can continue to be effective, I see no reason to spend on Vidal. Don't think we'll be in for Modric or Fabregas anyways.

1882~~~
He's done really well over the last couple of games which is a bit of a relief to be honest. At times it looked like we'd paid the guts of 30 million for a player that had almost nothing to offer us. I don't agree with those who suggest he wasn't that bad last season. He was. Whether it was down to confidence, fitness or a combination of both he generally looked slow, lethargic, poor in possession and often mindlessly violent. He never looked anything close to the player he was at Everton.

I think a large part of his improved performances is down to the system. His best football has always come when he didn't have too much defensive responsibility. He never had the positional sense or discipline to really play in a midfield two. The defensive part of his game was probably the part which frustrated supporters the most last season. With Blind holding he has a bit more freedom to play his natural game. He had a good game against Chelsea. He's got a real presence and can use the ball well.

He's not everyone's cup of tea but games like Sunday show that under the right circumstances he can be a good player for the club. We need to see him do it consistently though

1883~~~
No I didn't think he was poor in possession last season! He was mostly neat and tidy with the ball!

1884~~~
Not really enough for a United midfielder though is it.

1885~~~
Well it has been for Cleverley & Anderson

1886~~~
And Nicky Butt.

1887~~~
Erm <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> 

(Before you start I accept that Ando looked very good for a while and I thought he was going to be great. Not sure I'd ever have called him neat and tidy though) 

Aye. If he was half as good as Nicky Butt we wouldn't be having this discussion to be fair.

1888~~~
Neat and tidy's such an odd turn of phrase for Fellaini even if I know what you mean. 4:35 in the video above against Chelsea is what I mean. He recieves the ball under pressure, makes it worse with a horrific first touch, then recovers with a bit of upper body strength and a good second touch before playing himself into trouble again with his 3rd and recovering to recycle possession whilst getting applauded by the crowd for not giving the ball away.

He's good at keeping things ticking over, moving the ball on quickly to players who will hurt a team more and retaining possession. But I would never say he looks neat and tidy because, well, he's a bit clumsy looking.

1889~~~
I love his attitude towards working hard to be here and prove people wrong but that price tag will always be above his head. Right now though I'm enjoying his football!

1890~~~
I get what you mean. It's actually not a bad description of him though. He uses the ball better than most give him credit for and can hit some decent forward passes. Now that he's getting his confidence back he looks a lot more comfortable and safe in possession imo

1891~~~
and how many good games does he need to have before you accept that he is not shit?

As I keep mentioning, he had several decent performances even last season but at the time many people wrote it off as him only performing against weaker opposition (palace, west ham, WBA etc), now he put in a very good performance against Chelsea so soon there will be no excuses left for the antiFellaini brigade.

1892~~~
He just needs to deliver decent performances on a regular basis. Same goes for any player. So far he's had more bad games than good for United so people are justified in not being overly impressed by him.

1893~~~
Until that time comes he's still shit to me. Whats more, his chances will be very limited when Herrera regains full fitness and when we make a marquee signing in CM. He needs to keep performing like he did against Chelsea but I don't see him keeping it up.

1894~~~
The anti Fellaini brigade will never come around on this, even if he scored a hat-rick in a CL final they would make some silly excuse and probably give someone else credit for it while dismissing Fellaini. Fellaini is shutting up a million mouths with each of these performances and long may it continue because he is actually a quality player and can benefit the team a lot.

I actually wanted us to sign him right after he dominated us in that 1-0 win in August 2012, and the only season he got slated so bad last season was because he was Moyes only signing. Do people also forget the fact he was probably operating at 60% last season because he was playing with a Injury?  He was brilliant against Chelsea, he has a new purpose and massive confidence, another performance like that against City on Sunday and he will pretty much become a permanent fixture in our team. Teams can't deal with this guy when he's around their box, this gives other creative players a lot of space to work with.

Phil Neville stated both him and his Dad were buzzing over the moon when he signed on deadline day, imagine how he must have felt getting jeered by our own fans (twats) in that friendly game? I'm incredibly happy for Fellaini, never gave up, never sulked or talked shite to the press, he simply got on with his job and now he's taken his chance and is flying, good on him.

Not saying he's the best midfielder ever, but he's a very good and effective one, and when used correctly he is a very dangerous guy to play against.

1895~~~
Pretty sure he put Herrera on the bench against Chelsea lol, and Herrera hasn't had a game for us like Fellaini's vs Chelsea. If anything Herrera replaces Mata not Fellaini.

1896~~~
Blind, Herrera and Fellaini could be a great midfield 3.

1897~~~
Yeah, I think that too. Herrera is supposed to be a very good advanced Midfielder as well, so with Fellaini as Box to box with Blind as CDM that midfield has a lot of Balance on paper. We would have to drop Either Falcao or Van Persie though, but against big teams, we should try something like that.

1898~~~
There's several things there if I understand correctly, so I'll try and address them separately.

The point about his tactical awareness defensively ("keeping a shape") isn't at all based on this Chelsea match, mostly because he was clearly under instruction to chase and close down. He was still poor at tracking any midfielder that runs into the box, but I'm not criticising for his defensive positioning in this match. It is, however, something I noticed in pretty much every match he played last season. I didn't watch him all that carefully when he was at Everton, so it's possible it was just a bad season for him, but things like positioning shouldn't be a matter of form.

As for whether LVG actually cares about his central midfielders being able to keep a shape, I would imagine that he does. Keeping a shape doesn't necessarily mean sitting very deep and absorbing the opponent's attacks, it just means knowing where and where not to engage (this could be high up the pitch), and where to stand when the rest of your teammates are in any given position. The only exception I can see is other matches like this Chelsea one, where Fellaini is told to more or less man mark an opposition playmaker, regardless of where he goes. This is not something we're likely to do in most matches, which is why I qualify this as Fellaini doing a (good) job for us when required, something I (under) stated in my post. But this wouldn't make him a weekly fixture in our starting XI.

Finally, regarding the attacking impetus - yes, as I wrote, I agree that Rooney would be a more complementary piece than Mata as a n.10 when Fellaini starts in midfield. But anytime he's being pushed into the box when we have the ball, we are certain to be more predictable in the way we play than if he weren't there, because he's not likely to interchange positions with players around his as much as Herrera or any of our strikers, if nothing else. I could eventually see this being effective for longer periods if the centre forward played in front of Rooney were brilliant (or in brilliant form, rather) at the buildup play, linking up and interchanging with the players around him, but so far that hasn't been the case for RVP, and we're yet to see enough of Falcao to know if he'll be better at that in this team.

1899~~~
I used to drool over his performances in an Everton shirt, the last time Everton visited OT under SAF he totally bossed the game. The only problem that I had with Fellaini in a red shirt is that, for me, he's a kind of Crouch type player, not involved in the build-up and not all about the sweet movement, he's more a towering forward-midfield enforcer to hit the ball up to. It's sometimes hard for lanky players to look comfortable on the ball I know. I often thought that Moyes played him too deep and it was a bit of a waste but it also betrayed the fact that he's not the sort of player that wants the ball enough. It makes him look lazy when you see his movement off the ball … it's like he's moving into positions where he's least likely to get played in which really annoyed me last season. 
I was ready to watch him walk out the door this season too until I watched the MNF analysis of Sundays game and saw how many people Chelsea put on him and how his decoy runs were a tactic and actually made space for other players. I still worry about him as a card magnet liability, especially against a speedy team like City, but I think we need his height at set pieces and I'm starting to like how the experiment is going. If Carrick's still not match ready I'd welcome his inclusion on Sunday. 
I was stuck on an overnight cross channel ferry full of Belgian football supporters travelling to see their country play Wales (I think) just after we bought him last summer. The whole crossing (nearly 2 hours) they sang the same "he can feck my wife" song to the tune of "I love you baby". I thought at the time that, with the talent in the Belgium team, if they want to sing only about him we've done a great bit of business. My main problem is not that he didn't seem to work out (dissapointing as it was at the time) it's that I can't get the fecking song out of my head whenever I see him … and it's always got a cheesy French accent <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

1900~~~
LVG doesn't see Herrera as a number 10. He was only on the bench because he was obviously rushed back, hence his first half subsitution on his first game back. Herrera is firmly ahead of Fellaini in the perking order. If Falcao is fit for City he's starting upfront with RVP and Rooney will be behind them.

1901~~~
Well if that happens then I will firmly believe Van Gaal is a complete tool. If he drops a in form player so he can shoehorn another two strikers in his team, then I will seriously lose faith in the guy. What kind of message does that send out to the rest of the squad?, why should they try hard in training? We might play Rooney behind RVP or Falao, but I doubt we will start with all three. You do realize that Herrera can play alongside Fellaini too?

1902~~~
To be fair he hasn't had the option to use Herrera as a number 10 so far much when he's been fit.

In pre season he did play there in his first 2 games for a half and then some minutes IIRC.

1903~~~
Well I am sure you didn't see him putting in that sort of performance in the first place - in fact you were quite certain that he would never play for the club again, so shows what you know.

He did have a couple of terrible performances when he first came in but Im not sure if he has had more bad than good, not that I can be arsed to actually go back and check game by game!

1904~~~
Where does that live Blind? He's doing well too. Herrera needs to start games when fit. He's a genuine goal threat from the midfield and he also supports the defence well.

1905~~~
When did I say or even suggest that he might <b>never</b> play for the club again? Im pretty sure I said he'd fall further behind in the perking order when we make the inevitable purchase of another CM. I still see him being sold when that happens, unless LVG plans to keep him as backup anyway, and unless Fellaini is content with not being a starter.

You don't need a good memory to remember how terrible Fellaini was last season save for a few games against Crystal Palace and Wesr Brom. Those performances themselves were not great either, they were pretty standard of what you expect from a United player at the least.

1906~~~
Doesn't look like LvG agrees with your assesment does it?

1907~~~
How nice is it having 6 or so decent options in the midfield? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1908~~~
I would say no, and i'll admit it. Lets be realistic though, if we're going for a player like Vidal or of similar quality, and we have Blind and Herrera as well, Fellaini will have a decision to make at some point because I don't see him holding down a starting berth.

1909~~~
Of course he isn't going to hold down a starting berth but he isn't going to get a spot at another club of our size either. If he wants to win big trophies then sticking with us in a squad role is his only real chance.

1910~~~
I don't see this as being all that balanced.  Herrera often takes risks in possession, and Fellaini is someone you'd want to allow to get further forward for obvious reasons but can't track back with the emergency of Di Maria.  

End result being Blind being left on an island, or Fellaini in a restricted role that plays against his strengths and has people calling for his head again...

1911~~~
Personally i'd rather buy another good CM and give Perriera the standby position. Lets see how this plays out, because im far from convinced by Fellaini.

1912~~~
Great post, I agree with everything; the bit in bold especially. He's had a really really rough run here for a variety of reasons but he hasn't given up. He's shown a remarkable amount of perseverance and fight and he gets a lot of respect from me because of that. If he keeps performing well and LvG knows he can trust him to perform then it will be incredibly hard to drop him. However he will have an average game again soon and I fully expect people to jump back on the bandwagon of saying he is no good.

1913~~~
So you are saying he is good at keeping things ticking over, moving the ball on quickly to players. But he's not neat and tidy cause he looks clumsy? 
I watched Fellaini last season in a struggling team where he signed on deadline day, he also had an operation and obvious confidence issues plus trying to settle. He wasn't great I accept that but he wasn't as bad as folk were saying and was better than quite a few who escaped criticism. We have put up with Anderson for 8 years yet people were not prepared to give Fellaini more than half a season kind of annoyed me! I'm not saying he'll be a success here but he should have the chance! Ok neat and tidy was not the best choice of words so what about very efficient on the ball? As for someone "who looks clumsy" he manages to pass the ball forward quite a lot and retain possession from what I see.

1914~~~
He's a new player who's settling in who has been out with injury! Kagawa had more bad games than good games also but some folk were gutted when he left! Plus Mata has hardly set the world on fire are we going to write him off also?

1915~~~
Kagawa did nothing to deserve to stay. He had a big reputation but he never performed. It was the right decision to let him go. He wasn't suited to the PL. Mata needs to step up his performances or he'll end up sitting on the bench a lot as well. Not sure what you're trying to prove with these examples. You've named two players no longer at the club, one who is currently failing to justify his transfer fee and one who plays around 3 games a season.

1916~~~
Thats about it. I don't think 'neat and tidy' is a very good description of the work he does on the pitch and the fact its become synonymous with 'good' is a bit odd.

For example, I'd classify both David Silva and Tom Cleverley as 'neat and tidy' players but obviously there's a chasm in terms of the twos respective abilities. On the other hand, I'd argue Suarez looks a bit more ungainly than Silva, but is a more effective player.

All I'm saying is that if you asked me to describe in a few words Fellaini at his best I certainly wouldn't describe him in anyway as a tidy player, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.

1917~~~
I knew Fellaini could be a useful player for us. Some of you lot have to get over the fee we paid. We've wasted a lot of money over the years, with players like Berbatov coming to mind. However, while he probably didn't recoup his transfer fee, he was a decent player for us and scored a 20 in a season if I recall correctly.

Fellaini won't score that many but he'll chip in with his fair share of goals and he adds something different to our team full of pansys. Sure, his elbows have a mind of their own but he's a good player and dare I say it, has looked pretty good this season. That's two goals for him (inc. the one against Valencia) in as many games this season. I'm sure he can improve on that and put in a few more solid shifts this season.

1918~~~
Fellaini does bring certain qualities to the team that we lack, such as height in offense and physicality. He may not have the silkiest of techniques but in a season of over 30 matches you have qualities that work against different kinds of opponents. 

The guy has been a PL player in a team that consistently remained in the top half, and not only against the weaker teams, he has been difficult to play against even for the likes of ourselves and Man City. That obviously says to me that he is a proven PL player, but of course the debate whether he is good enough for us. 

LVG seems to have found a role for him and even if he might only contribute in those specific roles, he should be deemed good enough to play for us.

1919~~~
With Blind/Carrick occupying the defensive midfield roles, I actually do believe that Fellaini will get a lot of goals if he continues playing as he is. His role this season allows him to get into the box and cause all sorts of problems and most importantly, get on the end of crosses with that head of his.

1920~~~
On the "neat and tidy" thing, I don't think he'll ever win any fans for his aesthetics as a footballer. His touch is a bit inconsistent, he looks <i>really</i> ungainly when he runs and he's such an odd looking bloke everything he does looks a little cartoonish and awkward. However, he does seem to be a very consistent passer of the ball over short distances, with both feet. Usually picks the right option and passes the ball exactly where he wants it to go. Which is a good quality to have in any central midfielder. 

This whole chest control thing has become a bit of a piss take but, ultimately, anybody who can kill a football with their chest the way he does has great control of the movement of their body and is considerably more coordinated than you might think, looking at him mop-rampaging around the pitch.

1921~~~
And this is what you'd probably want from your central midfielder when you've got people like Rooney or Mata in the #10 role who're far better passers and thus the burden of making through passes or spraying it to the wings should lay on their shoulders. Or somebody could always simply carry the ball forward like Herrera does, while Fellaini can do it as well, Herrera due to his natural agility can do it better than him.

Easy options are sometimes the best solutions. Of course the problem starts when all of our midfielders pick the easy options, that's why midfield duo of, for example, Fellaini and Cleverley never worked.

1922~~~
Exactly. Plus he's favourite to win the ball in midfield, every time there's a dropping ball to fight for. Not a very glamorous skill but can make a big difference in the overall pattern of the game.

1923~~~
Fancy him for a goal if he starts against City.

1924~~~
Well fair enough for admitting you were wrong on that at least, I see many others who were going way overboard in their criticism have gone very quiet - at least you are consistent!

I dont actually see a desperate need for us to buy a midfielder now - the defence need reinforcements first. And he doesnt need to start every game to be a success, it is squad game - it is not even about whether Fellaini or Herrera is the better player, they have different strengths so it depends on the opposition for who gets the nod.

1925~~~
I've not spoken to a match-going fan who wasn't disgusted by the ironic cheering he got in the Valencia game. It was a low-point for Old Trafford, but one I'm convinced wasn't an accurate reflection of our fans. If it took that to spur him into re-inventing himself, or sharpening his focus, or whatever, then maybe it was a blessing in disguise.  What it does show, either way, is a determination and strength of character that is invaluable in top level football.
When the chips are down, that is the resolute, warrior-spirit that gets you a win from a losing position. It has to be accompanied by technical and tactical prowess as well, but these type of men are the ones that you want on your side. Those of us who can remember Neil Webb know what the opposite looks like.

I don't get some fans attitudes to our own players, at times. "We should get rid of Fellaini/Young/Kagawa/Berbatov..."
Maybe, if someone comes through or is bought, that is more deserving of that place in the squad. Then there is an argument if they are of no use, because they are not getting games, but to weaken the squad because of personal preferences is just loopy, and if a player is still getting games, they deserve support.

1926~~~
If rooney comes back in the XI, doesn't it mean that we won't be able to play in a 4141 anymore(which Fellaini well by the way)?

1927~~~
He would replace Mata.

1928~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1929~~~
The new Welbeck?

The man marker against the top teams?

1930~~~
Not necessarily. I can see us using it in the big games:

We have never been better in the CL away from home than when we played 451 (4141 is a type of 451 formation) with Rooney up top back in 2006/7. It was only Rooney's injury that stopped us beating Bayern that one year.

It's not that sexy but in tough away games, or the leaders at home, it gives us a great chance to shut down the opposition while still playing free flowing football.

1931~~~
I thought he had a good game on sunday, and he had a vital contribution in making us look solid, aswell as not allowing Fabregas to influence the game, but i think he doesn't offer much attackingly and due to him we become predicatable, i have watched the match again, and there was so many times the ball was passed to him, and he doesn't know whats going on around him, he could have easily turned and play an attacking pass, he either just passed it to Janujaz who was 10 yards on his left, or he passed it back first time, there was a moment in which Adnan passed into him on the edge of the box on the left hand side, he could have turned there were no Chelsea players within 20 yards off him, he just first time passed it back that summed it up his attacking ability as a midfielder for me. 

Another problem which we face when we play him is, he moves into the box all the time, rather than choosing his moments, due to which what happens is we don't have anybody in the midfield coming short for a pass, and their Fullbacks aren't moved out of their position and it doesn't give space to our wingers to cross the ball or get one on ones with the fullback, as the defenders can stick tight to them.

1932~~~
I agree if he is to build on what he did in the Chelsea game then he has to learn that he can’t just straight into the box all the time, on Sunday at times he needed better awareness of where Mata was (Mata was equally as guilty) as one of them needed to make themselves available for a pass from the winger or full back, at times both winger and full back were just hemmed in with no option infield other than the cb’s and in the end there was nowhere to go so it becomes pointless waiting for the ball in the box. If he had been able to do that I would have been a lot more impressed with his performance but I think that is probably a hangover from his time at Everton where he was the focal point he played with a lot more freedom.

I agree there are times he had more space and could have done more but I wouldn’t be overly critical of that because that’s not his game he has a specific and limited range of abilities which if used correctly can be effective. He does a flick and some good passes against Chelsea and all of a sudden he is much better than people said, dribbles the ball out of play against Bayern and he is useless, it’s all over the top reactions when really he is just a limited but effective player.

We have to wait and see if he can adapt to the team and the team can adapt to him, based on what we have seen so far I think that is still up in the air and personally I am not convinced that what he brings to the team compensates for what he doesn’t or what a different type of player would bring.

1933~~~
I don't think it's right to criticize him for running into the box a lot. He's clearly doing that because he is the target man and he is making himself available for the cross/pass. If him running into the box all the time is a problem, I'm pretty sure LvG would have had a word with him by now.

1934~~~
And his first touch is incredible. With his chest.

1935~~~
Not at all. Only his form has changed. 

Hope now people don't ridicule me when I say he is much much better than Cleverly.

1936~~~
I would still say Cleverley is the better footballer but when Fellaini is in form, he can impact a match far more than Cleverley. If that makes sense.

1937~~~
Pretty sure LVG is asking Fellaini to run into the box.

1938~~~
Hmm that really doesn't make sense. You're saying when Fellaini is in form he can impact a match better than Cleverley. So when is Cleverly better? When they are both out of form? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

BTW I have nothing against anyone who criticized Fellaini. I'm one of his biggest fans but the way he was playing of course he deserved some criticism. It's just the ones who were abusing him like he's some criminal and begging for him to get injured that should really not be opening their mouths.

1939~~~
In regards to technical ability, I rate Cleverley higher than Fellaini. However, Fellaini attributes (when he uses them) have a far greater impact on a match. Now I know that should make him the better player and in a way it does but for me, Cleverley is the better player wit the ball at his feet.

1940~~~
I'm probably one of Fellaini's biggest critics on here but even I found the 'ironic cheering' at that game really uncomfortable. I've never understood why fans would want to damage the confidence of their own players (even if he was rumoured to be sold). Just like our fans abusing Cleverley on Twitter. I don't get it. I felt sorry for Fellaini at that game. He might not be my cup of tea but I still want him to do well as our player now he's here.

1941~~~
Agreed. A real pity the way Cleverley's development stalled. A very tidy footballer on his day. His apparent deterioration might be partly down to him lacking the bloody-mindedness that is getting Fellaini through such a painful start to his United career. Both players that suffered from "supporters" doing the opposite of supporting.

1942~~~
The last line in bold does not make sense.
I've never seen Cleverley beat a man whether by manipulating the ball with  his feet or just a simple  body serve. All this Fellaini can do. Cleverley is just a basic ball to feet, give and go midfielder. Fellaini has much more to his game then that.

1943~~~
This is the thing that has held Cleverley back. It was also what we have been missing for a while in CM. All the best teams have cm players capable of beating opposition players with the ball at their feet, we haven't for ages. If Cleverley had that in his locker he would have been a very good cm for us. Sadly he doesn't.



Hopefully Fellaini can have a consistent run of good games for us, we need variety in our players so as a team we aren't predictable.

1944~~~
Ander Herrera is what Tom Cleverly should of developed into. Sadly it wasn't to be.

1945~~~
Sort of. Ander has an aggression in his game that Cleverley never showed, not even when he was being used as a fullback.

But interestingly he's doing a good job defensively on loan at Villa so he might finally be developing a little bit of bite for when he comes back, even if its likely just to be sold in the summer

1946~~~
Tom's best game last season was all about his defensive efforts, away at the Emirates.

Does seem a waste, though. He had the potential to be so much more of an attacking threat, which we saw when he was at Watford. Obviously, confidence is key when it comes to taking risks and being creative. His confidence must have been utterly crushed by events of the last two seasons.

1947~~~
I agree he did well that game and pretty well defensively all season, but I'm talking more about hard tackling and making the opponent think for a split second the next time he gets the ball. Thats something Ander puts into his opponents and even someone like Scholes with his typical bookable offences managed to do it. The more aggressive challenges that ruin a nice players' day

Cleverley has never had that part to his game, but last season and continuing this season at Villa his ability to win the ball has dramatically improved. And that will take him a long way, just probably not long enough to stay here post the summer

1948~~~
Oh right. Yes, not a feature of Tom's game at United. Haven't watched him for Villa but be good if he could add that string to his bow.

1949~~~
I have an issue with his slow mobility, he does get around the pitch quite a bit but we shouldn't rely on him defensively. He did do a pretty good job on Fabregas and has looked better overall. Good on him, it can't be easy having your credentials questioned like that but he's done well to come back. Hopefully he can be an asset for us from set pieces and open play as well. 

Fellaini is unique in the sense that he doesn't need to have the most technically impressive overall game due to the threat he gives up upfront with headers and from set pieces, if he can do that regularly which is what he should be judged on there is a case for him to be a regular starter.

1950~~~
I don't see how anybody can say that. How is he a better footballer? surely the ability to impact a match is one of the biggest attributes of a good footballer. You'd never see Cleverly score a goal like Fellaini did vs West Brom in a million years.

1951~~~
It's funny how most United fans wrote him off as a bad footballer. He was never a bad footballer. He's a solid player who under specific instructions can bring something to the table, we saw that in the last 2 games, and during his time at Everton. He'll be important against Man City, and even though we sign better midfielders next summer, I'll like us to keep him. I like how the big Fella didn't sulk despite things not going his way, instead he put his feet down and worked really hard to earn a place in the team, that's a fantastic attitude.

1952~~~
Louis van Gaal on Marouane Fellaini: "When he is fit I have played him. He has to continue with that because then I am very pleased."

1953~~~

1954~~~
You have to say for attitude and a desire to feck the haters and prove yourself anyway I find it odd how people think he's not Man United material. A similar path in some regards to that trodden by Fletcher, carrick and many others in the current squad.

1955~~~
Could be an incredible story if he emerges from low expectations to pivotal player this year. If he does, it removes a bit of pressure to buy another midfielder and will allow Van Gaal to focus on a defender.

1956~~~
wtf? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1957~~~
Interesting, so, if he goes back to being a liability in midfield, not shutting people down and ambling around, but shows a threat up front from crosses / set pieces, you think he should be a starter? I wouldn't, personally. Midfield area is crucial, and I think we need players in there making an impact there, in midfield, more than anything else.

Not to say  he will go back to being a liability etc. Though I do find the hyperbole after 1.5 good games priceless, with the "renaissance man" headlines and all. Talk about let him have a few games before the journos start talking like this. It's insane how knee jerk the reaction are these days. Hopefully he'll continue in that form, as he really was excellent against Chelsea. I'm not so sure he can, but please God I'm proved wrong.

1958~~~
The fact is if you can play at that level against chelsea and nulify fabregas in the process its in him. As many on here thought it was from his Everton days. That alone is worth something right now from a player some had written off as no way near of the quality required. His is......but can we get it out of him consistently.....

1959~~~
Unique is a good word to describe him. 

You always hear what a joy it is to watch Modric, Kroos, Cesc, Ramsey in full flight and I totally agree. The supreme technique to grab a game and completely control it like a video game. 

However going back to his Everton days I found Fellaini at his best a player I enjoyed seeing. He's not up to those standards of skill, technique and generally being aesthetically pleasing. Not many are. He's unorthodox but that's what is interesting to see. A lot of these type of players get found out eventually as one-trick ponies. He did it for many years at Everton.

He is no where near as bad technically as made out to be. Everton under Moyes were direct to get the ball up the pitch but from then onwards they played some lovely stuff and Fellaini was at the heartbeat of that. 

Often you watch him and you don't know what to expect. Going back to Everton, he was dominating. Unplayable at times not through deft skill but he had a knack of putting fear off opponents and exploiting it.

His performance on the opening game of 12/13 against us was one of the best individual performances I've seen against United.

1960~~~
And playing with 2 strikers I kinda feel direct football (long ball if your West Ham) is not a bad way to alternate proceedings and Fellaini on the pitch has to be up there when it comes to playing that game. People says that not our way. I doubt anyone would give a sh+t how we win if we get 3 points against city or any other team. It worked for SAF in his final few seasons in some respects. For me..its about winning the match however, simple as that.

21 seconds. The last couple of pages of the Kagawa thread have been full of <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> for a touch similar to that. Problem with Clev is he got a reputation of being a shite player and it's very hard to shake that off if people are expecting you to be shit and then disregarding the good things you do. As others have said, I believe Cleverley's technique is massively underrated but he does not have the personal belief or rock solid mentality needed to succeed at a club like United.

1962~~~
That post that you are responding to did not mention 'liability' but instead stated Fellaini might not be 'the most technically impressive' therefore it seems you are implying a player that is not the most technically impressive is then a liability.

This is an odd opinion you have.

1963~~~
Before and after the chelsea game he had Hazard and Courtois in headlocks, both seemed to be having a laugh with him. He looks like a decent character for the dressing room.

1964~~~
Ever seen Scholes go past a player lol

1965~~~
You were quite specific in one particular area of Cleverley and Fellaini's technical ability, i.e 'ball at his feet'.
You do not need youtube clips to realise that Fellaini wins hands down. You bringing  Scholes to the debate to support your point regarding Cleverley 'technical ability', 'with the ball at his feet' is quite funny.

1966~~~
Lol with a fancy stepover? Not often. Has he faked a touch or pass to buy himself 1/2 a second? All the time. Lol

1967~~~
Scholes did occasionally beat someone, but usually only took people on when he had a chance in the box. I can remember one or two goals where he goes past someone with a dummy

1968~~~
Loads of times.

1969~~~

1970~~~
If he starts today, I hope he can continue where he left off against Chelsea, where I thought he had a really good game. Be a tough game, but these are the type of games he'll have to have a big impact in to continue to silence his critics.

1971~~~
If he starts I recon he will be man marking Yaya Toure like he did with Fabregas. The good that's come of this is that LVG has realised that we need steel in the backbone of the team and not just technical ability. But I'm glad Fellaini is doing well and long may it continue.

I was sceptical when we bought him but at this moment if he can do us a job then I can't complain but can't see him as a regular fixture in the first 11...

1972~~~
David Moyes has done an "I told you so" article on Dailymail, it's hilarious!

1973~~~
You will not find a bigger critic of him than myself but my days I can see him putting in a perfomance tomorrow. C'mon Maraoune.

1974~~~
Imagine he puts in a performance and maybe even grabs a crucial goal. He would probably go to instant hero status, good on him for fighting through it all.

1975~~~
I thought he was man marking Fabregas the whole game but he actually wasn't. Plenty of times he would ghost away from Cesc leaving him worried and dragging him out of position. Was a good tactical display from him, along with covering the most miles on the pitch (so much for the laziness claims).

1976~~~
Agree. As soon as we won the ball he would force Cesc to defend (and often he wouldn't so Fellaini got space).

1977~~~
Yes exactly. I actually missed all this the first time. It only made sense when I watched Neville and Carragher's analysis on MNF.

1978~~~
It is interesting because if he does the same to Toure (who also tends to neglect his defensive duties at times) then he could become a big force in the match.

1979~~~
True, even more so if they play only 2 in midfield ( including Toure).

1980~~~
Made one or two last ditch tackles in our box too if I remember correctly. Just one of his best matches in a red shirt and exactly what we need him to do every week.

1981~~~
Hope he finds the right balance in his game. He certainly adds pushing foward but need him to time it better imo, I think at times he gets forward too quickly and we could get the ball in a better position/be better prepared for a counter if he waited a bit longer and let the play transition more.

1982~~~
No that's not what I'm implying. What I'm stating is that if he goes back to being a liability, which he was last year, technical ability or not, is he worth keeping. Not sure how you made the jump from what i said to what you thought I implied.

1983~~~
Our best player out there again probably, or at least it's close. Will struggle this second half I'd say with more ground to cover quicker, and us under huge pressure, but showed the first half that he can play a good role in this team... just probably not at CB

1984~~~
He's done well at times but he's still sometimes rash and a bit dodgy. Not convinced by his first touch, and he was very lucky to not concede a penalty after that rash challenge on Aguero. Plus, I'd rather see Rooney in his more advanced role, even if it meant sacrificing Fellaini.

1985~~~
If there's one player you want in a backs-to-the-wall scrap, it's Fellaini.

Saw him play brilliantly in these types of situations numerous times at Everton. Hopefully he can for the next 45 minutes as well.

1986~~~
He's been okay. Not as good as Chelsea but we're under the pump and it is going to be difficult for everyone. Just has to do his defensive jobs well and try his best to get on the end of any set piece chance we may get.

1987~~~
Only player that has kept the ball in the opposing half so far.

1988~~~
I'm sure he spat on Aguero.

1989~~~
One of our best players in the first half, but thats exactly why you dont want him at CB. 99% stonewall penalty for no reason, and a bad reaction to Aguero afterwards

He better not

1990~~~
Been great again, in my opinion.

1991~~~
My gripes with him in this game (and the last) are more tactical than anything. Just don't get why we want him to push us so quick. Plenty of cm's are able to get in the box when the moment is right, we let him push up before we've got in to anywhere near a good position. Just don't get it.

1992~~~
I imagine he just shouted expletives in his ear.

1993~~~
Looks like he was just giving him an earful. "Diving cnut" or whatever.

1994~~~
Well then why state the obvious? Any player that is a liability should not be in our first team.

The person that you responded to posted that even if he is not the most technically gifted he has other strengths such as set pieces, you then said, and I quote:

The poster mentioned nothing about him being a liability but simply even if he is not the most technically gifted, he has other strengths that contribute to his overall ability. The poster did not at any point imply if he is a liability in the team then he should be kept on in our first eleven, therefore I don't understand the point in your response.

Either you are equating the poster's assessment of him not being the most technically gifted with him being a liability and if so this is a ridiculous statement to make.

Alternatively you are asking the poster if Fellaini is a liability whether he should play in the first team despite the poster not even using that term. Well that's obvious, everybody knows a player who is a liability should be dropped.

The other point could be when the poster said 'that is what he should be judged on' you replied as you did, well then obviously he does not mean Fellaini should be <i>only</i> judged on his set pieces just like RVP should not <i>only</i> be judged on his goals and assists, he means that is his best strength, his best contribution to the team and so should weigh heavily in judgement of his contribution to the team. If he is deadly from them whilst being a good central midfielder then fine, if he is deadly from them whilst being an atrocious central midfielder then obviously he is not going to be a starter.

1995~~~
He's been our best player again.

1996~~~
See now this is why I don't think he should be part of our long-term plans. At the risk of sounding too harsh lemme just preface this by stating that he was by no means our worst player overall today but has the knack for switching off/ slacking off at decisive moments :



People keep repeating about how he's a scrapper with guts and blood, adds steel to the side, doesn't lack in work ethic and so forth. But I just don't see it in the micro perspective, dude keeps ball watching with little awareness for stifling dangerous play patterns. Show some hustling ability man, pick up the pace and close Toure down, there's just one critical area he can pass to and that's in the channel behind Di Maria. Failing that, atleast try to narrow the passing window, get in the box and help your team-mates. We're down a man with 2 kids in defense as it is. Where's the passion ? Look at Di Maria, fair enough he couldn't connect but he did reasonably well to slide in considering he's a pure attacker, the effort was there, the man just has some moxy about him.

1997~~~
That's nitpicking, in my opinion.

1998~~~
He's blocking off 2 potential passes there, Di Maria should have had the 3rd covered.

1999~~~

2000~~~
Another good game. Long may it continue.

2001~~~
You're completely misunderstanding me. I didn't at all imply what the original poster said. The original poster said that he has other strengths, such as being a danger at free kicks. I was simply asking if the poster thought that even with those strengths, if the rest of his game was proving a liability, that he should go into the team. I personally don't, if he goes back to being the way he was last year.

2002~~~
Another good game today from Fellaini. Fair play to him, hopefully continues to prove me wrong. Proved to be a bright spot today, one of the few I thought.

2003~~~
That looks like dribble to me. You dont spit at someone like you are sucking on a wet sardin.

2004~~~
Worked hard and did a job for us. Brings a physicality to midfield but I expect him to be replaced by Herrera once he is fit again.

Really useful when we are chasing the game and need to go a more direct route. Played hard for the team today and never stopped running. Cant ask for more.

2005~~~
Thought he was really good today - been impressive lately! Arguably our motm, but Rooney was excellent those last 20mins.

2006~~~
Did ok today, wasn't great but wasn't bad either. Still a worry with his tackling, got away with a couple today that could have been bad for us.

2007~~~
Its a central midfielder being lazy. We get the same from the likes of Di Maria. In that particular example I dont think he would have got back and made a difference but thats not the point is it? For all Fellaini knows there, the ball could have dropped 5 yards back and he'd have had a chance to get there. But instead he lost interest

2008~~~
Good performance. He's clearly a revitalized player this year compared to last.

2009~~~
Well yeah, it's a bit pedantic. But despite the narrative since Brom/ Chelsea I still don't think he's suited to big games where there is little margin for error because even the most minute coverage lapses are dealt with clinically. It's the subtle nuances that elude him purely IMO (rightly or wrongly).

I don't think so. Blind tracked dude all the way and Aguero was on McNair and Carrick so those were less threatening than the Di Maria one because of the angle of delivery and he was a non factor in all of them, particularly the latter most. And what about the effort after the pass was made ? In saying that it was a collective failure with McNair switching off too and allowing Aguero the space to convert. But those inconsistencies to be expected of a 19 year old. Not a veteran.

2010~~~
He was excellent again today. Herrera will struggle to get back in.

2011~~~
If there was a bit more elevation from the free kick I reckon he may have snatched a goal. He had the beating of Kompany but the big man never looked comfortable stooping for the ball.

Other than that he did a decent job. Better when we had 11 men because he was finding space to run into the attacking third. Our midfield looked a bit lost when we went to 10 as we didn't know whether to push out and risk them getting behind.

2012~~~
Yea he's done well, hard to blame him or Blind today, I think that Blind was simply fantastic up to 30th minute when we've lost a man, Fellaini was doing his job well as well.

It's a fecking shame that when we've got somewhat half-decent working CM at last it's other sectors of the pitch that fail us.

2013~~~
Am I missing something here? It looks like he was sticking with Toure? I don't understand what he did wrong there. Anyway, thought he was pretty good. Good spirit. Should have buried that header probably, so it is a shame he missed.

2014~~~
He has a role to play in this team. 

I am actually starting to like him quite a bit. Good game again, and one of our best players.

2015~~~
He was, together with Di Maria, the one you looked to when we were chasing yhe equaliser at the end.

2016~~~
Good game from him and looks a proper player in the last two games.

2017~~~
Clumsy performance. He was lucky not give away 2 penalties.

2018~~~
I agree, he did nothing wrong there. Another good performance from him.

2019~~~
I covered that in my post already. 

A team with the ambition that United have (that is to be the best in Europe) would drop from the first team any player that is a liability. I would say this is one of those things that are so obvious they go without saying.

2020~~~
He was ok today, but long term we need better, maybe he has a future as a very expensive squad option.

2021~~~
Was great again today. Was everywhere, and certainly showed the sort of passion you'd want to see from your players in a derby.

2022~~~
Yeah. He needs to stay as far away from our box as possible, unless it's a defensive set piece. Did well though at the other end in terms of getting on the ball and laying it off.

2023~~~
One of our better players today, very useful once we needed to go more direct.

2024~~~
He'll never convince some on here. He was arguably our best player today.

2025~~~
One of the best players on the pitch today. His first touch was surprisingly brilliant.

2026~~~
Decent again but lucky to not give away a penalty and he should have done much better with the headed chance he had in the second half. He was one of our better players though but with him and Rooney playing as our two more attacking midfielders it was noticeable how limited the range of passing was.

2027~~~
He did well at helping defensively and winning the ball, sadly whilst I understand why we did it when we went down a man I wish we weren't so focused on hitting the ball up to him with eleven men. He can be a great threat with his height but I personally feel we could actually get more out of him by using him actually in central midfield and letting him get in the box when the moment is right.

2028~~~
Details and shit, but when was the second penalty? First one is as obvious as it gets, second one around 60th minute mark? It was Carrick who fouled Aguero there. ( <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> )

2029~~~
Do you remember when some people used to suggest that we play him at centre-back? yeah, definitely not. Two minutes after moving there he nearly gave a penalty away.

Still, I've been really critical of him in the past, mostly because he switches off more than anything, but he's doing well with less defensive responsibility.

Still should have scored though.

2030~~~
Hmm ok. Fair enough. Genuine question though. Sticking with him how ? And achieving what exactly while in stroll mode ? What is the purpose of sticking by an individual when you didn't harry the opposition player and didn't prevent/ try to prevent him from passing into a critical zone ? At a time when you're a man down and ideally should be even more mindful of the need for 120 % effort.

As an example, in the same gif one can easily discern the difference in tactical astuteness between him and Blind. Daley closes down the opponent and positions himself to intercept the ball while Navas pings it in. That one little play speaks volumes about his mental alertness and the ability to stifle danger. It's these kind of details that separate the two in terms of nous of midfield play.

2031~~~
Once again, one of the best players on the pitch today. Calm and composed and gave us needed physicality in the middle.

2032~~~
Good game today.

2033~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2034~~~
He should have had a penalty against him and he should have scored a free header and he didnt.

I can understand wanting to be positive, and he was certainly among our best players today with De Gea probably the best. But he still made big mistakes that are being glossed over. Defensively he gave away a clear foul in the box and offensively he missed our best chance and didnt manage anything else. He helped us compete in the middle winning the ball and didnt give it away much.

2035~~~
Well where could he have gone if he left Toure? Into the box? Then Toure would have been unmarked on the edge of the area for the Clichy cutback. Blind tracks the runner and Fellaini minds Toure. Don't see an issue at all.

2036~~~
I absolutely agree with you, it should go without saying. I was simply asking the original poster a question, when he said the following:
I was simply asking that, if he gives a threat up front, from headers and set pieces, should a case be made for him to be a regular starter, while along with that he is a liability? That's all. Simple question. You seem to be misunderstanding it and getting bizarrely worked up over it. 
The way  I'm reading Wolverine's post (and I may be misunderstanding his) is that a case can be made for him to be a regular starter, due to the fact he is a danger from set pieces. 

I don't believe that's the case. Disregarding the technical ability thing, as I think plenty of players are crucial without great technical ability (Steve Bruce was one of my favourite United defenders), even if he is showing a threat up front, if he's dismal in other areas, he a case should not be made for him to be a regular starter.

At the moment, it's a moot point. He's done enough in the past few games to be starting, fair play to him.

2037~~~
Absolutely disgusting.

What is wrong with him? We cant have a player elbowing people every other game and now spitting at them on the floor

2038~~~
Very clumsy in his challenges and quite a few astray passes. Missed a few great Di Maria deliveries also, I'm rather surprised many think it was a very good performance.

2039~~~
Spitting on them?? really? I think that's sweat and spit from yelling at Aguero. You gotta get out ans play more football to see what spitting looks like.

2040~~~
People are actually trying to blame him for the goal? Wow. Cretins.

2041~~~
That happens in football. Fouls happen so do missed chances. Within the context of the game, he was our best player IMO. The other issues don't detract from that...

2042~~~
Funny how it shoots out of his mouth with him not mouthing any words

Next you'll be claiming its photoshopped

2043~~~
The penalty was bad alright. The header wasn't that easy a chance though, I don't think. Certain players make that thing look easy, but he needed to get the deftest of touches to guide that in. It's not easy, he probably missed the flick by millimetres, but with Sky slowing it down and seeing it hit his shoulder, it looks awful. I'm not saying it was a ludicrously hard  chance etc .. just that he was a bit unlucky. And bear in mind, I have been extremely harsh on the guy in the past. I'm also willing to give players some leeway when they perform well, for the odd mistake.

2044~~~
He's doing well in my opinion, he is a presence.. he is a reference point in the past two games and in a positive way. He isn't looking out of his depth and I'm very happy to see that. Interesting to see how we can make Fellaini, Herrera and Di Maria work in the same midfield. There is potential there in my opinion for something quite strong. Something like below - away from home would be quite strong.

2045~~~
Well of course you have no doubt he spat on him. it certainly plays into your view of him. Probably delighted to have sometuhg to latch on to .  Must have been worrying for you that he was playing well.

2046~~~
Maybe could've done better with a couple of chances. Had a decent game though, yet he's getting some criticism? C'mon lads... He was better than di Maria.

2047~~~
Decent performance from Fellaini today, certainly improving for us.

However, for a big man he is actually not great at heading the ball, so I think he needs to improve on that aspect of his game.

2048~~~
Thought he was very good today to be honest. Certainly one of our better players (if not our best).

2049~~~
I dont know how you can claim he's better than De Gea was today. Without him it'd have been at least 3-0

2050~~~
He'd be ideally suited to West Ham and Stoke. United are not about his type of football. If posters are praising him for this performance our other players should bow their heads in shame.

2051~~~
and then accusing him off spitting on Aguero.

This is ridiculous.

2052~~~
Very, very harsh.

2053~~~
Really impressed with him today, compensates for the lack of height and physicality in our squad.

2054~~~
Did well other than the headed chance, hope he carries on and make the haters eat their words.

2055~~~
Well I saw it live on TV. An unfavourable angle can make a lot of things looks worse. From the other side, he was really having a go and that was visible.

2056~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OOgvXdTetTj/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

So can anyone explain what he's saying here, as sweat accidently falls from his mouth?

2057~~~
LvG has got the best out of Fellaini. He's been our best player since the start of october.

2058~~~
That seems more like he dribbled than a spit. 

Generally I thought he did well in winning the ball back but it was when he got in the final third where he was disappointing. Though only Rooney looked a threat there. Everyone else was too slow and clumsy.

2059~~~
Nope. That's not how you play when a defender has been sent off. Players have to overcompensate the deficit instead of marking individuals which cedes the advantage to the opposition who have a numerical strength as it is.

2060~~~
maybe your mate 'LFC Vine' has a version with better audio.

2061~~~
Maybe your mate Fellaini can come and tell us?

2062~~~
It's absolutely incredible that a United fan can be so blind with the hatred/agenda against one of our own players that he's resorting to making up stuff about him.

2063~~~
Slow it down to three frames and it looks like he's spitting. But, what if he was ending whatever he was saying saying "Foul". Or even "feck offff". Show me the other angle where he was saying somthing to him and that's when the spit comes out. I'll agree if didn't say anything from that angle and it still looked like he was spitting.

2064~~~
Not true. Watch his world cup goal for Belgium in their first group game, cracking header. Was just off today. And Kompany is also good in the air so he didn't have it his own way.

2065~~~
Utter nonsense. You're making shit up simply to have a go at a player you don't like. The numerical disadvantage make no difference at all to how you defend situations like that.

2066~~~
He's going through a better patch at the moment, but is he our long term solution? Not a slight on his performances of late, he's been very good in the last few games he's played I think, just an honest question really.

2067~~~
Fair enough. I really hope he didnt spit on him but it looks very damning

2068~~~
Missed a great chance with the header, should have conceded a penalty and had the brass neck to have a go at Aguero for getting fouled <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2069~~~
Wouid you listen to him? Given your thoughts expressed on him previously I guess you'd be surprised if he could talk and doesn't just grunt.

2070~~~
Doesn't be so sure. We have played a fair number of long balls so far this season. It's kind of a herd mentality here right now, and Van Gaal can do no wrong. 

I think he was ordinary today. Back to his kicking, bad tackling and aimlessly running to the box routine. From watching Scholes all these years to having Fellaini is very depressing.

2071~~~
It's in super slow-mo ffs

2072~~~
We need those characters on the field. Yeah, he was a prick sometimes, but we need a bruiser in there. I've seen Roy Keane have a go at players he's maimed so many times. We need some nastiness in there.

2073~~~
I just don't like the style of play he brings to United.

2074~~~
I'm sure he has headed the ball well a few times in the past, but there is no doubting that his heading is off most of the time.

He should be posing a far greater threat in that regard.

His other aerial abilities such as bring the ball down and controlling it are great however, it's just the heading letting him down.

2075~~~
I'm not getting worked up from it, that's your opinion, without knowing how I feel right now it's also quite a poor judgement to make I think.

I think it would also help if you read more carefully my posts because I have already anticipated this response and replied so you didn't have to write that post:

That is two replies in a row now where the answer was already in the previous post.

I think you are underestimating that poster's intelligence if you are of the opinion that he honestly mean't Fellaini should be a starter if he is a threat from set pieces but 'dismal' in other areas. 

I also disagree with your last point, it's not a moot point because this is a discussion of principle, as in 'if he is deadly from set pieces' but as of yet we are to actually see this at United.

2076~~~
Some absolute feckwittery in this thread.

2077~~~
So are all the red card two footed challenges.

It doesnt change whats in them

2078~~~
I think the football hipsters on here wouldn't stand for a young Roy Keane in the team!

2079~~~
What the feck are you on about?

2080~~~
Fellani is a softie compared to Keane. We need someone like Keane to put steel into the side.

2081~~~
Well, you say it's obviously not what the poster meant, I don't agree, as he didn't state that. He stated that if he can give a threat up front with headers and set pieces, there is a case for him to be a regular starter. I interpreted that differently to how you interpreted it, as is my right, and I asked the poster a question, as is also my right. For some reason you felt the need to come into the conversation and correct me based on your own interpretations of what the poster meant. I asked for clarification from him. Perhaps I am wrong in how I read his post, that is true. And that's why I asked him the question. 

But I'm glad that you are able to read everyone's post on a forum and instantly know when it's obvious as to what they mean. I will seek you out the next time I am looking for clarity.

2082~~~
Some people actually don't want him to do well here, and would rather their opinion of him be right instead, pathetic.

He played well today again, his third good game in a row, was working well in the midfield up until the red, yaya didn't know what to do

2083~~~
One of the better performers today. It's got to the stage where I'd happily take him over Mata in the hole, but I doubt he's really in competition for that role. Very useful player when strength is needed in a midfield 2.

I just hope we don't resort to lumping it upto him too much in the future like we started to at the end. Understandable desperation in this game, but not attractive football.

2084~~~
Should have taken the chances better. Was good otherwise, looked up for it.

2085~~~
he's far too rash though. You don't need players who clumbsily put the boot in tricky players like Aguero from behind and IN the box.

2086~~~
Another pretty good game from him. He'll never be an incredible passer but I quite like his physical presence in these big games. He's clearly a lot more confident and assured now and playing miles better. You have to ask though, if low confidence makes him play as atrocious as he did last year, does he have the mental strength to play for a club like United?

Got away with the penalty incident, though. When you've got your opponent with his back against the goal, the one thing you simply can't do in that situation is to concede a penalty. Very clumsy.

2087~~~
Very sad whoever is finding him outright guilty of spitting just because they don't like him as a player.

2088~~~
Loving the bitter abuse he's getting. Shows that he's really playing well and worrying people who made big, brave, absolute statements about him 10 times a day last season

2089~~~
Well thanks for being rational about it and discussing in a non-hyperbolic fashion. 1st sentence - great opening salvo in any debate TBF. If one's perspective doesn't match another's = the differing one is shite/ nonsense. Also the second sentence is untrue as is the third one.

2090~~~
Let just say that he's one of the least concern we have, and he's positively contributing to our team. If we get to the level of Bayern Munich or even Chelsea, maybe he becomes dispensable then.

2091~~~
Getting to a good level performance after United "fans" booed him shows a pretty tough mentality.

2092~~~
Exactly. Some people here don't remember those times when it was pure grit that got us through a lot of the time in 90's.

2093~~~
At least he seems to be a decent option for us in certain circumstances.

Herrera should start over him in nearly every game but, for specific tactical situations, Fellaini now has a role here. As much as we could have hoped from him really, fair play to the guy.

2094~~~
We have lacked a proper bully in our team for ages.

Good showing today, shame he couldn't put away the chance that came to him but his all round performance was one of the best in our team, for the third game running.

I'm of the opinion that the penalty incident involving Fellaini would have been incredibly soft if it were given. Aguero was just looking to go down as soon as he felt any sort of contact, not a pen for me.

Fellaini was composed, didn't give the ball away, used his strength well and contributed in defense - to those who were trying to claim that he was rash and poor positionally. After we went down to 10 men he was obviously more disciplined in his positioning and times his runs forward more.

That shows that ordinarily he is clearly operating under instruction from LVG to get forward and provide a threat in the box - which he does.

Again today, just like last week, he was let down by poor deliveries from corners and crosses from the likes of ADM.

2095~~~
True. Had my heart in mouth when he was doing that.

2096~~~
He was ok but I prefer Herrera though.

2097~~~
He was lucky to not to concede a penalty but he continued his decent form here. Along with Rooney, caused problems for them in the final third when we looked down and out.

2098~~~
Why do people think we need a hard man to win games? Roy Keane had football ability and a tactical awareness.

2099~~~
Carrick?

Good performance from him today, tough job matching Yaya and Fernando and he mucked in and ran his socks off.  Strength in the middle is an asset and he won decent amount of headers and chests yet again.

Would like to see Blind, fellaini and Herrera as a midfield 3 sometime.

2100~~~
The Aguero incident wasn't great but tbh Aguero is a nasty little cnut himself. I'm glad Fellaini got stuck into him.

2101~~~
I bet you and <a class="username" data-user="21825, @Ekeke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21825/">@Ekeke</a> were absolutely loving the ironic applause Fellaini got in preseason.

So stubborn that he is shite that you simply cannot bare the prospect of him actually doing well for us.

2102~~~
United fans are generally very patient and appreciative. I'm sure those thousands of paying fans had a reason.

2103~~~
Thing is, even though he's doing pretty well, he still looks like a stop-gap player to me. As well as his sitter, he was guilty of criminally pulling out of a tackle that saw Rojo subsequently dive in and dislocate his shoulder.

Fellaini - not for me.

2104~~~
To be fair, Demichelles went in pretty high - and could have done some damage to Fellaini had he not pulled out. Should have been a booking and a free kick to us that.

2105~~~
You really think there is a valid reason to be mocking your own player as soon as he comes on the pitch? He was our best player in that game after he came on and scored a late goal.

It's simply proof that a lot of "fans" would rather see him fail (and do everything they can to try to encourage that) just to justify their own, ill formed opinions.

2106~~~
Yeah I liked Fellaini's reaction. I like to see that in the derby. Kompany and Zabaleta appeared to be fired up, and we only had Rooney and Fellaini in that respect.

He certainly assisted in us not losing the midfield battle physically. Yaya and Fernando (and later Fernandinho) are big strong boys. As much as I prefer Herrera, I don't think he would have done as well as Fellaini did today. A few times he had the beating of Yaya. I don't think there's anyone else in our squad who can really match him physically and do what he does. It's not always pretty, much he has been hugely effective in the last 3 games.

2107~~~
You think your opinions are any more informed than those at the game? Fine!

2108~~~
We have not won any of the games which Fellaini was supposedly superb.

2109~~~
All of those sentences were true. The point you're making is absolutely absurd and shows an astonishing lack of knowledge about how football is played. Hence the hyperbolic response.

2110~~~
Yea suggesting he was our 2nd best player is calling him shite

Like your post

2111~~~
Oh come on. What's that got to do with how well he played as an individual?

2112~~~
It's not about my opinion. Fellaini has played very well for the last 2.5 games (which is essentially all he has played this season) - that isn't just my opinion, that is the pundits, media and most fans that I have spoken to. Despite that, many on here refuse to acknowledge anything that he does, and are desperate to see him fail.

Nonetheless he has been directly involved in 2/3 of the goals we have scored in these games.

The fact that you are resorting to that sort of "statistic" is pretty telling.

2113~~~
All people criticising Fellaini today.

Take 2 minutes, have a word with yourself, then stop.

2114~~~
It's obvious he'll never win some of you over. I've appreciated his performances the past three games, good on him.

2115~~~
He has a role to play and is a good option. He brings something different to Herrera but its nice to have choices. LVG is making the best use of Fellaini in the physical and tougher match ups.

2116~~~
Yeah and?

2117~~~
My problem with Fellaini is his style of play.

2118~~~
It's a team game and he's part of the problem?

2119~~~
So we didnt win cause he played, is that what you're saying?

2120~~~
His current performances remind me of when Berbatov didn't really have to do that much to be lauded, all doubters have always been wrong and the told you so's. He is doing OK, nothing more, people are just so desperate for him to succeed he isn't getting judged like the rest.

2121~~~
Different styles are needed for different days.

2122~~~
I've had more than a couple of minutes...<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2123~~~
FFS some of you on here, he had a good game and STILL there is no credit for him.

2124~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fair enough. As you were!

2125~~~
The worst was Hargreaves. A lot of posters here thought he was the second coming. Despite being awful when fit.

2126~~~
Just as some people are desperate to see him fail.

2127~~~
Hargreaves was awful when fit? 

Hm... Maybe I missed something..

2128~~~
He's only here due to having the fortune of getting injured just at the right time. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2129~~~
He's looked good. It's actually really nice to have a player that can win a high ball in midfield. But his technical ability is nowhere near as bad as people have made out, he's strong on the ball and is able to distribute it well.

2130~~~
Yes!

Read Sir Alex's book.

2131~~~
Give us a quick summary, Sults...

2132~~~
I read it. Dont remember that he wrote that. 
And even if he did, I dont remember him being awful when fit!

2133~~~
You'd think he was some bricklaying hammer thrower the way some label him, he has decent technical ability, he's done alright the last 3 games, i just don't understand how people can single him out as a negative just now.
Only hope he can carry his form on, because he's rightfully keeping Hererra/Mata on the bench at the moment so fair play to him.

2134~~~
I thought he did relatively well to shepherd Toure towards the wing and discourage him from turning infield. The pass down the wing was the only one he really left open, and although it was a dangerous enough situation it could have been dealt with. The 'sticking with him' point was more to do with what Fellaini did after the pass, namely positioning himself against any late run by Toure towards the box rather than sprinting towards the ball/into the penalty area himself.

2135~~~
'There was something about him I didn't like' ... Ferguson describes 'disaster' Hargreaves as one of his worst signings

2136~~~
That doesnt mean he was awful when fit does it?

2137~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That seems a bit harsh!

2138~~~
That's a pretty damning statement from Sir Alex. Read between the lines.

2139~~~
Earlier I said:

And you replied:

Now you are asking these things be stated!

There seems to be a lack of consistency here regarding your opinion.

Last season people were saying "Fellaini was poor" and that is exactly what they stated. Your logic suggests that means he is a terrible footballer but that's not true, it goes without saying that people mean he was poor relative to the expectation but on an absolute level he is an excellent footballer as he made in not just as a professional but to Everton and then United in the premier league.

It goes without saying it was a relative statement and each and every poster on here should not have to state exactly what they mean.

Like this it goes without saying if Fellaini is as you suggested 'dismal' in areas other than set pieces then he will not be selected for Manchester United's first team.

It is also my right to point out an error in your response. In the future you might respond to me and I think your expectation I should state everything I mean is unfair, there are things that go without saying.

If I say "RVP should not be dropped if he scores", from this it should be obvious I mean he scores frequently or has a good goals to game ratio and also it means assuming he is not 'dismal' in other areas.

I should not have to say "RVP should not be dropped if he scores with the frequency he has in previous seasons, his build up play is still good although it does not need to be excellent since he is contributing much needed goals and also I would like his defending from corners to be good, this is an area where we are short and his heading ability will be important. If he performs dismal other than scoring then I think he needs to be dropped" and so on.

Well it is not difficult to realise that poster did not mean "If Fellaini is a danger at set pieces but dismal in all other areas of his game then he should be a regular starter for us".

2140~~~
Nope, they wren't. But ok fair enough, feel free to disagree.

Yup. Whole heartedly agree with the sentiment. Apparently any dissenters of the nuevo altered pro Fellaini narrative (on the back of a couple decent performances where the formation was rejigged to accommodate his talents mind) are summarily dismissed as blind irrational haters. When at the very core the issue is about him stylistically and technically being unsuited to a club of the magnitude of United. People seem to have let their standards go on the basis of last season and seem quite content with what he brings to the table in terms of intermittent functionality and that's a pity because nowhere else in Europe would one find a player that brings so much aesthetic and technical displeasure at an elite club. I can bear inconsistent midfield performances from Herrera or Di Maria because there's evidence of progressive football, albeit in flashes at times. But woe be to those who yearn for a superior breed of footballer to the affable Afro. Might not be our sole area of concern. But a concern none the less. And has to be highlighted. Because dude can be a detriment to the style of football I grew up watching as United fan, which was the primary reason of me gravitating towards the club in the first place.

2141~~~
He goes on to say he took the easy option in training.

2142~~~
If I remember correctly Ferguson's main gripe with Hargreaves was everything else bar the actually football... I remember him saying he was fine/good when he did play, it was just how it ended (with Hargreaves saying he was treated "like shit") among injuries and what not why Ferguson isn't all that fond of him.

2143~~~
Did well again, really should have scored the header though he was 6 yards out ffs.

2144~~~
He started Hargreaves in the Champions League final his first year here, so I'm not sure Sir Alex considered him a disaster on the pitch... up to that point at least..

2145~~~
I read between the lines and still dont think that means he was awful when fit.

Fergie didnt like him being injured all the time, not cause he was awful when he was on the pitch or sthing. 

Do you have your own opinion on the matter or just go along Fergie's book.

Cause my opinion is that he certainly wasnt awful when fit.

2146~~~
I suspect he's been made some sort of a scapegoat because of his association with Moyes. A lot of negativity towards Moyes has been chanelled his way I feel, which is too bad but he would just have to suck it up. If the rest of our season turns out well and he plays a good part in it then he should break that connection. But til then, the "Moyes is gone, so why are you still here?" sentiment continues to linger.

2147~~~
Quite

I asked myself last season if any of the big European clubs would have him anywhere near the team. Even after a few energetic performances I've not changed my mind.

2148~~~
Wov just wov.

How is that dude detriment to the style of football you grew up watching exactly?

Rest of the post is hard to read too.

2149~~~
Thing is, his style of play has been fine and hasn't looked out of place the last few games. If he keeps up his current level of performance on a consistent basis I see no reason why he shouldn't be a regular starter.

<i>He </i>does look out of place though. He's big and lanky and looks a bit silly and that will forever count against him in the eyes of some.

2150~~~
In football matters I'd actually have to bow to Sir Alex's opinions over mine. Injuries are unfortunate part of football. Sir Alex is not daft to criticise a player due to injuries.

2151~~~
So you dont have an opinion on Hargreaves and was he good when fit?

All right.

2152~~~
His a target man, he can hold the ball up well. 

Strength is fantastic, but anything else he does is clumsy!

He played better against Chelsea but couldn't do what he done to Fabregas with Yaya Toure.

If we had a strong CM he wouldn't be on the pitch, unfortunately Blind, Herrera and Di Maria ain't physical enough for the PL imho and Fellaini has that ability so got game time.

7/10

2153~~~
I can think of atleast 5/6 players who were piss-poor overall (bar small peiods) today.. Fellaini isnt one of them!

2154~~~
Read up the Hargreaves thread to know my opinion.

2155~~~
I'm not so eager to know your opinion on him to read up that thread. 

Anyway its offtopic so carry on.

2156~~~
He rarely gave the ball away & was well capable of passing to feet - with both feet, to keep possession.. 

Well pleased with him today & against Chelsea too. He has mental strength - unlike so many players in our team!

2157~~~
To be fair, with 11 men the first 30mins our midfield with Fellaini were on top, putting Toure on the backfoot.
Neville i think mentioned it to boot, something ala "Defensively Toure doesn't know whats going on right now"
then we lost a man and Toure had license and room to get forward which is his forte, sadly.

2158~~~
Holding the ball up, and being good with his head are qualities more suited to a striker. A midfielder dictates the flow of the game, creates and protects his defence. I'm not sure of the role he plays to be honest.

2159~~~
Which new updated version of the last one is that then?

2160~~~
Sultan, I usually agree with you on football matters, but the difference Fellaini has made when playing over Herrera is huge. we no longer get run over in midfield (at least aginst Chelsea and City). That alone means he should play right now. He might not be the long term fix (I hope he is - I like his style), but right now he brings something our midfield badly lacks.

2161~~~
Am I the only one who thinks the headed chance was not as clear cut as it's being made out to be?

2162~~~
Most of the facets of his game are very good. The main thing he lacks is quick feet meaning he's easy to pressure on the ball. The fact he played for most of last season with a back injury made that look a lot worse than it actually was. Now he's fit again, we're seeing a Fellaini that's easily good enough for the team. He's far from just a clogger.

2163~~~
Would he have been a United player had it not been for Moyes?
Just Google the question "Sir Alex criticises Hargreaves in his book"

2164~~~
We'll never know, buddy. To be fair, the results could have been a different had Herrera played. We know for a fact we did not win any of those last 3 games with Fellaini. Herrera has played against some of the best midfields (Madrid and Barca) without being run over in the past.

2165~~~
It's pretty simple to be fair. For the most part (save the last 3-4 seasons) I'm used to United midfields with proficient passmasters (Scholes, Carrick what have you) and hard-tackling yet technically sound BAMFs who gave 120 % (Keane, Butt). So to witness Fellaini who has numerous deficiencies has become a task of labor. It's just a matter of preference really, I'm not forcing it on you. Personally I just don't appreciate the brand of football he plays. That's one of my biggest gripes with him.

I'm sorry but I don't understand the second bolded part. Do you want me to space the paragraph ?

But see, it's all a matter of relative perception. Some might find it to be fine, I have zero issue with that - hardly ever argue with people who hold that view because it's about personal preference. But even his recent performances are not to my liking in all honestly. Maybe I'm being a bit neurotic but that's just how it is. And it's not just the physical stature of him. Nemanja Matic for one is of the exact dimensions as Marouane but I just love his reading of the game, the subtle movements and overall sense of security he radiates in their midfield.

I just find Fellaini to be the antithesis of what a modern midfielder stands for. You know, things like deft skill, inventiveness, field vision, spacial awareness and so forth. I dunno, maybe I'm being too unrealistic. Should probably retire myself from this thread because a lot of the times people counter with reductive "hater" tags and I think it's a bit unfair. Hardly hate the man. I just don't like the kind of football that he represents.

2166~~~
I'd bring Herrera back in for the Palace game, but Fellaini has been an important player in our two biggest games this season.

2167~~~
That is because we are playing a different formation with a different set of players. With fellaini, we play with wingers to make use of his aerial ability, and with Herrera we played a diamond with all our strikers.

2168~~~
Playing a diamond should lead to us getting overrun less, not more. Not sure I understand your argument.

2169~~~
We were winning the midfield battle today up until Smalling got himself sent off, imagine that? Going to City's place and winning the midfield battle.

2170~~~
i just think you aren't giving him enough credit. He's shown us deft skill, inventiveness, field vision and spacial awareness recently. I could give you examples as evidence for all of these things if you'd like.

You made the Matic comparison but did Matic look like a better player last weekend? I didn't think so.

2171~~~
He played well today but I really dislike this "tactical" plan by LvG which makes him run.into the box even though the ball is near the half way line and Blind is isolated. He is a midfielder and he should target his runs better than to just get in the opposition penalty area every time we have the ball.near the half way line.

2172~~~
Would Smalling, Jones, Cleverley, Djembe Djembe, Kleberson (to name but a few), ever wear the shirt it werent for Fergie?

No need to answer that - points been made!

Fergie & books, i've no interest in. He's just milkin every penny he can get & i'm sick of it - same as Keano. Both hypocrits in their own right & i've no interest what either say in their new book(s) 2.2a,b,c,d versions..

2173~~~
Whether Aguero is a cnut or not is not really the question. 

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OOgeZ2gjlnn/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2174~~~
These 2/3 games are about the best he can do though.  Not a long term idea that looks like a lot of fun.  Really limited footballer.  Awful decisions, average in possession.  Won't hit a ball that well (WBA goal) ever again.

2175~~~
I'm not liking this target man driven football were playing with him.

2176~~~
Maybe so, there could be some truth to you first sentence. fwiw I never liked him at Everton, for Belgium, with Moyes in-charge and now. He doesn't have have ingredients or the X factor for lack of a better word in my estimation. Sorry but I really really really struggle to see those qualities at a high level on any sort of a consistent basis. One flick to Januzaj here and one bit of blocking Matic there isn't enough for me because the overall game leaves a lot to be desired. I know, maybe I'm overly harsh on the fellow but it's best to be upfront about it. He will never be the kind of midfielder I'd like to see at United. To bracket that I'm thinking along the lines of a Martinez or Toure or Alonso, even our own Herrera - players who're conducive to attractive football. I think he's neither very good defensively or offensively or in terms of setting the rhythm from deep but offers a very narrow skillset - mostly pertaining to disruption and aerial presence.

As for the last statement, I'm talking more over a broader sample size. One game does not a worse/ better player make. Surely you'd agree that Matic has been very good in almost all facets of midfield in 9 of 10 occasions since his arrival from Benfica ? For one he's far superior while in possession of the ball, which is what I'd like to see from our midfielders.

2177~~~
Thought he played alright today.

2178~~~
I made this point a lot last season. 

He was decent today though. When you compare his performance at the Etihad in this fixture last season with today's, the difference is staggering. He's much better, it has to be said, but his level was so low to start with that even with this improvement, I still don't think he's of the quality we require. Nor do I think he will ever be. 

Even at his best at Everton in 2012/13 I could see that he was effective when used in a certain way and suited their style, however he was never a footballer I wished we had and I don't think his best qualities suit us.

I hope Herrera comes back in but sub appearances from Fellaini here and there will no longer fill me with dread.

He's still clumsy and nearly gave away a penalty. We are very lucky it wasn't awarded. He ball watches at times when defending set pieces which is a concern as he often has no idea whew his man is. He gives away niggly unnecessary fouls too. However he has some good qualities to go with the concerning ones as well. His passing, whilst simple, is much improved. In midfield he's been better positionally to help win the ball back whether aerially or via an interception and he's shown a lot more desire, fight and application which makes him far more endearing.

Nothing special, but still decent today.

2179~~~
No I should have clarified, obviously general play is a factor and a significant factor. What I implied was he can get away with a less technically proficient display in central midfield, less so than what I'd expect of say Herrera because of the added factor of his height (winning things from set pieces) and generally being a nuisance around the penalty box which at his best he can be (in his own way, despite not being aesthetically easy on the eye)

Having said that he certainly shouldn't be a liability, there are still standards that he should have with regards to passing, positioning, footwork, mobility, defensive work. He's come a lot closer to those standards in the last few games for me (certainly compared to last season). I think if anything more than anything we need to be dominating the midfield with possession due to our vulnerable backline so those standards are even more important now. But having said that if he can be average-to-good in his general play and be an attacking threat I think there is a case for him to start more regularly.

2180~~~
I'm throwing it out there.

I have more confidence in him than Herrera. We just look more solid with him in the side.

2181~~~
I don't understand why people think he is just a hoofball merchant. Plenty of times today he received the ball in the middle held off another played and turned and tried to set up a counter. We were a man short so we were very limited with options. Some of the buildup play he was involved in was very nice.

2182~~~
90% pass completion. 6/8 tackles won. 1 interception. The stats really back up everyone saying he had a good game. It was a proper CM performance. Something a lot of people used to say he wasnt capable of.

2183~~~
I'm not a huge fan of his and would happily have sold him in the summer just gone, but I thought he had a decent enough game today and the last three games are the first time he's built himself any kind of momentum in his United career.

Next week will be interesting to see how he does in a game when hopefully we will have a lot of the ball and be on the front foot, but good luck to him. I hope this is now the start of him proving me, and a lot of others, wrong.

2184~~~
He played well today, again.

I hope Herrera is fully fit and gets to start again next weekend though, even though Fellaini hasn't really done anything that warrants losing his spot. We look far more potent going forward with Herrera - Blind - Di Maria in midfield.

2185~~~
Whenever I see people who say he is ideally suited to West Ham or Stoke it's pretty much implying that he's a long ball merchant as there is a reason why those teams are perceived to have that connotation.

He's a better footballer than that. Not top level but he's good enough to have a go and he's done well since coming in.

2186~~~
Not to mention that West Ham have arguably been playing better football than us this season!

2187~~~
I thought he was alright today but I really don't want him anywhere near the first XI for these big games. 

Defensively he's often slow and lazy not following runners, and occasionally reckless in the tackle. On the ball he's in the centre he's alright in the sense that you'd expect from a CM, but he doesn't offer quite enough - he's a bit Tom Cleverley with his usage of the ball, except probably Cleverley moves it quicker. Fellaini had a couple of nice turns today, but in a game like this you need to have pace to break on the counter. Then you have his attacking threat - he ambles into the box leaving the midfield to work to everyone else and as a team it makes us go more direct than usual with long balls aimed at him. 

For him to justify his selection then he would have to be absolutely dominating in the air but for me he's missing too many headed chances and he's not winning those aerial balls in and around the box anywhere near enough. That's his main weapon and if he isn't providing a huge threat with it, then it's not enough to make up for his lack of ability in other areas.

2188~~~
Given the disaster of last season, one can only credit him for his revival in the past 3 games.  It takes a lot of courage and self conviction to come back from the lewd criticism he has received from critics and even his own fans.  At least he has now plausibly suggested that he can provide a unique option in our squad..  

Now Carrick is also back, and Blind and Herrera are closer to being settled, finally LVG has options in midfield  and can pick bespoke selections deepening on the game.  If Fellaini can continue this, he will be useful next year when we (hopefully) get back into Europe, and so have far more games to play and many different tactical situations to plan for.

Certainly the beginnings for a turnaround in his United career but still many more performances required for that to be a certainty.

<a class="username" data-user="11370, @Sultan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/11370/">@Sultan</a>  I don't think anybody is suggesting we build the team or even the midfield around Fellani, simply that at least he is now making an impact and provides us a different tactical option when required.  Surely that cant be a bad thing, if he can deliver and a manager uses correctly?

2189~~~
Of course not, and most of us did not want him at the club either.

But he's here now and at a considerable cost.  Surely its in our interest to make it work?

2190~~~
He did well again today. One or two times when he ran past City players with the ball, including Toure, like they weren't there. He might not have the quick feet but his long stride gets him out of situations effectively.

2191~~~
could have conceded 1-2 pens, missed a great chance, always gonna be ponderous in possession, encourages the hoofball just by being there

2192~~~
I don't agree with this idea that Fellaini makes us stronger defensively, at all. He hasn't been more influential than Ander, either. He can only play one way which makes us play that way - make him the focal point by playing direct - it makes him seem like he's the main man in the attack, but it's too detrimental to others. Herrera brings the tempo up and it forces everyone else to play quick, and not slow, indecisive football.

2193~~~
His physical presence alone has made the team more solid looking. With what we have defensively at the moment I think we need him, otherwise we just get runover in midfield and the defence shit themselves.

2194~~~
I just think that whilst he individually may be doing whats asked of him well, gets up and wins the ball/makes a nuisance of himself, keeps possession and is tracking back decently he still leaves us somewhat unbalanced and I don't know if he's, or the way we want him to play is bringing the best out of the attacking players. 

I don't think it's actually his fault as it seems tactical but the way we play with him pushing up so quickly just doesn't help us transition play imo. We don't get Di Maria/Januzaj close to the opposition box and then cross because by the time we've gotten the ball past the half way line everyone central bar Blind is at the edge of the opposition box and so the passing options are limited. Typically it results in either someone having to drop back by which point momentum is lost, it goes backwards or it goes wide and Di Maria crosses from very deep.

If we played with him actually holding his position and making a late run in then I think we could get more out of the rest of the players. Just feels that we want him and Rooney who albeit eventually come deeper, but in general it feels we want the two of them really pushing up and it's costing us in terms of build up play. City stretched us by overloading players where the ball is, we overload space which can also work but is a lot harder when the only way to that space is through an aerial ball which means the other team don't have to over-commit players there. 

I'd like to see how Fellaini could operate playing more as a cm and then making the burst in to the box when the time is right, but if he struggles with that, as it is a different skill then when you're the number 10 then unless we need his physicality I'd rather have Herrera there to help bring others in. He might not have the same individual impact but I think he can held bring others in better.

2195~~~
I don't get the posts which are suggesting we played a hoof ball in to the box game today because of Fellaini. He went up for set pieces as you'd expect but his more advanced contributions today and vs Chelsea were as part of a fluid, interchanging attack. He's played box-to-box in these two games but more so defensively being one of the two players who had the job of starting our attacks.

2196~~~
I thought he was quite poor for the majority of the match, though showed plenty of strength in the final 15 mins when we pretty much tried to launch every ball his way.

Pussied out of the duel with Demichelis when Rojo ended up getting injured, gave the ball away for the situation that 2 sec later ended up with Smallings brain fart, lucky to not award Manchester City a daft penalty. Too slow on the ball, too clumsy.

2197~~~
people here are like Fellaini is good , starting to feel he is better than Herrera. What the actual fcuk? I am pleased for him but he needs to do much more, he could have been a villain after clear foul on Aguero. Herrera was our best player since he came to the club. He just had one average match against chelsea when he was rushed back from injury. And we changed formation a little. Fellaini took his chance and thats why he is playing now. Herrera is twice footballer fellaini is, say what you want. Fellaini is palying his 6/7 premier league season or more Herrera did brilliantly okay to settle in and only unlucky injurries hold him back. Apart that one half he was the most influential player more influential than dimaria and once he comes back he will be starting again. I would it him in to side with fellaini maybe next time...

2198~~~
Played really well. Should have scored and given away a penalty though.

2199~~~
He's done what he was brought in for. We've been solid and tough to penetrate against the best two teams in the league. He's shown he's a valuable option for us, something many were loathe to admit a couple of weeks ago. There's still issues but to try to clearly define them on the back of that pantomime of misfortune and stupidity seems a pointless pursuit to me.

2200~~~
Fellaini played well, but we sacrifice our style and offesnive football for that. With Herrera, we were more fluid and created a lot of chances, but were more open at the back. With Fellaini, we are more solid, but we dont create anything. We kick a lot of times the ball towards him and hope for the best. I dont know what that means for our long term future under van Gaal.

2201~~~
It's cringeworthy the lengths people are going to downplay his performances. Talking as if we are playing route 1 football to him all the time. It's just not the case.

Maybe once or twice we aimed a cross or long ball to him, but why not use his aerial abilities to our advantage now and then?

2202~~~
Once or twice? Did you watch the same match as the rest of us?

Di Maria is being wasted turning him into a long ball merchant aiming at Fellaini's head.

If the ref had given their penalty then Fellaini wouldn't be getting any praise, he got lucky this time but he never seems to learn.

2203~~~
Another promising performance against another good side.

2204~~~
Probably because if he didn't it would have been a potential broken leg. Demichelis came sliding in with a high foot - it could (probably should) have been a f.k. to us.

<span style="font-size: 12px">I was talking to the way Fellaini had a go at him verbally - not the initial challenge. Aguero has a history of stamping on players and leaving the foot in, so I have no issue with Fellaini showing some nastiness towards him. So Aguero being a cnut was relevant for my point.</span>

Absolute nonsense. He has been really good in possession lately and has a decent strike on him.

Me too.

We didn't hoofball and besides we had 10 men, did you expect us to slice them up? Yeah he missed a chance but it's unfair to write him off for that because lots of players miss chances in matches.

2205~~~
We also played against poorer opposition and so it was easier to create chances.

2206~~~
Man of the match for us today imo.

2207~~~
He certainly looks fitter and sharper to me this season.

2208~~~
Maybe i'm crazy but that was his best performance since he was signed, IMO.

2209~~~
Looks like the press are going after him for the spit at Aguero.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2818136/Louis-van-Gaal-defends-Marouane-Fellaini-alleged-spitting-incident-Manchester-City-hero-Sergio-Aguero.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ident-Manchester-City-hero-Sergio-Aguero.html</a>

He got away with the Zabaleta one at OT last season but as usual he seems to have learned nothing.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/marouane-fellaini-faces-a-ban-after-footage-shows-man-united-man-spat-at-man-citys-pablo-zabaleta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/m...-united-man-spat-at-man-citys-pablo-zabaleta/</a>

2210~~~
I don't get it. We are starting to look that we can compete with two of the best teams in the league. Just when our midfield look solid with Fellaini play his part, some just want to pick it apart again.

Herrera-Blind-Di Maria combo couldn't compete (and sometimes overrun) by Sunderland and Leicester ffs!

At least, Fellaini earns his place, and we should give him more chance to see how he progress.

2211~~~
I want to see all four of them play in a midfield diamond, with Falcao and Rooney up top.

2212~~~
This. We have a real backbone now.

2213~~~
We have a midfield now and he's playing a crucial role there. 

But how do we fit in Afropuffs, Blind and Herrera?

2214~~~
A couple of decent games and you'd think he's morphed into Redondo the way some are posting about him. For the record we have never seen a Blind/Di Maria/Herrera midfield trio with 2 wide men in front of them in a proper 4-3-3 so it can't be judged.

2215~~~
He's done well in the last two games, which are two of the toughest opponents he'll face all season. You have to give him credit, because it's due. But it worries me that his mere presence naturally encourages a sizeable increase in long ball tactics. I'm stuck between wanting him to do well, and worrying it's impossible to play him without making our game more reductive by default.

2216~~~
This.
and this.

2217~~~
We have an alternative for midfield formation now. 

If we need more protection to the back four, Fellaini-Blind is a good combo in the centre. Carrick-Blind is another option. For a more attacking approach Herrera can come in for Fellaini or Carrick.

I am intrigued to see a Fellaini-Carrick-Herrera combo behind ADM-Falcao/RVP-Rooney. Not a good balance I must admit.

2218~~~
Fellaini has done a decent job for us the last few matches but this gambit has to come to an end. Herrera is the vastly better footballer and gives us so much more going forward.

If we need to resort to longball at the end, or shut things down, we can always bring Marouane on.

No rocket science degree required for this one, mates.

2219~~~
I dont know if its managers instructions or the player choosing to do it
but i kind of hate that when the balls goes over the half way line he moves up next to the striker
waiting for the long ball. 
Im sure it'll have its place but i kept seeing that for the first 30 mins of todays match and it irritated me.
When he sits in midfield and moves the ball around he does the job really well. Hes even decent at one touch football.
He was probably our best midfielder after we went down to 10 men (all 3 were pretty good imo actually)
The extra height at set pieces and just when the ball comes in for a cross or whatever is a great bonus.
But ...
When your losing a cm and the option of a short pass from the vast majority of the play to have a target man you can hoof the ball up to it just seems like a terrible trade off.
If hes being used like that then i wish we'd play him as a no.10 so when di maria or whoever picks the ball up on the edge of our box, hes up front, available for a quick pass already.
It has its place and that'd be the best way to take advantage of it.
But if hes playing cm i wish he'd stay deeper more often, as he did after we went down to 10 men.

Hes been much better the last couple of games though and he certainly has his uses.
I'd bring herrera back (or as well as) next game tough personally

2220~~~
If Aguero "deserves" nastiness, then what does Fellaini deserve? A fecking medal?? The point is simple - Fellaini is an idiot.

2221~~~
FWIW I was actually laughing at myself yesterday for being impressed with his chest control. He brought the ball down and held it up really well on a number of occasions and in a game where possession is key, it was a very valuable tool.

2222~~~
That red card after two fouls against Sociedad in CL is a fantastic contribution to this collage created by a 12 year old kid. Ladies and gentlemen, the first player ever to get a red card after two yellows.

Di Maria can't play both on wing and in midfield at the same time so we're not going to see it anyway. If anything, it'd be midfield trio like today with Rooney, Blind and Herrera or Blind, Herrera and Mata. With ADM on the wing, just like in last three games.

2223~~~
Best game by quite some distance, looked good and confident with the ball at his feet which was brilliant. Shame he missed the big chance with his head. But although slow (Which will not change) that was his best game by a fair way IMO. Hope that continues.

2224~~~
That's definitely a risk but didn't see it happening against City or Chelsea. Not until we were really desperately looking for a goal, which usually involves big hoofs into the box no matter who's playing. Up until that point, Fellaini was mostly playing the ball on the deck. 

We definitely played long ball football a <b>lot</b> more frequently in the first few games of the season, when Fellaini wasn't involved.

2225~~~
He's playing well but it just shouldn't be at the expense of Herrera, who is clearly a better player, that's my only real issue here.

2226~~~
Was about to bring it up, it looks as if people forgot what kind of turgid shit we were playing with 352 and Evans/Blackett's constant hoofs. 

Yesterday we've reverted to it because we were a man down, City had an advantage in midfield and would intercept most of our passes up front especially when our defence and midfield look horribly disjointed. Moving it like we did yesterday was easily the safest option not to get killed on a counter. Something like this didn't happen against Chelsea where we were chasing the score as well but didn't have to do it with 10 men and a fecking CM in CB.

2227~~~
Herrera <i>should </i>be the better player but didn't show it last time he played. Hopefully that was just due to the ribs though.

2228~~~
He showed it ALL the previous games he played in.

2229~~~
Like Swansea? I don't realy care if Herrera or Fellaini plays, as long as whoever plays does well. But foolish to say that Herrera has always been top class in every performance.

2230~~~
We actually avoided route one quite a lot yesterday. In that 15 minute spell in the second half, most of our good work was done with the ball on the ground. And Fellaini heavily involved.

2231~~~
Thought he was very good. One of our better players. It's obvious his confidence has had a massive boost. Pleased for him.

2232~~~
Somehow had City so pinned in that route one was far from necessary. aaargh a goal from it would have been so great...

2233~~~
Pleased for him, because it benefits our team, but I think that he plays because his styles suits the big games we had and the encessity to add steal in a unbalanced team. By the way, it's going to be interesting to see where he will play when Herrera will be back and when Falcao will start to compete with RVP upfront.

2234~~~
To come back and draw at the Etihad from a goal and a man down would have been huge. And we nearly bloody did it. Fine margins.

2235~~~
It quite clearly was due to the ribs. There's no comparison for me, Fellaini has shown he definitely has his uses but Herrera's a much more complete midfielder than him. In fact, he's our best midfielder (and one of Spain's best last season), I hope he gets put back in the team soon.

2236~~~
I mentioned exactly this. However I think it's manager's instructions as he would not be this dumb to bum rush into the box even when we are down to 10 men.

2237~~~
We'll see if VG agrees with you soon enough.

2238~~~
Herrea, Di Maria and Blind didn't play against Sunderland.

2239~~~
He actually played well against Swansea from what I remember

2240~~~
I find this spitting thing hilarious - if you need suuuuper sloooooow mooootion to try and prove something, it's probably incorrect.

2241~~~
I like his performances this season, looks like he can be a good player for us. Shows he has got come good character that even though fans decided to boo him, he can come back and put in decent performances. Those fans should be ashamed of themselves

2242~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">Well, if a City player had done it to Fellaini I am sure City fans would have had no problem with it because they see Fellaini as deserving it too? One of those images was ridiculous, his sending off in that CL game was poor refereeing. </span>

2243~~~
A good performance again. Held possession well, supported the attack when he could and also made some great last ditch tackles when needed. 

He adds that size and strength we really lacked the last few years. When he went 50/50 with Toure and came out on top, that's exactly what he can bring. Gutted that he missed that header from the free kick, it's usually his bread and butter!. 

The signs are positive though, he is improving every match.

2244~~~
If he finds a regular place in the team than the transition I feared when we bought him - "turning into Moyes Everton", would be complete long after Moyes left. Manchester United should play central midfielders not disruptors who run into the box at every given opportunity. Trying to take advantage due to their size, chesting ability, incesstant kicking and elbowing.

2245~~~
We can't all play like Barcelona mate, we have to play to the strengths of the squad we have here for the moment.

I will say I hope he's not part of our long term plan under LVG as it's a bit embarrassing having him as our main tactic away from home.

Heard our team yesterday was the most expensive prem 11 ever assembled, we should be able to play better football than the type Fellaini leads to.

2246~~~
Yea, how about that stupid elbow? He got a mere yellow for that. That's a straight red.

2247~~~
He is playing well, but we do have a problem that without Herrera and Mata (who doesn't play well, but does create something) we don't create anything upfront, which is a problem. LVG said it, we lost because we didn't score.

2248~~~
Not the point i am making, I am simply saying Fellaini is an idiot. Nothing to do with Barcelona or Madrid in this discussion. I watch other teams as well, not just Barca games.

2249~~~
Agreed. He's doing fine when he has a specific job but he doesnt really contribute enough when it comes to creating and opening up teams

2250~~~
Fellaini did pick up the ball, turn and keep it well though. Yeah we did try go long a couple times, but there's no point in ignoring his aerial ability because it looks less pretty. He's done well in the last three games. I have criticised him a lot, although before he came back, I said I'd give him another chance, a clean slate.

He has done well. Good for him.

2251~~~
I am not saying he is a saint. Definitely needs to keep his elbows down. I am merely saying that Aguero irks me, I do not like him, so to see Fellaini (arguably our most aggressive player) getting stuck into him in a derby pleased me. I am not sure why you are making a big issue about this. Just because I think this doesn't mean I don't see Fellaini's faults.

2252~~~
I don't like Aguero because he's a bloody excellent player for a team we're hoping to compete with. Fellaini played alright but when up against one of the top strikers in the World, you can't be as careless as he was kicking him in the box. I think he loses control of himself when under pressure, it was clearly a penalty although the ref had his view blocked, but then to get in Aguero's face, shouting and spitting, when you know you kicked him is childish and petulant.

2253~~~
I would like to se him, Blind and Herrera.

Or, we play diamond with other players and after we score (at least 2), we switch the system and bring him in to protect the defense.

I am very happy with him in last 3 games and I want him to be part of the squad, but I would not always play him it would depend on whom we play.

2254~~~
Yes when I say I don't like Aguero - that is part of the reason why too. It was a clumsy challenge and could have been given as a penalty. I don't think he did spit, merely shouted which I have no problem with because I think Aguero did go down easily.

Also, these comments about hoofball are incorrect. Looking back over some passing stats and we are playing the same amount (sometimes significantly fewer) long balls than when Fellaini was not in the team.

2255~~~
Last year, Fellaini put in some good performances, more notably against West Brom, Leverkusen, West Ham, but didn't really impress in the bigger games. This year, however, Fellaini has just put in two great performances against arguably the best two leagues in the league; in City and Chelsea, and has arguably been the best midfielder on the pitch on both occasions.

Last season, it was pretty evident his confidence was low (as was the whole teams), he was in and out with injuries, and was playing in a 2 man midfield with Carrick. Since Fellaini has come on and scored that great goal against West Brom, his confidence seems to have shot through the sky, and hasn't looked back since. If he continues with this, and I don't see why he can't, he can be a very useful player for us in years to come. The guys a beast.

If someone has got that tackle he put on Toure I'd be much appreciated. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2256~~~
Nice stat to see. Having Fellaini as an option in attack doesn't mean we become a long ball team. It just means we have Fellaini as an option in attack.

2257~~~
I think he is a decent squad player, but I found he just got in everyone's way yesterday.

2258~~~
Thank feck some of you lot dont run the club.


edit: Also, some of those "elbows" are ridiculous, as is the "spitting" claim yesterday. Its sad to see our own supporters so desperately trying to find flaws in arguably our best player of the last month.

2259~~~
Agreed. 

Maybe he can be a little bit dirty, but isn't that what we were crying out for.

I'm sure there are plenty of freeze frames of Keane and Cantona committing bad fouls, point is he might be a little mad, but he plays for us, I'd rather support him.

2260~~~
We've needed a bit of his type tbh, who the feck would have been scared of the likes of Cleverly, Anderson, Carrick in midfield?
At least they know now not to mess with the Big Fella

2261~~~
The hoofball worked quite well yesterday, looked like there was half a plan to switch him with Rooney to get the lovable mop-top further forward so he can be found with a long-ish ball.  It's not bad as an option (esp with 10 men) but I don't see RVP as being the one to live off MF's knockdowns.  (Keeps him out of our box as well, though).

2262~~~
Its posts like this which demonstrate how clueless some posters are.

2263~~~
Agreed.

Im pretty sure some people dont actually watch our games, they just see Fellaini on the teamsheet and assume that he has spent the entire match in the box whilst De Gea smashes the ball up to him.

2264~~~
As a more neutral question.  Does anyone think we look a bit lightweight when he's not playing.  City & Chelsea both looked to have bigger more powerful sides than us.

Less neutrally, I just don't think he's good enough, regardless of the need for a player to fill that role.  Wouldn't get into any other top side, would he?  Not the best 2 in this League, anyway.

But maybe we need him a little bit, atm.

2265~~~
Yes.

When was the last time (other than the last two games) where we played Chelsea or City (or any other decent team) and didnt just give up the midfield from the first minute? Its been that way for seasons. Finally we had a good showing and actually dominated possession/the game at some stages, and a big part of that was down to Fellaini.

2266~~~
Even as a committed naysayer, it's difficult to argue with that.

2267~~~
I'd much prefer Herrera in his position, and I'm sure that LVG agrees with that too, but that's no reason to criticize Fellaini's contribution over the past few games. He'd be one of the last players I'd criticize right now and if he keeps it up, I'd be happy to see him stay here as a squad option. Fair play to him for stepping up.

2268~~~
I don't think that your conclusion is right.

Fellaini has been good but it's not his physical presence who maid the difference but just his presence, he is an upgrade on Cleverley, in all aspects of the game, which make a big difference, now a less "physical" player, like Herrera would have maid the same job.
For me the difference between the past season and this one is that we didn't surrender the center of the park, and it is a consequence of the "philosophy"<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> and a more balanced midfield than the duo Cleverley-Carrick.

Blind this season is not better than Carrick during the last seasons (except last year) which makes me believe that the set up is probably the reason we haven't been bullied and have been better in possession.

2269~~~
I dont think you can put it down to just philosophy - I doubt SAF or Moyes ever said before the game "ok lads, just ignore the middle of the pitch". Its got to be a result of personnel.

I dont entirely agree with you about Herrera being able to do the same thing - dont get me wrong, I like Herrera, but he doesnt bring us what Fellaini does (and nor does Fellaini bring what Herrera does). Fellaini's ability to win aerial duels in a manner that actually retains possession (ie actually heading the ball to a teammate in space, not just "winning" the header and the ball going straight to their CBs) is invaluable, as is his strength in holding the ball up when required. I cant remember him being dispossesed once in the last two games. When you have that sort of outlet when you can give him the ball and trust him not to lose it, it helps the entire team.

As you said - we havent been bullied, and Fellaini is a big part of that. I cant see Herrera (or anyone else in our squad really) performing the same role that Fellaini played against Fabregas/Matic, and then against Toure.

I imagine that with Herrera we would have given a better showing than most previous seasons anyway - because he is a better player than what we have had in previous seasons, but I cant see him having the same impact that Fellaini did.

2270~~~
What bother in what you are saying is that Fellaini has been good with the ball in feet, not in the air, we didn't used that way, it's his pressing and fast simple passes who helped us, not is aerial prowess.
Fellaini is at the moment playing the same game than his teammates, is not used as an anchor or a bullier in chef.

2271~~~

2272~~~

2273~~~
All right Marouane all right. Just keep quiet and keep performing mate.

2274~~~
Whilst we havent been constantly hoofing long balls to him, his strength the air will naturally come into play over 90 minutes regardless. It was an important aspect of us retaining and winning back possesion that he was able to win the ball in the air in midfield and get the ball to a teammate in space. His very presence in this respect allows him to play his game, bullying the opposition midfield and winning the ball. This doesnt mean that the team is built around him doing it, but rather than it is an integral role in the side (especially against the big teams) and Fellaini does it better than most.

Those who are surprised (not suggesting that you fall into this camp) that he is actually decent with the ball at his feet, are simply those who probably never saw him at Everton and wrote him off the instant he joined United.
Yes, he is good with the ball at his feet, he can shield the ball better than anyone, thanks to his strength, but is also technically competent, and he has shown this on plenty of occassions.

2275~~~
Tbp that dude who posted all the pictures is a Barcelona supporter and he is well qualified to talk about this sort of thing seeing as he has no issues with Luis Suarez.

2276~~~
Touché

2277~~~
Is it me ? But I'm sure fellaini missed 2 headers yesterday coz he couldn't see for his hair .

2278~~~
SSN just said he's got away without punishment for spitting again. Good for us I suppose but sometimes a lesson learned is better than making the same mistake over and over.

2279~~~
What mistake did he make?

2280~~~
Well yeah, he 'got away' with it because he didn't spit.

Same way as I've 'got away' with robbing banks all my life.

2281~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2282~~~
He leaned over Aguero who was on the ground and seemed to spit/ drool onto him. The ball was still in play so I'm not sure what he was playing at but it certainly wasn't smart and if it had been seen by the officials he could have been off.

2283~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You actually think he spat/drooled on him on purpose?

2284~~~
Key thing in bold. I'm not sure why some people on here are so keen to bring his reputation into disrepute in every possible circumstance.

2285~~~
I thought he was really good yesterday, he can look awkward on the ball at times but his one-touch quick passing yesterday I though was great. He worked the ball quick playing some nice 1-2s and was able to work space which he drove into a few times. Keep this up and he can be a very good option.

2286~~~
He was shouting at him and it was a dribble that fell from his mouth.

Not the first player ever to shout at somebody he's suspecting of diving, is he ?

2287~~~
Well it was hardly Rijkaard V Voller but he's taking a needless risk, he got away with the kick in the box, get on with the game rather than stop playing to shout/spit in the strikers face.

2288~~~
He was shouting at Aguero to get up because he felt that he had dived, nothing more, nothing less. We would all rather he got on with the game but there is no way he 'took a needless risk'. Harsh to say the least.

2289~~~
Fellaini was subbed on against Everton and we were dominated after he came on, and no surprise we were playing a diamond in that game. It is down to tactics more than simply replacing one player with another.

Fellaini has played extremely well in the last few games, but anyone tying to suggest that we are better in the past two games simply because of him alone instead of us changing our tactics is simply wrong.

2290~~~
I honestly think him 'looking awkward' is a major factor in some fans not being able to see his quality. He has a strange running style which makes him look like he's lumbering around even though he's actually covering an enormous amount of ground and his proportions (and sheer size) make him look a bit ungainly with the ball at his feet, regardless of what he's doing with it. Refs seem to get taken in by it as well, he gets called up on a lot of stuff smaller players can get away with simply because of his size/strength.

2291~~~
Looks as though he did spit at him.

2292~~~
I still think a fully fit Herrera should be ahead of him in the perking order.

2293~~~
I think the football we played in the QPR game and the 1st half against Leicester was streets ahead of the style with Fellaini in the last two and a half games. He's a good plan B to have but I don't think we're getting the best out of our other players if long balls to him are our gameplan for the off.

2294~~~
As I said in the other thread, I don't think any other player in our squad could have done what Fellaini did in the last two games. Tactics are obviously a factor as well, but Fellaini's individual role against Chelsea and City was (in my opinion) highly effective and unique to him.

2295~~~
Too right

2296~~~
But it clearly isn't!

2297~~~
I don't really see why there has to be a debate of Fellaini vs Ander pn a general basis.

They are obviously completely different players, with completely different skill sets, and who will probably both play a role. Having two such different players for one of the mid positions can be a great strength for us going forward.

2298~~~
I'd argue that the relative lack of thrust coming from midfield has a lot more to do with Di Maria being shifted out to the wings than Fellaini starting over Herrera, as well as the fact that we were playing against  City and Chelsea rather than QPR and Leicester. I don't think Fellaini is 'better' than Herrera or anything, but if the latter had been in the team over Fellaini against Chelsea and City I think we'd have lost both games comfortably.

2299~~~
This is the new Carrick vs Hargreaves debate

All we need is one of the Chief's rants and we're golden

2300~~~
The biggest issue I have with Herrera and Blind is they are lightweight. The midfield needs a physical presence. Ideally we need a combo of Felliani and Herrera.....

2301~~~
This. I prefer Herrera's style and overall personality, but Fellaini has been hugely effective. I believe we won the midfield battle against the two best midfields in the league, and Fellaini was largely responsible for that. A few times he had the beating of Yaya and Fernando. Two very physically imposing players. Herrera wouldn't have shied away, but I don't believe he would have won any physical battles with Yaya or Fernando.

I think a midfield diamond of Blind, Fellaini, Herrera and Di Maria gives us a bit of everything.

2302~~~
People using the QPR game as an example need to look at that in context. Yes Herrera was good and we played through them but realistically, against Matic or Fernando/Fernandinho Herrera wouldn't have had it all his own way.

2303~~~
In those two games, we played a complete different formation to the one we're playing now, so I personally think that's a unfair judgement. I mean, we didn't exactly play brilliantly with a midfield of Herrera, Mata and Blind against West Brom until Fellaini come on and changed the game for us. Also, as for long balls, we played the same amount of long balls against Leicester <b>(75)</b> without Fellaini on the pitch, than we did against City <b>(75)</b> with Fellaini on the pitch. Same goes for QPR <b>(69)</b> without Fellaini and Chelsea <b>(68) </b>with Fellaini, so I think this changing our game plan talk is just a myth, in my opinion. Yes, at times we do look for Fellaini in the box, but I don't think our gameplan has changed. We've used the same philosophy we've been using since the start of the season, i.e split centre backs, playing from the back, etc. That hasn't changed since Marouane has come into the team.

You've also got to realise that we've just played arguably the two best teams in the league, and were arguably the better team in both games, with Fellaini in midfield. Against the 'lesser' teams, I'm hoping that we can continue that and start putting a run of wins together.

2304~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2305~~~
This thread gets really annoying. Fellaini has been pretty good the last few games. Sure, he won't be the best option for some games but he just proved that he can fill in well and match up with he right opposition. 

And he doesn't look as bad with the ball as most think. Reading some comments on here you would think he was Andy Carroll. His technique is actually good for a big man.

2306~~~
Herrera is no pushover. If anything he gets pretty overzealous in the tackles, pushing and shoving.

2307~~~
Yeah, I know, I need to renew my subscription of 442 and buy the latest release of FM.

Meet me in 2 weeks, then I'll show you..

2308~~~
Flying into tackles is not the same thing as being strong on the ball. Herrera does get out-muscled fairly easily. The PL is refereed differently to La Liga and it will take him a little while to get used to the more physical battles. He'll probably also need to put on a bit of muscle. I'm sure he'll get there though.

2309~~~
Do you have a link to the full passing stats?

I'd imagine that we had far more passes in both the QPR and Leicester games so obviously you'll have more crosses and long balls included.

I suspect if we were to look at % of passes that were long balls of our total passes then you'd see a large increase since Fellaini has come in.

2310~~~
It's all fun and games now that he got away with it. But you won't be laughing if he costs us a game doing something stupid next time will you?

2311~~~
He's laughing at your presumption of guilt based on feck all evidence (I presume)

2312~~~
He didn't spat, he just drooled a little bit. 
And who can blame him ? Did you see how close he was from that sexy beast of Aguero ?

2313~~~
<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2314~~~
QPR: Total: 847, Long: 69. Leicester: Total: 475, Long: 67. For our 3 most recent games it has gone:  
City: 473 - 74
Chelsea: 476-68
West Brom: 624 - 77

So QPR yes we had more passes but the Leicester match was basically the same as City and Chelsea.

2315~~~
Interesting stuff thanks, I think it's possible to explain the Leicester game as in the 2nd half we had very little control of the game at all. We were literally clearing the ball with every touch.

2316~~~
Since Fellaini has really only played two matches this season (full ones) it's hard to get a fully accurate picture. It'd be worth revisiting later on in the season. I am fairly sure it is merely a perception though. I mean, sure we might play a few more (it's natural as he is a target) but not enough for people to start calling us a hoofball team.

2317~~~
He's been very good recently, and he's a useful player to have for some games, but the Aguero penalty incident sums up why he'll never be a top player here for me. He does tremendously well to see off the danger and then makes a ridiculous tackle which should have been a penalty. He's just incredibly stupid at times and I think he lacks the game intelligence required. The annoying thing is he does have all the tools, despite the criticism, he's actually rather good technically, he can tackle, he's strong, and he's mobile, in theory he could be a tremendous DM, but positionally he's poor and he regularly lets runners go, and as much as I've liked him recently, I don't think he's the sort of attacking CM that should be playing regularly for a top side. I certainly don't want him sold but I also don't want to see him starting every week, but then according to Moyes he was never signed to play every week.

2318~~~
Yeah, I think that's fair. I always thought he was a better player than we saw last season and think we're seeing much closer to what Moyes hoped he would produce in these last two or three games. There are fundamental flaws in his game which are a worry, though and you've summed them up very well. A decent option to have, though, and maybe a season or two with the benefit of Van Gaal's apparently stellar coaching can help iron out these flaws? He's still only 26 after all.

2319~~~
Are people really comparing QPR and Leicester to City and Chelsea?

2320~~~
I'm maybe misinterpreting but last season he wasn't bad technically or physically, he was bad positionally and very naive tactically which is exactly Fellaini is good in almost everything except the use of his brain, even in the last three game he is regularly pressing too high or too far from is zone.
I don't think that he stupid so despite his 26 years old, he may still be able to fix his tactical deficit but until then he won't be the ideal option.

2321~~~
It would help paint a better picture if Chelsea and City didn't play like cowards.

2322~~~
Am I the only one who didnt think that was a penalty?

There was contact, no doubt, but sufficient to cause Aguero to go down like that? He could have very easily carried on playing, but he was looking for the first opportunity to go down. If it was any player other than Fellaini, I doubt there would be half as much attention on the "incident".
I suspect that if it were another player, there would be far fewer folk on here so adamant that it was a penalty.

Same with the so-called spitting... the only footage seems to be about 2-3 frames showing some saliva coming from Fellaini's mouth. I have yet to see a proper replay of it in real-time. When watching it live, it was obvious to me that he was simply shouting at Aguero - but someone or other managed to slow it down to find one frame where you can see saliva, and suddenly all the rag-tops are all over it. Sad.

2323~~~
Do you not think that some of that instruction may come from LVG?
Same with the accusations about him getting into the box too much... do you think that is really Fellaini's decision, or the manager telling him to get into the box and utilise his aerial strength?

2324~~~
I don't think he spat on him but kicking someone, hard, in the back of their ankle should always be a penalty.

2325~~~
It should have been a pen but I couldn't tell when I first saw it, only on the replay.

I don't think the Rojo one was a pen at all.

2326~~~
No i don't, while the runs in the box are, i think, instructions and Fellaini is really good at it. 
The huge gap in the right end of our midfield and the lack of cover for the right back can't be an instruction, the movement are way too erratic to be Van gaal instructions.

2327~~~
Fair enough.

I didnt see this huge gap that you are referring to.
In the Chelsea game he obviously was trying to shut down Fabregas and Matic as much as possible (which he did), in the City game after we went down to 10 men I thought he was very disciplined positionally and defended well on that side.

2328~~~
Against Chelsea he was excellent, but against City before the Chris Smalling Show he was chasing the ball no matter where. Which gave City space on the right 2 or 3 times. But he was still good.

2329~~~
To be honest I didnt notice him especially before the red card (except a lovely pirouette), but in general we seemed to be on top of the game - which when playing City away from home is a rarity - so whatever he was doing, as far as I am concerned it seemed to work.

2330~~~
Thanks <a class="username" data-user="83951, @ZDwyr" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83951/">@ZDwyr</a>. 

<a class="username" data-user="83615, @Manucho the boss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83615/">@Manucho the boss</a>, I got the stats from <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, but you also have to realise that our passing against City and Chelsea were bound to be lower, in comparison to the QPR and Leicester games, as they're better teams. I think it'll be more of a fair judgement to monitor our play style against teams similar to QPR and Leicester. I guess Crystal Palace this week will be interesting as to how we play, especially if Fellaini's in the team.

2331~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> What's with your Mad Winger-like obsession of Fellaini?  Besides the penalty in the box against Aguero, did you not see his wayward header from 8 yards out?  Also, inexplicably gave the ball away when he was leading a break on the edge of City's 18-yard box.  Thought he was okay, certainly not as great as some are making him out to be.  He's a brainless idiot who's a liability as far as giving away penalties are concerned.  But as others have pointed out, what worries me most about Fellaini playing is that it changes our playing style to a hoof-ball team.  Hoping a healthy Falcao, Carrick and Herrera means it's back to the bench for Fellaini.

2332~~~
How many penalties has Fellaini actually conceded in his career?

2333~~~
As others above have pointed out, we've not playing significantly more long balls in the last 3 games than we did in previous games where Fellaini hasn't played. 

The bolded is complete nonsense, and certainly far more biased than anything I've seen <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> post in this thread

2334~~~
He's another that doesn't actually keep his eyes open when the game is on from the looks of things.

2335~~~
Right, I'm imagining Fellaini cocking up our best chance to get a point against City.  Also, fouled Aguero in the box when he caught him from behind which should have been another penalty.  What followed with him yelling at Aguero to get up while knowing he fouled him, is acting like an idiot.  How many elbows and times he's out of position defensively will it take before you realize that he's actually brainless?

Got a good chuckle out of that, then realized you were serious.

2339~~~
You were having a go at Walrus for being the 'Mad Winger of Fellaini', but when people point out <b>your</b> bias its worthy of a sarky comment? Very consistent logic there.

Any chance of you responding to the part in my post that called out your factual inaccuracy? Or if you like you could just ignore the facts and keep on being sarcastic, it'd be a shame to break the habit of a lifetime after all.

2340~~~
I wasn't "having a go" at Walrus because he was "biased".  It's an internet forum, after all.  Everything here is based on people's opinions.  Simply curious why he's such a fan and ardent defender of Fellaini.  As for factual inaccuracy, a sample size of two games is hardly conclusive.  I'm not saying that his style of play doesn't serve a purpose, but I don't think it's a long-term solution or what we should aspire to.  We've got better players to play in forward positions as well as midfield than Fellaini.  Or did you miss his wayward header from 8 yards out that went like 10 yards wide?  Not sure what you mean about being sarcastic and breaking lifetime habits, do we know each other?

2341~~~
Yep, still clueless.

2342~~~
<a class="username" data-user="63291, @jeff_goldblum" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/63291/">@jeff_goldblum</a> and <a class="username" data-user="83693, @Shamwow" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83693/">@Shamwow</a> have already sufficiently retorted to this, in my absense - but ill bite nonetheless.

You strike me as one of those who made up his mind very early about Fellaini and as such will criticise him regardless of what he does.

Last season Fellaini was poor, but you know what - the entire team was poor. Furthermore he had no preseason with us, spent the start of the season playing with a wrist injury (which later required surgery), and is also very strongly associated with Moyes.

If it were another player, this season would have been seen by the fans as a chance for a "fresh start", slate wiped clean and all that. When we signed Berbatov on deadline day, the fans had huge amounts of patience (for the records, I was against the Berbatov signing at the time) for the same reasons, but with Fellaini there is an inherent hatred for him, which your post is a typical example of.

The notion that Fellaini = hoofball has already been put to bed by the stats. To add some more to this though - our last two games were against the best two teams in the league. Of course we arent going to be able to pass it around to the same extent as we can against relegation fodder.
Also, in both of these games we have found ourselves behind - it is standard practice, Fellaini or not, that when you are chasing a game you are more direct - you get the ball forward and try to get a goal back. This is normal.
Consider the above, and then consider that we actually didnt play any more long balls in the last two games, than we have done previously, and what does that tell you?

To conclude, not only are you wrong, but you arent even attempting to logically argue why you arent wrong, which is one of the worst types of wrong.



Edit:
With regard to this - I am not an ardent defender of Fellaini, I am simply disgusted by the inability of a lot of so-called fans to even give the man a chance. He dominated our midfield more than once when we played against Everton, and he did the same to other big teams. LVG has brought him into the side for the last 2.5 games and he has been arguably our best player during that period. What more can he do?
If it were any other player, the fans would be singing his praises and hailing him as a revelation, yet because it is Fellaini, even now there are a lot of people (like you) who simply refuse to give credit where credit is due.

The ironic cheers he got in preseason were for me, one of the lowest and saddest things I have been witness to as a United supporter. Fellaini has not really done anything to be targeted with such vitriol and insults. Fortunately LVG is a bit more pragmatic and seems to see (and utilise) Fellainis strengths and attributes.

2343~~~
I checked up and he has commited 2 fouls that led to penalties during his time playing in the Premier League. Can't find anything for national or cup stats though.

2344~~~
I can't deny that I do see him as a rather limited, borderline dirty player (elbows, anyone?) unsuited for the likes of us.  His best attribute (chest control) is more useful for teams that hoof the ball up to him in the box.  Everyone here would have been screaming for a penalty if that was him (ca Everton days) fouling Rooney or RVP instead of Aguero.  But fair enough, let's let the season play out and see how he does.
Reckon I can live with this.

2345~~~
He's doing a good job at the moment. Glad to see him doing well at last.

2346~~~
I honestly didnt think it was a penalty. There was contact without a doubt, but not sufficient to have any impact if Aguero had chosen to stay on his feet. Aguero was looking for it and went down as soon as he felt a touch.

2347~~~
Most strikers, bar possibly Messi, would have gone down there.

2348~~~
That is my midfield of choice from the current squad.  Rooney and Falcao if fit up top.

2349~~~
He concedes one penalty a game along with his two red cards per match.

2350~~~
It was as blatant a penalty as you'll see.

2351~~~
Has he actually conceded a penalty for us? Maybe he has and it's not instantly coming to my mind. Yep, he should have had one given against him the other day, but this comment is just absurd!

2352~~~
I'll take the Mad Winger position with regards to Fellaini. I have no issue being his #1 supporter because I like the guy. Although, I'm not <i>completely blinded </i>by his flaws. Just to add to the post from Walrus, he was also playing with a back injury last year (as well as the wrist). He definitely deserved a clean slate but the fact he didn't get it and has worked to win some over makes me admire him even more. It's frustrating that the hoofball perception and the 'gives away penalties every game perception' exists, because really they are not entirely accurate.

2353~~~
Not following you, mate. Probably want to start again.

2354~~~
A criticism I have of Fellaini during his last two (very good) games is that when we decide to go direct, he is taking up positions that are not going to hurt the opposition, he is usually taking up spots on the corner of the box. I don't know if it's an instruction from van Gaal or not but he should be right in the middle looking to score. The one time from memory where he did get into a good area between the posts he had the chance against City, yeh it was a pretty bad miss at the end of the day but you could see just how dangerous he can be in that area. I don't see the idea of these knock downs when he might as well knock it into the net if he moves 10 metres closer to goal.

2355~~~
That's twice in 2 days, man. It was okay the first time, but this time, it hurt. It really hurt, man..<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2356~~~
Good god man, this ain't the newbies. Anyway think we disagree a great deal on Fellaini.

2357~~~
How many penalties did he give away for us?

Now, how many penalties did Rafael, Jones and other players give away for us? Are they all brainless idiots as well? Mind you that besides Fellaini's penalty in that match they should've been given two more: one by Carrick and another one by Rojo. Another two brainless idiots?

And Jesus no, it doesn't fecking change our playstyle to hoof no matter how much you'd like to insist so. Were we playing hoof against Chelsea too? Maybe the hoof tactic we reverted to against City was solely down to the fact that we were down to 10 men? It's a bunch of shite cliches thrown into the air again.

And is the missed header everybody seems to be whining about the one when the ball bounced off his shoulder?

2358~~~
No doubt, at times Rafael and Jones have been reckless and hurt us in the past with stupid penalties that make you go "wtf was he thinking?"  Rojo is another one that I can see costing us 3 points with a stupid penalty.  But you're right, I certainly wouldn't classify them as brainless idiots, maybe brain-dead at times.  They're also defenders and offer us plenty in terms of skill and talent.

Perhaps "brainless idiot" was a bit harsh.  Fellaini's never been a player that I wanted at United in the first place, so maybe that "bias" does carry over.  I feel that he's clumsy, immobile, borderline dirty, and doesn't possess the requisite technical skills for what playing in our midfield should require.  I mean someone put up a clip of Fellaini with a nice, little turn in the City game.  Harldy Zidane-esque and something most Premier League midfielders should be able to pull off in their sleep.  I understand the desire to add steel and aggression to our midfield, but not at the expense of actual footballing ability.  I remember long stretches of the Chelsea game where he was getting bypassed and wasn't involved at all.  And yes, the missed header against City is the one that he so badly misjudged it ended up going off his shoulder.  And after that no-call penalty against City, was there really a need for him to go and yell at Aguero like that?  Stupid shit like that pisses me off.    

And I never said that we were playing hoofball, I said I was worried that having Fellaini in there would be too tempting to eventually resort to hoof tactics.  Especially when we're down.  Most would agree Fellaini's best position (up front as a #10) and attributes (chest control, height) are best-suited for hoofing it.  Although maybe it shouldn't be too much of a concern, as I do have faith in LVG to prevent that from happening.

I do hope that Fellaini finds success here, as I would for any United player.  It's just that I have my doubts and hope that he doesn't negatively impact us in terms of results and opportunity cost.  Having said that, I do think I'll take a little break from this thread as I don't want to appear overly negative, and I've said what I wanted to say.  To which most of you have clearly disagreed with. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2359~~~
Do you mean like crosses or long balls from deep? On long balls from deep I think it is better to go for a knock-down as it is extremely hard to get enough power and direction on a header from a long-ball. 

On the other side when defending corners/wide free-kicks I think his marking is poor. If the ball comes into his area he has a good chance of winning it but he seems to lose his man in the box quite often.

2360~~~
I think you're a tad harsh on Fellaini in this context. While, for me, the jury is still out as to whether or not he is good enough (overall I don't think so to be honest) but I'm willing to give him a chance after his last few performances. Maybe with a bit of confidence he will start to show something. 

The header though, that's very harsh. I think I mentioned it in an earlier post but I don't think people realise how hard it is to get just such a deft touch on the ball with your head, when it's whipped in like that, while you're running, evading a marker, and having to stoop. He knew he could barely touch it, and that's what he was going for, a glance. He misjudged it by millimetres I reckon, so it's very harsh to simply say "Oh look, it came off his shoulder, terrible". 

As for the penalty - yeah, it was probably stupid to start roaring at him ... but tell me this, have you ever had a fright and then just roared in an aggressive manner, out of shock? I know I have. I'd imagine Fellaini damn near pooed his pants! He knows he's walking a tight rope with United, especially with a majority of the support, and he knew he'd realistically given away a penalty. Fright, followed by relief, followed by a silly reaction alright ... but I can kinda understand it.

I think everyone agrees that they don't want his success, if he gets it, to come at the cost of watching United play hoofball .. and I personally don't think that's going to happen. That's not Van Gaal's way, never has been, and can't see him changing that now. I"m with you on the doubts regarding him, but hopefully next time you're back on this thread, it's to admit that you & I have both been wrong.

2361~~~
I couldnt care less if one of our players has a go at an opponent. As long as he isnt doing something that is going to get him booked - absolutely, put the fear of god in Aguero or whoever else.

We had images of Rafael standing up to Tevez and shouting at him and Rafael was (rightly) lauded as a hero for it - but Fellaini yells at Aguero and suddenly it is stupid behaviour?

2362~~~
Rafael is el loco so it is alright.

2363~~~
Watching Aguero dive again tonight reaffirms my belief that it wasn't a pen (against us) and Fellaini was in his rights to have a go at him.

2364~~~
Agree. There was contact, but Aguero clearly goes down easily. I'm not a fan of penalties for marginal contact.

2365~~~
Fully agreed. 

I'm of the opinion that contact, especially if minor is not always a foul. 

Conversely, I also do believe that in some situations there doesn't have to be contact for there to be a foul. If a player swipes and misses and the player gets out the way of the swipe for fear of injury its a clear foul.

2366~~~
Good Lord. It was a blatant penalty.

2367~~~
It's possible for there to be a foul and a dive.

Which is what happened. Fellaini gave Aguero a kick (foul) then Aguero flung himself on the ground (dive)

2368~~~
Nah it wasn't a foul. Aguero went down too easy.

2369~~~
He offers nothing in games like this, apart from the option to punt it up to him for a knockdown. Which is horrible to watch.

How he's keeping Hererra out of the team is beyond me.

2370~~~
? Thought he was one of the better players, always tried to pass forward, did that many at times, was calm, had high pass accuracy, threat in the air, and brought the ball to the ground often. Solid performance by him.

2371~~~
He's been good in recent weeks but had a weak game today. If he's to play that box to box role against sides like Palace then the onus is on him to actually create chances and influence the game in an attacking way. He didn't really do anything today.

2372~~~
He was okay, nothing wrong with his performance yet still some of you criticise him.

2373~~~
I lost count of the number of times he played it immediately back to the CBs who had passed it to him. But for his hair, I would have thought of him as Cleverley.

2374~~~
Meh, said it before the match that those three ( Fellaini, Rooney, Carrick ) spell danger in midfield. He's looked far better when Blind was finally moved into midfield, that's not reall a disrespect to Carrick or so but those two don't seem to work all that great together.

2375~~~
He's a waste of a player in a game like this. Offers nothing.

2376~~~
This.

2377~~~
That's the problem. He was OK. We need someone in midfield who can open up defenses which sit as deep as Palace did today. And for a player who plays as high up the pitch as Fellaini did for us today and has been doing of late, he created zilch.

2378~~~
I don't really think there is anything really wrong with his performance but the team as a collective seems to be a lot slower and lot less creative with him in the team.

2379~~~
Then maybe start with dropping Rooney who's made less forward passes than Fellaini ?

Not to mention that Rooney's constantly spraying thos fecking balls to the wings, Jesus Christ.

2380~~~
Yeah when was no movement in front of him, especially during our zombie moments, but if we raised up the tempo a bit and when he got the ball in oppositions half, he played the ball forward.

2381~~~
It was van Gaal's decision to play him, so Fellaini hardly deserves criticism.

2382~~~
Saw his limitations today, although he kept possession well he only plays easy passes and although his physical presence was an asset what he offers as a cm isn't enough in terms of his range of passing and creativity and really he is only going to affect the game by getting on the end of a cross or set piece. It's not his fault but we needed a playmaker in there today to play the passes to open palace up, if affects the movement up front because players know they need to get close to him if they want the ball.

2383~~~
What sort of absurd logic is this? Should we criticise no players, then?

He should never be playing home fixtures like this. He offers nothing but a hindrance in our play.

2384~~~
Rooney and Fellaini is an awful midfield. Neither have the technical ability to play there at high level. Actually thought he was better than Rooney today but both were poor. Not much in it.

2385~~~
If a player doesn't play well though, they deserve criticism. It's the managers decision to play anyone, that's his job.

2386~~~
Rooney's got plenty of technical ability; it's just that it's both erratic, and is suited to a more attacking role than in the midfield.

2387~~~
Rooney is not a midfielder and yet he does a better job at it than Fellaini. Says all there is to say. Fellaini was OK and I am not saying he was awful but he provided no impetus to our play, something we need in games like these

2388~~~
Complete over exaggeration.

2389~~~
I agree. It has to be one or the other with Carrick and Fellaini.

I'm pleased with Fellaini's performances though. Great ball retention and he wins all the physical battles. As much as I prefer Herrera, he wouldn't boss the midfield like Fellaini has been doing. I'd like to see them both put into the same midfield if possible. Blind, Fellaini, Herrera and Di Maria as a midfield gives us a bit of everything.

2390~~~
From Blind, Herrera, Di Maria to Fellaini and Rooney.

Utterly depressing.

2391~~~
As soon as Fellaini doesn't produce great performances like he did against Chelsea and City, people will start getting on his back again like today. Wasn't great by any means today, but he was far from poor like some are saying.

2392~~~
How did we do with those in midfield?

2393~~~
He doesn't though, that's the problem. I've already told you that Rooney did less forward passes than him and merely a couple more passes overall than him, he did less defensive job and I assume that ran less kilometers as well ( that's just me guessing though, mind ). He didn't get an assist, created two real chances one of which was Fellaini's header and had a two or three shit shots. He's the #10 in that trio while Fellaini is the box to box #8.

It's about the time we stop with that idiotic formation and playing those players together. Move Rooney up front and get Mata in his place.

2394~~~
Its a horses for courses approach.

Palace were sitting deep and we were not crossing it to him so Fellaini could not get involved into the game as much as the last 2.

2395~~~
Fellaini should only be used against the big team and off the bench as a last resort.He had an ok performance today but I feel Herrera would have offered much more penetration.

It simply wasn't his type of game today.When you have 72% possession you want some who can break through the defense and create a chance.Mata and Herrera are these type of players Fellaini is not.

2396~~~
Better then we've done without them.

2397~~~
He was fecking awful. Like the whole midfield.  

Not a fan of him but he didnt stand out by any means.

2398~~~
The issue is that we need someone with a blend of Fellaini's physicality and Blind's possession play. Blind gets pushed off the ball way too much and puts us in terrible positions but we can't rely on Fellaini to keep the game ticking. If we find a player like that (who can stay healthy) then we finish top 3. If not, I would at least replace Blind with Carrick once our CBs are healthy and revert to the 4-3-3 variant.

2399~~~
Was shite. Hopefully gets dropped. He's good for bringing down long balls and heading it... About it. On the ball, passing wise, he's just not very good and so many times he could have done a quick pass forward to RvP, he just passed it back.

2400~~~
This comment about Rooney is so ridiculous. He did play those balls a few times alright. But hey, let's kill him for getting the ball to a free man on our team, in a wide attacking position. 2 of the supposedly creative players in the team in Januzaj and Di Maria, both of whom were poor today. But yeah, let's bash Rooney for getting the ball to them just because they did nothing with it. Such an overwritten silly comment on this forum.

Fellaini was ok today. I thought we should have brought on Herrera alright, Fellaini just doesn't really suit these games, he's not really going to create much. Thought he was ok in what he did, and when people are saying all he did was pass the ball back, I disagree. I think Blind does that a hell of a lot and it doesn't get mentioned, and I actually thought Fellaini at least tried to beat his man on a few occasions - admittedly he made a balls of it each time, but at least he tried.

2401~~~
Am I the only one who thought the midfield did fine today? 

We dominated the game until we got into the final third which is where things broke down. Van Persie, Di Maria and Januzaj offered nothing whatsoever all game and the movement up top was poor. 

But yeah, let's have a go at Fellaini who while not great, had a decent enough game. Some lazy opinions in here.

2402~~~
People just have set opinions on him. Its really pathetic. He did not have a bad game, he was solid and ok, nothing to scream about, but because he was not putting in a outstanding performance he is criticised. In reality he was probably our 4th best player among a very average performance.

2403~~~
Was poor but so were a lot of our players.

Isn't particularly suited to these sort of games, should be on the bench.

2404~~~
Van Gaal thinks otherwise.

2405~~~
Fellaini is not playing badly, he's done well, however his limitations as a player affect the entire side. Fellaini simply isn't capable of quickening the pace of our play in midfield, his first touch and ability to run with the ball are nothing to shout about. Its a bit unfair to him, because Fellaini has been putting in good performances recently, but I feel he should be dropped because that will allow us to play differently.

2406~~~
Bingo

2407~~~
I think he'll still start against Arsenal to bully their midfield of soft lads. Then I expect Herrera to come in for him vs Hull.

2408~~~
Absolutely. People calling him awful, woeful today just have an agenda. He was ok. Did some good stuff, some bad, like basically everyone out there.

2409~~~
Ah right, so we must all agree with what LVG does. All those calling for RVP to be dropped must be wrong, because LVG doesn't agree?

2410~~~
When people say he's not suited to 'these type of games', would they class the West Brom game as 'those type of games', when he come on and changed the game for us?

2411~~~
How can he quicken the play when he has statues in front of him? He was linking up with Januzaj a few times now there is someone who was slowing down the play. A few times Fellaini made the pass to Januzaj and could have had the return but Januzaj just stopped, let the defenders get into position and then lost the ball pretty much every time.

2412~~~
It's just people talking in cliches. Lazy opinions.

2413~~~
This.

2414~~~
Nah, most of the criticism is fair today. I've defended Fellaini a fair bit over the past year, and he's a better, more threatening player than that. That box to box role is an important one and he really has to turn the screw when in there.

2415~~~
No, this comment about Rooney is not ridiculous, our wingers have been <b>shit</b> since we've switched to 4141, if a man that's responsible for dictating our forward play doesn't fecking see it and keeps spraying it to the wings which is an easy option to pick ( even more easy than a bloody sideway passing ) then he's simply too thick to play #10. That's the difference Mata brings. People can go talking shit all they want how he's not involved in game and other bullshit but the difference he's made when on the pitch was immense. He's kept it through middle even though he was deployed on the wing. Many times he's came for the ball and instead of playing it to the wing like Rooney did the whole match, he kept it in the middle, slowed down the play when necessary rather than forcing it to Adnan or ADM who were losing duels and putting us on counters, same shit happened against City last week.

Blind was mostly playing as a CB today, switched to CDM around the time we scored the goal. It's vital for him to keep it simple and backpass, play it safe, without idiotic risk. It's the players like Rooney and Mata who we should expect better forward play from. Rooney doesn't bring that in the #10 role in this formation.

2416~~~
I think now that we have Carrick back, Fellaini should play more from the bench, come on late in the game and try and make an impact.

2417~~~
No he didn't. He defended very well and put in more tackles than Fellaini despite being the #10 in the formation. Fellaini, as a box-to-box, provided no real impetus going forward and was pretty useless in our attacks apart from being a target man.

2418~~~
I'm not saying you have to agree, but he must be doing something right if Van Gaal is continuing to pick him.

2419~~~
He put in 0 tackles, congratulations, not even a failed one.

And yea as said, Rooney did close to feck all going forward too, even passing wise for which Fellaini is often criticised for.

2420~~~
Apart from RvP, Di Maria and Januzaj who were shit; the rest of the outfield cast put in bang average performances. All were equally mediocre. At least Carrick/Blind have the excuse for being out of position, Fellaini was played in his preferred position and was nothing special. Only problem is he does put in his 6/10 performances which should not be the standard we should be happy with.

2421~~~
How many successful tackles/blocks did Fellaini put in? Genuinely curious 'cause I cannot remember any one particular moment.

2422~~~
He should be played in a very specialized role , against big teams to mark their midfield playmaker ala the job in fabregas. He should but be starting home games against the likes of palace .

2423~~~
I'd agree. If Carrick can find some of his better form, he's a much better option to have in midfield than Fellaini.

2424~~~
To some extent that's a symptom of the system, if I were picking the team Januzaj would not be in it either. Our best players like to play two-touch football, they pass and move, Fellaini for all his strengths does not provide that. If we were playing to fit our most talented XI we'd go back to the diamond and put Di Maria in alongside players he can play triangles with like Herrera. I recognise that Herrera is probably still half fit but after the international break we need to get him back in the side so we can be more fluid in our build up.

2425~~~
Rooney didn't do that the whole match. He did it a few times. Yes, our wingers have been poor - so what? You just completely stop using them? Effectively turning our team into a 9 man team? Sounds like a sensible approach alright! Saying he did it all match .. well that really shows you have an agenda against him. He did it 4 or 5 times I'd say. Also saw him trying to play Van Persie though at times, and them linking up, maybe you missed that? 

Mata, yeah he did well when he came on. But he was absolutely terrible in the recent 3 games he started in there, so I can understand why he has been left out lately.

I know where Blind was played.  But I mean in general, when he has played CM for us he plays the ball sideways about 90% of the time. I like him, he's a tidy little player, so I'm not using that as a criticism of him. I just think it's unfair to then use it as a criticism of Fellaini. Who, incidentally I saw try plenty of forward passes and try to beat his man at times. But people will only see what they want to see.

2426~~~
One failed and one succesful tackle, 6 clearances, 7 won and 6 lost aerial duels, 1 interception.

2427~~~
Fellaini is perfectly fine at one and two touch passing.

In fact what usually happened would be that he played the pass, move for the return and not get it from Januzaj.

2428~~~
He did OK. Again the fact that for 45 minutes we had Di Maria wasting corners, and Valencia doing his usual "smack against the first mans shins" tricks it doesnt really help Fellaini.

In the first half Januzaj, ADM and Valencia wasted every opportunity that we had out wide. In the second half when we had a couple of decent crosses/corners, Fellaini looked threatening

He arguably should have had a penalty when the defender had him in a headlock, and it was Fellaini's layoff which set us up for the goal.

Basically, he wasnt outstanding but he contributed more than several players did (including RVP, Rooney, ADM and Januzaj). Most of the criticism strikes me as unjustified.

2429~~~
Not quickening the play isn't a criticism of him it's just his passing is a limitation, the movement isn't great but that happens when the midfield lacks creativity and a limited passing range. Players know he only plays short simple passes so when he has the ball that's what they look for, if it was scholes on the ball you would see players making completely different ones. He did ok today but he is a limited player there is no escaping that and those limitations affect the team, he isnt' the only one but it is true.

2430~~~
It's shite like this that makes me realize you haven't watched much of Fellaini at all....

2431~~~
He's ok at it, however he's nowhere near as gifted at it as Herrera, Di Maria or even Blind. His touch lets him down a lot, his ability to run with the ball simply isn't very good, and if you want to get a passing carousel going he's not the guy you'd trust to start it off.

2432~~~
Sorry but you're talking bollocks. You're blaming the lack of movement on him?!

2433~~~
He should be dominating the aerial duels given his height. As I said, he did OK. What are his stats in terms of chance creation/through balls/defense splitting passes (or whatever fancy term that's used)? That is what I am really interested in knowing.

2434~~~
I don't give a shit if people call agenda, I thought he was very poor today unless the ball was in the air, nowhere near good enough with the ball at his feet and lacks mobility, compared to Matic he's miles away from what a top side needs from it's powerhouse CM.

2435~~~
I'd put Fellaini on the same level as Blind passing wise.

2436~~~
He has one of the best first touches in our squad. Obviously Herrera and Di Maria are better at the little passes since they are completely different type of players.

2437~~~
He's a decent footballer. Adds height and physicality to the side. But obviously someone you wouldn't ideally want as first choice.

2438~~~
Probably shit but I can't think of a single defence splitting pass anyone in the team made so to focus on him is bollocks. Who would he have made a defence splitting pass to exactly? The movement up top was shit, that's the problem as far as I'm concerned.

2439~~~
Yup, that's me having agenda against Rooney. Man known for spraying it to the wings in every single match. I've said that he's created two real chances - one was near the end to RVP and the other one was from the corner for Fellaini. RVP and Rooney had less than 11 passes between themselves so they hardly 'linked up with each other', bar that one good chance really and probably a couple of worthless passes. So yea, I wish I had a chance to miss this fantastic link up play but sadly there was close to none for me to miss.

And Mata being 'terrible' is just another repeated ad infinitum cliche I can't be bothered with, sorry for that.

2440~~~
Did well, will defo start against Arsenal.

2441~~~
I'd agree with you that I don't think in the long term he is a good enough midfielder to be playing regularly for us, if we have designs on being a top side again. But I didn't think he was very poor today. He was average, didn't really mess anything up of note in a huge sense, neither did he do much bar the one header.

2442~~~
I strongly disagree. His chest control is very good. His trapping of balls along the floor leaves a lot to be desired, especially when he tries to run with the ball.

However, I go back to my main point: He has been playing well, but not so well that a system that would bring the best out of better players should be ditched to keep him playing.

2443~~~
He's created 0 chances if you're asking. Rooney created two. I think it was rather easy to count throughout the game as we've made very little things going forward and that seems to be both mine and yours problem. Thing is that we look at the source of this little creation in two different players - you in Fellaini, me in Rooney.

2444~~~
<a class="username" data-user="4006, @TheGame" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4006/">@TheGame</a> I am going to be clueless again today, my man. 

If he keeps on getting starts in the midfield, than the transition we all feared under Moyes, would be complete.

2445~~~
So .. 5 passes sprayed out to the wings, of 27? All of them successful? One unsuccessful if you count the one clipped up the line.

So .. was Mata miles better than Rooney in his 3 games as number 10? Bear in mind, I'm a fan of Mata, but are you saying he was good? Are you saying he actually did better in those 3 games than Rooney did today? Because he didn't. Plain and simple

2446~~~
Yes he did, plain and simple.

And yea, as you can see, bar those 5 or 6 sprays he did ( given that 'spray' - a long pass to the side ) most of his passes were to fecking sides. He's keeping the ball on the wings. He's trully playing 'the United way'.

2447~~~
Fair enough.

Incidentally - what site did you use for that Rooney passes diagram? I like that kinda stuff, would like to have a look.

2448~~~
It's on fourfourtwo statszone, you can get basically everything there bar distance covered.

2449~~~
What the hell does that even mean?

2450~~~
What site did you get that graphic from, <a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a>?

2451~~~
Nevermind, just realised you mentioned it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2452~~~
It's not bollocks it's quite simple and true for any football team, your not going to make runs which require defence splitting passs, switching the play, little reverse balls of you see fellaini is on the ball, in any football team you quickly learn the attributes of others and that affects how you play. I said the movement isn't good enough but if players know the passes aren't coming then they stop making the runs, if you people like fellaini on the ball you know you have to get close to them to receive a pass.

2453~~~
We are at home to one of the worst sides in the league, it's where our CM's should dominate, yet he didn't do anything productive, didn't set any tempo and even lost out physically at times. He wasn't alone in being poor, Rooney and Di Maria were poor as well and RvP and Adnan were even worse, but there's no way I can class this performance as anything but poor.

2454~~~
The movement up top has been pretty poor even when Herrera plays but he did actually create chances when he did play. Point is Fellaini is not suited for playing against teams who put 11 men behind the ball. He is decent against opposition where we need to defend a lot but against teams like Palace we need someone to actually create opportunities.

2455~~~
That doesn't match up with how the game actually played out though. He spent most of his time on the right side of the pitch and tried link up with Januzaj a lot. The problem was, Januzaj was slowing the play down whenever he got the ball and whenever Fellaini went for the pass and move, he didn't get it back.

2456~~~
What did you want him to do in this game specifically though? Through balls? No, that's not realistic considering Palace were playing with 10 men behind the ball and Van Persie and Januzaj did not have the pace to beat their defenders.

2457~~~
At the same time, on another day he scores his header that was cleared off the line. But you could always bring that threat off the bench after 60 minutes if it looks like its needed

2458~~~
I dont get your point, whos happy? He did ok, but was far from our worst player.

2459~~~
That means that he is not a player that should start regularly for Manchester United in the midfield. From the creativity of Scholes to the chesting of Fellaini is not a transition I want to see us make.

2460~~~
Our CMs did dominate. Almost the entire game as played in their half.

2461~~~
And this is a sentiment I could probably agree with, only problem that comes to my mind is what others have said already, look at games against Leicester for example, of course, we've had fantastic attacking play there but were completly overrun in the midfield, something that didn't really happen against Chelsea or City, or basically in any match we've had Fellaini in. You're right that Herrera's got better chance creating ability than Fellaini but if you stick just offensive midfielders who're weak physically, we're hardly seeing any of the ball and get destroyed on counters.

And again, biggest threat prior to Mata's cameo came from his header. Not saying it's enough of course but it's still somethin we've missed. Just like we've missed CMs against Chavski for the goal or overall, we've lost the most goals from the crosses in the league this season, 5.

2462~~~
We will never win a title with Fellaini as part of our first XI.

2463~~~
Do you always talk in cliches?

2464~~~
No, they were sitting so deep we had a lot of possession, domination is what you do with said possession, we did nothing.

2465~~~
Saying he's not suited against teams who put 11 behind the ball is stupid. You just want to put him on the bench. We were better in the second half because we put a bit more effort into it. Nothing to do with Fellaini. If we play with tempo we're a better team then what we produced today. I think we're also missing a great winger at the moment or someone with pace who attracts two or three players.

2466~~~
Palace sat back, let us have 65% of possesion, and Fellaini could do naff all with it (as predicted). He's a very limited player.

2467~~~
And you don't think the ineptitude of our attacking players (Di Maria, Januzaj and Van Persie) had more to do with it than someone who helped us dominate possession?

And this wasn't Moyes style possession like what we saw last season. Last season we dominated possession by playing it between our centre backs constantly and we had no clue how to play it out of defence without hoofing it. That was not the case this game. Our build up play was decent until the play broke down in the final third but I'd lay the blame for that at the feet of the likes of Di Maria, Januzaj, Van Persie and Rooney.

2468~~~
Thought he was serviceable, and probably played to his capability.  This year, as he seems to have settled, I can see his skill set. Doesn't seem 100% comfortable running with the ball, but can be disruptive in MF and an attacking option in the box.  

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps65f8d83d.jpg" src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps65f8d83d.jpg"/>

2469~~~
Yeah, it's Fellaini's fault that Van Persie, Di Maria and Januzaj were all poor. Christ...

2470~~~
But what would fellaini do when he got the ball back? Play it to whoever is nearest to him, that's what he does and that's not a criticism it's just true. Do you expect RVP or the wingers to spin off their man and ask him to dink over the top, or the full backs expect him switch the play, or for him to play clever little passes around the box? It's not what he does everyone knows that so their movement reflects that, it's no different to Cleverley or jones playing in midfield, this has been a problem for years and it's not all his fault but there is no point trying to make him out to be good at something when he isn't.

2471~~~
Are you here to here to comment on football?

2472~~~
Whats this got to do with those three? We're talking about Fellaini.

2473~~~
You're acting like he was the only player they could rely on for passes. They had shit movement all game, whether it was Rooney, Carrick, Blind, Mata or Fellaini on the ball.

2474~~~
Because they were (meant to be) our attackers...

2475~~~
I said they were all poor as well, back 5 for us were fine, front 5 were all poor or beyond poor in the case of RvP and Januzaj, yet somehow it was all their fault in your view and his cumbersome inability to run with the ball and lack of passing vision and variety is not part of the problem as well, he was on equal footing with their ineffectiveness.

2476~~~
But again, whats that got to do with Fellaini's performance? Unless you're saying, well xxx player was rubbish so it doesnt matter that Fellaini was rubbish too? Which seems odd.

2477~~~
The thing is we have changed our formation since that game and that is clear. If you are going to attribute this better defensive record to Fellaini's inclusion over Herrera, then you also have to equally blame him for our awful performances going forward. Truth is he is not to be completely blamed/praised for either of those things. Fellaini, in games vs City/Chelsea, has been good and I have accepted that (even though I am not his biggest fan here) but in games where we need more guile than steel he is not required.

2478~~~
Point is he does not have enough guile to play in games like these.

2479~~~
Right now Fellaini is a far better option in midfield than Herrera even against teams like palace because teams like palace have been murdering us through set pieces all season and we don't have a strong enough defence to be able to leave Fellaini out of the team. Fellainis defensive work defending set pieces is of huge importance to us now. Fellaini has been a nice surprise this year and offers a lot more than Herrera in this moment but for sure LVG will still need to sign a proper box to box player eventually. Herrera looks about 2 years away from being ready to become a first teamer

2480~~~
My sentiments exactly.

2481~~~
I'm not blaming Herrera for being overrun in the midfield, rather the lack of balance when playing the diamond. Yes, we've changed in 4141 with which we didn't help ourselves imo because neither ADM nor Januzaj have been helping our case while in the 4141 and I think that we've played the best to our strengths / potential while in the diamond, so I'd like to see diamond formation with Fellaini somewhere there.

To put it more blatantly, I think that Fellaini brings us the 'balance' we've lacked. Having the best team is not always about playing the best 11 players available.

2482~~~
Thats a joke right? right? Surely?

2483~~~
I am not saying it's just him I am just saying that he isn't good at passing, and movement and passing go hand in hand, the movement can be great but if the passing isn't good enough it won't matter and it's the same the other way round, if the passing is poor the movement stops, you think that's bollocks but I have no idea why. Him nd Rooney playing as the two more advanced in the three man midfield are crucial to the passing and movement of the team and they aren't really up to it.

2484~~~
Lazy opinion.

2485~~~
I don't think he was rubbish. You are blaming problems on him that are down to other players.

2486~~~
Palace set out to stifle our players and they succeeded. I thought Fellaini did okay. Just like most of the team did okay. It's hard to break down a resolute team and we are still showing signs of not being a cohesive unit. 

Herrera has more creativity and has the energy to come on to increase the tempo but if there is no movement around him what can he do. I think this is why we started with a defensive minded team because Palace possess quick players so if Herrera got caught up up the pitch we're liable to a quick turnover at a make-shift defence.

2487~~~
How is that lazy? It's a simple opinion which is backed by his stats about how he does not play enough passes which can open up opposition defense. And that is not just based on today's game.

2488~~~
He was the furthest forward of our midfielders today, and he never looked like creating anything. He was pointless.

2489~~~
If we are going to push him forward we need to be more direct and hit a lot balls into him that bring his height and chest control into play because that is how he causes problems.

2490~~~
Yep. And I don't ever want to see United play that kind of football.

2491~~~
How should he have created something? Explain to me please.

2492~~~
Everyone who is saying that Fellaini didn't contribute or create anything, I am yet to see a reply to my earlier point that he set up our goal by laying the ball off to Mata (who then played a 1-2 and scored), and Fellaini could have had a penalty when the defender virtually had him in a headlock.

With that in mind I think it is fair to say that he did more than RVP, ADM, Januzaj and Rooney.


Fellaini is not a creative midfielder but he created our goal today by laying the ball off to Mata.
If we had better crosses and corners rather than the drivel that ADM, Januzaj and Valencia were putting in, he could easily have scored or created more chances.

2493~~~
Attempted a through ball or two? Had a shot?

He literally did nothing going forward.

2494~~~
Bit of a stretch saying he created the goal, he was a threat at times but the point is he didn't do enough today and by having him in the side we lose creativity and it affects the passing and movement of the side. The other side to that is we miss his physical presence if he doesn't play it's part of the problem we have no matter what line up or formation we pick it just looks disjointed.

2495~~~
He passed the ball sideways to Mata the same way the whole team was passing the ball sideways all game. 

It was the interchange between Mata and Di Maria in the area just outside the box that created the space for a shot and therefore the goal. Realistically it was poor defending leaving them both that amount of time.

2496~~~
Herrea is better and offers a lot more going forward and defensively.

2497~~~
He was heavily involved in the goal and could have had a penalty - thus he contributed more in the attack than the rest of our attackers (bar Mata).

Fellaini isn't a creative player and I don't think it is fair to place an expectation on him to be a playmaker for us. I highly doubt LVG is picking him to create chances.
If our wide players had put in better crosses, Fellaini would likely have had more impact - whose fault is this?

He played alongside Carrick/Blind who are far more in the "playmaker" category (don't try to convince me that we needed a dedicated DM against palace...)

2498~~~
He was involved in the buildup and could've had a penalty as well. To me that is more of a contribution than what most the team managed.

2499~~~
He was pulling as much as the defender. And he did fine in the Mata goal, but its silly to say he created anything. He passed and made a run but Mata and Di Maria created it.

He was very unlucky with his header off the line

2500~~~
Considering how poorly we defend and it was a makeshift back four then we probably did need a dm.

He played a part in the goal but he didn't create it, the one two, the deflection and the poor goalkeeping all lead to the goal more than fellaini. I don't expect him to be the playmaker but I expect to have midfielders who can pass the ball much better and open the game up, if you aren't going to hit aerial balls Into him then he doesn't offer much going forward and is essentially percentage football which I don't view as the way forward.

2501~~~
A steady performance from him today, enough to make him one of our better performers on the day. Some awful individual displays from others.

2502~~~
Heh, I forgot about the header.

Disagree on the penalty - the defender had arm around the back of his neck, Fellaini was goal-side, he had no reason to try to hold onto the defender.

2503~~~
Fellainis passing is not as bad as you are making out. Stats on the previous page had him making more forward passes than Rooney, and with a better completion rate.

2504~~~
A through ball to who exactly? He tried a couple to Januzaj but januzaj was beaten for pace all game.

2505~~~
Don't know why he insist on running with the ball on any occasion. It usually end up with giving up the ball to the opposing player. It seems he is just used for set pieces, for both offensive and defensive situations. Other than that, he serve no purpose whatsoever.

2506~~~
Exactly what I was going to say. He had a solid game today. Nothing spectacular but he did a job and wasn't crap. 

Some people's opinions of him on here are a little ridiculous.

2507~~~
His passing is competent not good or bad, passing the ball ten metres sideways or forwards is nothing to get excited about. I really don't see why people try to make out he is a good passer because he just isn't. He is in the team to win headers, add some physicality and cause problems in the box, he is doing decent job of it but we lose a lot elsewhere in the side, we shunt di Maria out to the wing so having one header at goal isn't a huge contribution in that role. If we had someone creative there we might have seen better passing and movement and created more chances or on the downside we might have conceded a goal from a set piece, who knows but I would expect his passing stats to be better than rooney's because Rooney tries more difficult passes.

2508~~~
He may not have been crap, he was just pointless. Hardly a ringing endorsement for his performance.

2509~~~
You could argue that everyone other than Luke Shaw was pointless. Stop forcing an argument.

2510~~~
Another pointless performance. He doesn't defend or create. I'm at loss why he was preferred to either Mata or Herrera against a rubbish Crystal Palace team.

2511~~~
Spot on the money once again Sults.

2512~~~
All this is based on "what if..." Scenarios. We don't know what would have happened if we had Herrera playing, or if ADM was central (I don't think these are mutually exclusive of Fellaini playing anyway). It is unfair to assume that if we had ADM central that we would've won 4-0. We had players like Rooney, RVP and Januzaj and they all contributed much less than Fellaini, yet Fellaini is apparently the root of the problem.

2513~~~
The difference is that was expected from Fellaini. He very rarely makes a difference to our play apart from offering a physical presence which was hardly necessary against an average, horribly defensive Crystal Palace side. 

Also disagreeing with you is hardly forcing an argument. Stop being so precious.

2514~~~
Blind and Carrick were excellent. The whole point of a forum is to create conversation, debate, and constructive arguments.

2515~~~
He isn't the root of the problem, we have plenty of problems and yes it is 'what ifs' but when we are playing poorly and not winning games regularly I think it's quite obvious to look for how we could improve. All I am saying is although he is contributing we are losing out in other areas and that's true of a number of players not just fellaini. We lack creativity in midfield so playing a good but limited player like fellaini and Rooney who is a striker there isn't a great solution and that's one of the reasons why we struggled today.

You also argued earlier that fellaini would have been better if the wingers put in crosses they would probably say they could get more crosses in if there was someone to play better passes and move the ball quicker.

2516~~~
He's solid and does link up midfield and attack well. He's put in some good defensive displays recently also. Don't see what your issue is with him. You seem to detest him so much that it's made your opinion worthless.

2517~~~
But he did anyway and it helped him get his head on the ball, just a shame he couldnt keep that one down

2518~~~
I'm aware of that. My point was that this thread is usually full of people that are ready at their keyboards to berate Fellaini if he's not giving a Ballon d'or type performance every game. When you're a player like him in a game against a Palace side that puts 10 men behind the ball it's hard to look particularly amazing. He made some good passes, broke up a few plays, almost scored, and kept things simple. I rather would have had Herrera in there for this type of game but that's something Fellaini can't control, van Gaal does. It also seems that some people here have (shockingly) already forgotten how well he played against Chelsea and City. And he'll probably play vs. Arsenal too because he could cause them issues. When I said "stop forcing an argument", I mean that people have these set opinions on him and refuse to think that he actually might be a decent player. It's just an excuse to criticize a player.

2519~~~
Not nearly as well as Herrera though, which is the point a lot of people are trying to make and the primary reason why the insistence on playing him (barring some residual injury concerns with Ander) mystifies those who "detest" Fellaini.

2520~~~
Takes too many touches and his passes even when they find their mark are usually a bit wayward. Don't see why he'd start a game like today.

2521~~~
My opinion is as worthless as anyone's on this forum. I'm hardly going to change LvGs' mind.

2522~~~
He hasn't done badly and I can see the point of playing him against the stronger sides, but against Palace he's not going to add much in terms of breaking down the opponents defence, unless you play to his height - which isn't something I want United to see. It remains the problem. You can't play him as a defensive midfielder instead of Carrick of Bllind, but he hasn't enough to offer as a creative/attacking force (on the ground) to play alongside one.

2523~~~
Thought he did ok, when we went long from goal kicks and more direct he was a good option, the ball stuck to him and he played it simple, won some good headers in deeper positions when needed and was unlucky not to score with that powerful header, we utilised him well today, he is starting to look like has a role to play and he did it well and offered us something, only complaint is he tried beating his man a couple of times and he doesn't have the feet for it, lost possession unnecessarily instead of playing off a simple ball when he had options and getting himself into a position where he could do damage with his strengths.

2524~~~
He's doing ok in this new formation. I just think we had more creativity and got more out of Di Maria with the diamond formation, with Herrera playing too.

2525~~~
I personally don't think the tactic of him pushing up and Rooney holding back is working well enough. I don't think it's getting the best out of the wingers or RVP and reducing Rooneys potential impact. His strength is a good thing to have I just don't get why we want him to be so focused on getting in the box because I think it's considerably impacting our build up play.

2526~~~
Bang on the money. Thats why so many (including myself) have such an issue with Fellaini. No he didn't score 2 own goals, concede a penalty and get sent off today. So in that respect he wasn't terrible. The issue lies more with what he can't do, then what he is doing. 

Can anyone honestly say, hand on heart, that we're going to able to play the kind of fast, one touch, attacking football we all wish to see, with Fellaini in this role?

2527~~~
Steady performance. Didn't pull up any trees, but as has been said, he was one of our better performers. I don't understand all the people moaning about his lack of 'through balls' or whatever. That is never going to be his role, however advanced he is positioned.

2528~~~
Then he shouldn't be playing there.

2529~~~
I agree, but let's not pretend this is Fellaini's fault! He's just trying to do what has been asked of him, and I think he did alright. I think our lack of creativity was due to our set-up rather than any individual. I prefer the diamond midfield or even 4-3-3, but I guess van Gaal wasn't keen on risking Herrera, which leaves us a bit light on options for those formations.

2530~~~
Another decent performance from him.
But if playing him means Herrera benched and Di Maria out wide, I know what I'd rather see.

2531~~~
I'm really happy he has a role to play now in the team, but i don't think he needs to play every game, without herrera the tempo seems to be much slower, horses for courses is suppose.

2532~~~
Yep. Thing is I don't know how we'd do with him playing more like a cm (although suspect he won't link as well as Herrera would) and breaking forward when the time was right as a lot of cm's do, but at the moment his role seems to be to get in the box asap with him not looking to build up the play from deeper and I don't know if Rooney is meant to be doing more to make up for that but all I'm seeing is the dm having no one close by to pass to and for the wingers only having a pass to the fullback on most the time. It all feels very disconnected like this.

2533~~~
But then Herrera should be playing instead of Rooney because we are essentially playing two people who aren't really CM's in midfield and as LVG said after the game we need to be moving the ball quicker and switching the play but that's not going to happen with those two. Obviously the manager takes the blame for playing them but it's not surprising we struggled to break palace down with that midfield and someone has to make way for someone who can pass the ball.

2534~~~
Yep that's my feelings too. If we want Fellaini in this role then I think it has to come at the expense of a striker.

2535~~~
Yeah I think then he can just be a body in midfield but do the bulk of his work in the final third and we can have someone in midfield who can increase the speed and range of passing.

2536~~~
He cant play for us, we just cross and hit the ball forwards and look up to find him all the time. We dont have a playing style with Fellaini in the team, he is an useful option at times, but we really dont create anything, becaus he isnt creative and we smash the ball at him all the time. I didnt see this pattern in the first few games, but now it is more or less hit it long to Fellaini or hope someone creates something out of nothing.

2537~~~
He'll never win some people over on here irrespective of his performances. Even when he finished the season ok, people said it was against lesser teams. He plays well against Chelsea and City, more criticism. I like Herrera but he's too light weight and we were getting overrun in midfield with him and Blind. Not many Yaya's around that can combine both so at present that's Going to have to Felliani and a other.....

2538~~~
Why are people saying this? He's clearly shown for us that's he anything but light weight. He's a little fighter is Ander.

2539~~~
Still waiting for you to answer this <a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a>

2540~~~
Herrera is injured. I don't get why a big deal is being made of it.

2541~~~
Just caught the full game, I thought he did well, gets the ball out of his feet quickly, looks quite comfortable on the ball and has decent energy about him, always found around the box when we're in attack, I thought he could have done one or two things a bit better in the last 1/3rd of the field, though he was unlucky not to have scored from a corner. (cleared off the line)
All in all, did well... again.

2542~~~
To Van Persie? He might not be in great form, but he's making runs.

If Fellaini is going to play as an advanced midfielder for United, he's going to need a lot more then just being able to bring the ball out of the air well, and make decent 5 yard passes.

2543~~~
When is the last time Van Persie scored off a through ball played by Herrera?

2544~~~
I can't remember the last time RVP scored from a through ball. Period.

Doesn't mean the passes shouldn't keep coming, and Fellaini's had plenty of opportunities. He's also playing a lot further forward then Herrara has this season (apart from that strange 45 minutes against West Brom).

2545~~~
I'm not worried when I see Fellaini in the starting line up anymore as I'm increasingly confident he'll contribute something when he plays. That's a fair sign when it comes to the progress he's made.

That said, Herrera is a far better footballer and is actually quite aggressive and tenacious so I'm not sure why people see him as a massive weakness defensively. Anyway, although Fellaini is strong he's also rather weak defensively himself. Always think that doesn't get highlighted enough while his technical limitations are sometimes overplayed.

2546~~~
Right so he tried a through pass or two to Januzaj but Januzaj was beaten for pace & strength so it didn't work.

And he didn't play any to Van Persie but then no one really has done recently.

Fellaini is the problem though right?

2547~~~
I don't remember any incisive through balls for Januzaj tbh. And Van Persie has been played through plenty of times this season (Di Maria has done it about 4 times himself), he's just missed them all.

And yes, Fellaini is a problem. He's a waste of a player.

2548~~~
He shouldn't be on the bench then.

2549~~~
I suggest you rewatch the match in that case.

2550~~~
Probably not. But we will concede less goals (as evident since he came into the team) because we are more balanced. I'd rather win matches than lose 5-3 or 4-2 or whatever.

This thread is ugly. He wasn't that bad at all. Not as good as his previous two performances, but he was solid. People expecting him to create are looking for any issue to pick on him about. We had Januzaj, ADM, RvP, Rooney, and Carrick. That is five creative players. It is their job to create the chances. Anyway, he did play a few through balls to Januzaj but they didn't quite come off. His passing was fine. He moves the ball faster than Rooney and Carrick. However I think playing the three together slows us down too much. I'd like to see a Blind, Fellaini and Herrera midfield. He looks better with Blind in there with him.

2551~~~
Fellaini has been doing well for us this season, but he should not be starting in a side like MUFC.
His vision, passing and tackling abilities are average and he barely contributes to build up play.
I think by next season he will be a sub, LVG is only playing him because of his physical presence.

2552~~~
I agree with that, but when Herrera tried to play right after his rib injury with the corset on it didn't work out well at all. Maybe if Herrera doesn't make the bench anderson will and no one wants that.

2553~~~
Fighter is one thing, being a lightweight is something else. He does not have the statue at present to do the job without a Fellaini type player. Unfortunately, like I said, Yaya type players are few are far between. Equally Keano type players that aren't necessarily physically big but statue was huge.

2554~~~
What is this bizarre transition you are referring to? A highly respected and successful coach like LVG is selecting him for the side. He is playing well. Had a solid rather than spectacular game yesterday. I think he is more suited to a 3 man midfield rather than 2. I would like to see him, Blind and Herrera in midfield.

2555~~~
God knows, some people will never give Fellani never any credit no matter what performances he puts in.

2556~~~
It's a question of horses for courses. Against a big physical team like Chelsea, he's obviously a good player to have. Against a team like Palace sitting back on the edge of their box, he's too slow in his use of the ball and doesn't have the ability to make telling passes. Hererra also has the advantage of having a quick spring in the first couple of yards, so he's good at playing little one twos in tight spaces. Fellaini is a bit clumsy and has the turning radius of an oil tanker.

2557~~~
I'm enjoying our recent look of not being bullied in midfield, not shit on my pants every time we concede corners/freekicks, and to have hope again of scoring from a thousand corners and set pieces we've always got.

And (most of it) thanks to the big afro-man.

2558~~~
Thought he looked good again and like Isotope said above, it was reassuring to see Fellaini bringing some strength to our side. He won practically everything in the air. There was one moment when the ball was lofted up and it was two Palace players vs. Fellaini, yet watching from the stands, there was no doubt who would win that particular contest.

2559~~~
As much as i like Fellaini I feel a little bit sorry for Herrera because it is his size that is against him at the moment. I see the logic in playing Herrera against those teams that sit back, he would be better than Fellaini in breaking a team down. But without Fellaini we are so small at set pieces, we are likely to concede. So we need him in there for that.

2560~~~
He should be replaced by Herrera as he just doesn't contribute enough to our play. But he will most certainly start against Arsenal instead of Herrera

2561~~~
A highly successful coach is selecting him? What does that mean? We should just accept everything as a fact because of Van Gaal? What is the point of this forum then? "Only open for hunting season...i.e. <i>when Moyes or similar is the manager</i>".

This is not how I want to see a United midfielder and team play. All he does is move back to win the goal kick or pass and move to the opposition box to chest the ball. The problem is that he doesn't have the positional nous to play as a defensive midfielder, as his predominant skills are chesting and controlling ball. His reading of the game and tackling ability is below standard.

If played as an attacking midfielder, he doesn't have the quickness of thought, passing or guile to open up opposition defense. He can't run with the ball, doesn't have the vision or awareness to pick a pass, and is too ponderous and slow.

He can't play a box to box role as he doesn't have the energy or ability to track runners in midfield or contribute in attack running from a deeper positon. Jog your memory to Fletcher during his good years and you'll realize how inept is Fellaini.

What is left is this weird midfield floater kind of role for him. The team passes the ball around, doesn't work and then lumps it to Fellaini. Rooney or Mata are made to hold positions in the midfield, when these creative players should be in the final third, because Fellaini is up there and someone has to cover the spaces left behind. This is exactly like the role Nolan played for West Ham or Fellaini played for Everton. Being a nuisance than a footballer. 

I didn't mind him in the Chelsea game as we had to go as underdogs until we reach their level as a team. But against a shit City and Palace team? It's simply not acceptable to me.

But yeah, let's call me clueless and move on.

2562~~~
If he doesnt have the energy to track runners how come he is consistently in the top 1-3 players each game in terms of distance travelled?.
The team doesnt just lump it forward to Fellaini. This is a complete myth perpetrated by lazy thinkers who fall into the cliched thinking of coming to the conclusion that if a player is tall he has to be a target.
Fellaini heads in to the box when a certain thing happens. He also heads to the back post each time. Thats clearly following an instruction from his coach. Do you know what the trigger is for his move to the back post?, have you worked it out yet?.

2563~~~
And Phil Jagielka is the fastest player in the league. Congratualtions to one and all.

If you saw the game rather than read analysis on whoscored in the morning, you'll see that. Most of the time he lazily ambles across while Rooney or someone else is bursting their gut to get back. It's not a myth perpetrated only by lazy thinkers, it's a fact witnessed by people with two eyes.

He passes the ball and heads into the box. He doesn't play like a proper midfielder, or is not at the moment. He doesn't have the nimbleness to play a quick passing game. In the Palace game, he needed extra touches to control the ball, and then invariably passed it to Januzaj into a crowded area. As a top midfielder you should know the next pass before the ball even gets to you. With Fellaini, it's the complete opposite.

He must be following the instructions of the coach, and that is why I criticizing him too. Re-read the earlier post.

2564~~~
You really need to open both eyes when watching. Its quite clear you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Stick to FIFA 15.

2565~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Two really great responses, man. You really opened my eyes, both of them. 

You are a great debater.. Really, really solid talk. Glad we did this

2566~~~
We've seen plenty of evidence that shows you are completely wrong about stuff like this.

I'd suggest that it was more the case in the last game that Januzaj didn't know the next pass before the ball got to him.

2567~~~
He obviously has a role to play in the squad, but I think it's pretty clear that it should be more in the difficult fixtures and as an option from the bench. He did fine against Crystal Palace, but I'm quite sure given the amount of possession we had that Herrera would be far more useful with the ball at his feet. The quick exchanges that we saw earlier in the season, starting with Blind/Herrera and finishing with Di Maria/Rooney are stifled with Fellaini, as he tends to slow the game down. On a whole though he was alright, defended decently and his height was an asset all over the pitch.

I'd play Fellaini vs Arsenal.

2568~~~
To anyone still struggling to work out why Fellaini started against Palace have a look at his defensive stats from that game. In the absence of all but one of our first choice defenders his height is really important in defending set-pieces. 

Obviously, the same applies with our own set-pieces, especially without Falcao. Set one up for RVP against Chelsea and Mata came the width of the post away from profitting from another Fellaini header on Saturday. 

Combine this with his accurate passing (93%, 1 in 2 passes forwards) and general presence in the centre of the park and it's really not difficult to see why Van Gaal picked him.

2569~~~
I agree he is being picked to do a job and we have really needed that physical presence but with Carrick and Rooney returning and hopefully a couple of centre halves at some point the need for that physical presence diminishes. His passes were accurate but they are also short and easy, he is ever going to switch the play or play a pass to really stretch a team and when played alongside Rooney it’s no wonder we were struggling to open Palace up.

Fellaini isn’t really a midfielder he is a player who can play a unique but effective role in midfield but he is very limited and to really get the best out of him you need him higher up the pitch and you need the ball in the air more (that’s when he was at his best for Everton), if we really want to see how good he can be we need to drop Rooney or RVP, play Herrera and give Fellaini more freedom.

Ideally he would be a DM because then he brings that physicality, the usefulness at set pieces and his limitations on the ball aren’t really an issue but he lacks all the key requirements for that position and he is better going forward. I still don’t see how he fits in long term so be interesting to see how/if the manager uses him once we have sorted ourselves out in defence

2570~~~
Good lad, good attitude.

I wonder how different things might have been for him in his first year if he hadn't been signed by Moyes. 

I'd love to see him go on and succeed here, looked devoid of any sort of confidence last year.

2571~~~
He definitely deserves to be picked at the moment.

2572~~~
I would drop him next match.Not hating or anything but I believe he's only extremely useful in some certain matches and Arsenal is not one of them.Wouldn't be hesitate to start him vs Liverpool for examples.

2573~~~
Squad player at best, plan B player, unique games needs basis player. Bring Herrera back

2574~~~
He still shouldn't be part of any first XI for a team with genuine title and CL winning aspirations. He's just not good enough for that level.

2575~~~
he's playing well! i hated the sight of him last year but he's slowing changing my opinion.  hopefully it continues

2576~~~
I'm surprised he thought he had a good World Cup. He was absolute dog shit in every match he played.

2577~~~
Our cm's against arsenal should be carrick and Herrera.
Fellaini has not been doing bad this season but he is a very limited footballer and should Not be starting at a team like MUFC.

2578~~~
You would. Then again, you celebrated Rooney being banned.

2579~~~
We've won the league (and title challenging) with Valencia, Cleverly, and Young featured heavily before.

2580~~~
Yet he tore us and several other top teams a new one.

2581~~~
As did everyone else during the tournament. He was anonymous for them and his role was questionable. Belgium have the potential to be a dynamic team and he upset the balance when he played and their quality of play suffered a lot.

2582~~~
So did Duncan Ferguson, I don't remember people us advocating signing him.

The cold hard truth is, if you look at the top teams right now, the likes of Chelsea, Bayern, Madrid (i.e the level we want to get back too) then a player like Fellaini wouldn't get anywhere near their squads, never mind first XI. We've been carrying decent PL players for far to long now, and that's why were in this mess. We need to get ruthless and build a team with genuine top quality, and Fellaini isn't that. If we want to keep him as some sort of plan B, then fine, I don't particularly like it, but I can live with it. But he shouldn't be part of our long term first XI plans.

2583~~~
Well we are certainly in plan B mode right now. We are severely lacking in height and power on the pitch, and Fellaini is really the only player we have capable of providing that. Even our CBs aren't up to it in that regard. It will take us at least another year for us to be at the level we want to be (assuming Di Maria or others don't get frustrated and leave), and during this interim period I think we will really need Fellaini in our squad to provide some stability in our team.

2584~~~
I wouldn't drop Herrera for Fellaini, but can see Fellaini playing instead of Carrick. While Fellaini's passes may be short and easy, that's precisely what we need at times. No nonsense, sort of like what Blind is providing for us. With Fellaini's really good passing accuracy, we know that we aren't going to lose possession in the midfield or give away careless passes that will break up our attacks and give other teams an opening. And the whole "streching a team" or "playing killer passes," well let's be honest, that's what Di Maria, Rooney, Mata and Herrera were brought on for. If we expect risky attacking play from our wings and our middle, that's just going to end up in our team being too unbalanced and we will concede many more goals. Against teams that are parking the bus and trying to catch us on the counter, Fellaini is really quite effective.

2585~~~
Will be sad to see him go now that he was actually doing well here.

2586~~~
If we were playing Barcelona tomorrow, Fellaini would be the first name on my teamsheet. The guy's unplayable when on form and teams like Barca wouldn't be able to cope with him. And they're not the only ones. Sure, it'd mean conceding some possession, but we're never going to beat them at their own game. Having a player like him in the squad opens up so many tactical avenues that he's worth keeping around.

2587~~~
Wouldn't be surprised to see him bully Arsenal in the next game.

2588~~~
We can't expect to have world class players in every position. Before Fellaini there are tonnes of other players that could go. We've always had a balanced squad compared to the likes of Madrid and have done pretty well.

2589~~~
Fellaini is very good at offering the team strength and height. Many times, when the opposition would try to press him, he would be comfortable on the ball and rarely look like losing it. Plus, his height is a big advantage for us in the set pieces (if he's not careless). The role he plays in midfield doesn't make him that responsible for dictating play and controlling the game, which makes him less ineffective. Plus, his aggression is very useful in his ability to win the ball.

Having said all of this, I still think he isn't good enough for us. All of the qualities I mentioned above are provided by many other midfielders who offer more than Fellaini do in midfield (most of the options I'm thinking of don't really offer a set-piece threat like he does, though, but we aren't really a set-piece team anyways). His positioning in midfield isn't that good (when we attack and when we defend), and he's very limited in his movement. Too many times have I seen him go too far high up, leaving us with only Rooney as the option in midfield.

Fellaini's made himself more useful and suppressed his weaknesses, but I still think we can do better than him whilst not really losing that much of the physicality from midfield.

2590~~~
Blind or Carrick are the last players he should play instead of, replacing two players whose strengths are their positional sense and ability to collect the ball from the CB’s and start the attacks with someone who isn’t good at either is not going to benefit the team. The accurate passing idea is misleading, most CB’s have good passing stats because most of their passes are short and obvious which is very similar to what Fellaini does, so effectively you then need either a CB to start the attacks or someone to come deep and collect the ball. 

I don’t expect him to play expansive passes but I expect to have at least one much better passer in the positions Fellaini and Rooney are currently occupying and if we don’t it limits the impact that the other players you mentioned have on the game because firstly they can’t all play and secondly they don’t get the service they need and the inter play between them suffers. Quality passing is so much more than just looking at stats and saying someone is 90% accurate and 1 in 2 passes go forward, it’s about the tempo, the weight of the pass, the difficulty, teammates knowing where they can make runs to etc etc. We aren’t a team blessed with pace or an abundance of players who can beat a man so we either need to be more direct and get Fellaini further forward or improve our passing by playing a better passer in his place, at the moment we aren’t really doing either.

If fit I think Herrera should be back in the starting 11 against Arsenal with either RVP or Fellaini making way for him

2591~~~
The days when we could have gotten away with that are long gone I'm afraid. The other top teams are stronger and have better managers then they did back then.

I don't see young clev or Anderson as being part of a winning side.

2592~~~
Yea Fellaini was ok to start against Chelsea who are in the class of their own and City who'll finish up second but he's not good enough to start against Arsenal, team that's struggling against any sort of physicality.

Makes absolutely perfect sense.

2593~~~
Fellaini deserves too and should start against Arsenal - he can bully their centre-backs if/when he gets forward and could find himself on the score-sheet if our deliveries are good enough.

2594~~~
I find it baffling that people are saying not to use Fellaini against Arsenal.

Some of the people on here are looking at him purely as a solution to a problem - ie what he did against Chelsea and City to Fabregas, Matic and Toure.
Against Palace, yes, it was difficult as they played with 10 men behind the ball and we needed to unlock their defence.

Arsenal will not be the same, they will attack us, and furthermore their defence has looked very, very suspect (like our own). Fellaini would have an absolute field day bullying their midfield and CBs. I cannot think of a single Arsenal midfielder who could stand up to Fellaini physically or even come close, and like I said their defence already looks suspect, for me Fellaini is exactly the type of player who can exploit that.

I would actually like to see us line up 4-3-3 with Blind, Fellaini and Herrera in midfield (or Blind at CB and Carrick in midfield, either way). Stick ADM and Januzaj on the wings and Rooney up front and that is a good formation to use against the gunners.

2595~~~
The thing that Im battling with in my mind about Fellaini is that I compare Fellaini's performances now to that of his last year (awful)... i.e he can only really improve. Im pleased for him thats he's playing better and against Man City was his best performance for me in a utd shirt. 

However, if I was to compare him to other CM's in the league and i.e the teams and players we need to beat Im still not sure even with his current improved ability does he cut it when compared to: Matic, Ramieres, Fabregas, Yaya, Ramsey, Wilshere, Rooney (As a CM), Schneiderlin, even Henderson and Gerrard, Song. Im not so sure still. 

Especially when I like the style of Herrera and currently Fellaini is being used in his place. Similarly Carrick next to Blind (once our defence is back) would be great to see, think against top sides they'd give us some real positional stability and platform to build from.  

These are the calibre of player he needs to be IF he should be in a utd first team. I dont think us as fans should settle. Having said all of this should he and does he deserve to start against Arsenal yes, however if we are using his physicality as his main strength then when does he ever get dropped. Against shorter sides he becomes dominant against taller stronger sides he gives us a presence. Just struggling to get my head round it. Hopefully he just keeps improving and merits his place on a level to those other CM's in the league.

2596~~~
you name alot of midfielders playing garbage this season. I'd say in the few starts he's had he's been as good as half of those. He stopped Fabregas getting into the game as well!

2597~~~
Going by what i'm reading here Fellaini will never be good enough no matter what he does. He's very unique in his attributes and they are very effective too. I'm still reserving judgement until the end of the season if he keeps performing i would want him to stay. 

He's right in what he's said, his association with Moyes and keeping out fan favourite Herrera is making fans extremely biased against him, he's in the team on merit and we are playing better with him in it, long may it continue.

And it would be stupid not to play him against the Arse, you need physical players against them nearly every manager in the PL knows that.

2598~~~
Definitely the new Cleverley. Will get very little praise when he plays and we win, but will receive bucket loads of hate when he plays and we lose. I'd be willing to bet my car that he'll be turned on again as soon as he has a half-bad game.

2599~~~
He offers more than Cleverley though, and is a better player, judging by what the two have done so far in the Premier League.

2600~~~
Those who don't like the attributes Fellaini brings to the team and never will are of course welcome to their opinion, but I slightly wish they'd piss off from posting their hatred when he's actually performing quite well, as he happens to be at present, it's infuriating to read such negativity the past few games when his performances don't warrant it.

2601~~~
I am sure they didn't mind his physicality when he made the goal against Chelsea. 

Yes he is not the in vogue spanish technomidget, but he has something which can be even harder to stop.  Sure it's not for every game, but I guarantee Arsenal's defense won't enjoy playing against him!.

2602~~~
Doesnt say too much, I agree I was just naming midfielders from our competition, not to think of our European competition (if we were to get back in champs league) where the comparison would be scary!

2603~~~
Last time Marouane performed against Arsenal in centre midfield, he produced this:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzgMwbP18CQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2604~~~
Yeah, he was very good in that game. It's performances like that for Everton which made it so strange that you had half this place insisting last season that he could only ever be any use as a second striker.

2605~~~
You are asking me what I mean after you are the one babbling on about the 'transition from Moyes will be complete'. I'm simply saying LVG is a successful coach and LVG is much more qualified then you or me in coaching and managing. He clearly wants to give Fellaini a chance in the team and Fellaini is doing well so far. Of course people should question him but simply mumbling on about some 'transition' and not having the blinkers off to give credit where it is due is what you are doing. 

Do you actually watch any of the matches, I am slightly worried about you if you do and all you can see is him 'winning goal kicks' and 'chesting the ball'? Of course he is not a defensive midfielder, he was never suited to that role. He seems to be playing the box to box quite well in these past games, it suits him with 3 in the middle. He has a good technique and is passing is very good. I don't think he will do well if we only have 2 midfielders which we may employ in some games.You need to take your blinkers off and judge a player on how he is playing which according to alot of posters on this forum and the manager is quite well.  Lets not forget he is also selected by the Belgian manager. Comparing him with Nolan just demonstrates the blinkered view you have.

2606~~~
Ye exactly. Even before that, Fellaini was putting in memorable performances in centre midfield for Everton, more notably against Chelsea, IIRC. I guess people only see what they want to see.

2607~~~
He did have some very good games Everton but he was very much a focal point for them and they knew that to exploit his full potential you have to hit the ball to him in the air a lot, that isn’t a criticism or slight against him or them it’s just what makes sense. When you have the ball you target him with long balls, ask him to use his chest, win headers and then when you don’t have it you ask him to just put himself about. At the moment as a stop gap to add physicality and do a job he has been useful but looking forward we either bite the bullet and exploit his aerial ability or we find the physical presence elsewhere.

Against Palace he should have either been in or on the edge of the box and we should have been hitting in more crosses/ long balls of he should have been replaced by Herrera in order for us to be more incisive. I think his long term future is very similar to Mata’s, both very good players the downside is they have weak all round games in relation to other players in their position, the upside is both are capable lots of goals and assists. In Fellaini’s last 3 games he probably hasn’t made one really difficult or incisive pass but he could have scored with headers in all 3 games and 1 of those headers led directly to a goal so it depends what the manager regards as being more beneficial.

2608~~~
His best is yet to come

2609~~~
One would truly hope. Because if we've seen his best ...

2610~~~
So absolutely nothing apart from being taller and bigger than the Arsenal players. Not one attempted creative pass made by him in that game, which sums him up. He's good at getting the ball and giving it back to you, and good at being a big lad and that's about it.

2611~~~
At 2.04 he receives the ball and then gives it straight back to his team mate even though his team mate is relatively closely marked. Just curious to see if you know why he did it?

2612~~~
Lol great video, love how he's absolutely bossing Arsenal! It honestly looks like a grown man playing against a junior side.

That being said, as several other posters have mentioned, he's no Fabregas or Xavi or Hazard. Fair enough, United could get a better midfielder. But I just want to say two things. First, he's not meant to be a Fabregas or a Xavi - he's a completely different type of player, more useful for keeping possession and bullying weaker players as opposed to creating chances or breaking open defenses (we don't need him for that). Second, while we could get a player who is probably better than Fellaini, the same could be said in almost all of our positions. Our urgent needs are clearly a backup for Rafael, and an experienced CB or two, before we even think about finding an upgrade for Fellaini.

2613~~~
He will destroy the Arsenal midfield and CBs with his size. They are weak at set-pieces, we should be playing him IMO. I'd like Herrera played too though, with Blind in a 4-3-3. Also, people criticizing his lack of creativity need to understand it isn't his game. Although he is capable of playing short/medium quick passes in between the lines to people who have space. There was a couple of examples in that video.

2614~~~
I didn't give that much consideration, but Arsenal have been struggling aerially of late and have conceded quite a few headed goals this season with Monreal being a particularly weak point and getting dominated in the air (culpable for Gomis' winner against Swansea). Fellaini should pose a huge threat in that respect and more so than against opposition like City, Chelsea and Palace who are generally solid from set-pieces due to the height and physicality they possess. If Koscielny returns that could change the whole complexion of Arsenal's solidity though, so I think Fellaini's inclusion could hinge on whoever of the aforementioned starts.

Personally, I would be against him starting were it not for the opposition and how he might thrive against them though. For as well as he's played, I think he disrupts the fluency and movement in our midfield - which goes for Rooney also - and although he's acquitted himself well, I would much rather see Herrera start whether it's at the expense of Fellaini or not. At least one of Carrick or Blind start, possibly both, so Felli's probably the missing man.

2615~~~
I agree with you....we must use Fellaini as a weapon in this match

If Arsenal are playing
<i>Szczesny - Chambers, Mertesacker, Monreal, Gibbs - Ramsey, Arteta, Wilshere - Sanchez, Welbeck, Cazorla</i>
against us then they would only have Mertesacker and Chambers as big strong players (But Fellaini would kill Chambers)

Chelsea were strong at set-pieces, of course City too and Crystal Palace have had also some big strong players but Arsenal are looking really really weak there.
I would play Fellaini 100% from the start.

2616~~~
Yup, not just set pieces, I can see Fellaini utterly bullying Arsenal. People need to stop looking at him purely as a solution to a specific problem, and start seeing him for who he is - a proven PL midfielder who dominated our midfield more than once. He absolutely bossed Carrick against us and not just in terms of winning aerial duels, but most would loathe the idea of starting Fellaini instead of Carrick.

Obviously they are different players, but again for me it is people making up their minds on Fellaini due to him being a Moyes-man, and refusing to see anything that doesn't agree with that.

2617~~~
I agree with those who are saying we should start Fellaini. When I looked in here the other day there were some who were saying we wouldn't need his physicality against a relatively weak Arsenal team, but I think this is a game where we can see his physicality used to its best effect.

Arsenal have no Matic/Toure figures who generally physically dominate the midfield, so rather than Fellaini being employed to somewhat nullify such a player as in the Chelsea/City games he'll be dominating that area for us instead. It's a cliché, but Arsenal remain very susceptible to being bullied and Fellaini is easily capable of overpowering almost every player in their squad.

2618~~~
If by this you mean winning possession, then it's not as easy as you make it out to be. I mean, over the last few years, we've lacked someone with a bit of bite, who can bully the opposition players.

If you look at Arsenal, they've got plenty of players who can make that 'creative pass', but teams go through their midfield like they're not there, at times. Yes, Fellaini's never going to be Fabregas or Modric, but since he's been in the team, I personally feel we've looked more solid in midfield.

2619~~~
Yeah like said if they're playing a midfield Ramsey - Arteta - Wilshere then he would dominate that midfield too....Arsenal are losing many midfield battles

I'm still not a fan of Fellaini but i'm sure he could be a massive key player against Arsenal
I really think/feeling Fellaini could make his best game of the season in this match in 10 days......he's perfect for that match

And btw he can play football too.....he isn't just a big strong player <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

No serious i really would be shocked if he isn't in LVG's starting line-up against Arsenal

2620~~~
I've always been in this camp. He's good on the ball, he's not playing 30 yard defence-splitting passes but he's got a good eye for those little through balls between the lines and he keeps possession very well. I'd not have defended him on here like I have since he signed if I thought he was only good for his physique.

Agree with you on all points, really looking forward to Fellaini's performance and the game in general.

2621~~~
The problem is just Fellaini will play twice for Belgium in the next days.......with our luck he'll come back injured and our clever talking is for nothing <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2622~~~
Some people on here would be delighted. <a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> would probably start a poll to gauge how happy everyone is about it.

2623~~~
Fellaini has had a couple of decent games for us and now people think he's a dead cert to boss the midfield against arsenal. Interesting. Don't see it myself. I'll be happy if he plays like he has the last few games, but I don't think he'll boss the midfield, bully arsenal, nor run the game.

2624~~~
I've rarely seen him do this for Man. Utd., though. More often than not, he's gone for much safer option than trying to play it between the lines. Case in point: the match against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford when he had many instances to play di Maria, Januzaj, van Persie, or Rooney into dangerous areas but opted out and went someone more easily accessible.

I've seen him play some nice, quick, short passes for Everton, playing his teammates into dangerous areas. However, I've rarely seen him do this for us, and he needs to show that he has this in him; otherwise, he'll be nothing more than someone who helps us retain possession and win the ball quickly.

2625~~~
We haven't had a player who could "run the game" for a long time. I don't see anyone saying Fellaini will do that though. Whether he plays, or Herrera plays (if that is the choice), I think a United fan just wants them to play well. And objective observers know when a player has done well...

2626~~~
Absolutely, United fans should want him to do well. That's not saying that all do want him to. Maybe I'm mixing terminology, but I equate bossing midfield to running the game. I guess maybe the posters didn't mean it that way. Either way, I see it unlikely he'll boss midfield. I hope I'm wrong. But if he plays as he has the last few weeks I'll be happy (so long as one of the others takes it upon themselves to actually create something of course)

2627~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2628~~~
Irrespective of how he plays, for some on here he never be good even when it's clear that he's added something that others can't. He's a enforcer and a nightmare to play against. Like I said elsewhere, ideally we could find a player that's got Herrera and Fellaini qualities but unfortunately the nearest to that is playing in a light blue shirt. If he was playing for anyone else in the world, I'm sure we would have broken the bank for him.

2629~~~
Fellaini can be even more effective coming off the bench, either to chase the goal or defend the lead.

After all, if all of Di Maria, Herrera, Blind, Mata and Carrick (not too worried about the "groin injury", given the circumstances in which it is claimed to have occurred) are fit, would you really bench any of them to make room for Fellaini, who's neither a particularly creative midfielder nor a brilliant defensive midfielder?

Deploy the hairy Belgian if the starting XI needs a tweak in the 65th minute, but don't throw off a reasonably balanced squad to start the match.

2630~~~
Thankyou. 

Finally some sense amongst all the madness of this new found Fellaini love in nonsense.

2631~~~
Probably because he was absolute dog crap last season in CM. 

On topic, I'm not quite sure where everyone is getting the idea that being a big bastard is the key to winning midfield battles. I mean it helps Toure and Matic but they've got a lot more in the locker. It's not something we've needed in my memory. Surely if we're arguing Arsenal are a less physical team than others, surely the best idea is to bench him and play Carrick, Herrera and Blind who are much better technically and tactically.

2632~~~
Well quite clearly LvG would seeing as Fellaini has been starting with Herrera and Mata on the bench!

2633~~~
Last season being an excellent benchmark...

+injured for a lot of the season
+no preseason

blah blah, i could go on, but in this thread some people are beyond reasoning with.

2634~~~
I can recall many occasions in the past few years where we have not been able to cope physically or technically in midfield against the best teams in England and Europe.

2635~~~
LvG may be a successful coach, and may prove to be a huge success here too, still doesn't change the fact that he has been floundering along since his appointment. Most of the summer shopping was done with a formation in mind, and since then he has abonded that and gone with something new with Fellaini in the middle. I am sorry, I am not going to buy someone's balderdash just because they were previously successful and over stress on the world "philosophy". The transition I mention is the slow tugrid football we have played with Fellaini in the middle, which has comprised our creativity and attacking play. As I mentioned previously, it was good against Chelsea, a team who we are clearly inferior to, though not against a terrible CP team. The solidity in the middle and protection for the defense in the Palace game was provided by Carrick, not Fellaini.

Have you seen any matches or understand the box to box role? Because that is not what Fellaini has played for us in the last 3 games. The comparison to Nolan was to give an example of the specific type of role, not a direct comparison between their actual qualities.

You are the one who needs to stop drinking the Van Gaal Kool-aid and watch the games properly. Or may be come with a constructive post without personal attacks, which help me take my "blinkers" off.

2636~~~
Even though he has shown signs of quality, the last couple games, I admittedly still cannot stand the sight of him in our first team, let alone our squad. 

His style of play and the long ball tactics we resort to (just because he's a big lad) when he's on the pitch is just painful to watch and I honestly cannot wait to see him moved on.

2637~~~
LVG needs points more than anything so I think he is just trying to find a formation and line up that works, I expect there is still a lot of chopping and changing to come as I don’t think he has the players at his disposal to play how he wants. Fellaini has done well for the last 3 and a half games but I doubt there is any intention for him to be a first team regular beyond the short term and his long term future will be as a sub or at a different club.

2638~~~
Don´t get me wrong on here he has been torn apart more than any other player, not like we havent had dross players before (Ando anyone, that git got away with murder and a pile of cash doing it).. And I am all for giving players a fair chance or shot at it, new club, new players, new staff well you might be great at doing what you´re doing but a new workplace takes a bit to get used to.. That said he isn´t what we need in midfield the tempo just goes when he is there, no directness nothing. He is plainly a big log that moves about and can kick a ball, he offers nothing in build up what so ever when we have have the ball for 65-70% of the game, is clumsy and gives away to many freekicks. But when we are defending and need a bit of steel and hight in the middle he is a great tool and can easily hold the ball up to ease pressure! But we are dreadful to watch with him dictating tempo in the middle of the park..

2639~~~
Well, exactly. Which would be typical of the goldfish memories that infest this place. Anything that isn't happening right in front or our eyes, right now, might as well never have happened.

2640~~~
Same here. I wanted him out in the summer, and it kinda makes me feel like a c*nt, but my opinion of him is starting to shift. If he could find back to the form he had in his glorydays at Everton, he would be a very useful squadplayer

2641~~~
Why Carrick was just as bad for the entire season, is 33, and people are not writing him off ala Van Persie...all more dog crap!

2642~~~
You say the summer shopping was done with a formation in mind and yet we have tried 3-5-2, the diamond and now this 4-1-4-1 so which formation was in mind when the shopping was done? Where did I mention the word philosphy in my post? We have improved our posession play and are now keeping the ball more than ever. Fellaini has only featured in a handful of games this season and we have play worse football when he has not been in the team, especially at the beginning of the season. Who are you blaming then exactly? You are single handedly blaming Fellaini for our whole attacking play which is just plainly absurd when other attacking players have performed far worser in some games. I have already said Fellaini is not a defensive midfielder. He players better in a 3 rather than a 2 in my opinion.

You referred to Nolan and were not clear in your post. You put this box to box classification like its a game. He is not your standard high energy midfielder, we can all accept that. He has proved useful when attacking and has provided a useful physical presence in midfield and in the games he has played, we have a good possession record so what turgid player you are referring to, I don't know.  He is also very good technically which alot of people seem to forget. I thought the whole team against City lacked something they showed at Chelsea.

I have simply pointed out LVG is a sucessful coach. I don't have any blinkers on like the anti Felliani ones which you have on. LVG needs to find a formation which fits, personally I would like to see the diamond which with the right players can be our best approach. I think we need points on the board and quick because for all the philosphy talk and improving, it means nothing without points.

2643~~~
You said it yourself Carrick is 32 therefore not in his prime anymore when Fellaini is 27 and logically supposed to show us his best self. Being lenient for a player who isn't in his prime seems logic to me.

2644~~~
You could swap "isn't in his prime" for "is in his first season at his new club" or "is struggling with injuries" or "playing as part of a team having a season from hell" (or all three!) and you'd be talking about Fellaini last season too.

It was a weird season in that way. You had, at most, two United players who actually played consistently well but excuses made for almost every one one of the others apart from the one player who had all their excuses <b>plus</b> the fact he was trying to settle into a new team/club. He basically became a lightening rod for all the anger/discontent about everything else that was going wrong under Moyes (he had the right build for it, to be fair)

2645~~~
I have no problem with Fellaini last season, the fact that he came late, was injured, had to play with Cleverley, was the only addition, under an uncomfortable Moyes wasn't easy.

Now we should except more from Fellaini than Carrick because one his supposed to be the present and the other one is the "past", unless Fellaini is not seen as a starter, then he is fine.

2646~~~
I like Fellaini in the team - his detractors whine about us resorting to the long ball as though that's all we end up doing when he is playing, which is hardly the case. What Fellaini has provided us is an option and that is the mark of many successful United sides under Fergie. So many times we've seen Arsenal derided because not having a PlanB, even the great Barcelona were found wanting more than a few times because they stuck to playing just one way. Last year we cried about the 81 crosses against Fulham because we didn't know how to change up. With the teams we've been putting out, with Fellaini we have the options on the field to play the more technical game and at the same time still play the "hoof ball", a totally valid way to play football, though to some it has no place on the field.

Fellaini himself now that he is playing with confidence and well does not only give us the physical side though - in the recent games he's shown it's not just about elbows and chest downs. He isn't a technical wizard and isn't playing the most creative / penetrative passing game but, he has not been completely devoid of it either. Our lack of creativity has not down to him being on the field, that falls more on LVG trying to find balance as well as the players like ADM, Rooney, Januzaj that are supposed to give us that creative edge not performing as they can.

Like when Park, Fletcher, O'Shea used to be on the team, they had their job on the field while players like Ronnie, Tevez, Rooney, Nani etc were the ones that gave us that thrust going forward.

He had a shit first year but, he is doing his job right now quite well and while there is room for improvement, others need to step up their performances.

2647~~~
Indeed. Someone posted stats a while back which showed no difference in the average number of long passes, before and after the WBA game.

2648~~~
Good post. 

His qualities as a footballer seem largely underrated, which I imagine is because people have decided they just plain don't like him, so he has no chance of redeeming himself, no matter what he does. Even by playing well, which he has been doing.

He's doing his job on the pitch to good effect. He's winning us the midfield battle and retaining possession. I do prefer Herrera, but Fellaini is doing things that I doubt anyone else in our squad could do. Fair play to him for taking his chance when Herrera got injured. He's deservedly remained in the side.

2649~~~
I like it when he plays and he is instructed to stay close to Blind or whoever else is playing and not when he ventures forward.

2650~~~
At the moment he is doing his job and doing it well but I still don’t think his performances are anything to write home about, he was bought to be the player he was at Everton, that is what the over rated fee and his wages reflect and he has to reach that level to justify staying in the team for this rest of this season and beyond. 

I don’t think it can be disputed that we will ever get the best out of him unless we play a lot more direct and bring his chest control and aerial ability into play a lot more regularly, he doesn’t possess the skill set to be as effective in a side playing a style of football with more emphasis on passing and movement at the top level. To be honest I hope our aim going forward is the latter rather than the former but in the meantime whatever personnel or formation helps us get points is all I am interested in.

2651~~~
Fellaini gives us a plan B but he also makes our plan A less effective by removing the energy, tidiness and impetus that Herrera gives us and offering less overall in return.

2652~~~
That's a good and succinct way of putting it. I feel like we have been extremely lacking in creativity since Fellaini came on against West Brom, some players despite not playing badly at all aren't necessarily good for the rest of the team based on what their strengths are.

2653~~~
Big teams have big
I agree about the fact that Herrera brings much more energy and drive to the midfield but I honestly think Fellaini is the tidier player. I think it'll come down to horses for courses. Big CL game against a technically advanced team? Throw Fellaini on to disrupt their rhythm.

2654~~~
I'd throw Herrera in to disrupt their rhythm. A technically advanced team will hardly play long balls, they will play fast passing game, where Herrera's energy and ability to read the game will be more handy imo. I can see Fellaini giving away too many dangerous fouls against the likes of Bayern and Barca.

2655~~~
Fellaini is able to disrupt more than just winning long balls. Fabregas wasn't largely ineffective against us because Fellaini was stopping him getting on the end of long balls.

2656~~~
"Tidiness" to me implies good ball retention and really accurate passing. Which isn't really something I'd associate with Herrera so far. 

Agree about energy and impetus but they're essentially the same thing and you're being very generous to attribute that to Hererra when it's been most evident in games where Di Maria also played in central midfield.  

I like Herrera. Especially his eye for a through ball and willingness to get stuck in. I think he's being put on a bit of a pedestal in his absence though.

2657~~~
Can't we play both of them for different jobs? I don't like saying it but maybe the best thing would be for RVP to be injured, so Rooney goes back up top.

2658~~~
Do you think that Fellaini could do a decent job against a fast technical team? Who in Bayern or Real teams can he mark out of the game in such a way that the whole opposition team suffers?  I can see him chasing the ball all day long, being one pass behind the play.

2659~~~
The deep lying playmaker just like he did against Chelsea with Fabregas. You probably envisaged him chasing the ball all day long against Chelsea too but its not how it turned out is it?

2660~~~
Chelsea are not a fast technical team imo. Who in Real is the deep lying playmaker? Can you see him marking Modric out of the game? Can you see him marking Schweinsteiger out of the game? Herrera for me all day long, the guy reads the game well, is a faster and much better technically player, can defend as well. I'd rather have him against Modric than Fellaini.  To each their own, I guess.

2661~~~
I'm amazed that you wouldn't think of Chelsea as a fast, technical team - with Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar and Willian (not to mention Matic, the defensive 4 and Costa) they are clearly both fast and technical. And, for Real, wouldn't you be looking at Kroos rather than Modric.

2662~~~
Kroos and Xabi Alonso I was more thinking of, and I can see him doing a man marking job on either. 

I never said who I prefer anyway, I was calling out your insinuation that Fellaini is only useful if the other team plays long balls which he has proven to be wrong against both Chelsea and City.

2663~~~
I dont think Chelsea played very fast against us. I'd say that Real and Bayern would play much faster and keep the ball much better than Chelsea. Agreed about Kroos, you are spot on there. Due to the style of their play, I can see Modric taking over Kroos' duties, while Fellaini would be just trying to chase the ball. I'd rather play a midfield trio of Blind+Di Maria+ Herrera rather than Blind+Di Maria+Fellaini against any top European team.

2664~~~
I think he picked Fellaini against Chelsea and City because of the size of their midfielders. He played well so kept him in, but there will be games where that won't be needed and we will need more mobility. The injuries in defence are making it likely he is needed to protect the defence. More recruits in defence and we can change the midfield depending on the opposition. I agree that he has earned his place, but surely if LvG is saying that is the case, then it has to apply to all areas of the pitch and he can't have blindspots in other areas. Herrera will have to be patient and there have been no signs whatsoever that he isn't being, Fellaini might have to show the same patience at other times.

2665~~~
You're right - but you can argue that that was because their sparkplug is Fabregas and Fellaini played him out of the game (at least in the first half).

2666~~~
I'm surprised to hear that because I'd definitely say his ball retention's been one of his strengths so far. There's been a few times where he's been tackled a little too easily but he's moved the ball around very well. Fair point re: energy and impetus but the reason I used both words is because he offers a tremendous amount of energy when out of possession - more than anyone else in the squad, IMO - and he adds impetus through his use of the ball. He moves it around very quickly and is a very positive passer. You might well be right that he's been put on a pedestal in his absence, particularly given who he's been replaced by, but I've been impressed with him in every game he's played for us and saw nothing to suggest he should be benched.

2667~~~
I've already mentioned this in the Herrera thread, but I don't see how Fellaini's displaced Herrera given that Fellaini's playing a different role to Herrera (I believe the West Brom substitution has led many to believe this is the case). Fellaini's been okay in the box-to-box midfield role where he's not positionally restricted in any way. His aggression off the ball has been useful in unsettling the opposition (one of his biggest strengths), and his ball retention and physical presence has made it useful for us to maintain possession. However, his lack of vision, creativity, and ability to dictate play is why we played Mata and Rooney beside him (though it should have been Herrera instead of either of them in midfield). However, both struggle playing deeper, and both are much better in the final third. It is for this reason that we badly need Herrera on the pitch (whether in place of Fellaini or alongside him).

One thing I've noticed is that Fellaini's always at his best in midfield alongside a midfield dictator like Arteta or if he goes out wide to create 3 vs. 2's and have the wingers or full backs cut in. Recently, for us, Felllaini's provided support for the wingers only against Chelsea. Otherwise, he was poor in doing this and often left our wingers isolated.

To bring the best out of Fellaini, either we play Herrera alongside him, or van Gaal tells him to support the wingers more and create 3 vs. 2's at the channels.

2668~~~
I am pretty sure that it was done keeping 352 in mind, of course I can't be 100%. 
<ul>
<li>The purchase of another top striker instead of a winger to me suggests that it was done with the intention of playing 2 strikers. 
</li>
<li>LvG on multiple occassions mentioned that Di Maria was bought to play in the midfield. 
</li>
<li>We also sent two of wingers on loan, and Valencia is primarily used a RWB or RB. 
</li>
<li>Rojo's purchase, and Blakcett's promotion at the time, also suggests that he had every intention of playing with 3 CB's. </li>
</ul>There was a stat posted here on comparions between Moyes' and Van Gaal's first 10 games incharge, and it showed that there wasn't much in the possession numbers between the two seasons. In fact, last season was slightly better. We had insane possession in the Palace game as their plan was to sit back and only use long ball to their isolated striker/winger. It was quite similar to the Fulham crossing game, in which we had 75% possession. Also, possession doesn't mean anything if it is not meaningful. We weren't able to penetrate Palace's defense and most, if not all, of our shots were from outside the box, including the goal. 

I don't care enough about players to fall into the category of anti-Fellaini or anti-anyone, I only care about United as rest everything is transient. The frustration is not with the player, but with his use in the team. Fellaini is who he is, he has his limitations and you can only play a certain style of football with him present in the middle; that is what I am anti. 

You are correct, we do need points at the moment, and the style of play can be secondary for the time being. The problem is that we have scored only 5 in the last 4 games. So, at the moment, it's a bit of nothing. The manager hasn't been able to improve the style, nor has been able to fetch the points.

2669~~~
Fair enough, those are mitigating circumstances, but he was beyond awful throughout the season and looked like a championship player in most of the big games.

Really? In big games, I can only think of Barca consistently dominating us in CM, and that's a team full of midgets. Liverpool away, tend to come out like a pack of wolves and we tend to struggle against that. Either way, technically wise, Fellaini isn't the man to win any midfield battle, it's one of his weaker attributes. Even physically, can you name any top midfielder whose main attributes are physical?

Ironically, that's benefitting Fellaini at the moment, he's had a couple of good performances recently, but not enough to convince me he should be starting ahead of our 3 other CMs regularly. 

The whole team was crap. Carrick has anchored our midfield for the last 8 years, which happens to be the most successful time in our club's history both domestically and in Europe. He was our players' player of the season just the year before, holding together a midfield without any half decent partners, and we won the league comfortably. That gives a lot more confidence that last season was a blip, whereas Fellaini had no such pedigree to draw upon. He'd performed well in CM for a midtable club, before being proven better used as a second striker in 12/13.

People, well people with half a brain, aren't writing Carrick off, because 33 isn't that old anymore (see Scholes, Pirlo peaking in their mid-30s in a deep lying role, Xabi alonso doing well at a similar age, Gerrard and Lampard playing into their mid-30s, even Giggs having stormers in CM late into his 30s) and because Carrick doesn't rely on physical ability and has been free of muscle injuries during his career.

2670~~~
As you yourself say later in your post - the entire team was crap. I can think of De Gea and Januzaj who did well, pretty much the rest of the team looked "championship level" a lot of the time. Hardly a good environment for a new player to come in and settle in the team.

This idea that Fellaini is technically bereft and that playing him necessitates us becoming Stoke is ridiculous though. Stats have shown that with Fellaini on the pitch we haven't been playing any more long balls than without him.

2671~~~
I agree it wasn't the best of times for him to come in, but he was truly awful last season at times. His performance against Bayern was horrendous, for example.

I think Fellaini is ok technically. But he wants too much time on the ball, and loses the ball when he's in tight spaces (except when it comes to his chest, where he's actually very good). On top of that, he's not very ambitious with his passing, preferring safe options, and I've seen no evidence that he can play killer passes consistently. This means that in games like Palace last week, he's precisely the type of player we could do without. I don't think opposition midfielders are worried if they sit deep and allow Fellaini time on the ball.

2672~~~
This is exactlyy point as well, and I believe that, against smaller teams, we are better off opting for more creativity and attacking impetus. Besides, it's not like Herrera's that soft on the ball.

However, I do see Fellaini being useful with his aggression and presence against the bigger teams, making it difficult for the opposition to deal with him, and for providing us another attacking option in the final third. However, for us to not be toothless on the attack, we need Herrera or someone like him to partner Fellaini, who is at his best in midfield alongside/behind a playmaker.

Looks like a coming together, with him ramming him.

2675~~~
There was no need for that.

2676~~~
Exactly! And it's not exactly a one off with him.

2677~~~
What the....

I have no idea why he feels the need to keep doing that.

2678~~~
Man.......fellaini and is elbows <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2679~~~
He's big,
He's hairy
His elbows are fecking scary
FELLAINI FELLAINI

2680~~~
I love it, football is a mans game and smacking another in the face with your elbow is just you asserting your dominance over a weaker specimen...
<span style="color: #ffffff">is joke</span>

2681~~~
More forearm then elbow.

2682~~~
Looks like this guy is our holding CM <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

2683~~~
Carrick.

2684~~~
Isn't he injured?

2685~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I must be in a silly mood because this really made me giggle.

2686~~~
Oh come on, there is bugger all in that - he doesn't even move his elbow towards Allan for feck sake...

2687~~~
He got the ball first.

2688~~~
Yep a nothing collision of 2 players.

2689~~~
Ah, feck's sake, thanks for that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2690~~~
Had to chuckle. What the heck is this. It's like a steamtrain controlled by an idiot, and Allen is unfortunate to be so short and be right under it

2691~~~
feckin hell. From front angle, it looks as if a kid rammed into a giant!

2692~~~
For those who are shocked about Fellaini clattering Allen, Allen actually elbowed Fellaini in the ribs earlier on in the game, so I guess that's why he got him back. Does it make it right, no, but that's football. Happens all the time, although Fellaini doesn't normally need an excuse. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously, though, I know he can be dirty at times, but every, or most teams have their tough players who can mix it, and he's that player for us.

2693~~~
Elbowing a kopite in the face, what a guy.

2694~~~
Yep, he's the footballing equivalent of a goon in ice hockey. That Allen collision is nasty.

2695~~~
We've never had a player I like watching less, ugh.

2696~~~
Valencia since last season is still worse

2697~~~
He's a physical player but he's not the bloodthirsty pantomime villain a lot of people like to think he is. Half the time he's 'elbowed' someone it's hardly seemed intentional, it's more that he's a bit clumsy and that his arms are basically permanently at other players' head heights because he's a giant. He's not intentionally throwing elbows at people like Alan Shearer used to, if he was he'd be causing a lot more damage that he is.

The video that's going around looks bad but Allen gets caught by a forearm not an elbow and if you replace a 6' 4" Fellaini and a 5' 6" Allen with two 6 footers it's a nothing collision which no-one talks about. It's just a shame for Allen that the guy who clatters him had 10 inches on him.

edit - also (going on the evidence of the Vine clip as I can't find a longer one), despite the outcome, Allen's the one who was reckless and committed a foul. Fellaini plays the ball past Allen, Allen obstructs him and Fellaini's momentum wipes Allen out.

2698~~~
I'd say his passing has been pretty loose in general. I love his energy, close control and willingness to get stuck in but I wouldn't say passing or ball retention are a strong point. He doesn't look like a player that really strikes the ball particularly well whether passing or shooting. It's always just a little bit loose which results in more stray passes than you'd expect from a player of his calibre. That said I still like him a lot as a player. The positives greatly outweight the negatives. He's going to have a very good career at United imo.

2699~~~
I think Allen's height (lack of) makes that clip look worse than it is, as it is more of a clash between two players than anything else.

2700~~~
With Blind out we will be seeing more and more of Fellaini. Long balls to the big lad!

Arsenal never do well against long ball merchants!

2701~~~
Oh dear. Good thing Allen was moving his head back to absorb the momentum of Fellaini's forearm, or else....

2702~~~
Fellaini is a massive cnut. That's three separate elbow / forearm smash incidents I can remember since he joined us.

2703~~~
Its not Fellaini's fault Allen is so short he basically ran into his elbow. 

Its sad to see some United fans cant wait for an oportuninty to get on his back and call him a cu.t..

2704~~~
I'll never understand how he only has two red cards in his career.

2705~~~
I'm the first to criticise a Fellaini elbow as I know just how damaging a deliberate elbow can be. However, with this one, I truly believe it was unintentional. It was a hard challenge and it was just an unfortunate collision.

2706~~~
He didn't push his arm out into his head, he purely held his forearm out for protection. Unfortunately for Allen he is a ridiculously small man child, so running into a giant Fellaini was a bad choice.

As others have mentioned, Fellaini has been guilty of doing silly stuff before, but on this occasion it was made to look worse because he is so much bigger.

2707~~~
Nowt wrong with what he did there, it was just unfortunate. Some proper idiots in this thread once again.

2708~~~
It's nearly as bad as the "spitting" claims <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

As was said, Fellaini is huge, his shoulders are the height of other players faces which means that if Fellaini is going shoulder to shoulder with someone, he does occasionally end up catching them in the face, but he isn't actually doing anything much different to any other player.

2709~~~
He got the ball, Allen didn't. If the sizes were reversed then we'd be complaining about Allen clattering Fellaini.

2710~~~
He should keep his fecking elbows down.

2711~~~
His elbows are no higher in relation to his height than Allen's are. It's not his fault Allen missed the ball completely and is a midget.

2712~~~
If Fellaini doesn't protect himself, he loses 1 or 2 ribs on that collision. Allen needs to control himself.
.

2713~~~
Unless he finds a way to make his upper arms 6 inches longer I'm afraid that's not really possible. 

Fellaini very rarely does anything with his arms that you'd pull a shorter person up for. Him being tall doesnt mean that he should be penalised for not having his arms glued to his sides at all times when challenging for a ball.

2714~~~
Looking at the video it looks like an unlucky collision, however I read that Allen did clatter into Fellaini earlier in the game so there could well be a bit of 'afters' involved 

and lets face it, the more scousers you can elbow in the face, the better <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2715~~~
Boban doesn't rate him, does he? "Seriously, he can't play football" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Hard to argue with that.

2716~~~
I'd be all up for Fellaini being more of a nasty bugger like that. Arsenal don't deal with physicality well, let Fellaini bully them.

2717~~~
I still can't see anything wrong with what he did. Got the ball first and Allen ran into him.

2718~~~
The clip was only made worse because it shows Allen bleeding in the end.  Otherwise it was just a nasty collision that happens all the time, Fellaini did not look like he was aiming for the guys head, he had his arms out to protect himself.  Should he have led with his elbow?  Probably not, he's clumsy but not dirty.

2719~~~
Boban! Now there was a midfield player of the highest caliber. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2720~~~
Heh. Looks like a really late challenge from Allen. He got what he deserved.

2721~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2722~~~
How many elbow incidents has he had since signing with us?

2723~~~
Was it elbow or arm?

2724~~~
Looked like more of a forearm smash than swing of the elbow. There's definite anger in his face as he extends his arms to the face. I was watching the game and a few mins earlier Allen had got the better of him in a challenge and Fellaini stayed down holding his knee, Bale refused to put the ball out and it led to some confrontations. This was a chance for Fellaini to get revenge.

2725~~~
It was a forearm, and it pretty much looked like Allen was running into Fellaini. Still, though, the collision was very bad, and Allen avoided a very bad collision by leaning back his head.

Seems like a humble guy and that video is even more evidence of why we keep Ando around <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2729~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ando. It is all he is good for.

2730~~~
Once again one of our better players so far (not that that is saying much admittedly). Has won the ball back several times, should have had Wilshere sent off, and has contributed in attack.

I don't think the 3-5-2 really works for Fellaini though, really he needs more of a playmaker alongside him - Herrera would be ideal I reckon.

2731~~~
We need our forwards to make runs when he gets the ball. At the min all we have is Valencia/Angel avaliable when he picks the ball up in the middle. Carrick isn't doing too much to control the rhythm either.

2732~~~
Won the ball a couple of times, easily beaten by opposition players lot more times

The best thing he did was not react too badly when Wilshire tried to butt him

Ander cant come on soon enough

2733~~~
He's been good, don't get the abuse he's getting in the Matchday thread.

2734~~~
He's played well, but hopefully he doesn't lose his head. He's winning all of his physical battles, but is obviously getting done when the ball is on the ground since he's no sprinter himself. Still, I think he's important to us in this game, otherwise we wouldn't stand a chance in midfield. He's one of the few who doesn't fall to pieces when he's pressed.

2735~~~
He can't defend for shit.

Ergo, playing him a two man midfield is stupid. As proven today. Like a knife through butter.

2736~~~
He's played well, our best player in the half alongside DDG. I don't know if that's a good thing though.

2737~~~
He's been fine. One of our best, but yes a bad bunch. Needs Herrera in the midfield with him IMO. Get RvP off.

2738~~~
He's been very good so far. One of our best players in the last six weeks.

2739~~~
If that performance is classed as good then I give up, he's won a couple of tackles and headed the ball a few times, but he's bypassed by their players like he isn't even there when anyone runs at him, just a huge hole to run at with him and the equally slow Carrick in there together.

2740~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2741~~~
Fellaini in midfield two is a disaster. As shown in the last 3 games, he's a beast in midfield three, when doesn't have specific duty at defending but have a license going forward.

2742~~~
Herrera needs to come on NEXT to Fellaini, not in place of him.

2743~~~
Largely agree, still not convinced him at all. There was a moment when he charged towards Wilshere, who swept right passed him, leaving us incredibly exposed in midfield. His tactical awareness is very poor sometimes.

2744~~~
Casually gifted the ball to them again there, although to be fair he did make some effort to track back.

2745~~~
Fellaini has played decently in the last few, nothing that special. He's had more good moments than bad so far but that's it. Up to now nothing he's done has been more than 6 out of 10.

2746~~~
He's been alright but that mistake was terrible. I agree that he should stay on  though, get Herrera on for van Persie.

2747~~~
Yea that was a horrible backpass, glad it didn't backfire.

Thank feck he was around Gibbs when Szczesny barraged into him. Or they barraged into each other actually <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2748~~~
Good play releasing the ball early for Di Maria on the counter. Wish he would do that a bit more often, but very happy he did it there

2749~~~
Very good pass. Well done afroman.

2750~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Perfectly timed.

2751~~~
Herrera offers us so much more but credit to Fellaini hes come in and done really well. 

I still think Herrera is recovering from his rib injury and when hes fully fit he'll come in but Fellaini has really given us just what we've needed in the past few games.

2752~~~
Another very good game. Thought he was all over the shop defensively in the first half but once we got our shape, I thought he was very good, broke up play, actually looked quite composed on the ball. Very pleased with the performance.

It's still Herrera everyday of the week for me but nothing but praise with Fellaini today.

2753~~~
Great time to release the ball for Rooney's goal, been ok other than that, bullied Arsenal around but I'm not a fan of 2 man midfield of him and Carrick to be fair.

Give me Carrick-Herrera-Fellaini any time of the day though.

2754~~~
Decent game from him. Won some headers and broke up play.

2755~~~
Well done Fellaini! was very good in the second half.

2756~~~
People are still on his back? He has done a job for us in all the big games he's played in this season. It was a good performance against Arsenal.

2757~~~
He was fantastic for the job he was obviously set out to do, but he's a tad slow (being next to Carrick didn't help).

But yeah, great game from him and my 2nd MOTM behind De Gea.

2758~~~
That pass for ADM for the second goal was perfect. He's done well, a good example that through hardwork a player can earn his place.

2759~~~
Much much better second half.

2760~~~
Good match overall with some shaky moments. His pass in the build up to the goal was perfect.

2761~~~
Doing well.

2762~~~
He played well today.

Played to his strengths which helped him a lot.

2763~~~
Was awful for first 20-25 min, much like almost whole team but did grow well into game. His physical attributes are really key sometimes.

2764~~~
All over the place defensively in the first half. His aerial ability and chest control certainly helped us all game long.

2765~~~
Fantastic. We don't score without his superb pass to Di Maria.

2766~~~
Excellent second half.

2767~~~
Lost Mertesacker so many times on the corners, offered so little defensively, and his 'physicality' is fecking useless. Arteta was scrapping with him so easily. Good pass for the second goal but man, I'm really watching a different game it seems.

2768~~~
Yea, you've called his last matches average prior to his game when talking about absence of Herrera in the starting XI so yea, you wanted to watch a different game and so you did.

Agree about losing Mertesacker on corners by the way, difference is that despite not winning them, he's still put him off balance every single corner so he couldn't take a shot on target iirc.

2769~~~
He is never going to be a fan favorite but in the context off the match he had a decent performance.

2770~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Right then. He's alright when we need to see out games (which is what we basically had to because of how we lined up today) but besides that he hasn't played 'well'.

2771~~~
He's been in good form, how anyone could deny this is beyond me. I'll have Herrera next to him, not in place of him.

2772~~~
Fellaini this season has been very impressive, never thought he would make it here but so far so good 2014.

2773~~~
Laughable.

One of our best players today. Did plenty of good work defensively and was involved with both of our goals (causing confusion in Arsenal defence for the first, playing a good pass to ADM for the second).

<b>STILL </b>though (yes I am using formatting, its that important) the usual suspects on here cannot bring themselves to admit they were wrong. I really cant be bothered to go back and look, but I would be willing to bet that you lot and the others who still criticise him, are the same people who
a) Didnt want us to sign him
b) Never rated him
c) Thought we should have sold him last summer.

We have one game left this month against Hull, and if Fellaini plays and performs to the same level as he has done, he should be our player of the month. That isnt to say that he has been 10/10, but that he has in my view been the best of the bunch.

2774~~~
He's a good player. Certainly not the player we seen last season and never was. Happy for him.

2775~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Nice little foul on Gibbs to help set up the first goal as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2776~~~
Its impossible for him to win over "fans" who refuse to accept he is a decent player.

2777~~~
The best thing about it, he is no longer a laughing stock

fecking delighted for him and I always did stick by him...he was good today but did have a couple of very dangerous sloppy passes. I would prefer to see Herrera. But I am please Fellaini is part of the squad

Had a hand on both goals today too

2778~~~
Good performance in the second half.

2779~~~
Thought he started really poorly but was brilliant in the second half. Well done, he's turned his united career around completely. Won't be an automatic starter ever but he's a very useful player to have.

2780~~~
Wins the ball back well. I would like to see Herrera next to him.

2781~~~
Defensively, he was an absolute mess in the first half. A good second half (which I've already posted, but you've ignored) doesn't change that.

2782~~~
Laughable

He was offside and put two arms on a defender and helped him into the goalkeeper. He wasn't causing confusion, he was causing which on most occasions is given for a foul. Or an offside. He was lucky

Of course you make out that he's worked a miracle, because thats what you do.

Time to put the crazies on ignore

2783~~~
What does playing well equate to? Only dribbling and pinging 40 yard passes? He played well in that second half, won a lot of balls and set-off Di Maria for the second goal. He is currently getting picked on merit.

2784~~~
You are exaggerating. The entire team was being overrun in the first half. Fellaini won the ball back several times and rarely lost it.
Its the same as when people say he was shite last season when the truth is more that the entire team was shite, and he was a part of it.

2785~~~
What a player he looks this season. I love watching him.

2786~~~
Credit where due once again. He was prolific today, he saw a lot of the ball and made only a couple of poor touches. Haters cannot deny that he offers this team something. He may not be the glamour player we want, be he's doing his job.

2787~~~
There were times when he was tactically all over the place in midfield. He gifted them the ball at one point, while he'd occasionally go charging towards an Arsenal midfielder who would casually stroll by him, leaving us exposed. He did fairly well overall and showed improvement in the 2nd half, such as the very good assist before the assist for our 2nd goal, but I'm still not completely convinced by him overall and I think he has some severe weaknesses as a footballer which, despite his strengths, can often be exposed.

Also for the first goal, there's a solid argument that a foul should have been given for the confusion you're talking about.

Believe it or not, some of us just are not big fans of him as a player. I've given him some praise when he's improved, which he undoubtedly has, but I still think he has some major weaknesses. Am I not allowed to think that, though?

2788~~~
Miles better than last season. Keep it up.

2789~~~
He's definitely a decent player and was better than decent overall today. He was good

However I'm sure Ander would have been a better choice and unfortunately for Fellaini, when we have 2 Cms he'd be the straight swap. Because Fellaini has no capacity to play as the holding player who shields the defence like Carrick or Blind. The same goes for Ander

2790~~~
Arsenal away was always the right sort of game for him. Big part in both goals.

2791~~~
He was excellent 2nd half.

Meh first half.


Though even 2nd half he made that one big cockup on which Wilshere got injured.

2792~~~
Should be played with Herrera and Carrick with  Rooney upfront. Great performance in the second half.

2793~~~
Did well to keep his cool when Wilshit provoked him.

2794~~~
Because Ander wasn't creating and scoring goals for fun and being one of the best midfielders in the premier league when he was playing?

2795~~~
One of the first names on the team sheet currently.

2796~~~
The offside call was far, far too close to call and the attack should have the benefit of the doubt. Traditionally that would mean that (in this instance) Arsenal fans would call it offside, United fans would call it onside.

Of course, in this instance, because it is Fellaini, there are also United fans saying it was off. About par for the course really. If it were any other player in an identical situation I bet you wouldnt be saying it was offside.
Roughly the same line of reasoning can be applied to the "foul" you are claiming.

2797~~~
Machiavellian genius of a mistake?

2798~~~
Fellaini is good in games like today where our defense is as youthful. Nothing wrong with his performance. Some dodgy moments but they all have those. He got in and around the ball and that's what we have to do.

2799~~~
Determined and credible performance today and incredibly our most in form player right now, having put together a good run of consecutive performances.

Can't help but be pleased for him: he is certInly making a role for himself in the squad and I can see a future for him at the club.

2800~~~
He was onside.

2801~~~
Aside from his head, which is a part of the body he can score with and therefore off

2802~~~
Obviously you can think what you want. I just find the level of vitriol and abuse that he gets in relation to other players completely embarrassing. Like when he was booed during pre-season (and then scored a goal), there are a lot of fans so set in their opinion that they will stick their heads in the sand and ignore anything that challenges it.

Everyone has players that they "arent a big fan of", but if you call yourself a Manchester United supporter then you (not necessarily you personally) should be getting behind the team, not looking for the slightest reason to have a go at Fellaini and demand him dropped/sold.

2803~~~
Broke up arsenal attacks time after time.  Was great to watch

2804~~~
If he was offisde (which he wasnt) then it was his foot which was closest.

Again, the attacker gets the benefit of the doubt and it was a close call. Any other player and you would say it was onside, but because it is Fellaini you will say he was off. Blah blah blah, same old crap.

2805~~~
Fine, although I'm not sure in what world saying you feel someone was decent but still showed some of his major weaknesses is abuse in any way whatsoever.

All of the "formatting is necessary" stuff strikes me as you being someone who's making it his business to go around and correct us bad fans for being wrong about a player who's had a decent month or so for us.

2806~~~
I don't think he was offside (it looked like it was only his arms offside) but that's a blatant foul which he was lucky to get away with. Both he and the team deserved a bit of luck though. Wilshere shoud've been sent off for his feeble headbutt on Fellaini and Rooney should've been one on one if not for a poor offside, so it evens out in that sense.

2807~~~
Ekeke sorry but he was onside but why are you bothered? I'm more bothered about the one the linesman got wrong. The one where we were onside by a mile. It all evens itself out ..I guess

2808~~~
He isn't suited at all to playing in a 2 man midfield but hopefully when everyone is fit he won't have to. We still saw a lot of his good attributes today, but agree that playing him in 2 man mf with arsenal throwing everyone forward isn't going to make him look v good.

Still, with confidence high his passing is so much better and he would have lost today without his aerial game, he gave us our only outlet until our goal, which is why we won the game

2809~~~
To be honest, I didnt actually think we should have signed him when we did - or rather, we should have signed someone else in addition to him.

<a class="username" data-user="90628, @Shyftyy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90628/">@Shyftyy</a>  in the matchday thread summed up how I feel on it quite well - I feel compelled to defend Fellaini just because so many fans have it in for him. I am aware that I now look like the Mad Winger of the Fellaini thread, but I have never actually regarded him as being a key player for us, simply that he deserves a lot more credit than most fans are prepared to give him.

In the last month, the only player you can make a case for being more deserving of Player of the Month than Fellaini is De Gea in my opinion, but whilst folk herald De Gea as the prodigal son of Schmeichel and VDS, Fellaini still seems to divide opinion in a way that has been highlighted in this (and plenty of other) threads.

The formatting comment was meant to be tongue in cheek, also.



edit: I agree that he is better in a 3-man midfield although I could see him playing in a 2-man midfield alongside Herrera as well.

2810~~~
It was fantastic to see him break up Arsenal attacks and nick the ball time and again. I think that was the big attribute missing in him last year.

2811~~~
Looking much more like the man who would irritate us beyond belief with his heading and break ups of play when he played for Everton. Great to see him back to his best.

2812~~~
It's ironic that his fanboys are as guilty as the "haters" in their overpraise of him. He improved in the second half and his pass to release Di Maria was weighted perfectly. I still don't think he should ever be a starter for Manchester United and I hate watching him lumbering around in our shirt, that's my right.

2813~~~
I hated him so much, he was soooooooo annoying.

2814~~~
muricah!

2815~~~
The problem with this though is that by targeting supposed agenda-driven posters, most of whom just don't really rate Fellaini, you end up becoming an agenda-driven one yourself. I mean, being honest, how many of your posts in your thread are just you targeting people who are giving him any form of criticism? I don't want to seem like a dick to you, but it seems tiresome. Attack the post itself, and not the poster if you're going to be really critical. Don't want to seem too preachy or anything though.

The difference between De Gea and Fellaini is that while Fellaini's had a month or so of decent matches, De Gea's consistently been one of our best players for a good couple of years now and has established himself as one of the best GK's around.

Not to mention that being one of our better players this month is hardly an endorsement, is it? Our defence has been weak for the most part, while very few of our attackers have consistently been excellent, with Di Maria not at his best and RVP looking average. I'd say Shaw has more of a POTM case than Fellaini, though, since he's been very impressive and consistent.

2816~~~
And now he's our annoying afro-man. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2817~~~
I was really pissed off with him in the first half but second half he was very good - I can't remember him doing anything wrong really after HT..

2818~~~
Eh? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2819~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2820~~~
Lost in all of this is that Fellaini has reinvigorated himself under LvG - who now has an extra weapon to deploy for games that require more physical matchups in midfield.

2821~~~
I don't see how that's funny, some of the posts on here are like little nazi's running around demanding everyone group think with their opinion.

2822~~~
Played well today but I really don't like our approach play when is in the team. We seem to be content on hoofing it to his chest for him to bring it down and play a simple pass out wide. Whilst it CAN be effective, its not what we are about.

On the other hand, he provides us with a physical presence in midfield and seems to be improving in his covering of our back four. His workrate is also improving by the match. Not to mention we haven't conceded on set pieces since he has been inserted in the lineup (then again nor has he scored from one).

A bit of a conundrum and not sure whether we want him in our lineup at the expense of say someone like Herrera or Mata. Regardless, he seems to be quite effective in the big matches we have played.

2823~~~
Good performance from him today solid throughout midfield. Hope he goes on from here. Really need some depth in the middle of the park.

2824~~~
It's that fecking 352. In this system it's the back three that play the ball from the back and are meant to play it nicely, etc. Problem is when they shit themselves and are afraid to pass it on the ground and then they hoof it.

2825~~~
I understand the point you are making - the issue on this particular topic is that I find a lot of folk fairly blind to reason. "Attack the post, not the poster" only goes so far when people will pretty much just make things up (for example, Ekeke's insistence that he was offside in the buildup to the first goal).

This is another good example of people just being unreasonable about it;
It can get hard to remain constructive and objective when faced by this sort of crap.

I love De Gea and put him as my MotM today, and maybe my memory of this period is wrong, but when he joined the club he had a tough first season - much like Fellaini. Also much like Fellaini, De Gea's performances improved substantially after that first season. <i>Unlike </i>Fellaini however, as soon as De Gea started putting in those good performances, he became a fan favourite. It feels like Fellaini needs to single handedly win us the league before he will be considered worthy of being on our paylist by some fans.

Exactly, we have been stricken by injuries and even though we have started winning matches, the performances have often been sub par. RVP has been useless, ADM before today has been poor for several games (even today he missed a 1-on-1 which could have cost us two points if Arsenal made their late pressure count), Rooney has been average until today, Mata has been on near-RVP levels of uselessness until last week...the list goes on.

Fellaini has come into the midfield and has generally performed well in comparison to other players. He is easily above average (in terms of performance), and I would say that he, Shaw, Blind and DDG have been the standout players for over a month - out of those four though, Shaw, Blind and DDG have had a lot of praise whilst Fellaini is still a divisive issue. That to me says it all.

2826~~~
And why can't both of them play together? Ander was injured and so he was out of the team and Fellaini has given a good account of himself ever since, both of them can play in a midfield 3. Fellaini deserves to keep getting picked. It's not rocket science.

2827~~~
Probably right with that assessment. Especially in the big games where marking is tight and space is rare. I don't blame our young defenders for hoofing it up at times.

Hopefully we go back to a more effective back four where we actually play our best football.

Its good to have an option like Fellaini around though. He puts himself about especially in the big matches.

2828~~~
He can be solid and effective and he's done well this season but I don't like him in the team. A penalty waiting to happen.

2829~~~
...and don't forget the fee - which is still brought up by some and probably will till the crack o' doom.

I think it's fairly obvious that many were seriously disappointed when Fellaini turned out to be our only signing last season - and they took it out on him then as they still do now.

And some have gone so far in declaring him useless that it's impossible to back down from their position. I'd add, also, that a significant amount of our fans were adamant Fellaini would be shown the door by Louis (because clearly, Louis of all people will have no use for a hoof ball merchant like Fellaini) and that lot probably find it a bit hard to swallow that the same Louis actually gave the big fecker a fair chance - and that the big fecker took his chance well.

2830~~~
I really want to see us play a good old 4-3-3. Fellaini alongside Herrera and Blind/Carrick would be a good combination I think.

2831~~~
Didnt start too good. He was pretty good in the second half though and got us a bit of control in the midfield as the match progressed. Has been in good form but it's a shame that Herrera can't play.

The only thing that irks me is the tendency to go long with Fellaini in the team. There were periods in the match 
(Esp in the first 35-40 mins) when a ball to his head was our sole out ball and we didn't bother passing the ball or counter-attacking even. Not blaming him for it and the team is more to blame but the long ball option shouldn't be overused.

2832~~~
"It's my right". Don't be so dramatic about it, no one's telling you what to think.

2833~~~
This is fair and I was certainly of the mind that we needed another CM as well as Fellaini. There are various mitigating circumstances for last season, and possible explanations as to why he didnt perform; he was carrying a wrist injury for the first half of the season, he had no pre-season with us, and the entire team was playing shite anyway.
Then from the fans point of view, he was too expensive, he was (and still is) a "Moyes man", and he wasnt the Fabregas/Kroos/Vidal/Thiago signing that we were all craving for.

None of the above was his fault, but its easy to see why he wasnt exactly a fan favourite last year. Still to be booing him during preseason this time round was one of the lowest moments I have ever witnessed as a United fan.


I dont agree with the long ball criticisms either. In situations like today, we werent playing it long "for Fellaini" - we were playing it long because we were being pressed in our own half and needed to clear the bloody ball. If Fellaini wasnt playing, and we did the exact same thing, it would be acceptable, but with Fellaini on the pitch it means we must have become Stoke.

Same applies vs City - we were down to 10 men and under a lot of pressure. We arent Barcelona and our CBs have obviously been struggling at playing the ball out from the back, its not a deliberate tactic of "hoof it to Fellaini".

Fellaini showed today that he can still be involved in fast paced counterattacking football, with his pass for the winning goal. He is a good aerial presence in the opposition box, but the stats show that we arent playing more long balls or crosses with him in the team, compared to without him.

2834~~~
He was very effective today but plays in a style most fans don't want to see...I think ultimately whilst we're rebuilding he's of use but will become surplus very quickly when (hopefully) we start to play a more attacking/better style of football.

2835~~~
People keep asking why Herrera's not playing, well, it's because Fellaini's putting in performances like this. Yes, he's not as creative as Herrera, but you'd think we'd have enough creativity in the team already, with Van Persie, Rooney, Di Maria, etc. 

Fellaini's in the team to be a nuisance in both boxes, and yet again, that's what he did today. 

He was actually key to both our goals too. The pass to Di Maria for the second was great, in my opinion. 

Glad he's continuing to silence his critics. Long may it continue.

2836~~~
I wasn't being dramatic, the wording of some of the posts in here are that basically if you don't agree he's a good player then you are just biased, I was simply expressing my right to an opinion, I wasn't the slightest bit worked up. This whole thread is ridiculous no matter which side of the fence you sit on though. At least I'll be honest enough to give him credit for the second half and admit I just hate the type of player he is, others coat their agenda with condescension and attempts at sitting on a high horse.

2837~~~
What "type of player" is Fellaini, in your opinion?

2838~~~
His performances are like night and day now compared to last season. So many goals this season he's had some influence. I'm not saying he's a Rolls Royce midfielder but his ability on the ball is underestimated. The ball out for the second was perfect. What I like about it is he has 'a set of balls' and adds so steel whether legal or illegally. More of the same please....

2839~~~
A cumbersome, lumbering, mobility lacking type of player that sees our team hit endless high balls for knock-ons like we are Stoke, our football at the start of the season was the most exciting it's been in years, since he came in we've went back to functional and at times downright ugly. If we must have a powerhouse CM then make it one who has a much better ground game than him, like Strootman or Schniederlin.

2840~~~
Indeed - it's a bizarre way to look at things. Last season it was Moyes being the mastermind behind the hoofing (which was the only reason he went for Fellaini) - this season it turns out it's Fellaini himself who incredibly enough makes the far more sophisticated Van Gaal opt for the dinosaur tactic. Do people think Fellaini comes up with the gameplan for us?

It's precisely as you say: It's to a large extent panic hoofing because we're not secure enough to make the passing game work as intended - not some sort of tactical approach in itself. And even if it were a tactical approach it would surely be Van Gaal's approach - and not Fellaini's.

2841~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zpsb914448c.jpg" src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zpsb914448c.jpg"/> 

Put in a solid shift helping on defense. Passing accuracy was 85%. Overall made some valuable contributions.  See no reason why he should lose his place in the first XI after today's performance.  Would help if we had a MF beside him more comfortable driving the ball forward at his feet.

2842~~~
So that is all because of Fellaini and nothing to do with the fact we have played against 3 sides in Chelsea, City and Arsenal who have just been way better than us and not allowed us to get a hold of it on the ground?

Several people have posted before that we actually haven't played more long balls since he has come in anyway.

2843~~~
Was involved in both goals today and didn't shy away from the task when things were shit for the first hour.

2844~~~
You and I'd say a fair few opposition players that's come up against him lately especially with the way he's operating constantly sticking in, getting in the way and in general just annoying the crap out of the opposition or lads he's marking. Look at the way he pissed off poor little Jackie there today, he basically just got in the way. Job done.

2845~~~
I don't think Arsenal were way better than us apart from the first 25 minutes, and if we had Herrera in there I think him and Carrick would have helped us control the game better. We were using the hoofing tactic against West Brom as well.

2846~~~
I think he had a good game today and I am one of his worst critics

2847~~~
But the statistics have shown that we played just as many long balls this season without Fellaini, as we do with him in the team?

And do you really think that our defenders play long balls with the aim of finding Fellaini as a deliberate tactic, rather than that they are simply trying to clear their lines, given the amount of mistakes that have resulted from "playing out from the back" this season?

You are criticising style of football but ignoring that we have an entire (and pretty good) XI of players out injured. What about our style of football for the winning goal today? A nice counterattack that Fellaini was involved in by playing a great pass through to ADM?
Or is it the fact that Arsenal pressed us high up the pitch and dominated the first half Fellainis fault?

You are criticising his lack of a "ground game" and again, I will point you to the goal vs West Brom, the pass today, the possession retention statistics...etc, the list goes on.

Basically, you are entitled to your opinion of course, but it contradicts most of the statistics and therefore unless you care to actually try to back up your opinion rather than just throwing out words like "cumbersome" "lumbering" "mobility lacking" and all that jazz, then it can be argued that it is a pretty stupid opinion.

2848~~~
Strange performance. Got us in terrible trouble with some shocking play at times but also opened them up with some super passing, especially for Rooney's goal. By my count the number of good pieces of play just about equalled the number of poor moments.

2849~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at the bolded bit, be careful you dont give some of the others in this thread ideas!

2850~~~
He's nullified Febregas, held his own at city and again today against the leagues best midfielders. He's playing a well as anyone has in our midfield this season.

2851~~~
I imagine our long balls are played as that is what LvG has instructed the team to play, as far as the ground game goes one good strike and one good pass do not a good ground game make, Watch Pogba, De Rossi, Matic, Marchisio, Vidal, Scwheinstieger, Alonso, Gundogan, Modric etc...play and you'll see the type of CM I like watching, and that is what we are talking about here, the elbow out disruptor stuff is not something I want to see from a United CM, it's not the way we have ever played, most keep lauding the fact that he irritates the opposition and plays spoiler, that is not the type of CM I like to watch, it's the type of player that I loathe in other teams, like Tiote for Newcastle as an example.

Is it his fault that Arsenal dominated the first half hour? His and Carricks because the midfield job is to get on the ball and win control of the game so you earn the right to play, at times Wilshire just ghosted past the two of them like they weren't there. It's not a huge surprise that Fellaini got more into the game once he no longer had Wilshire running around him.

2852~~~

2854~~~
That would be scary.  Both of them like to get forward; Fellaini, if he's going to be useful, has to be allowed to do his own thing...

2855~~~
Didn't he use his physical strength to push Lescott away in the air and take down a long, high ball on his chest for that goal?

2856~~~
I don't know why, but for a quick second, I thought someone had photoshopped a copy of beers into Wilshere's left hand. I must be losing it....

2857~~~
Exactly, if we're going to use two box to box midfielders then we need either Carrick or Blind behind them to get it covered.

2858~~~
Because we had 2 CMs and 1 of them needs to help protect the defence.

Neither Fellaini nor Ander can do this, Blind and Carrick do. If we play with 2 CMs (and Rooney in front) then its 1 of the former with 1 of the latter

If we play the diamond, Fellaini and Ander could take one of the sides each. However that means picking between Rooney, Mata and Di Maria in the hole and most likely leaving at least 1 of them out of the team. Rooney can obviously play as 1 of the strikers, Di Maria tried a similar role today and didnt do great

My point is just that Ander was in on form and a key part to the team being in form. So Fellaini having a couple of good games shouldnt mean he's in on merit, if the merit is also with who he is keeping out.

2859~~~
I highly, highly doubt that LVGs instructions involve hoofing the ball to Fellaini. <b>When</b> we are crossing, he provides a target to aim for, and <b>when</b> we play it long, the same applies, but we still do this with or without Fellaini, he simply provides a better target.

He did indeed, and he then took a touch to take it round one of the defenders and finished with aplomb.

2860~~~
I don't like him at all but it is genuinely very useful to have someone who can win aerial balls with ease from goal kicks. It puts the team in a great position on the front foot instead of cheaply losing possession or taking an age to build possession from the back. It's something we used to do an awful lot with Ronaldo - isolate the midget centre mid or left back and ping it out to Ronaldo, safe in the knowledge he's got the strength and skill to bring it under control and start another attack high up the pitch.

2861~~~
Yes, I suppose Fellaini <b>is</b> like Ronaldo.

This looks like a puddle going of on a doberman or rotweiller. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2863~~~
Wilshere's got some big balls. It's a shame they're made out of glass, though.

2864~~~
He will be forever associated with the hoof ball tactics that always remind people of a less sophisticated playing style. Whereas that is true, I feel some people are really extreme about these things. I remember Guardiola employing Javi Martinez as a target man against Dortmund and instructing his players to hoof the ball to him when he felt that it was too risky to play around Dortmund's midfield. The problem is when it is your main tactic but it is a perfectly legitimate tool to use unless you have Xavi, Iniesta and Messi in their pomp.

2865~~~
Some of the posters keep banging on same old stuff and completely ignoring how he played today and every other game. They keep on repeating the same nonsense that we're playing hoofing ball to Fellaini and that all he is doing is barging and elbowing players and similar. It seems some of you just cant pay credit where credit is due.
HE can play the best game ever and some will spout same old nonsense over and over again.

We havent played hoofball to Fellaini and he has had few very good games. Why dont you watch the games and based your opinion on that.

2866~~~
Like a few others, he had a very good second half... He's really starting to win me over.

2867~~~
That could be the funniest basketball match ever.

2868~~~
No they wouldnt, we hoofed the ball cause our defense was under pressure and didnt know what to do with the ball when Arsenal pressed. Sure, midfield didnt help, hell the whole team didnt. Herrera wouldnt make a difference I think. 
But go ahead find sthing, anything to bash Fellaini.

2869~~~
it's finally getting to a point where he's another United player in his own right, rather than being a sign of the Moyes disaster.

Another decent display. He's keeping Herrera out comfortably at the moment.

Test will come in game we should be on the front foot, and not defensive.

2870~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hes thinking 'shall I bang him?'

2871~~~
I have no problem with us playing an accurate 40 yard pass to Fellaini's head and him touching it to a teammate.

I do have a problem with our big physical player being turned inside and out by Oxlaide-Chamberlain, beating him twice far too easily and starting a good Arsenal move down the right

I have a problem with a midfielder playing a poor pass in his own half that goes straight to Arsenal players who are dangerous on the break

I have a problem with a player famed mostly for his heading ability missing a fairly straightforward header, unchallenged and putting it wide

And I would have a problem with any of these things if any of our players did them.

However Fellaini also did a bunch of good things today. After a poor first half he improved in the second where he did track back at times to decent effect cutting out dangerous passes, played the right pass to set Di Maria free for Rooney's goal and he continued to compete for the ball in midfield winning it several times. He saved his performance with the good things he did because there were enough of them, mostly in the 2nd half. After a slow start he was the best of our CMs as Carrick was dissappointing

2872~~~
It's easy to have "big balls" when you're on the pitch and you know the other player won't hit you. He is just a stupid, tough wannabe cnut.

2873~~~
Glad fellaini let that little twat go and not engage with him.

2874~~~
My feelings exactly

Doesn't matter how well he does though it's still annoying seeing him play with Herrera and Mata stuck on the bench

2875~~~
Long ball football has its place in English football, it always has. Fellaini will always cause problems in the box attacking high balls, he's often leaning on the ref not giving a free against him for pushing/elbows but he certainly makes it difficult for our opponents.

2876~~~
When he is confident he's quite a captivating player to watch. Not aesthetically speaking like a midfielder of Modric or Fabregas's ilk but his combativeness is impressive. Usually a measured passer. Would be great if he can add those goals he had in his locker at Everton too. He's getting into the positions to do so and in his run of games he had chances to score in all. Very good second half. He and Carrick were very assured, particularly when we went 1-0 up.

2877~~~
I was surprised. Hopefully Van Gaal has had a word with the entire squad about pointless red cards after the Smalling one.

2878~~~
Yes and that is why some of our fans treat like something that only belongs to the dark ages. It's that over familiarity effect where people associate it with old style football. The fact is though it has its place and can be a useful tool that is used by pretty much every manager on the planet. It is only a problem when it is your ONLY tactic. We seem to be in agreement.

2879~~~
I'm very happy that LvG has found him a role in the team. He is tall and strong but he's not Yaya Toure but we already know that. My opinion on him last season was that he could prove useful in some games if he was given a specific role on the pitch, helping his teammates with his abilities and in the same time being helped by them to cover his weaknesses.

The manager has done just that, he is aware of his poor positioning and reading of the game and his lack of concentration at times, so he has instructed him to use his physicality to assist his teammates by being near the ball, where the action is. We currently don't have any other player in our squad who can do that. As long as Fellaini has safe options near him he can prove useful. 

It's also nice to see that he doesn't look like an outcast like last season but seems to be accepted by the other players in the team because he has actually helped us this season.

2880~~~
I was exactly the same, I wasn't for a quick second though, I spent a minute trying to get my eyes right and figure out why the beers would be funny.

2881~~~
I thought it might have something to do with his being Belgian...

2882~~~
By the way, I think Wilshere should be thanking Fellaini for not making a meal of that (ie. falling to the ground clutching his face.) Had Fellaini done that, I think Wilshere would've been sent off. Then again, had he been sent off, he wouldn't have been injured, so perhaps he resents Fellaini's nobility...

2883~~~
He won a lot of the balls knocked up today, but his unique ClumsyTackling(TM) style took a while to get going.

2884~~~
He'll say if Fellaini didn't walk him down shouting in his face then there would have been no problem.

2885~~~

2886~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's such a WUM.

2887~~~
So we've decided that Fellaini bullies LVG into forcing players to play long balls, even though we all know if united just played intricately from the back with two teenager CBs away at Arsenal they would win the game with style? We need Fellaini gone as soon as possible

2888~~~
Hahha this is so true. He'll smack a guy in the face and then look at him like he's just caught him shagging his Mrs...

2889~~~
The turnaround he has made is amazing. A few iffy touches that were a bit concerning but apart from that he was good. Really love watching him win the ball back just outside our defensive box time and time again. There were a few times where he potentially could have given away fouls in a few dangerous areas too but he seems to be doing a lot less of that lately, which is a good thing. No reason why he doesn't hold his spot in the team. Hopefully he can continue to perform well.

2890~~~
Some really bad moments and some really good moments, overall he did well, is definitely better in a three man midfield though.

2891~~~
Rooney too, Rooney's probably the one picking the line-ups in the first place.

2892~~~
Thought he was good overall. Dunno what that pass was about early in the second half, but otherwise he made some crucial interventions. Not perfect by any means, but he contributed more than most today.

2893~~~
The truth is Di Maria has iffy touches and today the ball ran away from him plenty of times, and Di Maria is the messiah. Making every pass perfect and neat isn't his game, and if you want to, you'll always find a few moments where he looks untidy in every game

2894~~~
I'll go along with the 50% bad moments, 50% very good, I thought his presence up at the top of their box caused the keeper and Gibbs to panic a touch more for Valencia's crappy shot/cross/goal.

2895~~~
You don't think a technically better midfielder with more athletic ability and mobility would have helped us get a better grip in the midfield? We have had plenty of other discussions on football, tell me when I have simply looked to find fault with a player? Just because my opinion doesn't line up with yours does not mean I am simply making up the flaws in his game.

2896~~~
My God, this is tiresome.

2897~~~
I thought Di Maria was pants and Fellaini definitely had a better game

2898~~~
I hate to admit it, but Fellaini was pretty decent.

That said, Fellaini was offside and our first goal should have been disallowed.

2899~~~
Fellaini has been our unlikely saviour this season. He is absolutely brilliant at some things and not so good at others. He has a huge role to play this season. Not sure if he'll be here long term but right now he is miles better than any other central midfielders we have apart from Carrick

2900~~~
And Blind and Ander

2901~~~
He didn't touch the ball and didn't interfere with play. Gibbs and Szechny interefered. With each other.

Even if it was offside, the linesman evened it out with the scandalous Rooney one. Surely that would have been a goal.

2902~~~
Carrick, Blind and Herrera are all better than him, though he deserves to keep his place given his form.

2903~~~
I still have not seen a replay of an angle that shows it, does he push Gibbs into the keeper?

2904~~~
Comparing Ander to Fellaini is like comparing Lee Hughes to Gareth Barry...one is clearly ready for pl intensity while the other is potential

2905~~~
He's been good but I still don't see him as a regular starter.

2906~~~
It's amazing how LvG has sparked a change in him. Just goes on to show how right training methods can improve a player. Massive improvement from the shambles of last season.

2907~~~
Do not care. The same thing happened with Diego Costa against West Brom, and not a single voice of discontent on that goal!

2908~~~
Not sure i it's Fellaini style / presence itself that's keeping Herrera out but, more me it seems LVG has seen something - no clue what it is - that makes him not want to play Herrera right now. He's not even coming off the bench. Today I thought the right move would have been to bring on for RVP and moving Rooney up after the 1st goal. Might have given us a little more ability to keep the ball and exploit the space Arsenal were leaving but, he brought on Wilson eventually. Then even in the end brought on Fletcher.

Fellaini deserves to keep his place and frankly so should have Herrera with only the W. Brom game supposedly where he was really bad. Think we can go midfield of Carrick/Fellaini and Herrera with a front 3 of ADM/Rooney and one of Januzaj/RVP against Hull. We are lacking a bit of the vision that Herrera provides from the middle of the field.

2909~~~
Can we sign his brother too?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347199501186/Marouane-Fellaini-Everton-008.jpg" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347199501186/Marouane-Fellaini-Everton-008.jpg"/>

2910~~~
I think he should be left out against Hull. We will need his physical and aerial threat against Stoke a few days later.

2911~~~
Has there ever been quite such a dramatic Zero to Hero in recent years? I know we've still got the diehard haters in this thread who desperately  wanted him banned for spitting. But generally he's now being judged as a useful asset to us, rather than a joke.

2912~~~
He put two hands on Gibbs and pushed him towards the keeper. It wasn't a big push, just a small one but clearly a push and contact

2913~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2914~~~
So the first third of the season didnt count? Ander is just potential?

2915~~~
Maybe you can dig up another video about it like you did for the "spitting". Send it to the FA perhaps.

2916~~~
There is definitely a little nudge there I think. He disguised it quite well though because it is hard to pick up even on replay. Don't care about the offside calls, it was marginal if there at all. Evened out by the Rooney decision anyway.

2917~~~
Yeh I think the reaction to the offside is way over the top from Arsenal fans, there was a pubic hair in it.

2918~~~
He has been good this game and recently but, sadly I don't think we would ever be able to play beautiful football with him on midfield.He really lack composure when under pressure.Brought physical presence though which is very useful in big games and defended well.

2919~~~
There was a moment today where he received a pass and had 3 arsenal players close him down. He had an open pass to carrick over his left shoulder but completely bricked it and gave the ball away in a very dangerous position. That really summed up his vision in midfield. He doesn't have the footballing intelligence to map out the field at high pace. Please don't play him in a midfield 2, he's a unique weapon for us in a midfield 3 that offers so much that doesn't require creativity. I love that big fecker though.

2920~~~
All for bringing Herrera back in longer term but can't tolerate the mindless bashing of Fellaini on here by some at the moment. The man has been a catalyst for our performances. His height, physicality and off ball movement from midfield have been a fantastic outlet ball. He's under clear instructions to drift away from play toward the end of a potential cross when we have control and is De Gea's number 1 target to distribute too. As crude as it is, it works perfectly. On the ball he may not be the most mobile or have the best vision but he's working his socks off and again and his size is a fear factor that stops 99% of players bothering to entertain a tackle with him, the Yaya factor. Thus his ball winning skills are vastly underrated and a huge factor in us breaking up the oppositions play. 

Love him or hate him, the man is an asset to our play right now and has been arguably our best outfielder of late in a spell where we've turned tough moments into points. The formula works and until it doesn't, Herrera will have to sit tight until the defenders are back and LVG can try the 4-3-1-2 again or some formation where we can look to play progressively first again rather than defence-first.

2921~~~
He covered more ground than anyone in either team yesterday - 7.5 miles.

2922~~~
But I keep hearing on here he's not very mobile?

2923~~~
I think he is just being used in the sort of role's he's suited too more unbashedly by LVG and is more confident this season as well rather than anything to do with training.

Was bewildering that Moyes bought him and then tried to completely change his game almost from what he was most successful doing with him at Everton. It was almost like Moyes was ashamed to use him to lob direct balls and a battering ram and allow him to get forward more and mistakenly thought he was a United standard of deeper CM.

Even the Belgium coach Wilmots said as much in the summer that United were using 2 6's and not utilizing Fellani's best abilities. He is a attacking box to box CM who'll work hard basically and be a constant nuisance in many ways. Just get the AM to cover for him when he gets into the box which is what LVG has done dropping those playing ahead of him deeper and allowing him room to go ahead early.

2924~~~
You just dont like Fellaini and you're going to extremes to point that up. That's all.You're desperate to find anything to bash him about.

2925~~~
Yeah, he's a bit deceptive - he looks slow because his legs are so long but in each stride he's covering a lot more ground than the others.

2926~~~
He took his chance and deserves to stay in the team on merit. I think there is a way for us to benefit from his physicality and Ander's skills but it will have to be at Van Persie's expense. If I were Van Gaal I'd be looking more towards playing Rooney as a lone front man, playing a midfield three of Carrick-Fellaini-Herrera and possibly having the two of Di Maria and Mata floating between the lines. In my view playing them in a three would allow us to get the best of both worlds, cohesiveness from Herrera and the physical presence from Fellaini.

2927~~~
Just like we've gripped it against Leiester?

2928~~~
He was exactly what we needed today, a niggly antagonising sly nasty fecker that completely threw The meerkunt off his game

2929~~~
Apart from DDG, he was my motm yesterday. I never saw the transformation coming and I thought he was on his way out for sure. I don't think he lost a header today

2930~~~
Amazing that Wilshere headbutts felli and fellis hair is offside for a goal and that makes the headlines - switch the two around, wilshere a hair offside (and afterwards not even touching the ball) and fellaini headbutting wilshere... which makes the talking points?

Felli is a player people love to hate. People act like Robbo/ Keano/ Shearer etc weren't dirty f*ckers, they were and it's that that made them great players, if he wins us games like he did yesterday by being a big, distracting physical presence then I'm ok with that. I look forward to the big CL night vs a big european team playing fancy football, where fellaini, marked by 6 defenders and a gk, bundles the ball into the net from a hopeful ball with 20 seconds left for united to progress. There's no answer to how he plays, there's no tactics pep guardiola or jose mourinho can dream up to stop him just muscling their most imposing players and getting away with it

Felli is a red, rant over

2931~~~
Shame, thought we could be more amicable than this, but ok.

That was a freakish game where the entire team imploded after a bad call.

2932~~~
He's on a good run of form and has shown he is a good player. But I still think he's a player for specialized occasions rather than a constant starter.

2933~~~
Game was a mixed bag for Fellaini. On one hand he's improved his defending and concentration at set-pieces, which was shambolic at times earlier this season (and last season). He also had some decent passages of play and didn't dawdle on the ball for Rooney's goal which deserves credit. 

LvG lamented our poor ball retention, but we were playing lots of long balls up to Fellaini, and whilst he did well winning most of them, we almost invariably subsequently lost the ball. I don't like that we play that way when he is in the team. Also for every good thing he does, he has to balance it out with something needlessly stupid and clumsy. 

Overall there was more good than bad though and I no longer despair when he's named in the team. He's much improved, even if he does lack some finesse at times.

2934~~~
Another solid performance from Fellaini.  Keeping Herrerra out on merit.  Weird how people still constantly look for any little mistake with him.  

Every player loses the ball, misplaces a pass and or gets beaten by opposing player in every game, that's football.  

Stats show he is doing less than most - certainly less than Herrerra was after his injury so he is rightly in the team ahead of him.  He is also adding non stop energy to our defensive work and gets up down the pitch more than anyone.

2935~~~
His pass for the counter attack from which Rooney scored was also excellent.

He's done really well, and I'm very pleased for him.

2936~~~
Who knew he'd be our go to guy for backs-against the wall time? He's been really good since he got his chance. What he's offered us has been more necessary than what Herrera can give us in our recent run of fixtures. Van Gaal will of course have decisions to make if the day ever comes when he has a squad to choose from but he has certainly proved his worth in the last 5 weeks or so. To go from a figure of ridicule to a vital cog in the cauldron that is United takes character. Like him or not, you have to give him credit for that.

2937~~~
Fair play to him, he's proving people wrong every game.

2938~~~
His awkwardness makes me cringe but I've been pleased with him.  LVG should be commended for finding him a better-defined role in the team.

2939~~~
Again though we weren't doing it just because he was in the team. De Gea played 34 long balls yesterday and it wasn't because Fellaini was in the side. The back-line couldn't handle the pressing and constantly had to play it back to De Gea. If Fellaini isn't on the pitch, De Gea doesn't just start playing nice little through balls or something, he is still going to play long ball clearances. Having Fellaini on the pitch just means we can actually win some of them.

2940~~~
I don't understand this 'he's useful for specialised tactics'. He was very good against West Brom, alongside the likes of Chelsea, City and Arsenal.

If anything, his problem last season was that he was pathetic against the good teams but generally he looked fine against weaker opposition. The fact he's now been putting in good performances against good midfields is extremely encouraging.

2941~~~
Precisely. A lot of our long balls yesterday were to no one in particular. Just hopeful lumps forward.

2942~~~
It was quite obviously a strategy for this game. Fellaini was used as a long ball target. We are less likely to use that strategy without him. Wasn't a criticism of Fellaini. As I said he won most of them - so you cant ask for much more from him, I just don't like that style of play.
As I said in my post he did more good than bad yesterday.

2943~~~
Hang on, if that's what makes players great, surely Robbie Savage, the whole ex Wimbledon gang, and Joey Barton are great players.

2944~~~
Well its hard to be more amicable cause you're biased as hell when talking about Fellaini, so no purpose really.

2945~~~
I could argue the same regarding your views on him, but instead I tried to not simply dismiss a view that isn't my own.

2946~~~
He really wasn't though. Neither of our 3 center backs were comfortable on the ball. They were shut down, and we lumped it. Rinse and repeat. It wasn't a "tactic" per se.

2947~~~
He was decent yesterday but our midfield was completely runover. Don't know how that can be classed as a good performance.

2948~~~
yeah thats perfect logic

2949~~~
His pass to Di Maria in the build-up to Rooney's goal was class to be honest, split the pitch wide open...

2950~~~
I think he had a good game overall, but that pass could have been played by my Nan, it was a bit of a travesty we hadn't exploited those gaps sooner/more.

2951~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/DirtyGenuineBluegill.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/DirtyGenuineBluegill.gif"/>

2952~~~
Remember that. Really happy to see him turn up in the big games this season. That 27m we paid for him is slowly starting to pay off, unbelievably.

2953~~~
No but's. My mother would have scored the chance Di Maria missed. It would be easy for someone with zero technical ability ...to get excited but he didn't. No need to to dismiss it. Lots of players struggle doing the simple things.

2954~~~
Good post.

2955~~~
Yeah, it was undoubtedly a very good pass, however Arsenal were incredibly weak at defending on the counter and were just waiting to be picked apart.

2956~~~
I just think through balls get awfully easy when almost every single outfield player is in one half of the pitch.

Credit to the big man, I don't like seeing Herrera sit out but I wouldn't be dropping Fellaini.

*cough* RVP

2957~~~
He's just a bit of an anomaly tbh, he is not always the prettiest but he has been one of our best players since he came on against WBA I don't think that can be in doubt, but I still don't see him as a long term United player, and fully expect him to be sold in the summer.

But the guy keeps surprising me so who knows.

2958~~~
I just think he looks clumsy and doesn't look gracefull on the ball . He's done well last 4 games though and is an important squad member now .

2959~~~
Why would he be sold if he keeps on putting in performances like yesterday's and the other games? I highly doubt LVG gives a feck about his afro, lankiness or whatever else doesn't qualify him as a 'United player' according to some fans. He's doing his job right now and he's clearly rated by the manager.

2960~~~
Proud to have stood by his side last season. <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10430918_10152463500360671_5313349606080741620_n.jpg?oh=90f354e10b65a83540c8c079ef5a7990&amp;oe=550A22EE&amp;__gda__=1428005368_44002c5b5b279c27629bfbb212b279d2" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10430918_10152463500360671_5313349606080741620_n.jpg?oh=90f354e10b65a83540c8c079ef5a7990&amp;oe=550A22EE&amp;__gda__=1428005368_44002c5b5b279c27629bfbb212b279d2"/>

2963~~~
The overrating of Fellaini's performance against Arsenal is on a par when everyone went nuts nuts over Ando in 07/08 after his performance at Anfield. In truth, on both occasions, we were overrun in midfield.

2964~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s10.postimg.org/zajoozok7/23_11_2014_11_34_00.png" src="http://s10.postimg.org/zajoozok7/23_11_2014_11_34_00.png"/> 
We were overrun against Arsenal because we were playing 2 against 3 there. Not Fellaini's fault.

His reaction to Wilshere's headbutt was hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fast becoming a cult hero this guy.

Overall he did ok yesterday. He's way to easy to run past for him to ever be a good enough DM for us I think but he does offer a lot in a midfield three. Still don't see him as a certain starter. Happy for him that he's made this turnaround. The boos and sarcastic cheers aimed at him before the season started is one of the worst experiences I've had as a United fan.

2966~~~
He is doing what is asked of him, however I would prefer to see Herrera start ahead of him. I think the ball speed will be higher with herrera in the side.

2967~~~
I don't know if anybody said it already but his pass to Di Maria for our second was very good. He could easily pass it sideways or kick it away but he looked up and tried to open defense wall infront of him which he did beautifully.

2968~~~
Felt he did well, and has done well the last few weeks.

2969~~~
It is your right but for me we have a better balance with a player like Fellaini at the moment.
And until we get the right player i am happy to stick with him.

2970~~~
Herrera has never even had a chance in a 4-1-4-1 3 man set up yet, his games before the rib injury were when we played 3-5-2 and the Diamond.

2971~~~
At this stage I suspect it's mostly about what they show in training. Without seeing what LvG sees, it's hard to second guess him. We're certainly way passed the time when you could say that Fellaini shouldn't be anywhere near the team.

2972~~~

2973~~~
Indeed. The kind of pass it would be nice to see him look for a bit more often, as Ander would

If he can keep those coming it'll help us a lot

2974~~~
How is Fellaini getting the credit for Fletcher's work in there? Fletcher caused Arteta (?) to make that rubbish first touch allowing Fellaini to just pick up the ball <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2975~~~
We were too lightweight in midfield, Fellaini has added a bit of physicality.
Until we find a better option we should stick with him.

2976~~~
Herrera is not fragile, he's tenacious and offers a lot more on the ball, we have seen a downturn in the quality of our attacking play since the switch. We should at least try Herrera with Carrick and see how that works.

2977~~~
Of course we're going to be overrun if we're playing a two (and a half) man midfield of Carrick and Fellaini, with Rooney helping out too. Herrera should come in as the third midfielder with Van Persie dropping to the bench.

2978~~~
Herrera deserves a chance back in the starting line-up, but Fellaini doesn't deserve to be dropped either. Maybe we can have Carrick, Di Maria, Herrera and Fellaini as a midfield diamond. With Rooney dropping back to help out if needed, that might work.

2979~~~
Scored against West Brom; his header led to the goal against Chelsea; similar header cleared off the line against City was the closest we got there; on Saturday, his harrassing Gibbs led to the first goal and his (excellent) outlet pass to Di Maria led to Rooney's goal. Are we starting to see a theme here?

2980~~~
We certainly are. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2981~~~
Yes, he was average against Arse overall. He was much better against the chavs, now that was a great performance.

He had some good moments, but was over run a bit too easily. Improved as the game went on, and once we took the lead, Arse were playing a ridiculously high line. Picked a good pass to Di Maria to exploit that space.

2982~~~
Am I the only one who likes the "doo doo doo Marouane Fellaini" chant?

2983~~~
I dreamt of Felliani last night. Must be a good thing.

2984~~~
I suggested a chant for Fellaini a few weeks back when he came into the team, and frankly I think it is excellent.

Tune - "Macho Man" by The Village People

"Afro, Afro Man
I wanna be, an Afro Man!"

simple but effective.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXQuQxHy7qI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Enjoyed this.

2986~~~
Yep, nice compilation.

2987~~~
Everything people have said Fellaini can't do, he did in the video. Guess they just see what they want.

<b>Flair</b> - 0:34, 2:17

<b>Drive with the ball</b> - 0:44, 2:32

<b>Good passing range</b> (weaker foot) - 2:11, 3:21

<b>Comfortable on the ball - </b>2:21

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> When he took Toure out (which isn't easy) at 1:50. Love that!

He's not just a big lump. The lad can actually play. So glad for him. Long may his good form continue.

Great video.

2988~~~
I think the theme is he's our lucky charm. He's had numerous decisions go his way, had they gone against him he'd still be getting criticism. Namely a push on Lescott for the goal, should have given away a penalty against City, the push on Gibbs which caused our goal against Arsenal. He's gotten away lightly for the incidents with Aguero and Wilshire too.

Wish he had a bit more sense. He seems high risk high reward at the minute.

2989~~~
The incident with wilshere?

2990~~~
Fellaine hype train on full motion here. He is still as bad as last season, only our expectations shifted that much we actually like what we are seeing.

2991~~~
Okay pal

2992~~~
Good quote bait this post of yours. I will give you that.

2993~~~
He can play, but unless he has a playmaker alongside him, our attacks and possession play won't be incisive and troublesome for the opposition. That video showed his strengths and hid his weaknesses, and unless we make up for Fellaini's weaknesses, our attacks will remain quite disjointed.

2994~~~
That pass to Di Maria is just perfect <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2995~~~
I'm not even on a wum. I just really think that the expectations of many on here shifted during the season. If we drop points tomorrow, we could be 7-9th by the ending of the weekend (after 13 games!), like last season and everyone was writing Fellaini off. When I see him play I see the same Fellaini as last season and the same at Everton. Last season we expected to have a go at the title and he was not good enough. Now we hope for top 4 and he suddenly is our lucky charm. There is a reason why no other clubs were interested in him, let alone good clubs. I'm glad he is performing at his top level, though I really think if we want to be back at the top he has to be dropped.

2996~~~
He is doing good job of what is asked of him and that's all that matters. Last season he wasn't doing that plus was injured. He is not most technically gifted but his strengths are important in premier league.

2997~~~
Must be an incredibly bitter pill to swallow for some of our supporters. Not only is Fellaini playing well, but it's LVG picking him. The master tactician that some thought wouldn't have time for such a big useless lump.

2998~~~
The same Fellaini as last season and at Everton? Did you watch him for Everton? Even in his current form, he's not yet playing as well as he did for Everton.

2999~~~
Considering he is not being played in his best position I'd say he is playing on the best level he can or atleast have shown he could. 

I have nothing against him, and as long as LvG thinks he is needed I'm glad he is here. But again if we want to belong to the top of the world, there is no room for Fellaini. Maybe, at most, as a squad player.

3000~~~
I get that some people still might not rate Fellaini, especially if they didn't see much of him at Everton and are only really going off last season (although even then he wasn't as bad as was made out), but to claim that his performances this season haven't been an improvement on those of last season is mind-boggling.

3001~~~
You mean like when we had Mata against West Brom who did nothing more or less all game?

As for disjointed attacks, again, that's just a myth that's always going to be stuck into the heads of the people who already had a preconceived view on Fellaini. If it's disjointed, it's because we can't make it stick up top or players are trying to do too much in the final third.

Fellaini's in the team to keep the ball ticking over when we're in possession (which I feel he's been doing well) and break up play when we're not. We have Rooney, Di Maria, Van Persie and Januzaj/Mata to give us the creativity.

3002~~~
Herrera hassles players. He's far from lightweight.

3003~~~
Herrera does get around, but hassling is different to having a physical presence. 

Oscar at Chelsea also hassles players well, but he is a bit lightweight. 

At 6ft4, Fellaini is a tall, strong, imposing player, who possibly intimidates his opponents (except Wilshere) by just looking at him, nevermind what he actually does to players in a physical battle.

3004~~~
What?

3005~~~
If we're to become the potent attacking force we were before Hererra got injured, we need to restore his place in the starting lineup. Fellaini is a good option when closing out a game.

3006~~~
He enticed Wilshere to headbutt him of course.

3007~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3008~~~
Pretty good comp. I think he's done well these past few games but the video is more impressive than I would have expected.

3009~~~
Mata is not a playmaker. His game is suited to the final third and not at a deeper role. He's better at creating chances and scoring goals rather than dictating play from the midfield.

The disjointed nature of our attacks isn't directly due to Fellaini, and I never fully put him at fault him for that. His main role in midfield is to keep us ticking in possession, be aggressive to the opponents, quickly win the ball from the opponents, offer an aerial threat in the final third, and provide support to our wingers. However, he doesn't have the ability to dictate play from midfield like Herrera can, and Rooney, Mata, Januzaj, di Maria, and Mata can't dictate play from midfield like Herrera can.

3010~~~
Think it's unfair to imply our attacking force has all of a sudden become dull since the inclusion of Fellaini. There's a couple factors as to why we're not the same attacking force, in my opinion:

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Change of formation</span></b>

Herrera only started putting in noticeable performances when we changed to a diamond, which pretty much got the best out of most of our players, especially Di Maria, who was arguably our best player, whilst playing that system. Before that, when we played a 3412, I wouldn't exactly say we looked like a potent attacking force with Herrera in the team, albeit only being one game. 

Since we've changed to a 4141, Di Maria, as I said before, who was arguably our best player in the diamond, has been shunted out wide, which has unfortunately resulted in not so effective performances of late. Also, Januzaj's not showing much consistency, which is understandable for a young lad, RVP's looked pretty stale and isolated, and Rooney's playing too deep, if you ask me. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I personally don't think you can blame the inconsistencies of the aforementioned players on Fellaini. I mean, even if we were to put Herrera in, would it stop Di Maria from trying to do too much, or would it mean RVP would run into channels more? These are things that Fellaini cannot control, and like I said, I very much doubt it would have been a lot different had Herrera been in the team. Just look at the West Brom game. We were shocking in the first half and couldn't create nothing with both, Mata and Herrera on the pitch. Yes, people blame his performance on his injury, but i'm led to believe he was fully fit to play, otherwise he wouldn't have started. I mean, you know what Van Gaal's like with making sure his players are fit enough to make the bench, nevermind start a game. 


<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams </span></b>

Like someone mentioned before, since Fellaini has come in, we've played much harder teams on paper, in comparison to when Herrera was in. 

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fellaini</span></b>

West Brom - Draw
Chelsea - Draw
Man City - Loss
Crystal Palace - Win
Arsenal - Win

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Herrera</span></b>

Swansea - Loss
QPR - Win
Leicester - Loss
West Ham - Win


I'm not trying to say Herrera won't make a difference when he comes back, (who knows? Fellaini's putting in some good performances, in my opinion) but at the moment, I feel our problems are much deeper than the inclusion of Fellaini. We need to get the best out of our individuals like we did in a diamond.

3011~~~
The so called 'disjointed' attacks can't be directed at Fellaini at all, in my opinion. You've just said yourself. His main role is to keep possession, be aggressive to the opponents, quickly win the ball from the opponents, offer an aerial threat in the final third, and provide support to our wingers, which is then up to them to create that bit of magic in the final third, which didn't happen. 

And to be fair, you're starting to contradict yourself now, because you said unless Fellaini has a playmaker next to him, our attacks and possession play won't be incisive and troublesome for the opposition, yet, in your quote above that I've put in bold, you state that Rooney, and to a lesser extent, Mata can dicate play - two players Fellaini's played alongside, therefore, surely there must be another reason as to why our attacks are not incisive?

3012~~~
Creating chances and scoring goals in the final third is completely different from dictating play from the midfield. Mata and Rooney are unable to control our pace, tempo, and passing rhythm. They haven't been able to put their teammates into dangerous areas with their passes, and their movement has resembled that of a forward/final-third player than that of a midfielder. They've frequently either played the safe option when they could have played someone into a dangerous area, or, in Rooney's case, played the ball out wide before running into the box. They are unable to control the game from midfield and are better off being in the final third where they either provide assists or score goals. Herrera has been great in dictating play from midfield, and we've missed this in our team ever since Scholes retired. Mata and Rooney can't do what Herrera does in midfield, and what they do in the final third does not constitute them dictating play and controlling the game.

3013~~~
Fair balls to the bloke. I'm still amazed he's proven himself to be a capable Manchester United midfield player. Really didn't think he had it in him after last season, last time I'll write someone off so soon.

3014~~~
He has looked capable, I am not sure about a capable long term solution. He excelled in a couple of games where we played as underdogs and adopted tactics like Everton would against top teams. That is his comfort zone. 

A regular starter for Manchester United in the midfield, imo, should bring a lot more to the table than Fellaini has. He is a plan B.

3015~~~
You're missing my point. You said that Fellaini doesn't have <i>'the ability to dictate play from midfield like Herrera can, and Rooney, Mata, Januzaj, di Maria' </i>can, and will need one of those players next to him, otherwise '<i>our attacks and possession play won't be incisive and troublesome for the opposition',</i> so I take it you feel the aforementioned players can dictate play from the midfield to a certain extent? Obviously some better than others. If that's the case, why have our attacks been so poor then? Nothing to do with the midfield, in my opinion. Actually, I think in the past few weeks we've kept the ball very well, outplaying City in the first 30 minutes, and also giving Chelsea a lot of trouble too.

Also, in a 4141 formation, which we've been playing the last few weeks, it's the the role of the holding midfielder to 'dictate the play'. In our case that's been Blind or Carrick, who both do a great job at it, in my opinion. That's the player who builds from the back and starts off the attacks However, due to being a single pivot, onus is on that player to always be available for the pass and make forward passes. The centre midfielders, on the other hand, are asked to start pretty high up the pitch and stretch play - almost finding pockets of space like they did against Chelsea, whilst the will both take it in turns to drop for the ball, either to give an option or to leave space in behind. 

As for Herrera dictating play, yes, I can imagine he can do that for us, and I doubt he'll be asked to play the role any different to Mata, Rooney, Fellaini, etc, but it's not something he's used to doing. At Bilbao, despite playing a 3 man midfield, Herrera always used to be the most advanced midfield out of the three. It was very much Iturraspe who used to dictate play for Bilbao.

3016~~~
This shit again? People see what they want to see.

3017~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Getting pretty boring now, isn't it? I just can't be bothered to explain anymore, to be honest.

3018~~~
You misread my statement. I said that Fellaini cannot be given the responsibility to dictate play, of course, and partnering him with Mata or Rooney in midfield won't work as they won't be able to dictate play from midfield as well since they're more suited to playing in the final third, creating chances and scoring goals. Same goes for Januzaj and di Maria, and both have shown that they aren't able to control the game from central midfield. In short, we need Herrera in our team regardless of who plays as no one else is like him.

Also, Fellaini's only good midfield performance, for me, was against Chelsea during the first half. Against Man. City, he couldn't do much as he was forced to stay back, and in the rest of the matches, he was average (Crystal Palace) or below average (West Brom/Arsenal) though not as poor as he was at the first few matches of this season.

Yes, the deep-lying player builds from the back and starts off attacks, but it still needs someone to control the pace, tempo, and rhythm of the team. The deep-lying midfielder will be the outlet from the defence and start off attacks, but it still needs a midfielder who can play players into dangerous areas, control our build-up speed, tempo, and passing rhythm, and be the link between the attacking and defensive players. Bayern used the 4-1-4-1 last season, and whilst they did have Lahm starting off attacks, they still needed Kroos or Thiago to build up the attack and control the team's game.

We've missed that sort of a player from our midfield. Rooney and Mata tried to play this sort of a game, but both have shown themselves to be incapable for this. Rooney doesn't have the vision, movement, and mindset to be our playmaker, and the same goes for Mata, who has the guile to split defences and score goals but can't control our pace, tempo, and passing rhythm in midfield. We did well in the first half against Chelsea because Fellaini was very good in supporting Januzaj and allowing him to cut into the middle and play through passes. Against Man. City, we may have been comfortable in possession against Man. City, but on the attack, we created almost no chances and weren't able to get a flow to our game. Of course, the red card ruined it all for us before we could really settle. We saw what happened against Crystal Palace as well. We played too slowly, rigidly, and safely, allowing Crystal Palace to set themselves up, whilst the quality of our attacking players allowed us to be incisive on the attack and create chances. Same thing happened against Arsenal except we kept less possession.

I see you and I interpret "dictate play" differently. It seems as if you see it as a deep-lying player distributing the ball around and playing balls to attacking players, whilst I see it as something that Ozil, Wilshere, Silva, Nasri, Oscar, Fabregas, Iniesta, Xavi, etc., do: control the team's flow, rhythm, tempo, and build-up speed whilst also playing teammates into dangerous areas. It would be good if you could clarify how you define "dictating play".

3019~~~
Herrera does more than just hassling, he also puts in tackles and wins the ball back, just as much as Fellaini does.

Also, having a big strong player is not an absolute necessity to any team, a team can cope just fine without one, just depends on the set up and tactics involved. We have done it ourselves before, and did fine without one.

That being said, Fellaini is doing fine now, so I don't understand why people are complaining.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Now you are just being ridiculous. He looked the same last season, but that did not seem to help him at the time.

Fellaini is doing well because he has improved from last season's slump. He actually looks like he has instructions from the manager, rather than just being chucked on the field and looking clueless like last season.

It is not because of Fellaini that we are not attacking as much as before, just as it is not because of Fellaini that we are defensively stronger than before, nor was it because of Herrera that we were exposed defensively before, like a few were implying. One player cannot control an entire team's performance.

Herrera has only played five games in total, and only one in which we played with 3 at the back, and that is against Swansea. Fellaini also played in that game as a sub, and was also just as average as Herrera.

We have not looked a potent attacking force with 3 at the back even once since the league began, no matter which players are involved.

It doesn't matter what you believe, the fact is Herrera started the game wearing a corset, which means that he was not fully fit, and there were concerns about the injury. It is not the first time that a player has played even though he was not 100% fit.

That does not mean much at all. Football does not work on exact logic like that.

We played well against Chelsea and City, but were relatively poor against WBA, Palace and Arsenal. Our better performances have come against stronger teams, than weaker ones lately.

Why are you using team results to determine a player's performance ?? If that is the case, then Fellaini played in that loss against Swansea and Herrera played in that draw against WBA, it goes both ways. You can't use selective reasoning like that.

Fellaini is not the problem, he is playing well and should be in the team based on merit.

3020~~~
Fellaini is the type of player I want on there in a game we aren't going to dominate from the outset. Under the right manager, he's the "do a job" sort of player. 

Not many will completely nullify Fabregas this season - but that is exactly why you play Fellaini.

Now against Hull, I want goals, chances and risks. Herrera is more likely to be that little nuisance all over the place trying to make things happen.

3021~~~
So last season when he had a couple of good games against poor teams it was "yeah but it was poor opposition, he's not the kind of player we want in games against good teams". Now he's had a couple of good games against good teams its "yeah but he's the kind of player we want when we have our backs to the wall against the good team but he's not going to win us points in games we're dominating". Make up your minds people!

3022~~~
We've come to the same conclusion then. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3023~~~

3024~~~
Good to see LVG keeping him. To drop Fellaini now when he finding his feet would be a big blow to his confidence.

Plus now we can see the much anticipated Carrick/Herrera/Fellaini system in midfield, which so far looks to be doing fine.

3025~~~
Been great so far. Well done Marouane

3026~~~
It's so heartwarming to finally see Fellaini do well. Such a presence when he's in form!

3027~~~
He has been playing so well, good to have him in this form.

3028~~~
Bossing it.

3029~~~
Our best midfielder right now.

3030~~~
Very very good today. Long may it continue.

3031~~~
I have been calling for a midfield trio of Carrick/Blind, Herrera and Fellaini for a while. We are making Hull look a lot worse than they are, in my opinion. There are plenty of times we have made teams like Hull look like Barcelona as a result of our own incompetence, so credit where credit is due.

Fellaini is in good form and is playing in a system which suits not only him but the other players.

3032~~~
Damn, he's been very good

3033~~~
Hasn't put a foot wrong this game. Really pleased.

3034~~~
Who is this guy and what has he done with Fellaini?

3035~~~
That's why I was crying out last season that Fellaini is a really good player and everyone on here was telling me Cleverly is better. But again, watch the haters say it's just hull etc etc

3036~~~
Great performance so far, I'd say this has been his best since West Brom.

3037~~~
Understanding between him and Valencia is telepathic today.

3038~~~
He's playing really really well.

I'd say I'm more impressed today then the Chelsea or West Brom game. Well played lad.

3039~~~
The entire team is playing well and Fellaini is undoubtedly a part of that. Pleased to see him continuing his good form, every week he will convert more and more of the doubters.

3040~~~
Anytime he uses his chest to cushion the ball means he is on form. Good game from him so far

3041~~~
This is probably the first game that I've seen him as more than just a nuisance. Playing really well, the crowd seem to be responding to him.

3042~~~
On reflection this makes the pre-season booing even more disgraceful. You don't gain anything by making your players feel like shit.

3043~~~
He is doing very well , still improving in all the aspects of his game.

3044~~~
Been great this season. Credit to the side.

3045~~~
I genuinely think that Van Gaal has improved him already. He looks more confident on the ball. 


Great stuff, currently eating all my words on him from last year and preseason and they taste great.

3046~~~
Not really time for point-scoring. Fellaini was poor last season and didn't look fit to wear the shirt.

Credit to him, he's turned it around and is establishing himself as a first-pick.

3047~~~
Playing with loads of swagger. They can't get close to him so far in this match. Moyes's best buy for United!

3048~~~
That could be said for a lot of the team though.

I dont think LVG has somehow turned Fellaini into a different player FWIW, its more that he is showing a bit of faith and confidence in him and playing him in a system which suits him - more important (from the point of view of confidence) is the fact that LVG didnt just drop him as soon as Herrera was fit, he continued picking Fellaini on form.

We saw Fellaini at Everton dominating games against big or small clubs - he has always had the capability, he has just lacked the confidence.

3049~~~
It really is pleasing to see the turnaround.  He looks so comfortable in the side 

And what's this Herrera or Fellaini rubbish? I think both can work very well together

3050~~~
Fellaini has been improving game by game since West Brom. I thought he played good but not great last week but the upward trajectory is clear. What I find most encouraging about Fellaini is that his game is visibly developing. We all know about his physical gifts but as a footballer he's a bit one dimensional. He's never going to play the game like a Spaniard but he's been more willing to try things lately e.g. back heels, first time passes. Plus, those things have actually been coming off. Van Gaal is making him a better player. I've slated him more often than praised him since he joined. However, its quite clear now that its not just a flash in the pan: Fellaini is showing consistent improvement. Well done to him.

3051~~~
Wow, what a turn around. From being consistently shite, he has now delivered top notch back to back performances. Hope he keeps it up, because right now, he is a real asset to our MF

3052~~~
He has played like a £27M player this season to be fair, absolute quality so far.

3053~~~
Ah it is to be fair.

3054~~~
Agreed. Fellaini looks great in that box-to-box role and Herrera looks great playing with a little more freedom to attack. With Carrick/Blind behind them the midfield has a bit of everything

3055~~~
skinned by brady

3056~~~
Pathetic.

3057~~~
His clumsiness still annoys me. Gives away such silly and pointless fouls when a more intelligent footballer wouldn't put themselves in those situations.

3058~~~
Another very good match from him.

3059~~~
Wouldnt go that far, but he shouldnt have let him past so easily and got booked for it

3060~~~
My mum's man of the match. Yet another very good performance.

3061~~~
You must be gutted he didn't get a second yellow. Didn't get injured either. Shame.

3062~~~
Why would I be when he put in a decent performance? Just hope he doesnt get skinned like that too often and that we pick the right players around him (ie. never leave Ander out to accomodate him)

The fans are cheering everything he does

3063~~~
He has confidence and form and when he is on the park very few teams can defend him in set pieces which is a bonus to his passing

3064~~~
Credit to him. He's looked a totally different player and taken his chance.

3065~~~
Yup. That was a really nicely balanced midfield today. More of the same please.

3066~~~
Played well today. It is good to see several of our midfielders show a bit of form, gives us plenty of options.

3067~~~
Are we sure it's not his brother? This can't be the same Fellaini.

3068~~~
Close to getting sent off today, other than that he was fantastic. I'm loving how much he's proving me wrong week after week <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3069~~~
very good in the first half, couple of decent tackles, chest downs. Still produces very silly fouls as his reactions and concentration is still really bad, but he worked on it and is getting better. Shame he didn't score could have kicked him on even more. I want to see him next to Herrera next match..

3070~~~
Deserves a hell of a lot of credit for fighting back to save his career here. Many a player would have let everything effect them.

If he keeps playing like this then he'll deserve all the credit he'll get.

3071~~~
I love how teams try to bully us, then we score and right after that Fellaini accidentally elbows someone out of the game. On the ball he's not great, but he adds a really good and strange balance physically.

3072~~~
Always always knew given time he'd start to feel more comfortable. Came in at the worst time at United and under awful circumstances...got injured and just melted with all the rest of the team. Credit to LVG to sticking with him and giving him a chance. Apart from ability, he gives us steel and agression....we need that.

3073~~~
Had a solid game today despite being hamstrung by Valencia giving him nothing to aim for on the overlap. I still think he's an area of the team we can get a better player from, maybe Strootman.

3074~~~
Don't think he is particularly suited to that wider midfield role but he still played well none the less. Got a bit nervous that he'd get sent off for a bit though. 

In line with how he's been the past month or so, good in possession, not giving it away and putting himself about to help dominate the midfield. Next to Herrera and in front of Carrick or Blind is definitely the way to go in big games, and give Di Maria a free role in front of them.

3075~~~
He's played really well in almost every appearance he's made so far this season and today was no exception. Performed his role really well in the middle of the park.

3076~~~
van Gaal has being great for him. A different player from the one Moyesh signed.

3077~~~
Don't give me that "not really time for point-scoring" thing. The people I'm talking about didn't say he's out of form or having a bad run - they said he's shite, wanted him to fail miserably, get sold asap and couldn't stand the sight of him. You can check any of those threads.

Everyone was attacking me and telling me I had no knowledge of football. No one held back from saying what they wanted to back then. So yeah, it's pretty easy to say "No really the time for point-scoring" (which makes no sense since it's post match and this is exactly the time for such things), without realizing the amount of shite me and others who on here who have been defending him have taken.

People who made those comments last season should be ashamed of themselves.

3078~~~
I must be the only one not seeing these great performances.  Unless he is playing in MC's position I expect him to be in more adventurous and faster in his passing. His height adds a dimension to our attack but it's just not prominent/utilised enough except for when DDG kicks long which isn't very often.

3079~~~
I don't believe either of those comments in bold for one second.

3080~~~
Almost like his game is coming back in stages over the past 3-4 games.  

First, was able to get his head on the ball and make himself a nuisance.  Next, looked comfortable passing the ball. Now, he seems more comfortable with the ball at his feet making runs. 

Pretty complete performance today. I agree with an earlier post that he didn't pass to an overlapping runner once or twice-but that is just nitpicking. He's a first choice now, based on his run of form.

3081~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> His best buy but didn't know how to play him!

I think LvG has told him that he'll never be that DMF he thinks he is but is a credit playing a bit further up the pitch. He really imposes himself in games and its great to see, exactly what we have been lacking in recent years. With Carrick/Blind sitting back and him and Herrera in the middle we really have all bases covered!

I've also been impressed with his tackling and energy levels this season

3082~~~
Good to see him getting a run in the side and starting to show us the player he can be when his confidence is high. Needs to improve his defensive awareness though, because at times he ends up out of position at opposition set pieces and loses the player he is supposed to be marking.

I'm pleased that he has taken the chance LVG has given him and appears to be staying in the side on merit. Though, i don't want to see Herrera benched in favour of Fellaini when both are available because i think Herrera gives us much more fluidity of passing and a higher tempo going forward.

3083~~~
If he added some more goals to his tally it'll be a complete turnover for his United career. He's been a tank in midfield. Adds that bite to the middle which balances our subtle, creative players too.

3084~~~
Are you serious? Go to any Fellaini thread from last season and search Cleverly. I can swear to you that you will find this said multiple times. As for wanting him to fail, you don't even have to go last season. Just the beginning of this season when he had a 10 minute cameo at the end of the game people were saying such comments.

EDIT: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/cleverley-vs-fellaini.377853/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/cleverley-vs-fellaini.377853/</a>

These aren't even the abusive comments but you can see how much he was rated. 75 percent people thought Clev's was better. You see some posters saying Phil Jones is better than Fellaini.

3085~~~
There was people in this thread saying he wasn't good enough for the Premier League last season.

3086~~~
I'd imagine a lot probably felt he was better in a central midfield role, which is hardly a ridiculous assertion when Fellaini generally been known as more of an attacking or defensive mid.

3087~~~
TBF, he wasn't really great at all but now, everybody should be happy that he's playing well under LVG. No complaints from my side anymore

3088~~~
I admit it. I hated him last season and early this season, but his recent performances has changed my mind. 

I don't think he will ever be a good defensive midfielder. But harassing people around the pitch and adding physicality to the side really helps us against premier league teams. Not to mention he's useful for set pieces and lumping it to him when the defenders are in a tight spot is a great alternative too!

3089~~~
Thats cos he was an utter shambles last season.

This idea that a players current form dictates how good/bad he was previously irks me.

3090~~~
I'm pointing out that the criticism of him has always been over the top. Nothing to do with current form.

3091~~~
Not many have said "in a central midfield role" so not sure where you got that from. Besides, it is quite ridiculous because like I said last season half of the people hadn't followed him in his Everton days (comments like he can't pass/is only good when he plays upfront would suggest that).

The comments made in that thread are pretty ridiculous no matter what way you look at it.

3092~~~
So you were irked last season when people said he wasn't good enough for the Premier League?

3093~~~
There were times last season where he was so bad he really didn't look PL quality. He was woeful.

I don't remember anyone saying he was shite for Everton though. Most acknowledged that he was good for them.

3094~~~
Fellaini was no worse than the rest of our midfielders were last season and at least he had an excuse in the form of the his various niggling injuries. He was abysmal in the big games, but almost everyone else was too, just for some reason no-one bothered to gif all of their mistakes.

I'm surprised by the your second statement. A lot of people on here said he was shite from the moment we signed him.  A few of the stereotypes and myths that were bandied around from the moment Moyes presented him - that he's only good in a long-ball team, that's he's too immobile to play in midfield, that he has poor technique, passing etc. were still pretty prevalent until a month or so ago.

I said it last season, but I reckon that a lot of that immediate antimony towards him was sour grapes from people whose only memory of him at Everton was that game at Old Trafford when he bullied our entire team for 90 minutes and scored the winner.

3095~~~
I certainly agree with the first two statements, less so the third. I think the antimony probably was sour grapes, but due to a number of factors - overpaying for Fellaini, him not being the world class CM like Kroos or Thiago that we had been hoping for, him coming from Moyes old club - in addition to what you said.

3096~~~
Yeah I'd agree with that, the post-Fergie anxiety combined with the doubt over Moyes meant we all wanted a world class signing and Fellaini got a lot of stick for not being that signing despite costing so much. It only got worse as we did so badly under Moyes due to that connection you mention.

3097~~~
You say it doesn't work, but it has. If it didn't work, surely we wouldn't have been able to dominate City, Palace, and to a lesser extent, Chelsea? Yes, Rooney and Mata are not used to dropping that deep and dictating play as, like you said, they're used to playing a lot further up, however our this is not to say they didn't and can't do it. Just look at Mata today against Hull. 

I disagree. Fellaini, before we got a player sent off, looked good, and like I said, we dominated City. Obviously things changed when we went down to 10, but Fellaini was still getting forward.

Fellaini and Rooney have been playing as a double pivot above the holding midfielder. One drops, one finds pockets. By no means are they Kroos or Thiago types of players, but if they didn't drop for the ball, we wouldn't have such a high possession rate and our midifelders wouldn't pick up a high number of passes. In the game vs Chelsea for example, Fabregas is supposed to be the player who pieces things together for them, i.e. dictate play, yet he had only two more passes (43) than Fellaini (41).

We did look slow and played safe against a Palace who had 11 men behind the ball, but I don't think our midfielders can be blamed for that. Our wingers got into good positions in that game, and in those type of games, you need your attacking players to do something special just like Mata did when he come on. 


I interpret it exactly how you do. Players who control the tempo of the game, despite where they're playing. I mean, Pirlo plays in the deeper role for both, Italy (retired now) and Juventus, yet he's always dictating the play, using his great passing range to find players in dangerous areas. Would you disagree?

3098~~~
Looks so much more confident in comparison to last season. That goal against West Brom really helped him and hasn't looked back since. He just looks so calm on the ball. He's even adding in some pieces of flair too. Good on him.

3099~~~
This. Most impressed by his mental toughness and attitude. Same with Smalling. It really is astounding how this time last year the guy couldn't play a 5 metre pass to a teammate without over or under hitting it, and today he is playing left footed curlers out to the left wing, first time. He is looking pretty good. Happy for him. 

Has to do something about those bloody elbows of his though because they are going to cost us soon.

3100~~~
Tidy and composed. Like every other player in the team, he's doing a lot better than last season because everyone knows and understands their purpose and role. Good to see.

3101~~~
Moyes need to shoulder some of the blame here. Last season he was intent on having Fellaini as a holding midfield player which simply isn't his game. We as fans were annoyed because we would watch him lose his midfield runner and didn't offer us any penetration via his passing or runs. 

However put him in a midfield 3 with someone else holding and another being creative and he can do what suits his game best - add a bit of a physical presence and link play up. I don't think the player was ever the problem it was the manager who misjudged his ability and put him in positions to show the world his failings

3102~~~
This, on a other forum i explained that i was against this transfer just because Moyes was the coach, Moyes didn't used Fellaini as he should at Everton, he didn't taught him how to be a box to box or a holding midfielder, he didn't helped him achieve his potential, and i was also worried by his temper.

3103~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a> 

Let me start off by saying that I have no agenda against Fellaini at all. It seems as if, from your posts, that you believe that I'm criticising Fellaini. Let me say that I'm not criticising him at all for our performances as he's not a direct cause for them. In fact, he was better and more like his true self ever since the Everton match. The point I'm making is that, ever since we lost Herrera, our performances haven't been as good. Our worse attacking performances are not down to Fellaini in any way (as shown from this Hull match). Our main issue was that we didn't have someone who could be our Scholes or Silva in midfield. Fellaini has good qualities, but none of them involve running the midfield and disorganising the opposition defences. Even in Everton, when he was at his best in midfield, he had Arteta control matches or Pienaar, Barkley, Mirallas, and Osman to carve open defences and drag the opposition around. Fellaini, however, was a good supporting midfielder who kept things flowing, provided the creative players the freedom to play their game, and won the ball well to stop the opponents.

Fellaini isn't at fault for our dire football. I'm saying that he won't provide us fluid and exciting football.

3104~~~
Really interesting positioning towards the end, basically playing as a right winger. 

I think Van Gaal just opted to have the more mobile one touch passers in the centre running around with their triangles passing poor Hull to death. 

It was good to see because it showed Van Gaal recognises his limitations and knows just how to use him.

3105~~~
Completely different player compared to last year. Has been really effective for us so far this season. 

I'm happy for him.

3106~~~
I like how he keeps it nice and simple and uses his physical attributes really well. He's really growing on me.

3107~~~
Thought he was great today. His style of play irritated me in some recent games even when others though he had a good game, but today he was just brimming with confidence and and didn't hinder our play at all.

I was very hopeful when he signed for us even though most wrote him off. Then I joined the bandwagon of writing him off (and rightly so, I would say), but things are looking promising right now.

I did find it amusing though seeing him pop up on the right wing so often. I don't know even why because it worked!

3108~~~
This is exactly how Fellaini can play at his best. Both the defensive and creative midfielder (or two in our case) will make up for his limitations, and he will be able to best utilise his strengths, and Fellaini's strengths provide our dangerous players the freedom to play their game as we saw today.

I'm happy to see him become a useful member of our squad. Even if there are better players out there than him, he's still making himself quite useful, and if he keeps going like this, he can make himself a valuable squad member.

3109~~~
Another good game. Got into foul trouble so he slowed down a bit in the 2nd half. However this was the first time in a long, long time that he had this sort of trouble with fouls so I'll let it slide. It would be nice to see him score another goal soon. He is getting some half chances from set-pieces, just needs one to land perfectly and hopefully he'll bury it. Played his way out of trouble nicely a few times too, was good to see the crowd applauding him. Think we should pursue with him, Carrick and Herrera.

3110~~~
Since we lost Herrera, we haven't played a diamond, though, so it's hard to judge. Ironically, we went back to a diamond today and played some great stuff, even before Herrera come onto the pitch. This is not to say Herrera didn't improve our play, but I felt Fellaini and Mata, who played a lot deeper yesterday, were doing fine before Herrera come on. 

And to be honest, I really couldn't care less whether you have an agenda or not, it just gets boring when people continue to talk about how Fellaini ruins our attacks, when it's there for everyone to see that he doesn't. Like I said, preconceived views. The way you say Fellaini needs a creative player, vice versa. I mean, creative players can only have the freedom to venture forward when they know they have someone like Fellaini who's going to cover for them and get stuck in so it goes two ways. Look how many goals we were leaking before Fellaini come into the team.

3111~~~
Fellaini did interfere with play.  Ergo, offside.

But you're quite right about Roo being wrongly called offside...he was through all the way.

3112~~~
Where did I ever say this? All I said was that he himself won't make us fluid and exciting on the attack.

I did say this at the post you replied on:

He does provide players the freedom to play their game though not necessarily by offering the defensive protection that Blind or Carrick offers but by providing a physical presence that attracts the opposition and, thus, creating space for these players.

3113~~~
Hold my hands up and admit, he's looked good since his cameo in the Everton game.
(He lost his man twice and it needed two wonder saves from De Gea. The Caf was all for lynching him that day. Me leading the pack)

Since then, he's completely transformed. Hope he keeps it up. Still not fully convinced but, pleased.

Goes to show what good coaching and the aura of confidence can do

3114~~~

3115~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a> 

Yeah, so if we play a midfield 2 of Fellaini and Blind/Carrick with wingers staying out wide exclusively, do you think we'll still play fluid, free-flowing football? That's why I made that point.

Some players won't be creative and provide fluid football just by themselves, but they will allow other players to provide this with their qualities. Case in point: Khedira.

3116~~~
Let's not change the subject. The fact is, we were playing a 4141, with 3 centre midfielders, and Fellaini wasn't the problem. Against Chelsea, Palace and City, he moved the ball at speed and give it to our attacking players, who were very wasteful. 

Fluid football is a collective effort. The ball needs to be moved around fast by everyone in order to achieve fluid football, and that's exactly what Fellaini has done since he's come into the team. Di Maria, Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj were all pretty wasteful against Palace, which is why our attack looked so disjointed, but hey, let's blame Fellaini if things aren't going well.

3117~~~
If there is any truth into being on the way out at the end if the summer only for it to get scuppered due to the injury - then very glad for the injury.

I liked the original signing bar the over payment. The presence he has provided recently plus people realizing he is a good footballer. Yet after last season, the reception he got earlier this season and LVG seemingly ok with him leaving figured he had no future here. Even if he becomes horses for courses player and not an every game player - what a stud to have for certain courses.

3118~~~
When did I ever blame Fellaini for our worse attacking performances? I said that he's not a direct replacement to Herrera and is a different player to him, so he has different expectations for his qualities. You wouldn't expect him to play like Herrera or Silva, would you?

I've never ever said that Fellaini was the problem. I've said that people can't expect him to be creative; he needs others around him to provide that creativity and allow us to play better football. You might be twisting my words because you've seen others criticise Fellaini during that same period and assume me to be one of his haters.

3119~~~
Proved me wrong in a sense that I never thought he'd ever contribute positively to this club.

3120~~~
I remember reading something when Fellaini was injured about van Gaal saying he had an important role to play in the team. At the time it seemed silly because Fellaini had struggled but maybe it was accurate. LVG seems to have a lot of faith in him which is good to see.

3121~~~
He's really growing on me. He looks faster, better first touch, and generally looks a much better player than I've ever seen him so far. Confidence is a big issue for him last season it seems. 

I find it ridiculous though that van Gaal knows exactly how to use him in less than 3 months,  while Moyer who have work with Fellaini for years failed to do ao

3122~~~
To be fair everyone looked more and more devoid of confidence the longer last season went on. This season is the complete polar opposite. Even Young and Valencia look improved.

3123~~~
I was one of those lamenting the fact that he got injured and that prevented his outward transfer. I'm absolutely delighted that he's proved me completely wrong. Like has been said, he's been given a clear role and he's performing it as instructed. What more can you ask. The other thing is that he runs all day long, which is a great asset to have given his physicality.

3124~~~
Do we...do we have a working midfield?!

3125~~~
Yes. And it is probably the most pleasing thing about van Gaal so far. How long has it been since we actually had a midfield that could consistently dominate games? Even towards the end of SAF's reign teams were playing through our midfield too easily.

3126~~~
Gives me a lot more hope going into the big games.

3127~~~
Ever since he has come back in the West Brom game, we've conceded 4 goals in 495 minutes(counting only the second half in the West Brom) in a run which included the fixtures to Chelsea, City and Arsenal and that too without a settled defense. I don't think it's a co-incidence. I can understand the reservations some still have for him, but even they can't deny that the improvement he has shown from last season has been nothing short of outstanding.

3128~~~
Also with 10 men for the majority against City.

3129~~~
Has to be the coaching and direction.

Watch the West Brom game again....LVG clearly gives him instructions and dictates to him what he wants. And he went and done it. 

Contrast this with last season....Let's be honest, at times, he didn't even look a footballer. He was clueless and didn't know what to do. Bayern at home is the obvious example. City at home, Liverpool at home etc, he just looked so out of place. Has to be down to the coaching. 

Hats off to him so far. I'm nowhere near fully on board with him yet but, he's making me look a tool so far, since the Everton cameo

3130~~~
I'm glad Fellaini is performing in midfield like he did when Moyes first brought him in. He's really turned it around when you compare him to his first few matches this season, and he's made himself a key figure under van Gaal.

It's interesting to think that, during the summer, most of us (me as well) thought that he wouldn't fit in to this team, and Cleverley would. I doubt anyone would think of this now.

He's playing at his best now, and it's benefitting our attacking players that he can win the ball and draw opponents to him. Herrera and/or Mata can work very well with Fellaini and Carrick/Blind in the team.

3131~~~
I agree. van Gaal and the coaches have done an excellent job in bringing out Fellaini's strengths. They find value in his strengths, and this is what I wanted to see when we signed him last summer.

He's doing what he's best at, and it's beneficial to us.

3132~~~
I think many underestimated his actual footballing quality. Last season we saw him lose the ball time after time and it looked like his second touch was always a tackle!

3133~~~
Last season people said he was a Conference standard player (and they were serious). He's a very decent footballer.

3134~~~
Careful, goals conceded is apparently not as relevant as getting in 0.1 additional blocks per game...

3135~~~
Always knew he was going to turn things around and prove all the haters wrong. Perhaps not worth all that money (yet) but we always have to pay premium prices regardless of who we're dealing with.

3136~~~
He's in good form, but doesn't erase the fact that he was woefully overpriced and that he's technically a bit deficient.

3137~~~
He's certainly been doing a lot better than I thought he would be. I still don't think he'll have a role in the sort of first team we'd like to see, but if we've got a good mixture that works like yesterday and he's a part of it, you cannot take it away from him.

3138~~~
Some here must feel like idiots after the shit they gave the poor lad.. LVG has found a great role for him in the team and it seems to be working.. That said he isn't a midfielder in my eyes as his passing range isnt there, his long balls arent up to the standard of a bossing midfielder.. But credit is due another solid performance from the big man...

3139~~~
You need a midfield gadfly like Fellaini if you want to play yesterday's possession tactic consistently in the Premier League. We see it with Arsenal that it's all too easy to bully a side like that when it's slightly off its game. Fellaini is the safety net who ensures that doesn't happen. He's a key figure to the way opponents approach games against us.

3140~~~
I'm not gonna pretend I always backed him, I ran out of patience in around march after initially thinking he'd be a good player for us even if he wouldn't justify that ludicrous fee (not his fault obviously). I think there could be more to come. He's only now fnally found his feet here, who's to say he won't further improve?

3141~~~
I really like how each of our midfielders offers something different to our midfield. It's no different with Fellaini this season. He's been fantastic.

3142~~~
He's been miles better but he's still no solution for our first XI IMO. A good squad player, which basically is all I think you can reasonably expect from him. Has done a good job these last few weeks.

3143~~~
Another solid performance but no more than that, will always be laughable we paid so much money but he has become a useful member of the squad. Eventually he will be phased out of the starting eleven but probably not until next season if he continues and improves on his current performances.

3144~~~
Glad to see Fellaini is making me eat my words.  No doubt that LVG is a huge part of this, but credit to Fellaini for turning his United career around.  Still don't feel he's our long-term solution in midfield, but he's definitely contributing and playing his role well.  Compared to last season, the difference has been night and day!

3145~~~
This is becoming a joke. You're completely swaying from the whole point of the debate, and to be honest, I see no point to continue to reply to your points when you're constantly avoiding my questions I pose to you and quoting what you want.

The debate started by you saying:

Now, knowing that Fellaini needs a playmaker next to him is pretty obvious really. Fellaini's a box to box player, who gets the ball, keeps things ticking over and distributes it to the more creative players. Now, when you said our attacks will remain disjointed unless we make up for Fellaini's weaknesses, again, you're just stating the obvious, and it seemed that you were blaming Fellaini for our 'disjointed attacks'. Why not say, unless Rooney, Di Maria, Januzaj and Van Persie create more (referring to Crystal Palace game) our attacks will remain disjointed? I mean, against Palace, Fellaini did the job that was asked of Va Gaal, which is the same job he's been doing since he's been put into the team. If our so called creative players did their job against Palace, there would be no issue, just like against Hull yesterday, albeit going back to a formation that provided us a lot more fluidity - the diamond.  

Of course I wouldn't expect Fellaini to play like Silva or Herrera, just like I wouldn't expect Herrera or Silva to play like Fellaini. Goes without saying really. Since Fellaini has come into the side, he's provided us with something we were lacking when Di Maria, Herrera and Mata were in the side, and although we looked good on the eye, we've looked open. Football's not just about going forward, you know. You need a balance, and it seems that Fellaini has given us that.

3146~~~
Agree with all of that. He complements the Mata/Carrick/Blind type of midfielders. Was slightly worried yesterday that he might get a second yellow but LVG kept him on as if he trusted Fellaini's judgement and ability to avoid it.

3147~~~
I am so glad for the poor bugger. Had to put up with a lot last season and the start of this one. He is playing well and deserves to be in the squad.

3148~~~
Yes, we actually do! It's a weird feeling.

3149~~~
Yep, our midfield has an excellent balance to it. Carrick in the holding role, has that defensive nous, an excellent passing range, and adds some physical presence. Fellaini has the physical presence more then anybody, is energetic (though seemed lazy last season as many criticized him for), and has the height of course, Herrera the energetic and creative one, very good technique wise and a very quick passer, and the Blind with his intelligence and movement defensively to keep the game ticking along. Then also Di Maria if we want to put in there. Add Strootman in to it for next season and we're set there depth wise as well, with Pereira as the youngster but plenty of potential to fill in for the creative role in midfield.

3150~~~
Who thought Cleverley was anything other then a bottom half standard player?? But yeah, Fellaini really surprised me. I was one of his biggest critics, never wanted him here in the first place but he's proven his worth and usefulness. Still don't think he'll be a key player or starting 11 player long term, but he'll be like a Park, or Fletcher under Fergie. Will still get loads of games, especially as we'll be back in the CL next season, and will also be the plan B option when we want to change our way of playing or have more of a physical presence or height.

3151~~~
That's pretty much the way I see it as well. He'll be a valuable squad player like Park and Fletcher pre-08/09 were. He will get quite a number of matches, and he will be useful in disrupting the opposition and providing the players the freedom to play their game.

3152~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a> 

I think we are saying pretty much the same thing, but you took one statement of mines and interpreted it as a criticism of Fellaini rather than as a criticism of the team setup. As you can see from my recent posts here, I do not disregard Fellaini in any way. I have nothing against him as a player and as a person.

3153~~~
A lot still held hope that Cleverley would go on and become a big player for us. Granted, most of that sentiment was gone by this year though. Even then, some felt that while Cleverley was a fairly average passenger who you could throw into the midfield if need be, Fellaini was a bombscare who couldn't play in central mid.

3154~~~
Fellaini has shown great strength of character to come back - I can't think of many (any?) United players who have recovered from being the subject of sarcastic applause to earning respect like he has over the last 6 weeks. Credit to Van Gaal as well of course, as Fellaini is not the only member of the squad to start looking like a footballer again. As we expect to be back in the CL next year, then I see no reason why Fellaini can't be a very useful player to have around (and whinging about the transfer fee won't persuade Everton to offer us a partial refund). As for Cleverley, he's definitely bottom half PL/good Championship club material - again Van Gaal was spot on with his judgement.

3155~~~
The amount of times he's won back possession for us, especially in the big games is truly brilliant.

3156~~~
Well, when you single out one player for our 'disjointed attacks', of course I'm going to interpret as a criticism, especially when there's another nine outfield players to pick from. It's a team effort, and against Palace, our creative players simply didn't do enough.

3157~~~
I genuinely think that if you did nothing but make him a few inches shorter and give him a hair cut, quite a few people would have a higher opinion of his technical ability.

3158~~~
Agreed. IMO he's technically better than most people think. A lot has been made about that infamously inflated fee we paid. But I do wonder, how much do people think he's worth now?  Some were even ready to "cut losses" and take 12-15mil for him in the summer.  I reckon he's worth closer to 20mil now (considering the super-inflated Premier league prices). Still not a good deal, but not exactly a disaster either.

All players have their strengths and weaknesses, Fellaini is no different. It's the coaches job to pick a balanced team to make sure they can cover and complement each other. So all credit to LvG.

3159~~~
I like Fellaini, but when he was the scapegoat I kind of hoped he'd chop his hair, just to have one less thing for the haters to target.  I guess now he has proved himself a useful player I'm happy for him to have it as big as he wants. The kind of people still using it against him are not worth worrying about.

3160~~~
Complete turnaround from the ironic cheers at the beginning. Our matchgoing fans are brilliant, but on that occasion they clearly overstepped the line. Some even tried to shout it down, but Fellaini has clearly played well when he has been called. He may not play in all matches, but he is clearly a contributing member of the squad and that's good enough. He had no control on what we paid for him, so that's none of his fault.

3161~~~
Read the quote above, it makes sense.
Fellaini offers something we need atm, as i say until we find a better option i would stick with him.

3162~~~
No we don't. How many of the top teams in Europe need an intimidating player these days? Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern don't have a Fellaini.  If anything it just shows how limited we've become. This is not saying he hasn't done well recently, but he's still a squad player at best and a good option B to have. He should only be starting certain games. Herrera is the much better player who will link up well with others and bring the best out of them.

3163~~~
Fecking hell, this Hererra vs Fellaini stuff was tiresome enough before the game against Hull. Why on earth is it still going after a game where they <b>both</b> played well as part of the same XI?!

3164~~~
He's not a flashy player, doesn't try flicks and tricks* and being tall will always look a bit ungainly so it's an easy (and slightly lazy) criticism to accuse him of lacking technique.

To be fair, he's no Paul Scholes but his touch is reliable and he is really consistent with the direction and weight of his passing. That's something I really like about him as a CM. Nearly always picks the right pass and delivers it right where he wants it. Not over 30-50 yards but in terms of the 5-10 yard short passes that keep things ticking over in midfield. It's a really useful attribute in the type of football Van Gaal has us playing and has to be a big factor in him continuing to get games. Van Gaal doesn't strike me as the type of manager who values central midfielders on the basis of their chest control and strength in the air.

3165~~~
apparently hating Fellaini requires building Herrera up into the best player who ever played to make a sharper comparison with Fellaini. Or something. Hate certainly twists logic.

3166~~~
Further to that, it's blindingly obvious that the two of them are different types of players, as evidenced by the different roles they have been playing in games. Yet for some reason it's being seen as Herrera vs Fellaini.

3167~~~
I actually think they complement each other very well. As it stands, I would like to see Van Gaal play Fellaini, Hererra and Carrick as a midfield three in every game from here on. A really good blend of attributes, with each bringing something different to the table and complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses really well.

3168~~~
Well Fellaini has been starting at the expense of Herrera. Herrera was introduced early because of Di Maria's injury. It makes perfect sense to compare them as going forward they'll be vying for the same spot in the team when everyone is fit. Two different players who offer different things but yes, they are competing for one spot without a doubt.

3169~~~
Pretty much. In some games, yes one of them might lose out but I think it's bloody great situation to be in that the manager has a dilemma of that sort. It's also great that both Herrera and Fellaini aren't the stroppy kind and will wait for and take their chances when they get them. That's the kind of competition for places and attitude that we need to put us back on top.

3170~~~
No they aren't. When Di Maria gets fit he can play as part of a front three ahead of both Fellaini <b>and</b> Herrera.

3171~~~
Yeah. They should both start on merit the next few games, at least until di Maria is back.

3172~~~
THis - he was poor last year bar one or tow games (mostly in Europe) but this year he's been much better and more like the player we saw at Everton. I hope he keeps improving though I still prefer Herrera to him for most games - find  way to play them ALL Louis!

3173~~~
I don't think that's really true, it disregards the fact that they're completely different players with completely different roles in the team. When Herrera came on against Hull it was as a #10 and it was probably his best game for us. He's a good tackler and works very hard but he's still far more an offensively minded player than an all-rounder, which is why we look far more defensively solid with Fellaini playing in a box-to-box role in front of a DM than we were when Herrera was playing the same role earlier in the season.

Ultimately, Herrera's not competing with Fellaini, he's competing with the likes of Mata and Di Maria either for that more offensive midfield role or the #10 position. Since LvG seems determined to play Di Maria elsewhere, I expect to see Herrera and Fellaini starting together a lot more, which is what they both deserve at this moment in time.

3174~~~
This.

I think its a fantastic set of attributes to have - Passing and defensive shield (Carrick); Functionality, Physicality, Potential goals, Winning back balls (Fellaini); Speed, Movement off the ball, Incisive balls, Creativity (Herrera). In fact, I'd say Herrera is possibly competing with Mata and maybe Rooney as the role of the third midfielder (On occasions, not always) and Fellaini should be starting most games (In this form, at least).

3175~~~
Yes. I've thought this since pre-season. He seems much better suited to playing in behind the strikers than in deeper areas of the pitch. An attacking midfielder with any eye for a through ball who also excels at pressing high up the pitch.

3176~~~
Yeah. Also, I'd not be very happy with a midfield two of Carrick and Fellaini - and Herrera seems like the best option for a 3rd midfielder (the most advanced as you've stated). Suddenly, these three make me feel optimistic!

Poor Januzaj. As if he did not have enough number of guys to compete with

3177~~~
He is doing well and is a solid 6-7 out of 10 every game now which is a massive improvement compared to last season but in the context of this season is nothing to get excited about yet. I like the physical presence he brings but I still think his passing inhibits us slightly, too often he plays the obvious and safe pass, he often doesn’t see the right pass or is a bit too slow on the ball. 

If he can improve that area of his game then he should be able to kick on and I think he will have to eventually if he wants to keep his place, our early season problems made the physicality necessary but if we continue to improve our play and with players returning from injury that need could decrease.

I am still convinced that longer term he shouldn’t be anything other than a squad player because I don’t think we will ever see the player he was at Everton as he won’t get to play the same role, be a focal point and we won’t play as direct. Ultimately I believe we will sign a CM with a physical presence who is better on the ball to achieve what we want to achieve but in the meantime he is a useful player.

3178~~~
£4 on him to score tonight <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3179~~~
He should really stop doing flicks and heels.

3180~~~
Nice one <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

The anti-Rob!

3183~~~
Ouh! I need to apologize, i shouldn't have doubted him.

3184~~~
Really is a beast in the air <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3185~~~
Its great watching him grow in confidence under LvG.

3186~~~
Somebody posted that Ronaldo header against Roma today, he must be reading this forum. He's really sprinted for it in the last couple of meters, fantastic goal.

3187~~~
I just realised i accidentally put him as first to score as well. He saved me from my own stupidity.

3188~~~
fecking hell, what an improvement, an absolute lesson in why you need to give players time.

3189~~~
Was thinking the same thing. Not quite Ronny's intensity but definitely reminiscent.

3190~~~
Great player. Never doubted him.

3191~~~
He's been our best player in the first 30 minutes today, even disregarding the goal.

3192~~~
Club legend.

3193~~~
Yup. Best CM so far by a margin. Other three a bit subdued.

3194~~~
If he hadn't sat down to cry over nothing, he might have been able to trace their goalscorer. Still a few comedy bits here and there but overall he's doing okay, though.

3195~~~
Going out on a limb here but I suspect his pain was genuine. 

Very strange though. Must have trapped a nerve.

3196~~~
Yeah, looked like a slight neck muscle strain to me. Had it myself and it can be extremely painful for a short while.

3197~~~
Daily reminder that we're playing with feckin 4 defenders at the back and other two central midfielders.

But yea, he should stop doing backheels and flicks ( with which he's released Herrera around 5th minute ) and shouldn't have cried there.

Good God.

3198~~~
He doesn't have prior form for pretending to be hurt so it's interesting that a few people are happy to assume the worst and stick the boot in. He's had another good half.

3199~~~
He's been one of our best players, I echo the shouts of neck strain.

3200~~~
I just don't get why the footballer's instinctive reaction to pain is throwing yourself to the ground. You don't see that happening anywhere else. I get it if you're trying to force a foul or waste time but that wasn't the case here.

3201~~~
Nah, he might have prevented Herrera from coming across needlessly when 3 players were there already vs 1 tho.

He would have followed Bojan.

3202~~~
I'm sure he'll be fine. Probably one of those annoying neck spasms that hurt for a minute or two.

3203~~~
Not sure, thought he was trying to get the game stopped as he failed to win it in important area

Apart from that he has been our best player.

3204~~~
#bargain

3205~~~
Playing well. Just wish he'd shave the fro.

3206~~~
Why does a guy care how another guy has his hair?

3207~~~
If you need to screw up three or four times in order to succeed once, then you shouldn't do it. He's a good player as long as he keeps it simple and leaves the flashy stuff to the flashy players.

3208~~~
He looked like a wannabe gangster without the afro. I hope he never shaves it.

3209~~~
Pain would have to be genuine. Didn't make any sense at all to go down there.

3210~~~
Exactly. Without getting touched either.

3211~~~
He's done 'the flashy stuff' twice, one ended behind the sideline as he tried to release Valencia and he had nobody to pass it in any other direction, with the other one he's released Herrera.

It's funny how people complain ( not exactly you though, mind ) about his 'lack of technique' and other shit yet complain when he's doing things that do require the mentioned technique.

And yea, I wouldn't mind our flashy players doing some of it today as they're doing feck all so far in.

3212~~~
His neck spasm (or whatever the feck it was) is one of the stranger things I've seen on the football pitch, that's for sure. With Marouane, is always polemic.

3213~~~
He's got a half decent cross when he feels like it.

3214~~~
He's been quality neck spasm aside. Putting Herrera to shame.

3215~~~
Walking goat.

Hassling Stoke all over the pitch, LeBron-esque goal, could've had more, another great performance.

3216~~~
Man, i feel like an ass, because i wanted him out.

Right now, he looks like the real deal. Ads some sorely needed steel to our midfield, plays with real swagger and even has goals to his name

3217~~~
Another cracking game. His hold up play and composure is great.

3218~~~
His chest control is ridiculous. Another good game, very happy for him.

3219~~~
I thought this was his worst game for a while yet he still bagged a goal and looked threatening. Long may his form continue.

3220~~~
Went missing in the 2nd half I thought. Very good in the first

3221~~~
Wtf <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3222~~~
Another good game from Marouane! Was a little sloppy in possession in the 2nd half but that could be fatigue. The guy runs 12km a game and with a packed schedule he must be stuffed. Decent cross on him too.

3223~~~
Another good game, but because we've reverted back to a diamond, as we saw tonight and against Hull, he'll often find himself in wide areas, which doesn't really suit him, although he did put in a few Beckham-esque crosses.

Glad he got another goal. Was a great trademark header. Can only keep his confidence going.

3224~~~
I've always said he's better than our other midfield options and heck hem.... I was right !!

3225~~~
How many times did he brought the ball down with his chest from a DDG goal kick? I swear his chest control is otherworldly.

3226~~~
Still managed to get 86% accuracy with his passes.

Other stats: 5/6 tackles, 2 fouls, 1 interception, 4/5 aerial duels won, 3/4 clearances, 0/2 take-ons and I think it was 2 chances created with those crosses.

Oh, and he's a great help for DDG to re-start his game, he's available for all the chest-downs David throws him which helps the team and DDG himself.

3227~~~
Nah, his hair genuinely adds to his performance. Would you remove Messi's left leg?

3228~~~
I always said he'd make it. Legend*

*me, not him.

3229~~~
Good header for the goal and solid all round performance in the second half after a sloppy first half.

3230~~~
Pleasure reading this thread after suffering last seasons 'posters'.  

He has turned it around and deserves credit.  Playing himself into the team and although he tired he put in another good performance and a fantastic goal.

LVG shares the credit, great management to get him doing the things he does well, and minimising his weaknesses.

3231~~~
MOTM for me today, he bossed the first half and was good in the second.  The thing that impresses me the most is when everyone was against him and writing him off (mostly our fans incl myself) he kept fighting for game time and when he got it he made sure to be noticed. He has been one of our best players since coming on against West Brom as a sub.

3232~~~
Another good game,got in more goalscoring position than Rvp and Wilson combined.

3233~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3234~~~
Very good first half till their goal, didn't really stand out in the second but did alright.

3235~~~
Thought he was poor today, except for the goal.

3236~~~
I'm with you on this. I never thought he was a 30 million signing..but that wasn't his fault, but a club fault. He was an unpopular signing, came into a team that was managed by a new manager for the first time in 27 odd years, got injured and then melted into a team that was shorn of confidence, management and direction. I take my hat off to LVG for giving him time. No he's never going to be world class, but what he gives us is steel, aggression and power. We used to have a lot of that with quite a number of Fergies teams regardless of the skill and it paid off consistently. Perhaps LVG recognises that...or perhaps he has just reivigorated a player to play to his strengths..

3237~~~
He was responsible for the Stoke goal, wasted some very good chances and he could've been sent off after elbowing Pieters. Some of his moments were laughable (his 'shot' in the 75th minute <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>), mixed with some decent and some excellent ones. He scored, so apparently that means he was good and because he also helped to score an offside goal vs. Arsenal he is proving all the haters wrong. Fine by me, as long as we are winning.

3238~~~
Ridiculously harsh assessment.

3239~~~
The big guy still has too many poor moments; getting disposessed on the ball seems to be the most frequent. The wide CM role helps nullify these lapses as its less dangerous to lose the ball there than the center of the pitch. He's just not nimble enough on his feet which means he must do a better job of passing the ball early enough before he is put under pressure.

3240~~~
Played well again, arguably our most improved player this season.

P.s am I the only one that has noticed his Afro has gone Ginger? Surely not dyed it that way <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3241~~~
He's going rusty.

3242~~~
Yea, I think that his oldschool black afro was a lot better.

<a class="username" data-user="48866, @KiD MoYeS" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48866/">@KiD MoYeS</a> it's not harsh, it's fecking rubbish.

3243~~~
I'd swap "harsh" for "retarded".

3244~~~
Well I don't think he was particularly poor or anything. Alright performance, but goals always get players more credits I guess, it has always worked this way. 

But if I watch back the match, I think I can find at least 5 moments of him that would make most football fans a) laugh and b) say that's 'not the United standard' or something like that.

3245~~~
Thought he was superb in the first half and below par in the second half.

3246~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3247~~~
How is it retarded? Because he didn't lose the ball for Stoke's goal, faking a neck injury as a cover up? Because he didn't miss two good chances and wasted some good moments? Or because he didn't elbow Pieters for no reason (might not have been intentional, but after what happened for Belgium it's a huge risk for him)?

3248~~~
He was our best midfield player in the first half and even scored, the second half he was played further wide, which I thought was strange, yet he still performed quite well. He had a very good game and is looking more and more a capable player for us by the week, dare I say it, he's even becoming an important player for us.

3249~~~
I told you he was good. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3250~~~
I never would have thought he'd be an important player for us, he's just everywhere on the pitch. Intercepting, dispossessing and just creating possession for United.

I'm happy he starts for us now!

3251~~~
He's a Manchester United player.

3252~~~
he was superb in the first half as was the match before in the first half, faded little bit and did some mistakes in the second but still good performance, him and de Gea have got a great understanding he chested the ball from a keepers kick many times. I loved that. That is a good option in setting up attacks. Could have scored another two goals, he needs to sort out his shooting from longer range, his instinctive shots and volleys are great but not much shots hes got time for. He's like very rushed all of a sudden.. but I am glad for him that he is becoming a good player for us in the end. He is currently turning the first important corner. Van Gaal seems to know how to work with players and how to use them. I think Valencia and Young very have been very solid as fullbacks so far under LVG...

3253~~~
As Gandalf himself said: "My heart tells me that Fellaini has some part to play, for good or ill, before this is over. The pity of Moyes may rule the fate of many."

3254~~~
He's becoming a focal point in our play.. very instrumental. Not sure if many will like that but it can't be denied. He's growing on me, will we win the CL with a guy like him in midfield? Maybe not but he's doing very well and he's earning himself a long term future here if he carries on like this.

3255~~~
That moment at the end when he controlled the ball and then just let Valencia run with it was brilliant

3256~~~
I agree. He's grown on me too. He reminds me a bit, style-wise at least, of Mick Martin who played for us in the Docherty years. I was as bad as most last season when it came to criticizing him but he's made me eat my words and I'm glad he has.

3257~~~
He's playing well, so a massive fair fecks to him. I'm not convinced about this central midfield/right wing hybrid role we've got going for him though.

3258~~~
Some mixed moments but nice goal. Capable of scraping into double figures

3259~~~
I think with everyone fit I would like to see Herrera own that role with possibly Blind taking up the position on the other side. If we adopt the diamond long-term though Fellaini will get a lot of opportunities with rotation and injuries.

3260~~~
Yep, he didn't do himself any justice at all last season. Showing his true class now.

3261~~~
Just curiously, how do Everton supporters feel toward him? Are they bothered he left?

3262~~~
Can only speak for myself and the people i know but no one holds any grudges against him for wanting to leave. Everyone understands United is a step up and that is what happens. I wish him good luck as i still like him a lot personally. It was the same with Moyes until he started coming out with twattish comments ever other week. Rooney is the exception though he was a Evertonian and he could of given us a few more years.

3263~~~
I thought he was shite tonight apart from his goal obviously. Gave the ball away way too much!

3264~~~
Didnt think he was all that tonight. Good goal but overall play was quit epoor

3265~~~
I just love the way Van Gaal says Fellaini....Fellanni

On a more serious note, he has been nothing short of fantastic ever since West Brom considering the stick he has had and the ever changing starting XI's. He has proved many people including myself wrong that he is indeed Man Utd quality and long may that continue.

3266~~~
Are you planning on the same exercise for Herrera in today's game? Or do you not have the same pathetic drive to find fault in him?

3267~~~
Oh another one..<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3268~~~
Exactly. You could find 5 clips on any of the players barring De Gea. Herrera was shocking today but that's a different thread. As for Felliani he was our best player for 60 mins, faded but was playing all over the pitch.

There could be an argument he has been one of our better performers since the WBA game. Look he was shite last season, but to be fair he is looking a good asset this year - maybe those street sellers might make their money back on those wigs after all....

3269~~~
He's helped out Valencia quite a bit in the last two games. There's been little pressure down our right.

3270~~~
Well taken goal, and really good timing for the run into the box.

Though what was that horrible pretending in the lead up to there goal. Hope LVG has a word to him over that, because I don't want to see any of our players doing things like that.

Had a number of other good chances where he really should have done better with as well.

3271~~~
Good goal, only decent performance besides that though IMO. I know their goal came about by him losing the ball but I don't think he can be blamed at all, he seemed to be genuinely hurt.

3272~~~
Why are people being so harsh with him? I thought he was excellent for the most part last night and has been for the past few games. Plays the pivot for playing flicks to players moving around him, good close control and short passing, wins aerial battles, and scored a goal

3273~~~
Some will never take to him, doesn't matter though because our manager recognizes how good he's been and continues to play him.

3274~~~
I thought he did rather well. Good goal. Won the ball in good places. Didnt give away the ball much. He needs to step up his distribution though. Most often he looks for the safer sideways/backpass. He needs to try to and make more offensive passes.

3275~~~
I wouldn't really expect Fellaini to play those offensive passes that players like Mata and Herrera play from midfield. It's just not his game. This is where an upgrade on Fellaini would allow for this, but for now, we're stuck with him, and at least he can create chances from the right with his decent crosses. Plus, he draws players away, creating space for our attacking players, so if he doesn't play them through with incisive passes, at least he gives attacking players the freedom to play their game.

Now, if we had Strootman, for example, then we'd see more of those incisive passes, which would make us much more dangerous on the attack whilst making us more secure defensively.

In terms of Fellaini's defensive contribution, I've noticed that he's starting to read the game better than he used to. I still don't think he can be a defensive midfielder, but at least his spatial awareness has improved, he recognizes danger better, and his overall reading of the game has also improved.

3276~~~
One of the main things i've noticed is his fitness levels!  He is getting about the field better than most

3278~~~
Not surprising. He regularly covers the most distance in a game. Even last season, iinm.

3279~~~
Was very good in the first half today, but a little lazy in the last 25 minutes or so. I remember that one time when Stoke were attacking us at 2-1, and Valencia won the ball and passed it to Fellaini, expecting him to get on his bike! Lazy Fellaini just passed it back to Valencia and asked him to run. Hahaha

3280~~~
Pretending? He went down clutching his neck, after no contact with a Stoke player. Surely the more obvious explanation was that he pulled a neck muscle. 
I've read a newspaper report saying this same stuff about pretending he was kicked in the neck. Be doing well to reach his neck!

3281~~~
It's amazing what van Gaal has gotten out of him so far this season. He's really getting him back to his Everton form. Fellaini has genuinely been one of our most important players in these past 4-5 games. He's really improved and clearly has a lot more confidence in his overall game. 

I'm happy for him and I hope his good form continues. He really is making an impact in the team when he plays. Fair play to the guy.

3282~~~
Only going off the replay. But in modern football, sadly the more obvious expanation in that situation is he was trying to get a free kick. All I saw was a foot being semi high, fellaini losing the ball and then going down. I would have expected if he had actually hurt his neck to have come off. Neck injuries are not exactly the sort of thing you mess about with, particularly when part of your role in the team is dealing with high balls.

3283~~~
I thought some of the praise he received after the CHelsea/City games was really unwarranted. He just stopped being useless for those games.

But these last 3 games he's been very very good. Does everything you want from your midfielder. Delighted for him!

3284~~~
If there was contact it was to his hand. The player was in front of him. Everyone saying he pretended he was kicked in the neck must have a pretty low opinion of his intelligence. If he wanted to fake being kicked  he picked exactly the least likely place to receive it.  Pulling a neck muscle seems a hell of a lot more likely.

3285~~~
Thought last night he was just ok. In the City game I thought he was excellent.

3286~~~
First time in a United shirt I have seen him attack a ball like that in the box. When the cross was floating in, the feeling was 100% goal. Something that was the norm during his Everton days but never in a red shirt. More of that please.

In regards to his performance, average. Good and bad moments but did his job.

3287~~~
Bit unfair regarding the City game. We were up against it with 10 men. I thought he did more than was expected in those circumstances.

3288~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3289~~~
I agree but I didnt like that he was on the right of our midfield

3290~~~
Never judge a person by his fair. Never judge a mop stick by the first.

3291~~~
Still gives away posession far to many times.. His passing is to limited and slow as feck. But that said he has his uses and is doing ok this season. But in here it's a bit to much on or off for my liking..  Last season terrible,  this Messi reborn. He is doing ok for us and I have nothing to add to that, great goal.

3292~~~
He played his role last night - and well at that. I agree his general passing isn't the greatest, but simply breaking up play and moving the ball short distances effectively means he can be useful. A goal on top and we're laughing. Played better recently for sure, but the whole team have which certainly has helped him I think. Still not sure he'll cut it against top opposition, but there's a lot to be said for a team full of confidence and the way players feed off one another.

3293~~~
He played well against Chelsea and City, and unfortunately we will have to wait a while to play the Bayerns and Barcas...

3294~~~
Yeah, obviously, but I do think his game is more suited to the premier league than it is to the champions league. I wasn't as impressed as you seem to be with his perfromances against Chelsea or City though. Not saying he was bad, but he wasn't great.

3295~~~
Doesn't bother me right now if he is not suited to the CL. I hope it's a problem we will face. Fellaini is looking an asset to help get us back there, that's the main thing .  VG can sort it out if we need something else once we actually get back.

3296~~~
Well put. He's never going to be a great passer but that doesnt matter - he's not in the side to do that. he gives us an edge in midfield that we've lacked for years. We're no longer getting overran and his being in there is a big part of that for me. He's not fashionable, but does the ugly things well and offers a threat going forward. If we set up right and have a system that fits the players we have tghen his average passing wont make a great deal of difference.

3297~~~
His stats from last night's game are immense, at both ends of the pitch.

3 shots, 2 on target, 1 goal
86% pass completion )(61/71)
3/5 crosses completed
10 ball recoveries
5/6 tackles
1 interception
3/3 clearances
4/5 aerial duels

3298~~~
Cina rules.

3299~~~
I thought he was outstanding last night and the stats back that up. He can feck off though with the elbows and the feigning injury.

3300~~~
I don't like the idea of him hanging out on the right-wing putting crosses into the box tbh.

3301~~~
Another good performance, good to see him do well after all the stick he was getting before.

3302~~~
He was playing on the right of a diamond, same as against Hull, so he's bound to find himself in those positions sometimes. He actually put in a couple of decent crosses too. I reckon Van Gaal would have preferred to see more crosses coming in from the other wing, with Fellaini looking to get on the end of them but it just happened that Stoke were more vulnerable down the right.

3303~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3304~~~
He played well, needs to be a bit more careful with the ball though, as to Herrera.

3305~~~
I think he was very good against Chelsea. Last night he gave the ball away needlessly trying some fancy flicks when we were in a good position to attack. He did the same once/twice when nearer our penalty box. Think yesterday, apart from the goal, his general play was poorer than his last few appearances for us.

3306~~~
Yea I appreciate that, and agree that his crosses were also pretty decent.

I think we are getting closer and closer to finding the ideal composition in the team though.

3307~~~
One complaint though is that he should not be the one crossing the ball but still had decent delivery.

He should be smashing crosses into the net.

3308~~~
I think he jarred his neck or something as the way he went down was in agony. I have not seen him play act like that before, and it would be an odd moment to try it then.

Typical all action performance from him really. Yes his passing was a little sloppy especially early on, but I think he made some great interceptions and his goal was exactly what we expect of him. I wish we stood more crosses like that up to the back post, as 9/10 he will win them with a running jump. 

For all his Critics he has been the 1 constant in the team since West Brom away in which he grabbed us a point. Really glad for him that he has managed to turn his career around.

3309~~~

3310~~~
Were people suggesting he faked that injury? It looked like he was genuinely in pain, and yeah it would've been really odd to simulate at that moment.

3311~~~
Yes. After spending an entire season slagging him off as a pub footballer, I guess they're still desperate to find something to have a go at him about.

3312~~~
I think he's crucial to us at the moment. His physicality in the middle of the park is vital and he's a constant aerial presence at either end. I think the likes of Mata and Herrera need someone like him so that teams don't set out with a particular style of play to get in their faces, as Fellaini stops that sort of thing from working.

3313~~~
Just watched the highlights from yesterday, as many have predicted yesterday, it must've been some muscle cramp or a neck twist. You can see him rubbing his neck all the time since that injury.

But yea, it's pretty rich to see some complain about him not getting up and chasing the ball when you still've got two or even three midfielders and a back four to defend.

3314~~~
Those saying he 'feigned injury' are pathetic. He, nor anyone else, complained about the incident and he quite blatantly pulled a muscle in his neck.

3315~~~
I think with him in the side we get decent balance. The 4 of Herrera, Mata, Carrick and Fellaini is what I want to see with Di Maria Coming in for either Mata Or one of the forwards. He adds grit and also adds an out ball. De Gea seems to pick him out quite often like he used to with Valencia when Valencia used to be good.

3316~~~
Well to be perfectly fair I slagged him off plenty last year as I thought he was crap. He's really turned it around though this year. 

In any case, suggesting that was a faked injury is bizarre, it looked so genuine.

3317~~~
So does this chap

<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3318~~~
I'm not to sure if they're included there or not somewhere (probably are) but De Gea aimed 3/4 long range kick-outs in a row to him in the 2nd half and he got his head on them all, finding one of our on with the ball each time too. I thought he put in a mighty shift again last night. He's turning out to be what must be a real pain in the hole for the opposition with the way he's operating lately.

3319~~~
Yeah, he's a great target for De Gea to pick out when he needs to go long. The hair probably helps.

3320~~~
Thats one thing I really like about Fellaini - not that he just wins a lot of headers, but when he heads the ball it actually tends to be to one of our teammates.

One of my pet peeves in the game is how players (often CBs) will just blindly head the ball forwards without any real target. If they are under pressure or it is a difficult aerial duel then fair enough, but you seem times when a player isnt even under any pressure and could bring the ball down if they wanted, but they just head it randomly back up the pitch without a thought to who it actually goes to.

Fellaini is not only excellent at winning the ball in the air, but he actually seems to aim his headed passes towards a teammate, and finds them more often than not.

3321~~~
He's growing on me...

3322~~~
You should get that checked out by a doctor.

3323~~~
I think Fellani's been very good this year, and happy for his turnaround from last season. One quibble I have from yesterday's game is that he sometimes left his position chasing the ball, leaving the right side exposed.  Would like to see him have a little more discipline in that department.

3324~~~
I noticed that too. But I think it's more to do with the formation being narrow - sometimes he has to come more central to cover the space, so a quick switch to the full-back on the other side can leave him exposed.

3325~~~
Criminal from Stoke to let him have a free run to goal. But what a header that was. That's how to attack the ball from a cross. Seems like ages since we scored a header from open play.

3326~~~
How lucky were we that he injured himself at the starr of season and therefore his loan move to Napoli was cancelled. 

He's been quality these days.

3327~~~
He's a United player, that's for sure. The way he sprinted up and attacked the ball for the header last night is what you want to see from him. Was all over the pitch again causing all sorts of hassle too. I honestly think that if he was get injured, we'd miss him more than anybody right now, which is an incredible turn around.

3328~~~
I'm glad he's started doing this for us. There was nothing more annoying than seeing Fellaini pull a ball of thin air from a goalkick and start attacks when he played for Everton.

3329~~~
Was he really that close to leaving?

Christ. Seems like a lot of hasty decisions were made this summer. Not really sure who to blame (if anyone) but thank feck our next transfer window will happen under a much better informed manager.

3330~~~
The talk in the papers was that Fellaini was on a list for players along not in the manager's plans. He wanted to prove himself. Can't force a player out and perhaps Van Gaal himself saw something in him that made him want to keep him until January at least. 

It seemed to be the case of a waiting game from all parties. Even Benitez said that Van Gaal isn't too influential in a deal, but the people above (Woodward) which confirms to me that Felli would have been off had Woody got someone else in (Vidal). This is probably still the case for a fit Strootman.

3331~~~
What way around would it be though? Did we hold off on Vidal because we couldnt shift Fellaini? Or did we keep Fellaini because we were nervous about signing Vidal? Of course, the two might not be linked at all. We might not have signed Vidal because of our concerns about his fitness and we might not have shifted Fellaini because of his injury - or because LVG actually wanted to keep him, and the media were misinformed. There's no way of knowing, really.

Itll be interesting to see what happens if we do sign Strootman, what that means for Fellaini. Might push him down the pecking order but I reckon his place in our squad is secure now. Though there is always the possibility he'll attract some more compelling bids in January given his recent performances. Could that test Van Gaal's resolve?

3332~~~
Of course it's all conjecture but if there is a connection the bolded part is close to what I think is the reason. If we were to get Vidal it would be on our terms. His knee injury would have definitely caused concern but there was too much smoke for their not to be a fire IMO. Van Gaal namedropping him, all those reports from foreign press as well as British, the player himself not committing to Juventus at any point. At the same time he played it safe, not pushing the barriers for the transfer, but not putting an end to rumours. Maybe that would have sealed the deal. All our other signings put forward that they wanted to leave their club apart from him. Had he done so we could have strengthened our negotiation ploy. Juve themselves would have got money they don't usually have which they could spread over the team.

Fellaini has qualities similar to Vidal, qualities no one else in our side has, even if he's not in the same bracket. Maybe that's why despite the talk of him not being a LVG player, he was the player we needed to ponder over whilst the other outgoing players went without much deliberation.

3333~~~
Yeah, four defenders back for the goal, herrara brushed aside and sloppy footwork from smalling causing a deflection but of course it was fellaini losing it in midfield. Jesus wept get a grip.

3334~~~
He's done very well after all the criticism last season. Will he be here long term? I don't think so but van Gaal knows how to use him effectively.

3335~~~
Seeing his goal again makes me appreciate it even more. His run was perfectly timed, and when he got into the box, there was only going to be one winner. Great header.

3336~~~
Except nobody is really saying that (or anything remotely like that,) are they?

3337~~~
Carrick was also ball watching instead of watching N'Zonzi behind him at the top of the box, if he was more aware he could have easily cut that out but instead we had like 4 or 5 players crowded around Bojan.

3338~~~
Don't think so.

3339~~~
LVG really can restore confidence and get the best out of his players. He did well with Fellaini, Valencia or Young whom you'd have thought should not play a single minute again but this season, showed they can be useful. I hope these players get credit and feel that their efforts are appreciated by the fans

3340~~~
Not in any of the training photos. Yet another cocking injury? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

(also not sure he was in any of the Xmas party photos, come to think about it)

3341~~~
He was and he wasn't wearing socks.

3342~~~
Hello. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3343~~~
Well he's not on crutches anyway!

3344~~~
Neck injury according to Ben Dinnery, one of those freelance injury specialists who write for various websites. Just prior to Stoke scoring, Fellaini did appear to sustain a strange neck injury while losing possession.

3345~~~
Really? Not many people will have noticed that <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3346~~~
So it was no exaggeration on Tuesday, then.  I thought he must've been in pain since he doesn't go to ground easily like others do.

3347~~~
Just an off day, but he has been awful

3348~~~
Flashbacks of that Arsenal match from the first half, except that he's been two levels below today. Whole midfield is fecking disjointed, it simply does not exist, can't string 2-3 passes between each other.

Him and Carrick in 2-man midfield in front of those 3 is a disaster waiting to happen.

And obviously, that was a God awful pass.

3349~~~
ffs...

3350~~~
He is awful today.

3351~~~
Been horrendous today, pass for their goal was shocking, he just can't cope if he is pressed.

3352~~~
Come on Fellaini. 

Terrible so far.

3353~~~
Wouldn't get on the Southampton team.

3354~~~
The big lump horror show.

3355~~~
Looking like the clown that he is today

3356~~~
back to his usual self. worst player on the pitch

3357~~~
Having a mare

3358~~~
Probably the worst midfield performance I've seen for a long time from  fellaini . Absolutely terrible . he looks like we've turned up with 10 men and we've dragged somebody out of the crowd to make the numbers up

3359~~~
I realise it was me who bumped the thread but let's not go overboard. It's his first bad performance this season

And he isn't the only playing badly

3360~~~
Terrible so far, poor touch, bad passing, and far too flipping slow to track back. Jogging FFS!

3361~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> harsh but true.

3362~~~
Get Giggs on.

3363~~~
You're really, really generous here.

3364~~~
If we're going to keep him out there, he should be moved forward, not further back. 

He's having a horrendous half and looks like their best chance to exploit our dire backline.

3365~~~
First and foremost, he's been by no means the only poor performer out there. Having said that...

This is the return of last season's Fellaini. Poor passing, losing the majority of physical challenges against anyone even half his size, getting mugged off by the opponent's attackers all game, all at sea with his positioning. Its a mess.

Hopefully its a 45 minute relapse and he'll get back to his recent form after half time.

3366~~~
Not sure he's done a single thing right so far.

3367~~~
Yeah he's been poor. But the tactics are crap and he needs clear direction and a defined role to perform well.

3368~~~
Shit Fellaini is well and truly back with a bang. That was beyond woeful. 

His bottom level seems to be somewhere between pub player and rugby player..

3369~~~
Fellaini has been poor, Mata invisible. Wayne and RvP are fairly static in attack. Herrera needs to start being a bit selfish and shoot more.

3370~~~
He needs to get his act together, that half was just horrendous

3371~~~
Fellaini should not play in CM - his passing technique is absolutely horrible and incredibly infuriating! Every pass he plays is under hit or wayward (as if he scuffs the ball every time) not to mention usually backwards. He should be ashamed of the pass that lead to their goal, even schoolboys would have done better. Play him further forward if you want to keep him on the pitch LvG!!

3372~~~
Having a bad game but the comments in the match day thread show how many people have been waiting eagerly for him to have an off day 

Herreras first touch was a ridiculous back pass which may have led to a goal on another day, but I barely saw a single comment about that.

Additionally he is now apparently playing the holding role with Carrick at CB which seems a very poor tactical choice on both counts and won't help matters.

I do think a couple of his passes have been the fault of the receiver - like when he played it out thinking Valencia would be making a run. He should have looked yes, but Valencia at WB should have been making that run.

Regardless he is having an off day although most of the team seems poor - we need to revert to the diamond for the second half.

3373~~~
A Moyes-esque Fellaini performance. Disappointing considering how well he's done the past few games.

3374~~~
A very good clearance from a corner at the end and one nice pass 

Apart from that it's been pretty bad

3375~~~
Horrible performance so far. Only positive is he didnt get booked, yet.... Looked like a basketball player or something

3376~~~
He's having a bit of a shocker today. Not only is he passing poorly, but he's losing out in the majority of the aerial duels. He shouldn't be losing the aerial battle against Wanyama and certainly not against Bertrand.

Him and Paddy seemed to have a competition in that half for who could screw up the most.

3377~~~
Dreadful so far. Tactics have no impact and players giving it away so needlessly like he has done time and time again that half. Just been shite.

3378~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3379~~~
It actually makes me angry watching him play. I never thought I could dislike a United player so much. He's just so shite and yet LVG seems to rate him ahead of Herrera (an actual footballer). As I said in the match thread he has little or no footballing ability. Watching him reminds me of that huge 14 year old kid with no talent who would just dominate teams purely because of his size. Really should have come off instead of McNair.

3380~~~
I'm having horrible flashbacks

3381~~~
He has the football ability of a potato.

3382~~~
Poor from Felli for sure. Negative tactics from ourselves are putting too much pressure on himself/mcnair/evans/rojo. Hopefully herrera will alleviate that and we can keep the ball better

3383~~~
He's a limited footballer and is useful in some matches. Against a high energy pressing team he is useless.

3384~~~
I don't think Fellaini was even this bad last season. Easily his worst game for us so far. He's been absolute gash today.

3385~~~
He's been getting a lot of praise recently for not very much. He's been pretty shite, not even mentioning his fault for their goal he has no idea where to be in a two man midfield and has been slow on the ball.

3386~~~
A bit harsh on pub players that.

3387~~~
I don't know what's worse, his performance or van Gaal's decision to move him to holding midfielder position. But we aren't supposed to criticise our Marouane, right?



You are definitely my agenda poster of the year, you must be Fellaini's brother or something like that, and plus you hate Herrera, or you simply love Fellaini that much that you need to downplay Herrera to praise him.

3388~~~
Fellaini should have been subbed and not McNair IMO looking back. McNair was shite but fellaini, that was seriously one of the worst halves ive seen from a player. Constantly gave it away, lost headers, caught out of position.

3389~~~
Passing is poor today. Nothing coming off for him. 

Playing him at the base of the midfield is also asking for trouble. He doesn't have the distribution or speed to play there.

3390~~~
First really bad game in a while, it's been him and McNair as poorest so far, got another 45 minutes to turn it around now.

3391~~~
I said he is having a bad game, but the reaction after their goal in the match thread was ridiculous and over the top. Watching the half time analysis you can see that yes, Fellaini gives the ball away, but at that point they are 3v6 and we should have easily defended it.

Similarly I don't hate Herrera, I use him as a comparison as he is a fan favourite whereas Fellaini is anything but. Herrera gave the ball away in a very bad position and it was largely ignored, but when Fellaini makes a lesser mistake he MUST BE BURNED WITH THE FURY OF A THOUSAND SUNS.

3392~~~
Well, at least he can't get any worse.

3393~~~
No he's been much worse. Bayern spring to mind. This was him in about 50% of games last season.

3394~~~
I hope people don't completely hate the crap out of Fellaini. He's been poor that first half, but the game's not over. He's had a few really good games. Time for him to justify our slowly improving faith in him (or as it was before this game and is yet to be decided).

3395~~~
Poor game for Fellaini so far tonight, but this 352 doesn't do him, or the whole team for that matter, any favours. Lack of options of the ball. All we're doing is hoofing it.

3396~~~
Piss poor performance but, he ain't the only one.

3397~~~
He has time to put it right in the second half. But its a big task

3398~~~
His passing has been awful and he is only one to blame no one else, valencia had no chance of getting on the end of that because it was a bad pass, he got plenty of good praise for one good game against Chelsea so he is going to get criticised when he has a shocker. As well as being awful on the ball his positioning has been terrible today and he is running around like a headless chicken.

3399~~~
We are just asking for it if we play him at the base of the midfield. He's like a headless chicken there and isn't the most defensively astute player or has the reading of the game to play there. 

Wasn't great before his switch to the base of the midfield mind and seems to be having an off game. Saying that his recent performances should allow him a teeny bit of leeway so far. Hope we go with 4 at the back, with Carrick at the base and Fellaini pushed further up. Seriously......

3400~~~
Either shunt him to the right of the midfield or play him as a second striker. He is not a central midfielder in a 100 years.

3401~~~
Nobody, literally nobody is making himself available for the ball for nobody, thus so many mistakes from Rojo, McNair, Evans charging with the ball. Even Carrick is playing sideaways.

3402~~~
The entire team is looking rubbish. For me that typically points towards bad tactics. Fellaini has been one of the worst but as <a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a> said I don't think players are making themselves available enough, and tthatis at least partially a result of formation.

3403~~~
What on earth is he doing today?

He's been losing his man, slowing play down, second to every ball and losing every physical challenge.

3404~~~
He's not the only one but it's not the formations fault he can't pass the ball very well, he is also constantly out of position in this half and just jogging back after he gets too far forward.

3405~~~
Acknowledge that everybody is.

Not to mention that he's playing at CDM the second half which is not his position.

3406~~~
I don't care if it's his position or not he has to adapt his game not just keep playing the same way. Look he has had a bad game there is no dressing it up, not the only one by any means but he has been one of the worst players in a bad performance.

3407~~~
Then tell Rooney to play in a fecking central midfield and expect him to perform to his level. Play Herrera as a CDM, Mata looks wank in CM as well, everybody has to adapt or LVG has to stop fecking around with playing people out of their positions by constant changes to the formation?

Playing players out of their position was one of the main whips to lash Moyes last season, same's happening this year.

3408~~~
Terrible performance. Him and loads of others, obviously.

3409~~~
He has been one of the worst but when the entire team looks clueless, I tend to blame the manager and tactics primarily.

In the second half Fellaini has made numerous defensive clearances and interceptions. He has contributed more than Mata or Herrera for me, even if he has made several mistakes as well.

3410~~~
Play with some intelligence it's quite simple, at times you are going to have to do a job and you need to do it as best you can, if you are playing as a dm you don't rush forward aimlessly.

3411~~~
Horrific stuff

3412~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's like saying: anybody can play as a goalkeeper, just stand in goal.

3413~~~
LVg mess up no doubt but fellaini has been poor and making a couple of tackles and interceptions is nothing to brag about, mata has been awful I agree.

3414~~~
It's not like that in the slightest.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3415~~~
He's played there before so I don't see the big deal and that is also a ridiculous comparison, just  accept it he has been poor and you cant take it. When he plays well he is a great player for turning it round and when he is bad it's everyone else's fault.

3416~~~
I have said several times he has been poor so it isn't bragging, just acknowledging that there have been some positive contributions as well - would you rather a player who is at least involved in play even if he is looking a bit off the pace (less so in the second half) or one who is completely anonymous like Mata or Herrera?

3417~~~
No, you're talking shit, I was the first person here to say he's having a horrible game but unlike you, who's got his opinion fixed and can't really think about the reasons <b>why</b> he has been shit today ( like everybody else bar RVP ), I look for a reason why our team is looking like a sack of shit which coincidences with us switching to 352 again.

3418~~~
One word - abysmal

3419~~~
Bad game, he will do better next time.

3420~~~
I thought he was better in the 2nd half. Got a few tackles in and played it simple in possession.

3421~~~
Diabolical performance. Said it was the return of last season's Fellaini at half time, turns out he didnt truly return till the end of the game when he ran his elbow into someone

3422~~~
He was horrendous in the first half, but really stepped up in the second i think. Got stuck in there and is useful in he air

3423~~~
He was shit because he was out of position and kept passing it poorly, formation isn't always going to be tailored to you and he was better against Arsenal in the same formation so look a bit harder.

3424~~~
He really got better in the 2nd half, still not good but kept possession.

3425~~~
I am not going to compliment someone for a couple of tackles and interceptions, he was awful apart from last ten mis or so when he was competent, mata was awful all game but that doesn't make fellaini better.

3426~~~
He's looked as poor in the first half, but if I need to look harder than here you go: he was partnered by Mata in CM since 30th minute when we've switched Paddy with Carrick at the back.

And yea, obviously formation isn't always going to be tailored to him but it isn't fecking tailored to anybody, that's the main problem.

3427~~~
Had a shocker tonight but he was not the only one.

3428~~~
Really poor game. Time and time again he had a clear option and took one touch too many and that option was lost and he found himself in trouble. Worse still was how many he misplaced which instantly heaped pressure on us, one of which leading to their goal.

Hopefully he can get the form he had back.

3429~~~
He always had a nasty side to him at Everton with his elbows and he was lucky not to get booked tonight.

3430~~~
Old Fellaini in the first half, New Fellaini having a bad game in the second...if that makes sense...

3431~~~
Feck off Moyes, seriously.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3432~~~
Horrible first half, better second (not saying much to be fair).

3433~~~
Yeah...the obligatory elbow surge was there

3434~~~
If I got a penny for every time he elbowed someone in the face.

3435~~~
He let midfielders run past him for the two best chances of the match. 

Unacceptable.

3436~~~
You must really not rate any defenders then.

Again the reason I mention Mata (and Herrera) is because you will see that they will receive maybe 10% of the abuse that Fellaini gets, despite being arguably worse today. Fellaini's first half was his worst of the season without question, but his second wasnt that bad. You were saying earlier in this very thread about how he should still be able to play CDM, yet you are now saying you refuse to acknowledge tackles and interceptions as a worthwhile contribution? What are you expecting him to do from that position then?


From my point of view, the majority of the blame for tonights performance lies with LVG. We thought that with the Herrera/McNair substitution he was realising that the 3-5-2 wasnt working, but in fact it just meant putting Carrick at CB and Fellaini at DM - neither of which are their best positions.

When an individual plays badly, you blame the individual. When the entire team looks bad then you have to look at the tactics and question the manager.

3437~~~
Glad him improved after an utterly dire first half in which he seemed to forget how to pass the ball to people on his side. Not a defensive midfielder, doesn't have the mobility, and lacks the passing to start things off but he filled in well. Went some way to redeeming himself second half but had we drawn I'd be feeling less generous towards him. Two games running Fellaini loses it and the opposition score. That's not good enough.

3438~~~
You'd make a Rolls Royce on Ramos.

3439~~~
Awful first half, slightly better in the second defensively. He's come into form when being a midfield "general". As an anchor he was painful to watch. He's limited to do that role and your limiting his impact on the game. I'd rather Fletcher in anchor than Fellaini if we had to go for one of the two.

3440~~~
To be honest I thought while he improved a bit in the second half he was still rubbish. Won the ball back a few times but made way too many mistakes.

3441~~~
How is he a midfielder when his passing is so poor at times? Even the ones that are successful, you never feel the weight is right. A few times tonight his passes were too slow or bobbly, putting his team mates under pressure. I feel like he doesn't concentrate enough on passing the ball properly.

3442~~~
That's not the point you can't justify a really poor game by saying he did a couple of good things, tackles and interceptions are important but I would be worried if a DM or defender didn't make any and it's nothing to get excited about if the rest of their performance is rubbish. Your clutching at straws.

3443~~~
That was a Fellaini performance from last season! Appalling. I still think with Di Maria out move him up behind the front 2 strikers and have a midfield 3 of Mata, Carrick and Herrera

3444~~~
Saying he improved in the second half cannot be used as a compliment, we could have brought on Doris the tealady and she would have been an improvement on that first half.

3445~~~
He's been great in the past 2/3 games but today he went through the floor. Now he needs to find his way through the rubble, get to the stairs, and climb his way up again.

3446~~~
Absolute dog shit performance. He won't play Sunday

3447~~~
Horrific performance. Was that an elbow at the end too? Sky showed only one replay.

3448~~~
If Fellaini played in Spain he'd get sent off every game. Ramos is a saint compared to this thug.

3449~~~
He should be kept as far away as humanly possible from our own goal.

3450~~~
At no point have I tried to "justify" his performance - I gave him a 4 on the player ratings (admittedly with hindsight I would maybe have upped it to 5). He had a poor day, but;
*he was being played in a position which is definitely not his best
*the entire team was playing poorly
*he was arguably our best midfielder (ie better than Mata and Herrera who were both anonymous all game)
*he improved in the second half as the game went on and made some good contributions defensively

So again, bad game, but nowhere near enough to merit the level of pure vitriol in the matchday thread (which was what my original post in this thread today was referring to).

3451~~~
Not a good game from Fellaini today, although I felt he had a better second half. He's definitely a confidence player, though. His first touch of the game was a poor one, and I felt from there he looked pretty nervous. Hoping he can pick it up for Liverpool, because prior to this, he's shown people that he can put in good performances against the top sides. We just need to scrap this 352, in my opinion.

3452~~~
You'd see him sent off as often as you see players in Spain booked for diving.

Especially when it's diving for a penalty. Out of sheer curiosity, have you seen Fonte's elbow on Herrera? Or Mane's studs up tackle on RVP? Not that it justifies Fellaini's dirty work.

3453~~~
He will play

3454~~~
He's useful in some situations but he's far too sloppy and wreckless to be a consistent starter for us, very poor today. Should be used sparingly.

3455~~~
Perhaps it's simply a case of him being better suited to the diamond, or generally a more conventional formation. Although he probably looked the worst player on the pitch, he certainly isn't the only United player to look much worse in the 352.

3456~~~
Thought he came out fighting in the second half and even though it wasn't as good as his recent performances he was better.

3457~~~
He is awful as a holding midfielder. No 2 ways about that. Really was a dreadful performance especially the first half.

Once Blind comes back from injury he'll be on the bench. Herrera, Blind, Carrick are comfortably a few levels above him. Useful to have as a squad player though in certain roles and was in good form before this.

3458~~~
Now how is this for a really controversial theory:

In the first half, Fellaini ended up looking so bad because he was one of the only ones really showing for the ball, and thus when he HAD the ball he had no real options.

And no, this isnt me trying to deflect the blame for a poor performance, but merely a theory owing to the fact that in the first half the likes of Mata and Rooney were completely anonymous - Fellaini seemed to get quite a bit of the ball (and lost it a lot of the time) so he was obviously getting into positions where he could receive it - if other players were doing the same and giving him some easy options for the passes, maybe he would have done better?

3459~~~
maybe the least creative player in the league, and when he can't do the simple things he's useless.

3460~~~
Showing for the ball doesn't explain his inability to make simple five yard passes under no pressure. Technically he's poor and being closed down affects him but tonight he was sloppy even when not under any considerable pressure.

3461~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a>, give it a rest, man. I know you have self-appointed yourself as Fellaini's crusader on this website, and I am sure he would be thrilled with it. But your posts are getting boting now. 

Fellaini was fecking terrible today. There is no two ways about it.

3462~~~
Nice theory, partially it sounds about right because he's made more passes than Carrick today ( with not all that bad completion, probably made up for it in the second half, ended up with 84% success rate ) but the latter was sent to defence. But hey, we're playing it from the back and for <b>that</b> reason Michael was moved to that 3-men-pile-of-shit.

Match to forget really. I blame the 352 for everybody's inability today.

3463~~~
Aaaaaand you're getting silly now.

3464~~~
I agree he was sloppy and gave the ball away too much, but I have to say he is normally pretty good at retaining the ball under pressure - that has been one of his key strengths so far this season for me.

3465~~~
Yep, he looked all over the place in the first half, nothing was going right for him at all and in fairness he wasn't the only one either but he improved or began to gain control of things in the second half. He's on the back of  few very good performances in recent weeks though so I wouldn't be calling for his head or anything yet.

3466~~~
Under pressure his size helps him to shield the ball but in my opinion he's just not a top level midfielder and never will be. Technically he's ridiculously lacking.

3467~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3468~~~
My post was meant to be tongue-in-cheek and I blame LVG for tonights performance as I have said in several threads, but 84% completion isnt actually that bad, especially considering how bad he and the entire team were in the first half.

3469~~~
I hadn't thought of it this way, but your post makes sense to me, and you're right, he didn't shy away from the ball as too many of his teammates did.

3470~~~
He wasn't as bad as perusing this site would have people think. He was poor in the first half and decent in the second. Only RvP and DDG were good. The rest were average or below average. Fellaini was slightly below average all things considered. What annoyed me was that he struggled in the air against the likes of Wanyama; that's what he's there for, to win the long balls. He mostly won them in the second half in defense though, so that helped slightly.

3471~~~
Its not really a criticism. It isn't his game to be creative. He doesn't make incisive passes or clever dribbles. He usually does the messy stuff and the fundamental stuff right. When he doesn't do it though, he doesn't offer anything.

Why don't you relax <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3472~~~
That's why I've said it's 'partially' right <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3473~~~
I was referring to his size/strength/ability to shield the ball when I said he is good under pressure. Ignoring tonight, most of his games this season I have been impressed by his ability to receive the ball in potentially problematic areas and manage to hold off an opponent and release the ball well to a teammate.
Technique? Its pointless trying to argue anything after tonights performance but in general I wouldnt go so far as to say that he is "ridiculously lacking" - obviously he is never going to be a Paul Scholes type of player, but I would hope that in his other games this season he has shown enough to dispel some of the myths about his technique.

3474~~~
Today, the shit Fellaini turned up as opposed to the dominating all-round behemoth we've been witnessing over the past few games.

He was in Wanyama's pocket all night long, and it was one of those nights where he could've even been outjumped in the air by a three foot hobbit.

3475~~~
So I havent gone <i>completely</i> mad then, that is good.

3476~~~
Even on that form, I couldn't really give a shit when the opposition hit a long ball forward because he's on the pitch. Some shocking passing but he was definitely a factor in us not looking under too much pressure towards the end.

3477~~~
I wouldn't use my support as evidence of your sanity if I were you.

3478~~~
Hmm...touché.

3479~~~
Horrible first, completely decent second.

3480~~~
Thought he was just about passable in the second half, if I'm being generous. He was completely pass-unable in the first half - dreadful.

3481~~~
I Think that the 352 really exposes our deficiensies in midfield and attack. Affected Fellaini tonight aswell, he needs more support in order to function.

3482~~~
hold your horses.

Fellaini was so bad last season that a decent performance in the last 3 games looks like some kind of improvement . which is not.

3483~~~
Showed his limited attributes today. He was the player to get the ball off the back three and that simply doesn't suit him at all. He isn't good enough on the ball and a passer for that job.

3484~~~
I guess you're right. Once we manage to get a decent defensive midfielder I'm convinced he'll be off. He's just not a Manchester United style footballer.

Despite that, LVG seems to trust him.

3485~~~
You just called him "the least creative player in the league" though. It's a silly statement. He's not even the least creative player in our team.

3486~~~
Worst he's played in a good while, and like a lot of our players, he looked tentative and sloppy. But he's enough brownie points in the bank for him to be allowed to move on from it.

3487~~~
Yep, that was a clear red card.

3488~~~
Exactly. He is not a proper central midfield player. 

He did well when he was on the right and the opposition was sitting back. That allowed him to run to box and make himself useful. Or run back to win goal kicks from either keeper. Got shown up tonight under the press when he only had to make simple passes.

3489~~~
Stood up well second half after a poor first.  Really got stuck in the last fifteen minutes.  Bad day for him overall but at least he kept at it and showed character to help battle for the win.

3490~~~
Basically this.
Second half from him wasn't *as* bad, showed some character like the rest of the side to grind out a result somehow.

3491~~~
Thread has gone basically as expected. He's back to being a conference standard player, worst player to ever wear the shirt, second coming of satan etc etc.

In reality, a poor first half. Was one of the worst but let's be honest there were a handful that were just as equally bad. Yes he gave the ball away for the goal but it could have easily been Rojo, Evans, McNair, Rooney, or Mata that did that. Just happened to be him. Wanyama beat him physically which makes me wonder how fit he was. Last season when he was playing injured he was poor and he was under some doubt before the match, maybe he just cannot play well when he has some kind of issue?

Anyway, LvG didn't help him by shifting him into the CDM role. He struggles with the off the ball stuff in that position and it showed. However, he did improve in the 2nd half and started to dominate again - winning headers and tackles. So overall, a poor game compared to his recent stuff but let's not go over the top considering he has been our 2nd best player for the past month.

3492~~~
His positioning has never been his strong point. He's a box to box player, sitting in a role that requires him to have a footballing brain doesn't work.

It's not his fault, he was played out of position. Didn't have the best of games before the switch though, and just hoping this is a one off and he's back to form and drops Gerrard next week with the peoples elbow.

3493~~~
He was so bad last season his performances over the last few games were an improvement. Fails to convince he should be anywhere near first a team regular at United.

3494~~~
Played nowhere near as well as he's showed recently. His passing was probably the worst out of any player out there.

3495~~~
awful. Not good enough for us. Fair play to him his recent performances have improved but the last 2 games were poor

3496~~~
Poor tonight but not he only one! Rooney McNair Mata Evans take your pick

3497~~~
Who offers less creativity from a midfield position?

3498~~~
We'll see if he plays against Liverpool whether tonight was just a bad day. I don't think he'll get in the eleven personally, I wouldn't select him purely because this will be a high tempo game with crap defences at both ends so in effect we should match them. At the same time by all accounts he didn't train so maybe the 3-5-2 set up further outlined his deficiencies in that way. Never want to see him against a team with quick players to be the anchor because he hasn't the composure to transmit calmness on the ball that a Carrick/Blind/Fletcher do. As a box to box he's shown signs of his best days at Everton.

3499~~~
Would anybody except Walrus, not swap him for Jedinak who is the most similar player in the league and also a more effective one?

3500~~~
Look, you said something silly. Just accept it and move on.

3501~~~
Crystal Palace fans wouldn't either!

3502~~~
This thread is so fecking unbearable when he has a game off. All the people who don't post here after he's had a decent game swarm this place like flies swarm shit. I'd start worrying for Jimmy because I haven't seen him for ages here, wasn't it for today's game.

3503~~~
You should see the Ronaldo thread. He gets shit after scoring hattricks.

3504~~~
He was desperate tonight. He looked so slow and immobile and his passing was embarrassing. Very much like the Fellaini of last season.

 That said, it's unfair to criticise him too harshly considering how well he's played the last 2 months. Ultimately I don't think he should be a long term first teamer at Utd but for now he's fine and up until tonight he's been very effective.

I think he'll start on Sunday, with how weak Liverpool are from set pieces he should cause havoc.

3505~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3506~~~
Can't pass, so can't be used in midfield.. Sadly can't be used period. Clumsy, no movement no passing range.. Heading is his only attribute..

3507~~~
My my, the WUMs have really come out of the woodwork tonight.

3508~~~
I wouldn't. At all. Fellaini is a much, much better player.

3509~~~
In what ways is Fellaini a better player than Jedinak?

3510~~~
They are back in full force. Couldnt wait for their chance. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Imagine he had a poor game and that automatically means he's not good enough for us. 
Well at least he's the only player who had a bad game, isn't he..

3511~~~
In almost every facet of the game. Maybe from a defensive perspective they are similar in tackling ability but that is about it. Oh, Jedinak has a better free kick on him.

3512~~~
Some fans are just pathetic, don't show up when he plays well so they can't moan then crawl out of the woodwork when he has a bad game but failing to mention we as a team were shite.

3513~~~
The alternative is that some people don't think he's actually playing that well but can't be arsed arguing otherwise because every criticism is interpreted as some kind of agenda post and gets hounded out. Talking about Fellaini isn't really worth that kind of hassle. He's singled out for criticism more often than others because he's cumbersome, sloppy, careless and inexplicably elbows people an obscene amount of times. His style of play simply will make him unattractive to some people and I don't see why people take issue with that - it's completely understandable. That's not an agenda that's an honest and reasonable reaction to a player's game. It doesn't mean the criticism isn't valid.

If you watch him for the goal you'll see what he does almost every time he's tracking back and a cross is coming in - he's slow to get there in the first place and because he's still on the move by the time the ball comes in he's not actually in a position to get his head on it. Is he even able to sprint? I don't think he's in any way lazy but I genuinely can't think of a time when I've seen him really bust a gut to get back, it's very odd.

3514~~~
Yup. Its as if all they're trying to prove is that he's not good enough and are happy as hell when he plays bad..

3515~~~
There was some stat posted that he's made the most high intense runs from our team untill some point ( can't remember during which match it was posted ) so yea, I guess he can sprint although he's not going to leave trials of fire behind him while doing so.

You know, I don't mind the criticism, it's very noble that you're pointing out rather fair reasons to dislike him for, although you'll find many disliking him because he's simply a) Fellaini b) Moyes player. It is agenda though when one makes odd 92 posts in thread of a player he doesn't like and most of them are full of shit or of incredible substance such as 'would you trade him for Jedinak?'.

I just can't understand why would anybody bother with that. I didn't like Cleverley and I didn't reside in his thread talking shit about him 24/7, I won't jump out of Rooney's birthday cake yet I don't slate him after every game, you know, this criticism isn't pointed at you as I hardly see you here, but some could simply feck off because it's looking rather silly really. 

After today's game you could probably hang half of the team by their balls yet I assume that out of all players' threads, this one is the most active for the negative reason. I'd actually start with hanging one who implemented that stupid 352 formation I'm starting to be obsessed with.

3516~~~
I have talked about this when almost everyone was blinded by his LVG rise... Today we got pressed and his lacking came crystal clear. Used his strength very well after we got the second goal.. Heading and clearing it was top notch in the last 15 tonight..  He is not a man utd calibre midfielder.

3517~~~
Some terrible, loose passing but you can say that about most of our players today.

3518~~~
There were a few poor performances throughout the team tonight, but Fellaini was the worst of the lot. Terrible. Back to his usual self it seems.

3519~~~
My view on Fellaini is known, Brwned sums up nicely why many just don't bother, he had a few decent games and you'd think he'd turned into Scholes, Keane, Pirlo, Redondo etc......and any negativity was swarmed on by his fan club. If LvG wants to play possession football that is aesthetically pleasing, then long term he has no place here, and the suggestions that our midfield is sorted with him as part of the solution is massively wide of the mark.

As for tonight he was poor but so were the CM's around him once Carrick got moved into defense. The role he was given tonight took away his most useful attributes.

3520~~~
I guess he's allowed an off day and I'm just glad it was in a game we won. No more please Marouane.

3521~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3522~~~
He was awful tonight but he'll have better days. He is an incredible asset to have in the team for defending set pieces and he's saved us countless times in our 5 game winning streak from defending set pieces but I have a feeling he might not be in the first team next season as his passing isn't creative enough to be a man utd player....but he's an incredible squad player to have if LVG can find the right player to replace him over the summer  and he has been our third best player this year but the jury is very much still out

3523~~~
Shit, shit player who's recent run of good form has made people believe he's good enough for this team going forward. I'm not convinced. Sell this guy in summer

3524~~~
It seemed like the caf warmed up to him a bit these last few weeks. But, after a brief reprieve the knives are back out.

3525~~~
It was always going to be like that though.

3526~~~
A poor match, it happens. There'll be cause for concern if he repeats this sort of stuff but at the moment nothing suggests anything like that.

3527~~~
Posters are fickle. They throw players under the bus after a bad performance and fall in love with them again after the next good one.

3528~~~
I remain unconvinced. Props for his recent performances but when we buy a Strootman or a Vidal this imposter won't get a sniff

3529~~~
Unbelievable the amount of flack Fellaini is getting on here. Check our winning record since Fellaini started featuring in our starting 11...give the man a break.

3530~~~
A few days ago we where title contenders and now it will be an achievement to get 4th after such a poor display.  Peoples minds change  every game.

On Fellaini he is not the flashiest or most skillful player but he does his bit and he played a big part in the second half with some very important interceptions.

3531~~~
It's clear there's a good player in there somewhere, but he'll never reach the heights demanded by a 30m player. We know that, hence the outrage at overpaying. He'll always be what he was at Everton, a nuisance, a physical presence, and that's only if we utilise him correctly. He had a bad game but no-one really covered themselves in glory, RvP apart. I wanted him dropped for Herrera as soon as he was fit again, but even he didn't look great when he came on. Just one of those games.

3532~~~
If you think that counts centre halves then fine, go ahead. Obviously I don't think players like Clint fecking Hill are more creative than Fellaini. But Fellaini certainly isn't creative, nor is it his job to be.

3533~~~
It's kind of understandable as he isn't really that likable as a player. Obviously has that association with Moyes which puts him in a negative light for a lot of people right away, people see him like a player we should never have signed even if he was in good form. Then he's a very clumsy/dirty player, always leading with his elbows which doesn't do him favors with people who are on the fence about him. On the ball he is a bit clumsy, and not a flair player at all, doesn't look neat and tidy or whatever. He used to be one of my least favourite players really, but he's proven that he can be a useful squad player this season. I still don't rate him particularly highly and think he'll never be more then a squad player, as he just doesn't have enough quality on the ball.

Also considering he was directly the reason for the last 2 goals we conceded, then you can kind of understand that people will be more harsh on him especially as they probably never completely warmed to him. He was shite today IMO but I think it's because he was being asked to play in the holding midfield role, which he just can't do. Isn't good enough positionally, defensively, on the ball, doesn't open himself up enough for it or anything. His best role is a roaming midfielder role and so he can bring down long balls occasionally, get stuck in at times or win headers from crosses.

3534~~~
The Stoke one where he was injured?

3535~~~
Yeah. Sure he got injured, but you play to the whistle, just kick the ball out, don't just fall down. Not like the guys foot was even close to his head anyways. Not saying he was faking it, but even if you pick up a knock you have to at least kick the ball out before you fall down.

3536~~~
I said this at the time but I'm not buying the whole "good form" nonsense. He was better than last year - does that constitute him being in good form? No. Any improvement would have been noticeable. 

He's clumsy, slow, and can't pass. Should be nowhere near the team and never should have been.

3537~~~
Maybe. Don't think the opponents foot had much to do with it though. Was clearly a neck injury caused my his own movement. If I felt something wrong with my neck I am not sure my first instinct would be to worry about the ball. Anyway, it's not like that was the sole reason for that goal. The defending wasn't a lot better from everyone else.

3538~~~
Don't talk rubbish (good form nonsense) he has been very good of late and had a drop off in the last two games.

3539~~~
I have been happy to see Fellaini improve this year. However, he was downright awful in the first half, especially with the misplaced pass that led to the goal. I think he will play better against Liverpool.

3540~~~
He was dog shit last night.
Wyanyama(sp) was stronger, faster, better on the ball and beat him in most of the challenges they went in for.

He just went to pieces and it it spread throughout the midfield.

3541~~~
You seriously believe he's been good? I don't - I think it's just been better than previous. 

If that is what a 27m midfielder looks like playing well then God help us.

3542~~~
When we were linked with Wanyama, he was often dubbed as "not good enough for us", but he bossed us on his own practically. He's done very well at Southampton. Rarely does anyone get the better of him.

For all his flaws, Fellaini nearly always wins the physical battle, but he was made to look small yesterday, and not just by Wanyama. The whole midfield really lacked any sort of understanding, but I still expected better from Fellaini, from a physical point of view. It's a shame, as he was in a good run of form and was looking very important in the way Van Gaal has set the side up. Hope he can get back on it against Liverpool.

3543~~~
We probably overpayed for him, and he was crap last season, but give the lad some credit, he's been decent so far and he's helping us get back into the Champions League. Won't cry if we off-load him at the end of the season, but he's paying his dues at the moment.

3544~~~
It's sad how people were waiting for him to have a bad game like vultures, first bad game he's had this season, for me the jury is still out on him but giving him the full season before making any judgement.

3545~~~
To be honest, there is so much negativity surrounding him from fans that it would probably be better for his own sake to go somewhere where he is less divisive. Perhaps Moyes will come in this summer.....didn't he lose 4 - 0 last night?

3546~~~
The knives were always being sharpened in wait. It's not like he was the only one who stunk the place out....he's made a massive contribution in other games but for many on here, they have a blind spot on here.

3547~~~
He's been good. He absolutely dominated Fabregas - who has probably been the best CM in the league this season. He has been solid/good in every other match too. Everyone knows we overpaid for him, but it's time to move on. How much did we pay for Herrera? Mata? They are probably under performing for their price tags too. 

No way would Fellaini want to go and join Moyes at Sociedad. Too much of a step down.

3548~~~
He's genuinely looked good in the last 2 or 3 games.

3549~~~
I don't understand one thing with him, I don't know if it's because he's stupid or he does it purposely. I'm talking about the moments when he tries to retrieve the ball by going through the opponent <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, I mean wtf, you know it's impossible to get the ball as the guy in front of him put his body in front of it but Marouane barges into him regardless. 100% sure way of conceding a stupid FK.

3550~~~
As depressing as it is inevitable to see the naysayers try to wipe those games from history the moment he has a poor game. Pathetic.

3551~~~
Don’t know what some fans expect to hear after a game like that, his passing and positioning were terrible, awful pass that led to their goal, lost too many aerial duels and physical battles so he isn’t going to get much praise. It doesn’t make him a terrible player but he hasn’t managed to repeat the performance he put in against Chelsea and has been fairly average recently, I still don’t see anything to suggest he is good enough to play week in week out and is nothing more than just a squad player.

I also can’t understand how Fellaini and Moyes suggested his best position is a holding midfielder he lacks every attribute required to play there and it was painful to watch him running out of position and then jogging back slowly last night.

It was shocking how bad our 3 midfielders were (formation partially to blame but doesn't absolve them), all 3 have shown they have something to offer but accommodating them is not easy and something will have to be done to address the lack of balance we have, wouldn’t be surprised to see Mata and/or Fellaini go in the summer.

3552~~~
Thought he did really well against Arsenal and very good in subsequent matches obviously bar yesterday.

3553~~~
He was turd but one bad game doesn't suddenly wipe out his form over the last 5 or so games. He has been important to Utd's revival.

3554~~~
Hr was awful but it infuriates me when players get all the blame for conceding a goal like that. He was on the half way line with 7 players behind him who were all narrow at the time and did feck all but let him walk through

3555~~~
He can have one of these games in a while. I expect him to struggle against teams that press us and are fluid in midfield which Southampton were today.

3556~~~
There were so many defensive errors that followed his misplaced pass that I wouldn't give him much blame for that. He shouldn't be passing the ball like that but it's not like it was Gerrard's pass to Drogba.

3557~~~
I hope thats not aimed at me Pogue - my point is i dont believe he has been great...just better than last year.

3558~~~
He was left stranded in the middle. Where were Mata and Herrera to help him?

3559~~~
And has more goals this season, is a better passer, loses less physical battles

3560~~~
It was a general swipe, not aimed at any individual. Do you really think he's not been good at all this season? That's incredibly harsh.

3561~~~
He had a terrible first half and a slightly better second half.  Thing is...just about everyone on the pitch in a MU kit had a terrible game.  I don't even think he was the worst of the bunch.

3562~~~
He got bullied by Wanyama last night. The amount of headers he loses for someone with the size of his bonce is unbelievable as well. Awful player.

3563~~~
Your exact quote was:
Your point of should he should be nowhere near team ignores his form in the last few games. A number of the players were poor last season, is their improvement not counted as good form? He had a bad game yesterday however please do not come out with ridcoulous statements such as he cannot pass. His passing has been fine the last few games, however in this game it was poor but that doesn't mean he cannot pass. He has been a key part of our team this season. LVG who has tryed to instill a passing game into us favours him and therefore must think he has good technical skills plus the fact he gets into the Belgian team ahead of more players who could be percieved as better technically is a big point.

People keep moaning about the price, FFS! that is not his fault, we messed up on the timing of the transfer, that is not down to him but to us.  He has worked hard to get back in the team and deserves all the praise he gets. Instead of people like Anderson who simply cannot be bothered to even try and get back in the team. His work ethic has been great and he has overcome the moronic fans who booed him last year. He obviously performs better in a midfield 3 rather than a 2. He doesn't suit the holding player role, that was evident from last year. If he plays alongside a Blind or Carrick type player, that sorts him better. Bad game yesterday however that could be said for everyone bar 1 or 2 from yesterday.

3564~~~
You cant blame anyone but Fellaini for the poor performance (and that counts for every player). Nevertheless, he will continue to start due to his good displays before but if that continues, he will be benched again

3565~~~
My god, last night was possibly the worst display I have ever seen by an International footballer. Pace - slow, touch - heavy, passing - shocking, heading- got outjumped most of the time, control - non existent, aggression - pussy .. my gran could have taken him.

3566~~~
Playing Fellaini as the DM was the problem.. He can't distribute the ball quick like Carrick or Blind, doesn't keep it moving. Moyes made the mistake last season, asking him to play as a deep playmaker, clearly not his position. But playing him as a box to box midfielder is where he excels the most, doesn't have to make too many critical passes, uses his physicality well and of course offers a perfect outlet for long balls from the back, meaning our CB's have an option other than "try speculative through ball or punt it long hoping RvP magically gets the ball"

Vs Soton they had no where to pass with Carrick getting man marked, and Fellaini playing deeper meant that all the long balls were just giving possession back to Soton. Passing to Fellaini was an equally bad option as Soton just swamped him instantly and he just gave the ball away. Also Mata and Rooney either seemed reluctant to drop deep and offer passing options. Towards the end, we were so much more effective in possession once Fletcher and Herrera sat deep and Fellaini pushed forward.

Playing 3 at the back means the rest of the team needs to more dynamic when not in possession, it's very easy to shut such a tactic down if we can't keep the ball moving. After all, we sacrificed a midfielder to play a back 3, so rest of the midfield and attack needs to work that much harder if we want to keep possession and play a passing game.

3567~~~
Oh yeah I remember this guy from last season! Some posts from last season's Fellaini thread:













And that's just a handful of his total posts all along the same lines, he's like the opposite of mad winger but applied to Fellaini. I don't understand why posters spend so much time attacking a player, objective criticism is fine, I don't know what this is but it's not that.

3568~~~
Even if he gets back to his best form from his Everton days I still want him gone. You need to play to his strengths to get the best out of him (long balls) and that isn't our style.

3569~~~
There's a difference between the level of his performances and the way some are reporting it in my eyes - i dont believe he's been great but equally its been far better than anything shown last season. 

Where i do agree is that last night was a level below his last few performances.  Utterly diabolical last night....and he wasnt alone in that in fairness to him.

3570~~~
See I'd agree with that last paragraph entirely. He was shit.

3571~~~
I dont see what value his passing has brought?  Carrick on the other hand offers far more in that department.  With the way we are looking to play offensively, i do not know what Fellaini offers.  I believe he's in the team due to his size and our vulnerability at set pieces. 

I totally agree he wasnt alone yesterday so i should make that clear.

3572~~~
I hardly think we're playing to his strengths, its more like we need someone like him out there on the pitch. Our defenders can hardly pass the ball, and having him out there means long balls from the back are not just punts giving possession back but rather he helps win the ball and keep possession more often than not.

It might not be tiki-taka or the prettiest style of football to watch but it gets the job done when used right. I agree that it backfires spectacularly when he's asked to drop deep and be a playmaker, but he's been good when played further forward.

3573~~~
He loses a lot of headers in the air for a player of his height.

3574~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a>

I just wanted to see what your opinion was now?

Last time we spoke I replied to this last season:

I was arguing his ability is better than a league 2 footballer but you were saying that's his level, do you think perhaps he is at least championship level now?

You also said this:

Do you remember those random blokes, could you get in touch with them? We have quite a bad injury crisis and could do with some signings I think in January, Louis van Gaal might be interested in scouting them.

3575~~~
I think most on here were happy to see him have a bad game so they could say I told you so.

Ironically I think it has something to do with his size. To win a header, you need to be aggressive and attack the ball. Most footballers are not midgets, so a slight leap and they can easily win a header against him (I remember Alaba winning a header against him last season). Fact is he goes in with the same tenacity as the smaller players he'll be giving away fouls all the time. 

I think Fellaini on a whole plays within himself. You could see it yesterday after the big mistake, he simply stopped trying stuff and played it safe for the rest of the game.

3576~~~
I don't know why people get riled up about Fellaini one way or the other. It's pretty obvious what he's good at & what his limitations are & this has been evident in both his good performances & the bad ones.
We've lacked options in the midfield the last few years so I'm not going to complain about having someone in the squad that's a bit different & seems pretty determined to do well.

3577~~~
Fellaini was very poor yesterday. His passing is not expansive and I don't expect much from him in that regards, but he is usually very good while playing short, simple and precise passes. That was missing yesterday.

The thing that disappointed me more was that he was losing a lot of the physical duels. That is something you expect him to do a lot better as it is one of his strengths.

My opinion of him as a player has not changed, I still think he is a good player who can at least be a squad option.

3578~~~
He only got pulled back to DM when Mcnair came off and Carrick went into the back 3 though. Before that, we were surrendering possession just as badly — which in a way shows how we were just generally shite but also shows that Fellaini was also rubbish at the role he'd been playing in previous matches during those first 30 odd minutes. Wasn't making himself available for longer balls out of defense, and was either losing it or losing the challenge whenever the ball did come near him. Could have just been an off day for him, could be that he got influenced by the general form of the team, or could be that he (like most of our other players STILL do) reacts very badly to energetic teams who press him.

To be fait, even during his recent upturn in form, lots of posts have been along the line of "he's shown he can do a job", which I agree with. It's just that LVG needs to be very clear about the job Fella can do, and not ask him to do anything else, like make quick decisions under pressure. He's not a Michael Carrick that we can just slot into several midfield/defensive roles; the setup, his role and the opposition need to be right.

3579~~~
My favourite was the one that mentioned Fellaini "killing our swag".

What the bollocks does that even mean? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3580~~~
I'm taking inspiration from the RVP thread, and wanting to put my hands up and say I was wrong on Fellaini. Yesterday's game aside, he has deserved his place in recent weeks.

Good on you Marouane, I'm absolutely delighted you're proving me wrong. Keep at it.

3581~~~
Imagine Fellaini in a bar, I wonder when he gets drunk if he's the kind of guy who will walk up behind somebody punch them in the back and when they turn around point to someone else.

3582~~~
I agree with what you say, but the Soton game different than our previous games in that they did their best to make sure Carrick got as little time on the ball as possible, same with our wingbacks. He was expecting LvG to play with a back 3 i think, and Tadic, Long and Mane did a phenomenal job along with Davis and Wanyama in limiting our short passing options. Fellaini then started to drop deep to collect the ball, but Mata and Rooney didn't at first. 

Credit where its due, Koeman and Soton knew just how to counter us, and did it perfectly. It might have been a different story if Carrick had a better passer alongside him from the start like Herrera, or if we'd gone with a 4-4-2 diamond, with Herrera starting instead of the extra CB. Had it now been RvP's clinical finishing, DDG's saves and Soton general wastefulness with regards to producing a quality final ball/finishing, I think we'd have been on the receiving end of a resounding defeat.

3583~~~
He is certainly better now than he was playing at that time. He has largely justified his place in the team in recent weeks, just as Andy Carroll justified his at the weekend. I still believe that in terms of his footballing ability, i.e - controlling (with your feet) the ball, passing long and short, shooting, dribbling - his ability would not stand out at a lower level. Perhaps I cannot necessarily say for certain that League 2 is his level, if this were a scientific conversation, it may be ruled that it is instead Championship or League 1. I do watch a reasonable amount of lower league football as I have a fair few friends who play at those levels, and I am also a Leyton Orient fan (in addition to United of course). I don't see a whole host of midfielders with ability many levels below Fellaini's, I stand by that.

There are so many factors that go into the level a player plays at. I have heard footballers as gifted as John Barnes say that he played with players of greater ability than him when he was a kid who did not make it. It is not as simple as saying that my mate is not a pro, so he couldn't possibly be more gifted than Fellaini. Which leads me towards your other question. Yes, I believe I do indeed know people I have played withwho are not pros who have more footballing ability than Marouane Fellaini. And Andy Carroll. And Nemanja Vidic. Those guys have been coached well and have used some attributes to do their jobs at a very high level. That said, I do believe that my friend Joseph Sachs, for instance, is more gifted than Fellaini and a fair few other pros. Perhaps you think that is impossible given he isn't a pro, so we'll have to disagree here.

Out of curiousity, would you say that Fellaini is significantly more gifted than Jason Koumas, who I believe plays for Tranmere? Personally, I reckon if you took them both to the park and gave them a ball, it would not appear so. Likewise Jay Emmanuel Thomas. For whatever reason, he didn't make it in the Prem, but no chance could Felli do half of the things I've seen him do with a ball.

3584~~~
You can't just pick and choose attributes, often what separates the most elite level player (such as those for Manchester United) with somebody at a mid table club is the psychological component, you can only judge him as a footballer not partial attributes, next you will tell me how Carrick is slower than some of your friends! How Vidic isn't as good a passer as some of your friends! How Ronaldo doesn't get stuck in like some of your friends! How Messi isn't as tall as some of your friends!

And you seem to imply Vidic isn't as good as some of your friends but he just applies his skills better yet the point of a footballer is not to perform on the training pitch but to perform in a match, the whole point is application of those skills, that's what you judge a footballer on.

You cannot say 'My friend has better ability than Vidic but he just doesn't know how to actually apply those skills in a football match'.

If that's the case then your friend is not as better footballer than Vidic.

3585~~~
Fellaini is a player with a certain skill set, a player for situations and certain matches. He should not be a mainstay or a regular starter for a team like United.

We have to use him in the games which are suited to his abilities. Southampton move the ball quickly. You cannot play Fellaini in that sort of a game. LVG should know this. Liverpool is another team Fellaini should not play against. 

A midfield three of Carrick, Herrera and Di Maria should be fielded regularly while Fellaini should come into the lineup if we are playing more physical teams like stoke crystal palace west ham etc. or teams that play with a slower tempo.

3586~~~
It's pretty simple really.

When we're playing some nice football with him in the team it's 'in spite of him' and when we're playing utter shit like yesterday, passing's failing and the sky falls down ( his passing was at 84% completion rate, team average was 81% by the way ), our 'swagger' gets killed by him, it's basically some kind of aura that kills everybody's passing ability.

To some, that is.

3587~~~
As <a class="username" data-user="81972, @Empire" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81972/">@Empire</a> said, you are defining ability way too narrowly. Have you ever seen Abdullah, the football freestyle guy who busks in Leidseplein in Amsterdam? The guy can do things with a football that probably 95% or more of the PL could not do. He was desperate to play for Ajax and has had a couple of trials there I believe, but they arent interested. Not just Ajax either, Im sure he would love to make a living playing football for any club in Holland where he would surely make more than the change he gets from stoned tourists. But unfortunately close control and dribbling arent the only attributes you need. Or passing. 

There will certainly be extremely gifted footballers who never make it playing professional football despite having all the attributes you need. There must be a big element of luck, being in the right place at the right time, playing well when the scouts are watching, playing in a position where there are opportunities at the club you find yourself at etc etc. You may well have a friend who is as good at football as many in the PL, I cant comment on that. 

But just because Fellaini is never going to go on a solo run past 5 players like Giggs' FA Cup goal in 99, or be the best passer in a team, doesnt make him a Sunday League level footballer at all.

3588~~~
He was awful last night, but has been generally good this season.

I have to say though, even when he's playing his best he always looks like he has a big error in him to me. Whether it's letting someone ghost past him while he nonchalantly jogs in a random direction; elbowing someone and risking a red; a casual pass that causes a counter attack (like last night); or just general poor positional play that puts pressure on others.

As I said when we first signed him. He's fine as a squad player who can provide something different in 2-3 different positions; however I think Van Gaal should be looking at other player's to fill the midfield void permanently. Of course it may be the case that he is only using Fellaini this much due to the lack of first team defensive options; which would make sense.

3589~~~
You clearly spent some time digging up my Fellaini related posts. I don't rate him, and im glad we're spending more money on new signings. His days at a top club are numbered. Tick tock

3590~~~
Koeman definitely made the right choices tactically, I agree. In fact, I think that if every manager had the personnel to play a physical pressing game from the front, that's probably how every PL manager would choose to play us, it clearly bothers us and has done for the last few years. The frustration from the fans' point of view is that we'd looked so much better at dealing with that with a back 4 and Carrick sitting in front of it; I almost feel robbed of the opportunity to see if that improvement could stand up to one of the best pressing teams in the league. As it is, all we've found out is that we're still pretty rubbish at playing football with a back 3/5.

As far as Fellaini goes though, I really don't remember him dropping deep before McNair went off. All I remember is him trying to press close to the forwards, not really achieving anything, and then going missing when our defenders needed an out ball from someone behind their press. I agree that he went to DM after McNair went off, and also that he's clearly not suited to playing there. But my worry is that for those first 30 odd minutes, he basically couldn't do the things he's in the team to do — provide some physicality so we're not overrun, and provide a slightly more direct passing option in midfield when the short, deep passing is being denied to us. So, either: 1) yesterday was an off day, the whole team was shite and Fella's form was just a consequence of that, or 2) he's actually not that good at this role either, at least not when the opposition gets physical and presses well.

3591~~~
Our midfield was better after Herrera came on. RVP immediately saw more of the ball

3592~~~
Was it thanks to those 19 passes that Ander managed to play during 60 minutes?

3593~~~
Yes, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and the Belgium national team manager don't know what Fellaini is suited to, but you do.

3594~~~
No, I used the search function with your name in that thread and then copy and pasted random ones so I had a few, there are a lot lot more just like that, I spent no more than two minutes, you made it easy for me because most your posts were the same.

Whether his days are numbered is irrelevant, you thought you were vindicated in your opinion but where would we be this season without him? He has been of value defending set pieces, something LvG needed because of his defensive injury crisis and the lack of height in our box but also his height has offered us an alternative route to attack, the draw against Chelsea and the win against Arsenal, two games that could prove vital in our season, clearly using his height was something Louis van Gaal had worked on, I mean it's clear as day he target Gibbs.

Louis van Gaal was right to keep him and you were wrong to want him out of here. If we sign elite central midfielders then fantastic but they are not so easy to come by and there are other areas to also strengthen, areas of greater importance, had we followed your advice in the summer we would have been in a much worse position! You misjudged the impact he could have for us.

As of now he has been an important contribution in us having an excellent season that is to say where we are, how close we are to the leaders yet having an injury crisis so severe that might have caused Chelsea or City to drop a lot more points had they been the ones experiencing it.

3595~~~
In fairness, footballing ability is an important attribute for a footballer. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

3596~~~
I am aware of all of this. My post explains that Fellaini has obviously learned how to be an effective footballer. He has been coached to fulfil his role, and fair play to him.

I'm just saying that I won't back down from my assertion that people at a lesser level have more talent. Obviously it is those people's own fault that they haven't made it perhaps,  and as i said originally,  there are various factors why a player doesn't make it to the PL. One of the most common factors is likely a lack of natural ability to do so, however, this is not the case in every instance.

I believe you can think Fellaini is as useful or effective as you like, but I think anyone who watches him play should not make a mockery of a statement that someone who does not play in the PL can have more ability. I mean, none of us are blind. He's clearly not a supremely gifted player. Just because he plays for United doesn't prove so. Even within the club - Fellaini and Di Maria are both United players and the gap in technical ability between this is enormous.  Both serve their purpose. Fair dues to Fellaini, or Carroll for making it. Right place,  right rime. Right attitude probably too. I doubt they would have made it as professional footballers if they were somehow in a Spanish or Brazilian academy at 16. It is likely they would have been thrown out for being further from the standard required than my mate Joseph Sachs or this freestyler you referenced.

I think over the last 2 decades, you have a fantastic chance of making it in certain parts of the world if you were fitter and bigger than the others, and had a good application. A position or system will likely be found for you where you are not required to be a particularly good footballer, but a team can make the most of the attributes you do have. Fair play to you, but the observation is still valid I think. Fellaini is bigger and stronger, maybe more disciplined and even intelligent on the pitch - but I don't think he's better at much else than Jason Koumas. That's all I'm saying. Not that Koumas should be at United instead.

I don't think people should react the same way if I say my mate is more talented than Fellaini as they should if I said Di Maria, or even Ashley Young instead. Quite frankly, I would think anyone who watches him, as opposed to simply saying 'not possible, he plays for United' will not find it that inconceivable.

I'm sure we have all heard countless stories of players told to leave an academy as a teenager simply because they were 'too small'. It isn't always ability.

3597~~~
Firstly I dont appreciate your tone. Secondly, Im just saying that theres a pattern. Its evident that Fellaini doesnt get about the pitch quickly. If certain teams move the ball quickly players with a languid style will suffer. like yaya toure suffers in CL games where his lack of mobility is exposed. Fellaini was exposed playing in a two man midfield last year for the same reason. 

Im not claiming ive observed something unique. Its obvious. Van Gaal should have not have started him and shouldnt do so against liverpool. 

Like I said, he has a certain skill set which managers need for certain TYPES of games. He is not a player who should start every game. IMO wilmots should be using nainggolan instead of fellaini. Its my opinion, it doesnt have to imply i know more or less than anyone.

3598~~~
Well I think having a different opinion to three top level managers makes it likely yours is wrong. The entire team struggled yesterday, yet this is the thread and player being discussed the most. It's laughable. I don't even like Fellaini that much, and wouldn't be disappointed if he was benched. There's just too many people blaming him for several glaring flaws in the team.

3599~~~
My opinion on Fellaini is a bit biased to be honest but here goes. He's done really well this season - especially this past month or so when it was needed.

I still don't think, even at his best, he's a top 4 type player. IMO, his skill set is useful and unique, but it has limitations. It's great when it works, but against the top midfielders in the world, I think he'll always fall short.

He's very useful in a "backs against the wall" type set up, but if you prefer playing a high tempo possession based game, I don't think he's mobile/technically gifted enough. If we need a box to box player, I'd prefer the strootman type over Fellaini - he's more energetic and mobile. 

I'll gladly be proven wrong though and if it benefits United - then I hope he continues to prove me wrong. I just think he should be, at best, a great squad option/plan B option at a club of our size. (Without considering the price we paid for him etc). That's another debate.

3600~~~
I'm surprised that people are surprised Fellaini doesn't add <i>that </i>much physicality. At least not in the games where it's really put up to the test (i.e. not against much weaker teams at Old Trafford, who surrender possession completely)

The type of physicality and strength needed in midfield is miles away from the physicality and strength needed in a second striker role (in a team with emphasis on high balls and crosses.)

It's like Andy Carroll - It's not hard for him to be 'strong' when his task is just to stand their and literally muscle off defenders as he waits for a lofted ball.

Now ask him to be as strong and use that muscle while also turning about and having to use his brain quicker.
Ask him to out muscle a defender while dribbling or while moving about and being agile.
And what you'll get is what you got at Liverpool, which was Andy Carroll being knocked over quite a lot, somehow being made to look quite flimsy and lightweight (unless the ball was in the air) and on his arse quite a lot.
Bambi on ice.

Similar thing applies to Fellaini, though not to the same extent.
Notable example: Him losing the ball on the edge of his box versus Newcastle last season.

3601~~~
Firstly, in many cases an opinion is not 'wrong'. Its just an opinion based on observations. so i cant be wrong unless im basing my observations on something which is not factual. im sure there are many managers who dont rate fellaini, does it mean then that they are wrong too? or does it mean that everyone has an opinion and any opinion can be right at a given moment of time?

secondly, i too think many players were poor yesterday, but im not basing my opinion on one game. Ive always thought that fellaini should be used sparingly and only for certain kinds of games. If there was a way you could check all the posts ive made about fellaini you would see what im talking about. 

im not blaming him. im merely saying that he shouldnt start particular games, eg. liverpool next week. its not a game i feel he would do well in. its unfortunate that di maria and blind are injured. it might be that we have no other choice.

3602~~~
Don't bother mate.... some people are simply obsessed with him...just ignore them

3603~~~
He was blatantly fouled in that example, there is a gif floating about.

3604~~~
I dont think he's like Carrol. Carrol will win everything in the air regardless of the strength or size of his opponent

Fellaini will win strength battles against much smaller and weaker opposition as you'd expect, but when someone is actually some competition for him he doesn't look very strong. Why? Fellaini relies on his size, not strength. His sheer size lets him win some headers and dominate smaller, weaker players. Theres nothing athletic about it. He doesnt get off the ground very high, he isnt pushing people away from him with his strength. He's just big and athletisism and effort are secondary to that

3605~~~
Had a poor game last night but I don't necessarily blame him for that. The team was unbalanced. Probably would have been better off chucking him up front to hoof the ball at the way we were playing.

3606~~~
That's my point though. Carroll wouldn't win everything in the air if he was ever played in midfield. It requires a completely different way of challenging for the ball and using the body.
And he wouldn't look half as strong playing in midfield either.
It's a type of strength suited to that target man role.

I agree that Fellaini's about half of the aerial threat (and geunine strength) of Carroll though.

3607~~~
What is this footballing ability that his friend has that is better than Vidic?

3608~~~
His 'footballing ability' is miles better than Andy Carroll

3609~~~
Opinions are not always factual....

3610~~~
True. But (a) that's not saying much, and (b) that wasn't the debate/point. It was about people wondering why he looks so easy to bully, shoulder barge and knock off the ball, when he looked relatively strong at Everton.

I'm likening his strength in that role to Carroll's. It takes a different kind of strength as a target man or recipient of crosses than it does as midfielder.

Let's put it this way: Carroll and Fellaini (without saying they are equal as players) are more likely to get bullied and knocked off the ball in midfield than Sterling. Because their type of strength is useless in midfield. At least, it's useless when your brain and technique aren't all that.

3611~~~
Define what you mean by talent and how you quantify they were born with more than Fellaini. You said they are a better footballer than Fellaini and even when you use the term footballing ability then you are talking about the actual realisation of potential.

How is it possible you can say "My friend is better than Vidic because if he had been coached by good coaches then he would be one of the best centre backs of his generation.", how can you possibly say this, for all we know for all we know your friend could be given the best coaches and still not actualise that potential.

Explain what you mean by a gifted player and also why somebody who has an insane work ethic is not gifted in that department because surely that also is a vital component in becoming an elite football player.

So now you are talking only of technical ability? But you do realise a football player is more than just technical ability? Again you said your friend is 'probably better than Fellaini' but you did not once mention technical ability.

The concept of luck can be applied to every player, Messi was lucky Barcelona helped him overcome his problems when he was young or somebody who had good parents and got them all the best coaching from a young age.

Surely physical limitation affects ability, a player who is Fellaini's size can never dribble as good as a player that is short and light, footballing ability is making the most of what you do have, that is the skill, your friend was unable to make the most of the tools he had at his disposal.

<b>Lets also understand the post you made, you never once said technical ability, this is your exact post and it was not in reply to any other post:</b>

3612~~~
He's a % type player. Ugly stuff.

3613~~~
That goes against what we've seen in previous games this season where he's used his strength to hold off and turn players in midfield to very good effect.

3614~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3615~~~
i never said opinion are 'facts'. opinions are based on observations of things we consider factual. ofcourse some interpretations can be completely nonsensical. but some things are open to interpreation, and the opinion cannot be wrong. eg. is fellaini united quality or not? this question is open and any opinion cannot be a wrong opinion.  i havent studied philosophy, but i guess its just logical?

3616~~~
Deserved his start ahead of Herrera because of his recent performances, but he also deserved to be subbed with McNair before the first half was out. Was abysmal. 

I can only imagine the reason he stayed on is because LvG envisaged that we might need a goal threat late on.

3617~~~
Fair enough. Sometimes he's done a good job at that specifically.

But again, it's usually a similar type of scenario - He receives the ball in a stationery position. Maybe on the edge of our box.
At that point he has two things to think about: One holding off the guy as he stands still, and two - controlling the ball. Almost a target man role. It doesn't occur <i>that </i>often for a midfielder.

It's the rest of the game where you have more to think about, and have to actually move and be agile. His type of strength isn't all that useful.
He just seems to spend so much time flailing about once the ball is zipped about.

I don't have anything against him. But his strengths are not suited to midfield at all, in my opinion. The less thinking he needs to do - the better. 
Get him up against the defenders' bodies and backing into them, and he's an asset. Or shielding the ball in the corners. 
And there's a place for that in the squad.

3618~~~
I still disagree. He's got the skills required in his locker and he's shown them in the last few weeks. It's just when his head drops and he loses his confidence like he did last night he seems to forget that he can actually play football - this to me is actually the thing he desperately needs to sort out if he wants a successful career at United because we aren't a club that can rely on 'confidence players'. 

Not a fan of compilations to prove points but it will save me time. 2.17 and 2.29 both good examples if you can't be arsed watching it all:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXQuQxHy7qI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3619~~~
The bread and butter stuff: touch, control, passing. Not top four standard. He's also one-paced and lumbering. That doesn't add up to someone who should be in Manchester United's midfield, imo.

(He has major assets as well: size, head, chest and elbows(<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>) It's just not enough to make him anything other than a squad player who can be very useful in a a particular role in certain games.)

3620~~~
One of those passes led to a RVP shot that came off the side net. Afrotrash couldn't find a player unless he was passing back. Wanyama made him his bitch all game

3621~~~
Afrotrash? Childish nonsense.

3622~~~
<b>Fellaini</b>
Average rating: 6.2
Your rating: 3.7

Caf rates him higher than I do.

3623~~~
Oh holy shit, get in, a pass that lead to a shot that came off the side net. Fantastic.

Actually, that match it was Ander who couldn't find a man himself with astonishing 70% passing accuracy.

3624~~~
Jedinak takes penalties and has played more minutes. So yes he has more goals but that is a bit circumstantial. His passing is no better, I'd say it is worse. Physical battles would probably be similar. I'm Australian, I've watched Jedinak for his whole career. He is not better than Fellaini.

Also, it's bemusing when people come in here and say "For such a big guy he loses a lot of aerial duels.' The fact is that he doesn't. He has one game every two or three months where he probably loses more than he wins and people use that to criticise him. If Messi fails to execute his usual amount of successful dribbles in a match people don't say, "for supposedly being a good dribbler, he isn't very good at it." Fellaini is good in the air. No, he isn't going to win <i>every </i>single header.

3625~~~
A few 7/10 performances in his career with the rest being rubbish and all of a sudden he's
He created a chance. What did Fellaini do but lose challenge after challenge, fail to make a single penetrating pass or cross, get smoked by Wanyama and finally got punished for making the most stupid of passes to the opposition unchallenged? He was the worst player on the pitch last night. Im certain he has no big future here and I thank God. United need better.

3626~~~
Losing three aerial duels in a row vs Arteta against Arsenal kind of defeated the point of having our entire gameplan in the first half built on lumping it long towards him.

Said it before: I just don't see the sort of attributes he brings, that are more useful than those having him in the team automatically deprives us of.

3627~~~
He's made 51 passes ( of accuracy of 84% ), made more forward passes than Ander, made more tackles than Ander ( Ander did 0 ), he made more clearances than Ander, won more aerial duels so yea, he's done pretty much that match despite making a horrific mistake for the first goal.

And funnily enough, he really wasn't in Wanyama's pocket all match, as much as you'd love to imply it.

Oh, and you were making sure that he will be gone under LVG last season as well, you were sure that he's not a LVG player, so please, be so kind and drop your foreseeing attempts because they have a rather shit outcome.

3628~~~
I accept he is a squad player, Herrera might be competing for that role or even for number 10 in which case Vidal or Strootman will surely be signed, I can even see Valencia given a chance in midfield when Rafael returns but I'm stating he has been important to us this season and it's good we didn't sell him as so many wanted and he has shown he is better than most gave him credit for.

Footballing ability does not just include what you mentioned, you are being selective, it is his ability to use the tools he has and make himself as effective as he can, he isn't going to have the dribbling of somebody smaller, just like the small guy uses his low centre of gravity to his advantage Fellaini does his size.

One cannot play football without a body so that body is going to influence what type of player they become.

It's like being critical of Rooney for his lack of agility compared to league 2 wingers but then his body type lends to physical strength which can be an advantage for him if applied correctly.

You must judge a footballer as they are and Fellaini is not league 2 standard.

3629~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Loublaze and his warped view of reality. He watches a game but does not see what actually happens, he sees what he wants to see.

3630~~~
Worst thing is though that those 'debates' simply turn into Fellaini vs Herrera for some idiotic reason, which I'd find incredibly not needed if I wasn't called to the blackboard.

3631~~~
Statistics for this? I can only see Arteta beating him in one duel, while he won the other two.

3632~~~
I agree with what you say, Fellaini's two biggest weakness that makes him an awful playmaker are his passing and lack of dynamism to offer a short passing outlet and keep the ball ticking, especially when the opposition is trying their best to limit short passing options for the defenders. That is where Herrera really shines, and  a 4 at the back with Carrick and Herrera should have theoretically countered Soton's tactics

3633~~~
Yeah I actually like Herrera better but it's hard not to have to play some form of devil's advocate when faced with such stupidity.

3634~~~
I dont have to imply it. The commentators mentioned it all night. I have the game saved in my DVR and I can point out everytime he lost a challenge if I have to. He was atrocious and turning a blind eye to it won't do you any good. You're trying to find positives in his diabolical showing where there is only glaring pieces of inadequacy. Fellaini was almost shipped off to Napoli and getting injured saved him from that outcome, so I wasn't way off.

3635~~~
Are you telling me that those statistics suggest to you that Fellaini actually had a good game against Southampton?

3636~~~
Do you have eyes? You can't seem to watch a game or read writing.

3637~~~
Oh, right, commentators said it so it's alright.

And yea, you were so hard way off with your predictions that in the meantime he managed to stay at United, play some very good matches against top opposition in the league and become one of our better performers this season. Funnily enough, he'll probably start against dippers and more matches to come, he'll have more good matches and you'll be gone untill he has a shit match again.

Your reading comprehension skills are really, really shit.

3638~~~
No worse than your inability to tell when a player is not starting 11 United quality. Fellaini is an option b % player. Once we have a full team and a settled system you won't see him as a fixture in the starting 11. I still stand by that.

3639~~~
Mine is a 4.3. And I thought I was the lowest.

3640~~~
Yea, on the other hand you're a walking book full of wise judgements as of who is and who is not worthy of being in the starting XI. What does 'once we have a full team' mean? You mean, when Herrera, Carrick and ADM will be all fit at the same time? I think that has happened before but it was Fellaini who got in ahead of Ander so something's not working with your, yet another, bold prediction.

Really, instead of tossing shit at him and making up arguments that are being mythbusted one by one just try to enjoy that we're winning games despite not being in top form, with plenty of injuries and even players that have been underperforming last season seem to have turned the tides.

3641~~~
Oh please, don't act like a spoilt fan!

We're not really in a position to be parading about who is and is not starting XI quality. I'd appreciate his contributions in the last few games. As difficult as it might be for you to admit, he has made an impact, a positive one, since his return from injury. I don't care if a year from now we bench him or not, I'm more than happy to see him contribute to helping us winning games.

I trust LvG to make that decision, and he's already shipped out or benched those he thinks aren't good enough or not in form. Also, he's doesn't give a shit about the price tag and reputation a player comes with. He gave Fellaini a chance, he took it and has done well. Hence, kept his spot in the starting XI. That is how a team should be selected, based on form rather than reputation.

3642~~~
Arteta won two aerials in total that game - no idea if they were against Fellaini. Fellaini won 5 aerials together with 12 defensive interventions (tackles, interceptions, clearances, blocked shots). He also had a team high 39 passes at 84.6% accuracy (only Rooney and Di Maria had higher accuracy) and was 4 of 4 for long balls (another team high). I'm not entirely sure what his critics expect of him.

3643~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You cannot see clearly when blinded by hate, my friend.

Go back and read the post you wrote, the reply and then this post, this post makes no sense whatsoever.

3644~~~
Watch him dominate Gerrard on Sunday.

3645~~~
I would love you to be right but I just cant see it.

3646~~~
Now this poster is claiming to have inside information, either that or he believes everything written in the papers to be true and if so then may god help him.

Fellaini spoke of leaving because he felt he was made a scapegoat last season but in the end decided to stay, Louis van Gaal made clear no player would be shipped off, no player would be given the axe, the player would leave only of his own will.

3647~~~
It's a bit rich of you of to come into the Mcnair thread and slate the people for 'abusing' Blackett and do the same with Fellaini <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hypocrite.

3648~~~
Blind and Carrick are better at DM, Herrera and Di Maria are better in CM and we'll sign Strootman or someone else in January/The Summer and Fellaini will move on for a decent price. He'd do well enough at lots of teams, but he's not good enough for us.

For all his positive qualities, he doesn't recognize danger defensively and he's certainly below average as a passer at CM for a CL side. You basically can't survive at this level with both those faults.

He's useful at times and good enough to be an okay depth CM for us, but I hate seeing him play over Herrera, who moves, passes and defends better. 

In some ways he's unlucky not to have been here in the immediate post-Scholes days, but we have 2 good CM's in Herrera and Di Maria now, and should really be looking to add another to compete/rotate/play together.

If he can keep being a solid contributor and we get a CL spot and sell him for 15 million or, this whole thing will be just a mistake and not a feck-tastrophe.

3649~~~
How can you compare them? Fellaini is a 'seasoned' PL player. I was comparing how people are assessing two young inexperienced players.

3650~~~
Every rumor we had concerning player outs came to fruition. Nani, Hernandez, Van Gaal's talks with Welbeck about his exit, etc. Benitez actually mentioned Fellaini, stating that his future was in United's hands and that was right after strong rumors about his 'imminent' move to them. Why did he have to even answer to paper talk? 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12040/9407315/transfer-news-napoli-boss-rafa-benitez-says-marouane-fellainis-future-in-manchester-uniteds-hands" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...-fellainis-future-in-manchester-uniteds-hands</a>

3651~~~
Fellaini is a Manchester United player. Do you give a shit about say Suso in Liverpool because he's one of the 'young and inexperienced player'?  I agree with your stance on Blackett, he's a young player but more importantly, he's one of our players and he shouldn't be harshly criticized, and so is Fellaini. Your criticism of Fellaini is baffling because he's been playing swimmingly well for us ever since he's been back from injury. Everybody has a game when they are not playing well including RvP, Rooney, Mcnair and Blackett. While you seem to 'pleasantly surprised' at the support that Mcnair got even though he was subbed out under 40 minutes, you are happy to slate Fellaini. Sorry, that's a shit argument.

3652~~~
The fact that there are people whose average rating for Fellaini this season is around 4 or less, says it all. There are some folk who are simply blinded by hate, or cannot bare the thought of being proven wrong and a player coming good.

Whilst plenty of the Caf may still advocate Fellaini being sold, fortunately the man in charge seems to have come in with an unbiased view and is taking each player on merit. Fellaini has been given chances and for the most part he has taken them and been one of our best players over the last couple of months - during which we have won 7, drawn 2 and lost 1.

3653~~~
What did I say in the previous post, can you recall? Probably not because you don't read them properly, I said Fellaini himself admitted he was thinking about leaving because he felt he was made a scapegoat by fans for last seasons failure but in the end he opted to stay.

Also I have to laugh at the link you posted, please enjoy this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Benitez answered a question when asked, he said I must work with the players I have and Fellaini is not our player so his future is Man Utd's concern.

Where have we heard this? Louis van Gaal recently when asked about January transfers when he also said he must work with the players he has and to talk of other players is disrespectful, he was asked a question and he answered. Louis always says "I did not say that but you asked and so I answered", Benitez was asked a question and replied with a logical answer in that Fellaini is not his player, only in your world would this mean "Fellaini will be our player soon".

Now instead of you spreading lies in this thread I would like to get Louis van Gaal's opinion on the situation.

The middle of august, Louis van Gaal says from 1:55 mark that he needs to assess Fellaini and this will take two weeks.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fCWVFvwUyF0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The article you post is from the start of August yet Louis van Gaal said he needs two weeks to see Fellaini before he can make a decision, so either you are wrong yet again or Louis van Gaal is telling us all lies and never wanted to observe Fellaini train, which is it?

And what was the point of this post? You could have just read my previous post properly..

3654~~~
Is there anyone who's giving him that sort of rating, though? Genuine question, since I imagine most would recognise he's at least doing fairly decent now, despite his poor performance on Monday.

Again, even saying he's been one of our best players recently isn't <i>that </i>much of a compliment. While our results have improved, our performances have been especially average lately. How many players can you say have been very good recently?

3655~~~
Time to drop him. Even when he was playing well there were question marks over his inclusion because he inhibits our style of play. After such a bad performance, it's surely time to see what we can do without him.

3656~~~
Do you think he will be here in 3 or 4 years?
Part of me thinks he's just being used as a short term option to help cover up some of our weakneses (I.e. crap defenders) that hopefully will be adressd in the summer.

3657~~~
On that logic we might as well drop the whole team as in the 3-5-2 most of our players looked dreadful. The difference is that Fellaini's been one of our best players this season.

I can't understand the style of play thing. If you're expecting him to be one of our primary creative outlets then you're always going to be disappointed as that's not his job. His role is to play box-to-box and he's comfortably the best we have in that position in the squad at the moment.

Anyway, we saw what we could do without him when he had Herrera playing the box-to-box role in the diamond earlier in the season. We consistently got cut through by dross teams because Herrera and Di Maria are both too offensively minded and Blind was left exposed.

3658~~~
He has done better this season than I thought he would ever do in a United shirt.  I still don't think he is what we need going forward.  Can't be playing a guy like this and be challenging for prem or CL title.

3659~~~
I wouldn't throw him out of this team yet. He will be very useful but we need to go back to the diamond.

3660~~~
He has clearly proved his worth and for the first time has a place in the squad. But what that will never be is as a deep lying central midfielder, he just isn't good enough on the ball for it. Play him further up the field and you will see how effective he is. I can't believe first Moyes played him deeper then LVG decides to do it as well (aware that it is probably due to Carrick having to play in defene)

3661~~~
I'll explain: most of our best players will do best in a system where we protect the ball, and aim to have more possession than the opposition, but always favour the most purposeful pass, the one which gets us closest (in terms of the move, not necessarily the position on the pitch) towards scoring a goal. That's always been a big part of Van Gaal's so-called philosophy too - purposeful possession football.

Fellaini is not a good passer of the ball and not particularly comfortable in possession either. He is very good at certain things - defending and attacking aerial set-pieces, and holding up long balls forward. He's decent at adding bite to midfield although not much of an actual tackler and without the defensive nous to be a proper defensive midfielder. All of this adds up to a player who is useful when he's playing well, as he has done for the most part over the last five or six games. But even when he's playing well it inhibits that style of play because he's not comfortable enough receiving the ball under pressure and he too often misplaces passes or is forced to choose an overly negative pass. As a result the effectiveness of lots of our other players - Mata, Herrera, Di Maria, Rooney, Carrick - is limited, because the style that we are trying to play and the style that suits them best can't easily carry a player like Fellaini who isn't very good at it.

As we've seen, sometimes that's a sacrifice worth making in order to add his different qualities. But when he's not even playing well to his own strengths, as against Southampton when he was comfortably our worst player bar McNair, it becomes a bit of a no-brainer, in my opinion, to leave him out.

And he's not our best box-to-box midfielder. For one thing, one of the standard qualities of a good box-to-box player is that they are athletic, hard-working and dynamic in their movement. It's in the name - they move energetically from box to box. Fellaini is slow in terms of both pace and acceleration and not particularly mobile. Herrera is a much better b2b midfielder.

3662~~~
Both of them will last about 20min before they elbow each other out of the game. But then it's at OT, so maybe only Gerrard gets the red.

3663~~~
Wanyama did a good job at nullifying his targetman job, almost everytime de gea tried to pass him wanyama headed it away. Everyone but Carrick and RvP was sloppy in passing i don't know why, but he wasn't the worst of the worst, shouldn't bench him because of that, he will help alot against Liverpool.

3664~~~
There were a couple in this thread since the Southampton game bragging about how their average ratings for him this season were like 3.5 - obviously the caf average is 6.2 (mine, for what its worth, is 6.7). Personally I think 6.2 is a little bit less than what is deserved, although it will have taken a hit from the Southampton game of course.

Honestly I cant think of a single player who I could definitively say will be here in 4 years time.
Fellaini? I dont know. It all depends on LVG. I have a sneaking suspicion that we will keep him because he adds something very different to most midfielders, and that can always be valuable to have in a squad.


Now that the dust has settled a bit I am going to re-post my theory that <i>part</i> of the reason he appeared so poor was that he was (in my opinion) our one midfielder in the first half who was showing for the ball and giving the defenders an option.
As a result, when Fellaini did get the ball he didnt have many options himself for who to pass to. This doesnt excuse what was obviously a poor performance, but just an idea - the stats do back it up as Fellaini played substantially more passes than the other midfielders (and a higher completion rate, which was surprising given the first half).

3665~~~
I think you're overboard with your criticism. He's perfectly comfortable on the ball and he's a decent, if limited, passer, his stats bear that out. He covers a deceptive amount of distance and does a lot of defensive work, keeps the ball well and has shown the willingness and ability to run forwards with the ball when the opportunity has presented itself. Regardless of how badly he played against Southampton (which is also an exaggeration), one bad game in a shite formation doesn't mean he deserves dropping.

Obviously if you stick someone like Herrera into Fellaini's position the ball will zip around more, but you lose a lot of the attributes required from a box-to-box midfielder. With Herrera playing in that role we were on a knife-edge defensively against some of the weakest teams in the league because he was too offensively orientated to provide adequate support for Blind. It's no coincidence that when LVG put Fellaini in that role we became far more solid even against far better opposition

When we first signed Herrera I thought he was a perfect all-rounder but in reality its clear that he's far more suited to playing further up the pitch. It was unsurprising that his best game for us was against Hull when he had far less of a defensive brief. Personally I'd play them both in front of Carrick, I think that's comfortably our most balanced midfield.

3666~~~
Can you elaborate on this? What is this bite if he isn't that good at tackling?

3667~~~
Exactly this. I'll admit I was completely wrong in writing off Fellaini and Young (who was my MOTM vs. Southampton) before the season. He (Fellaini) has done well in the last 5 games except that absolute clusterfeck against Southampton where his touch was awful and play was just going right through him. In my opinion, he's not as good as Herrera but definitely good enough to be part of the squad. I'd like Herrera and Mata to be given more time together because the play is absolutely lovely when they're both starting.

3668~~~
He was wank against Southampton but I think some of the criticism labeled at him has been harsh, especially in regards to Wanyama bullying him. Sure he's meant to be a physical presence and I do expect more from him but Wanyama is a bloody beast. Physically, it's of no surprise Wanyama go the better of him, not sure many other players in the PL would.

3669~~~
Good post. Sums him up pretty accurately. 

Unfortunately, you'll have to brace yourself up for the 'Clueless' and 'Not this shit again' posts.

3670~~~
I guess he probably meant providing some strength when it comes to jostling and duelling for the ball which in itself is tackling of sorts but lacking a bit in the department when it comes to measured tackles to dispossess runners.

3671~~~
<span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: 'verdana'"><span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20)">
Agreed. He's not defensively great and is absolutely woeful when he's in the defensive midfield role. Certain negative aspects of his game which always irks me are his blissful unawareness, tendency to ball watch and poor defensive positioning. He does seem to switch off in the defensive third and can't pick up runners at times. 

There was an instance in the Southampton game when he was just jogging back ball watching in a deep position, when Pelle was making a run into the box in his vicinity and was ultimately picked out by Tadic, resulting in a good chance for them. This is not an isolated example either.

He's decent in the attacking box to box role where he can utilize his combative and physical game play. However, he's not refined enough offensively or that great of a defensive collosus for us to stick with him in the long term, esp in a a role where you need all round qualities and not just sheer physicality or a decent, albeit inconsistent short passing game. I also think his impact on us being more defensively solid and balanced recently has been overstated when its actually Carrick's performances (with the lack of Di Maria in the CM role in recent matches to a certain extent) which deserves the plaudits. 

Make no mistake about it, I admire Fellaini for his resilience and he deserves praise for his recent good form. He can clearly do a job in the first team as of now and is rightly in the first team but moving on, we should get a better player in there, someone who can both offer steel and defensive nous whilst being more refined as a player. Don't think we need to ditch him and make a huge loss on him at the end of this season though; he can be used as a rotation option next season esp since we'd most likely be in CL as well.</span></span></span>

3672~~~
Would be incredibly harsh. He's excelled in this box to role in the last few games and deserves another go.

3673~~~
The entire team aside from De Gea, RVP and Young played like wank on Monday. It'd be incredibly unfair to drop Fellaini based on that game and Herrera(The Caf' new Kagawa) was just as bad.

3674~~~
<a class="username" data-user="68962, @Brightonian" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/68962/">@Brightonian</a> and <a class="username" data-user="90058, @Joga Bonito" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90058/">@Joga Bonito</a> have both summed up Fellaini well. However, I do disagree with Joga about our defensive improvement with Fellaini in the team as Fellaini's aggression is very useful in causing issues for the opposition and winning the ball. He provided us what we have been lacking in the team (physical prowess and aggression), and this has played a big part in some of our recent performances.

However, he's not someone who can be a mainstay in our first team. He's a good squad option to have who can perform particular jobs and provide extra options on the attack, but he's never a player who can be a mainstay in our first team. His offensive and defensive abilities are not good enough for him to be a first-11 player. Defensively, he's very good if we are organised, which gives him the platform to play aggressively and win the ball. However, his reading of the game, awareness, and marking ability are not good enough for us. Offensively, he adds height and strength, and he's a nuisance to the opposition. However, he can't play players into dangerous areas, and his technique is average.

His qualities make him suitable to be a squad option who can be used to make things difficult for the opposition. However, we should go for someone better if we need a physically strong and aggressive midfielder for the first 11.

3675~~~
Fair enough. I might have been a bit too under appreciative of his impact on the team. Agree with the rest of your post as well.

3676~~~
Fellaini added something in midfield that the others struggled with, a bit of physicality. I'm in no doubt Blind and Herrera struggled at times with this, and Herrera although game, at times could have been sent off with multi fouls being committed. I recon someone like Stootman offers us a bit of both. This would make both of them redundant and would give us some flexability in formations, in the same way Yaya does for city.

3677~~~
I always sulk when Carrick has to play in defence but right now it can't be helped. Fellani is a very unbalanced player but his physical attributes are needed in a team who continually get pushed of the ball. I think Blind and Herrera are still adapting and will eventually learn to cope with it but right now they are struggling. 

The only thing I would like Fellani to do more of is to get forward and support that number 10 position. You saw Mata almost anonymous in the Southampton game and he is a player who needs others around him to bounce of. Fellani is very good at holding the ball and that provides a foothold in opposition territory, its up to players like Mata, Rooney, RVP to utilise the space he creates.

3678~~~
I think the problem with Fellaini in that game was he was just generally rubbish. He was actually get the ball off Mata quite a lot but he kept losing it so Mata never got it back.

3679~~~

Has anyone seen this? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3680~~~
It will be interesting to see if he holds his spot. Liverpool are a decent pressing side when they click so that would work against him, but they are so vulnerable from set-pieces that he would be a huge asset.

3681~~~
We should use FIFA14 (Moyes) tactics. Ping in cross after cross with Fellaini playing as Second Striker with "Make runs into box" set to 100. RVP will mob up what doesn't go in directly. 

Standard 16-0 with a Rodgers disconnection in the 86th minute.

3682~~~
Chelsea, Arsenal and City ( especially when we went down to 10 men) are decent pressing teams and Fellaini seemed to do fine. He just had a bad game against Southampton, as did most of our players. If he starts tomorrow, which I think he should, hopefully he'll have a good game.

3683~~~
Would be so funny to see him score tonight. Hopefully after elbowing Skrtel to win the header.

3684~~~
Yeah I'd start him too. If Rafael is back then LvG has the option of playing Valencia in midfield though, and he was decent against Everton.

3685~~~
Valencia was very decent against Everton, however, I don't think one decent performance will convince Van Gaal to play him over Fellaini, who's had several.

3686~~~
I fear for his elbows and general clumsiness today. Atkinson is going to want to make a point with the cards today to control the game.

3687~~~
I'm actually predicting him to score 1

3688~~~
How is this guy playing again after THAT first half? Shocking decision. And awful start from him.

3689~~~
Is he drunk? ffs

3690~~~
Old Fellaini is back !

3691~~~
Let's at least wait until half time.

3692~~~
Sigh

3693~~~
Great idea to play him at CDM...again.

3694~~~
We wouldn't have a team if we were only playing players that weren't shit in the first half against Southampton.

3695~~~
Had a rough start but I'd say it he deserved to start. Can't say the same about Mata on the other hand.

3696~~~
He's not a CDM. It's a dig at 352.

3697~~~
It's clear he doesn't work in this system with Mata and a Rooney as the other midfielders. I have always said from day one that Fellaini is a valuable player but we need someone like Herrera or Carrick next to him (or both, preferably).

He is a box to box player or an attacking midfielder - in the current system he is he most defensive of the three.

Mata has been anonymous again, if it were me I would have started Herrera instead of Mata for this game.

3698~~~
Up to the 25th minute there's no 2 ways about it, the boy is having a stinker. Positionally woeful so far as a DM. Diving in everywhere. Sloppy passes left right and centre.

Today the boy needs a McNair call on him. Sub him before half time before we're down to 10.

3699~~~
Unbelievably poor.

3700~~~
Needs to be taken off. Gonna get sent off otherwise.

3701~~~
It's surreal to see a United midfielder having such a hard time doing some of the most basic stuff in football. He can't control or pass a ball and we play him as a playmaker. Unbelievable.

3702~~~
Made a couple of decent defensive contributions in the last few minutes. Fairly hopeless in this current setup though for everything else.

3703~~~
He's been having s horrible half overall, though he has made a few good tackles and interceptions.

I really think it's plain to see he doesn't work in this role, in this system. Mata has been invisible (and then scores as I am writing this...) and offers nothing defensively, and doesn't show for the ball properly.

It seems to be a running theme that when Fellaini has it, there are no options when we need to have the likes of Mata and Rooney (in the current lineup) showing for it. When there are short passes on, Fellaini contributes perfectly well.

We need to bring Fellaini or Mata off, or both. Fellaini can't play without a proper midfield or two alongside him.

3704~~~
Difference between him and Carrick as midfielders is so stark

3705~~~
Meh, he's been alright since that yellow card, sadly as somebody's pointed out, we're probably going to end this match with 10. We've got 2 CBs booked now, him and Rooney, so all of those players will be reserved with their tackling and somebody will have to do it at last, it will be down to the CDM.

Either drop this shite 352 or get him off for Paddy, get Carrick to CDM would be the solution. Although we've seen that LVG's not content with Paddy in the 3 CBs setup with no playmaker there so we'll probably end this match with a man or two down.

3706~~~
I'll be amazed if we end this game with 11 men on the pitch.

3707~~~
He needs to stay more in front of the back four and make himself available for passes like Carrick does so well when he plays there.

3708~~~
Can't find a teammate so often. Last game and a half he has been really poor. I agree screening the back 3 maybe his job but that does not mean he cannot have a good touch. His passing and touches have been way off the mark. Rooney seems to be the only proper midfielder we have, which says a lot about Fellaini today.

3709~~~
He's so careless. If we want to keep possession we need someone else on or Felliani shifted out wide, he doesn't offer the defense enough protection or as an outlet for a pass.

3710~~~
Plus as most thought, his role is to be a target man for DDG to launch balls into. Cannot believe Herrera has been benched for this.

3711~~~
He shows again how limited he is. Unbelievable

3712~~~
Useless.

3713~~~
Maybe I'm in minority here but I think he has been decent.

3714~~~
He has the probably the worst passing ability I have ever seen in any central midfielder. It's unbelievable how bad it can be when he is asked to play a forward ball. Also his touch has been awful today, miscontrolling under no pressure.

3715~~~
Want Herrera playing as a fecking CDM?

Jesus Christ.

3716~~~
Been our best player FFS, just had a shit first 5 mins.

3717~~~
He can't pass the ball to save his life, but that's hardly new information. Looks a liability today though with a yellow card after 5 minutes.

3718~~~
3-5-2 doesn't suit him. Midfielders will spend time isolated and therefore need to be proficient on the ball to maintain control. While defensively he's been decent, he's been poor on the ball. We're putting at stake cohesion in the possession for someone to do a job but in this case Liverpool are there to be got at. Fellaini's best games this season and that run of good form he had was when he was in a three with four behind so he could impose himself all around the pitch. Here his lack of nous for a disciplined role is glaring.

3719~~~
No, he hasn't. He's conceded possession countless times with wayward passes, or slow passes putting people under pressure, or passes to people who are tightly marked, or his awful control. He has been so poor.

People saying he's been our best player haven't paid attention. Look closer. 

It's unacceptable for a United midfielder to be so poor at such simple things.

3720~~~
wtf are you talking about. He is one of our best players and more or less the midfield on his own. Mata, besides scoring, is in hiding and Rooney doesnt really Play as midfielder. He is the defensive and central midfield all by himself and is doing a decent job.

3721~~~
Erm no! I defend Fellaini more than most, but no.

3722~~~
Is Fellaini doing a good job of it, passing the ball to opponents or out of touch so many times?

3723~~~
He's made a couple of good tackles but is so poor in possession when it gets tight that he gives it away easily.

3724~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What? Better than De Gaa and Valencia?

3725~~~
He's been alright after a really poor start. Looked like he'd lost his head again but after we scored he's got it back together (to an extent).

Something looks off though... he was playing with a bit of swagger before the Southampton game - now he seems scared to do anything but the basics.

3726~~~
Playing in him a midfield one, with no support is utter madness.

I actually feel a bit sorry for him. This system just brings out all his weaknesses. He's bound to get sent off at some point.

3727~~~
What on earth is with this guy? Puts together a string of great performances and really look like hes turned a corner. Then he goes ahead and deliver a couple of stinkers like this.

3728~~~
Where is the white text? 

He was probably our worst player in the first half.

3729~~~
Yet he has lost the ball more than both Rooney and Mata. Great performance that!

3730~~~
Needs to calm down because you cannot be booked against Liverpool after 5 minutes. Especially with this 'ref'. Would like to see a change second half to hopefully give us better quality. He's done alright but we've got two goals, we just need to calm down and pick them off now. Too many players on a booking

3731~~~
Very mixed bag. Some rotton moments.

If you could take them away he has been fine

3732~~~
I wonder if anyone has ever thought of making a pair of boots out of his chest hair. I figure that might improve his first touch, so his second isn't a tackle 90% of the time.

He's done well defensively though. Some good tackles, but the way Atkinson is throwing his cards around to day it's a sending off just waiting to happen.

3733~~~
Very sloppy in possession. Need to step up and shield the back four in the second half

3734~~~
Usual mixed bag for Fellani. Funny thing is that he does things in games that provide bases for his detractors and supporters.  He sometimes looks awful with the ball, but will make a nice play in the next minute. Guess LvG thinks his good plays outweigh the bad.

3735~~~
No, he's shit at CDM, it has been stated here countless times but if you're thinking that Herrera would be any different at CDM, you're simply wrong.

3736~~~
mata never has the ball so he cant lose it. Fallaini is the only one who is actually trying to get the ball in the central/defensive midfield, while being under pressure.

3737~~~
This - the system brings out his weaknesses and hides his strength. I honestly blame LVG in the last couple of games for (not just Fellaini) deviating from a successful system. We can even play 3-5-2 effectively if we just choose to play our midfielders.

3738~~~
When I'm watching him play like this, it looks to me like he's got something else on his mind and is lacking the focus required. Like he's wondering if he forgot to lock the door when he left the house in the morning. That's the only way I can describe it.

3739~~~
This sort of typifies the praise that Fellaini has been getting recently. He's been built into some sort of monster player, the player "that we've needed all this time". In reality, he's a limited player who can do a specific job, in a specific position, in specific games. To be fair, he was very good in 2-3 games and competent to good in a handful of others, but remove him from those specific situations and he's a massive liability for us, which is how he was for the whole of last season basically.

3740~~~
Decent at times, poor at others. Just clearly can not play the Carrick/Blind role and they are really missed.

3741~~~
He has been sloppy on his passing today but overall he hasn't been to bad.

3742~~~
Funny. Don't like him sitting so deep-would like Carrick in that role.  For me Fellani higher up is better as it's not a potential catastrophe when he makes his obligatory screw ups with the ball.

3743~~~
My prediction: He's not lasting the 90. He'll either get subbed or sent off. I really hope it's the former.

3744~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You're right its about the last role you'd want him playing and he's the last player you'd want to be playing the role. He just isn't the type of player needed for that deep role.

3745~~~
Probably the worst first 10 minutes I've seen from a United player. Got better after that with several good things and several bad things - the usual Fellaini, a mixed bag - instead of a bag of... well, whatever it was in the first 10 mins

Actually his pass completion is 3rd lowest after De Gea and Wilson...

3746~~~
This, and then we've got somebody DDG can pass to with a long ball, now he can't do it because Fellaini would have to move forward leaving a huge gap in front of defence.

3747~~~
Can't keep with the movement in their midfield. I dont blame him entire either, the role he's been asked to play doesnt suit him. He will never be a top holding player, been saying it for ages. He needs a Carrick/Blind next to him to allow him to do what he's good at.

3748~~~
His touch/control has been shocking at times. Got him into trouble a couple of times already. Doing well winning the first ball though, and has made a couple of important interceptions/tackles.

3749~~~
Yep. Looks much better higher up-less exposed when he losses possession.

3750~~~
Yes, and no reason to wait. Now, please.

3751~~~
Look he's not good I know that but feck me he's trying out there, busting a fecking gut to hold midfield together by himself. His passing isn't good enough but he's put himself about and made some good tackles, De Gea's been our best player today (again) but I'm sick of people looking at the first opportunity they can to jump on Fellaini's back.

3752~~~
That's right. He has made some crucial interceptions and has won a lot of high balls for us in the middle of the park.

3753~~~
Sub him out please. A red card waiting to happen.

3754~~~
Hey, who's started that counter attack for 3-0 with his tackle... ?

3755~~~
Came here to praise. He has been good this 2nd half and did very well to start that attack

3756~~~
Shock horror: People were way too early to start laying into him.

3757~~~
Started poorly but I think he's recovered well and played decent since then.

3758~~~
Better after the break. Still not good, though. And not good enough for United. 

He's being judged so lenient on here by many people. No other player is continually getting praise for simply not being absolutely horrible. Mediocrity is the best you'll get from him.

3759~~~
He has turned it around in the second half again. I still don't think he is suited to this role in the side, but in the second half he has made loads of tackles and interceptions.

Given that for most of the game we haven't exactly had a balanced midfield, there has been a lot of responsibility on Fellaini in the middle of the pitch and he has done well since half time.

3760~~~
He is playing better in the second half because Liverpool are defeated and their pressing game has gone so he isn't panicked into mistakes. He can't handle being pressed but as the second half has gone on Liverpool have given up and he's being given a lot more time.

3761~~~
Yeah, he's been playing well, but so has most of the team. We've been in firm control of the game.

3762~~~
Brilliant in the second half.

3763~~~
He's made 10 tackles so far in this match, immense.

E: 11 now.

3764~~~
Much better in the second half. Impressed after his first half effort.

3765~~~
He has been a fantastic DM today, well done.

3766~~~
Poor passing, but brilliant tackling. Good to see him fighting back in the 2nd half, pleasure to watch.

3767~~~
First and second half were day and night, good to see him being so good after terrible start.

3768~~~
Very good second half. Would have loved him to get a goal and really rub it into their faces. Two Evertonians killing Liverpool. Moyes's Revenge.

3769~~~
Compare Liverpool's pressing in the first 25 minutes to the second half. That's why he played better. The same as agaisnt Southampton and Arsenal. When we're being relentlessly pressed he is ineffective, when we're in control he plays better.

3770~~~
Good second half in terms of disciplined tackling. But we do lose a lot passing wise with him in there.

3771~~~
Asise from a poor start with a couple dodgy tackles and a stupid yellow he's been really good. I've never seen him so effective defensively. Distribution was decent, not as smooth as Blind or Carrick, but he's shown he can be a DM not just a threat going forwards.

3772~~~
A few loose balls that put us under pressure, but got better as the game went on. Then 10 tackles, 3 interceptions, and more passes completed than any other player on the pitch. What he brings to this team is obvious.

3773~~~
Very bad first 15 minutes or so but he's made up for it, 81% passing rate, 11/13 tackles, 4 fouls, 4 blocks, 3 interceptions, 1 clearance, 3/5 aerial duels won, fouled once, 1/3 take-ons.

Still, he isn't a CDM so I don't really want to see him there. Nice to see that he's kept his head cool though because everybody expected him to get sent off, including me.

3774~~~
He really shouldn't be a starter. His role is as a squad player. He and Evans annoyed me no end today.

3775~~~
He deserved the criticism he got at half time, but was much improved in the second half. Was more focused with his passing, although that still could have been better, but he was brilliant at winning the ball back. Overall, he justified his inclusion in the team. 

And pleasingly, not only was I wrong with my prediction of a red card, but he also gave me no reason to clench my butt cheeks. In that respect he played with a more composed head in the 2nd half.

3776~~~
Did very well today.

3777~~~
Mata is not playing in midfield. And Fellaini has lost the ball so many times today, placed poor passes when not under pressure. If you cannot see that, I cannot comment more on this.

3778~~~
Made some great challenges. Found him to be quite slow and negative in possession though. Took an age to pop it off to Valencia at times.

But he's vindicating himself. We're winning and he is contributing.

3779~~~
I still really dont like him as a DM unless he has the likes of Herrera with him - everyone knows how much I have defended Fellaini this season, but he is a box to box player. He did a good job in the second half as a DM, but for me he shouldnt be in that role in the first place. He also suffers when he is effectively the sole midfielder, playing with a bunch of #10s.

3780~~~
I thought he was very good and disciplined defensively.

3781~~~
Do you know how many he made now the game is over? I was really pleased at how he won the ball back.

3782~~~
Dismal in the first half, looks like he rightly got told to buck his ideas up in the second half where he was far better.

3783~~~
A shaky enough start but he wasn't long turning things around and overall today did the job required of him. Definitely a huge improvement on the Southampton game.

3784~~~
11 successful out of 13 tries.

3785~~~
Some appalling abuse in the match thread as usual. Look at this prick:

If anyone has such hate for United players why don't they toddle off and find a new club to give their 'support'.

3786~~~
Mixed. Lost the ball a lot of times, but also when a lot of times. Better than his last performance vs Southampton, so definitely something to build upon.

3787~~~
Watched the second half only and thought he did well and his physicality was crucial but he needs to really work on his passing.

3788~~~
Loses the ball to much. His passing is batty.

3789~~~
Broke up play very well, passed it poorly.

3790~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Fair play to him. Brilliant in the 2nd half!

3791~~~
Typical overreaction as usual, just a bad first 5 mins, grew into the game.

3792~~~
Decent second half but it's quintessential Fellaini - play so bad that when you start playing okay it looks even better.

3793~~~
Credit where it's due, he was great in the 2nd half

3794~~~
Good second half. People talk about his passing but that goes for an awful lot of these players.

3795~~~
Great is an overstatement. Atm he really brings a lot to our defense though with vital interceptions. Going forward he looks a bit wank and his movement when he have the ball is non existent I feel.

3796~~~
My god he's a confidence player ain't he? Theres like two of him.

3797~~~
I thought he was really poor. Too sloppy and doesn't offer anything in the build up. He just shouldn't be starting for us except he has a specific job to do

3798~~~
Who would you play at a CDM in 352 when Carrick is one of the defenders?

3799~~~
He did what he had too, won the ball and kept it simple

3800~~~
A lot better in the 2nd half after  very shaky first. Fair play to him, picked it up really well as the game went on.

3801~~~
Played very well in the second half, particularly taking his booking into consideration. Made a lot of tackles without taking too big risks.

3802~~~
First of all I wouldn't play Mata or Rooney as midfielders next to him and if everyone's fit, he should be behind Carrick, Blind and Herrera

3803~~~
Odd how he passed so badly yet got 80 odd percent of them where he intended! Kinda like you're saying something, yet the facts point at something opposite...

3804~~~
The purple patch is over for the lad. Bench warming and an FA Cup appearance in the foreseeable future.

3805~~~
His tackling second half was much better, but he still could have been sent off after he clattered into Moreno. I was probably a bit harsh on him in the matchday thread but his passing was poor and he could quit easily have been off and left us with 10 for half an hour.

3806~~~
That's nice but it's LVG who insists on playing that stupid system, so seriously, who would you play at a CDM in current situation when you've got to play Carrick in the 3 men-defence and Blind is out?

3807~~~
great second half. break pools' attack with ease (on the eye at least)

3808~~~
Should have made himself available for our defenders more often I feel and his passing was off as well. Still a decent performance.

3809~~~
He was very good in the second half, made some excellent tackles, especially when you consider he was on a yellow and had some red mist in his mince pies after that elbow from Moreno.

3810~~~
I saw that comment too. Fellaini had a very poor first half, improved in the second half but  that sort of abuse of one of our own is awful

3811~~~
Similar to Southampton. Poor first half, much better second half. 

I just think he's a bit lazy in his passing at times, needs to cut that out.

3812~~~
We can rest him v Villa so that he has a bit of a break leading into the holiday fixtures.

3813~~~
I'd play Herrera. Fellaini is just not a good enough passer and can't control a game. His passing was horrible today, some really poor touches as well. Yes he can win back balls but with Carrick or Blind in there as well, he's not needed

3814~~~
So you'd play with basically 3 number #10s in front of that defence with 2 strikers ahead of them?

3815~~~
Who said Herrera is a 10? With Carrick or Blind in midfield, that area is certainly covered too. 

Do you think he did well in the last 2 games and should start the next games?

3816~~~
I don't think he should be a starter for us. If we're not controlling the game and being pressed he's a liability, if we have a lead and the opposition is tiring he can do a decent job cutting out attacks.

3817~~~
Was very good breaking up attacks in the second half.The problem in the first half was that everything was going through him and Fellaini is not a good enough passer to be that player.

When Herrera came on he took that responsibility and we put some very nice attacking moves together.

3818~~~
Because I'd say that he's looked the best out there due to his natural attacking abilities. Why are you ignoring fact that neither Blind nor Carrick are at the moment available for the CDM job? It's purely CDM position we're talking about here.

I think he did well this game, SOTON game was a game off and since Blind might not be back for the CDM spot next game, yes, he should start if we insist on that 352 system, purely because we have nobody better for the CDM position.

3819~~~
Not the best first half, but was very good in the 2nd half. Was a beast defensively. He'll cop it because people don't like him but look at his defensive stats. Immense.

3820~~~
Awful first 20/3p minutes, but he improved and was very good again second half.

3821~~~
As soon as all our defenders are fit then Carrick can move forward and do what Fellaini is asked to and we can get Herrera to start. Until then for the most part Fellaini has been ok filling in

3822~~~
Thought he was our worst player in the first half, but he was absolutely brilliant in teh second!

3823~~~
I honestly think people are being a bit harsh on him.  I don't feel as if anyone here genuinely thinks he has the footballing brain Blind or Carrick have. He is on the pitch to do a job and he is doing is decently. It is also important to note that he most likely won't be playing if we have a full compliment of players in midfield. He is not good enough to displace Blind, and he only came into the side due to a Herrera injury and credit to him he took his chance.

He does provide something different to our other midfielders, that should be appreciated. He is by no means world class, but he provides us options which is what every successful squad should have.

3824~~~
What are you smoking, his tackle by our box led to our 3rd goal. Do some of you even watch the game before insulting your team?

3825~~~
Is saying a player was "poor" actually "insulting your team"?

3826~~~
Won the ball a lot second half. He's no footballer though. Absolutely shocking ability with the ball, which I maintain is below Premier league standard.

3827~~~
What annoyed me about his performance is that every time he received the ball he he gave the ball to Rooney , who then showed him the pass that he should/could have made the first time.

3828~~~
Was awful in the first 10mins of the game and I was certain he'd see red. Grew into the game though and did well by the end.

3829~~~
Do some of you consider 30 seconds of being good an excuse for being 'average ' for the other 89 and a half ?

3830~~~
He has that ability of intercepting the ball that none of our midfielders have.. Thats the main reason he is there in the team before Harrera...

3831~~~
Impressed he didn't get himself sent off in the second half.

Provides no protection at all and can't pass, so I'm not sure I like him as a CDM.

I'd drop him, move Carrick forward and play a four-man defence but I don't think Van Gaal wants that against tough opposition without any of his first choice full-backs available.

3832~~~
Carrick is better at it IMO but yeah he his better than Herrera at being in the right place at nicking the ball off the opposition. Having said that I don't see Van Gaal being convinced of him to not go after someone else in his position in the next 2 transfer windows.

3833~~~
I don't think CDM is for him. When the ball goes through him he just doesn't have the guile for it. He's better playing alongside a Carrick or Blind as a supporting member who also has license to go forward into the box.

3834~~~
Unbelievable how much people will just hate on him....

He player really well today and helped Manchester United beat Liverpool yet he's not good enough for our side?

Well done Fellaini. Even initiated the third goal.

3835~~~
Yeh CDM definitely not where his future lies. Has been much better in the box to box role he's had recently.

3836~~~
Picked it up a lot after a poor start. Defensively he was very good. Attacking wise not so much (although you could see his confidence growing towards the end which was promising). His passing was not up to his usual standard.

3837~~~
I thought he was one of our best players in the second half.

3838~~~
If I was to describe him in one word I'd describe him as a nuisance. Like you said or alluded too when it comes to the technical side of things there isn't a whole lot going on in under that mop of hair but when it comes to popping up all over the place, swinging elbows, sticking legs, ploughing into lads and just being an annoying fecker for opposition players there's no better than him around and while that sort of stuff wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea in the Premier League there's place for a lad like him, even on a Man Utd team. I suspect LvG knows that too.

3839~~~
Played really bad the first 15 minutes however he recovered and only had one or two bad moments after that. Did well I thought.

3840~~~
And it's gone from "He's only useful as an attacking player in the box" to "He doesn't have much footballing ability but can surely tackle". If people think Fellaini is not a really good squad player to have then I'm not sure what they are expecting. You need these sort of players (different from the rest of your squad) to have a squad that can compete in all competitions. 

Personally I think he's solved a lot of the midfield problems all of us used to cry about (but I can understand if someone disagrees with that. Just don't understand people who say he's not PL quality)

3841~~~
Some people don't think he's good enough long-term to be a first team player for us. It's hardly a ridiculous opinion.

3842~~~
Agreed, first half I thought he was going to see red, but he eventually settled down and went back to doing what he does best. He needs to avoid possession whenever possible though as he cant pass for toffee <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3843~~~
Erm it's not without basis. He gave the ball away in horrendous positions, scythed down a player about about an hour late in the opening minutes, before almost getting himself sent off a couple of times because his first touch was shit, and his second touch was a clumsy tackle. The further he plays from our goal the better, because he's not very good at starting attacks from deep and doesn't have any real intelligence - two things with Carrick and Blind excel at.

He had some good moments, but you can't ignore that when he's bad, he's VERY bad.

3844~~~
Couldn't help shake the feeling he'd get sent off, he pulled his socks up in the second half and played really well. Those loose square balls need to stop, if he can get rid of them then we wouldn't have to rely on DDG as much.

3845~~~
Awful first few minutes.  Grew into the game and threw himself around.  Not thrilled with his ball control in front of the back 4, especially when pressed early.  Settled down after Liverpool backed off a bit.

3846~~~
Thought he was really good today, 2nd half especially - Broke everything up.

3847~~~
Berbatov did that too and he wasn't good enough for United.

3848~~~
I think it's ridiculous. How is he not good enough if he's helping us win matches? Yeah he's not one of our key players who always start like Rooney, DDG and RVP but he definitely is a notch above being just a rotation/back-up/squad player.

3849~~~
Pretty poor today again. His movement is awful( with the most highlighting moment when Balotelli hit the bar). Doesn't cover his ground well or fast. A lot of passing errors in the first 30 mins. Still he can't win a header despite being like 3 inches higher than the opposition player, poor positioning sense. A good solid 5 today.

3850~~~
His passing isn't very good, and he's often very rash to the point where he could've easily been sent off today. He contributed a lot defensively though, and did improve in the 2nd half, but he was under nowhere near as much pressure on the ball as the game wore on.

Just because a player is involved in a win doesn't automatically make them brilliant, though. Long-term it would make sense for us to improve on him, and that's hardly a ridiculous opinion.

3851~~~
Wouldn't deny his defensive contribution but his passing was so poor and might potentially cost us on other days.I still can't find a reason to like him as I really hate midfielders who are poor passers.

3852~~~
Shite in the first half, very good in the 2nd imo. No doubt his physical presence is welcome in our side, but he needs to cut out those silly errors. The first 5 he played like he was drunk

3853~~~
No I don't think he's "VERY bad" when he's bad. He is over scrutinized beyond my understanding. Of course he does some bad things but because of his last season and just his style (being big and standing out on the pitch) some will say he's terrible. 

You go to Match day thread and if Fellaini loses the ball everyone hurls abuse at him while other players lose the ball the same amount of time. I might be wrong but I strongly believe this and wish there were some statistics to show how many times Fellaini loses the ball compared to other attacking players.

3854~~~
Making up facts to say a player is shit is unwarranted. The man said Fellaini offers nothing in the build up when in fact Fellaini was directly responsible for the creating the build up to our 3rd goal.

I dont know why I have to spell this out for him or you. He made a statement of fact regarding build up play to say Fellaini is shit. His statement was and is factually incorrect when you look at his offensive contributions this season. Along with all those other "facts" about Fellainis supposed poor passing, when in fact he is about on par with anyone else in our team (80-90%).

Again, if you have to make up facts to insult your own players (supposed poor passing, supposed no contribution to buildup), that is uncalled for.

Clear enough?

3855~~~
Agree with this.  Does some necessary dirty work for us and on occasions he can string decent passes together.  But he's a bit inconstant and also lacks a bit of mobility.  I think he's shown he can give good performances but certainly there are better options out there.

3856~~~
Just look at the replay for the Balotelli bar and how he tracked back. He contributed well when the ball was near him at slow pace. We pulled back for most of the time in the second so it made him look good. As soon as there is a bit more pace in midfield he struggles.

3857~~~
I agree. He's good for standing tackles and interceptions a lot of the time though. Definitely more suited to that then tracking back, although that's a big part of his game, or at least should be.

3858~~~
Go to whoscored.com and look at his passing percentage. Thanks.

3859~~~
I'd prefer to discuss the game from actually watching it than just quoting pass percentages that can often be distorted and don't give full context. He's often sloppy on the ball, and can give it away in dangerous situations.

3860~~~
It's not just "a win". He's been part of a winning team for us for some time now so it's quite a few wins. Also, like you say he performed well and yes had some bad moments but you can't expect him to have a stormer every week. 

As for improving on him, no one really plays a "best eleven" anymore so it's not as if Fellaini has just occupied that midfield spot. You need to different players for different teams, especially in a long season. In that sense he's a really valuable player to have and I do think it's ridiculous how some want to "improve" on him so badly given we have other areas (defense) that need to be addressed first. The only way you could improve on Fellaini is to get a world class midfielder but you don't need a worldie for every position.

3861~~~
You too, please go to whoscored.com and compare his passing percentage to others in our team.

Unbelievable. It seems we are watching different games. Numbers dont lie..

3862~~~
Thought he was poor in the first half, seemed to be early signs his passing from the Southampton game would continue. The fact he got a yellow so early and is always a candidate to get booked made me think he would not last the full game. Certainly improved as the game went on, though I always cringed when he went in for a challenge.

3863~~~
Yes he was sloppy, yes he made mistakes. Yes his vision is wanting and his passing not creative. Those are all good starting points go have a real conversation. Coming out and saying he is shit or is a terrible passer is not a good or constructive comment because that simply is not true.

3864~~~
And look how Herrera (didn't) track back for the same ball Fellaini recovered and started the counter for the third.

Sometimes players don't track for various reasons really. And no, Fellaini wouldn't have 11 tackles and 3 interceptions if he was standing in place one game and didn't track back and retrieve the ball, not with the possession we've had.

3865~~~
I hate to defend his passing because it sounds as if I'm saying his a really good passer but he gets so much criticism for it that I have to. His passing isn't all that bad. It's not Herrera/Mata's level obviously but it's good enough given all of his other abilities. It's much better than Cleverly's that's for sure and he can spot some really good passes if he's playing in an attacking role.

If you don't like stats you should've watched him for Everton. His passing/attacking play was a key part of their games.

3866~~~
Touch is horrendous but I thought he was superb at breaking up the play, best game for United.

3867~~~
Poor in the first half and some misplaced passes but in the second half I thought he was brilliant at breaking up the play. I worried he might have got sent off but he was disciplined. Very good performance.

3868~~~
This is exactly how I feel.

3869~~~
How about comparing his numbers before and after we were 2-0 up and the game was done and dusted.

3870~~~
He's been in some decent form for about a month or two now. This statement makes it look as if I'm slagging off Ryan Giggs or Paul Scholes.

For all that Fellaini's fans are saying his supposed <i>haters </i>are too harsh on him, it now seems as if any slight criticism of the man, or any suggestion that we wouldn't want him to be a main player long-term, is now taken as some sort of admission that he's terrible. Far from it. I've actually given him some praise here, but I still think he can often be very unreliable and while he could be a useful squad player, I hope we upgrade on him as well. He'll have his uses, but I'd rather he be used in more of a rotation role.

3871~~~
Well he gave the ball away for Soton's goal last week, then almost did the same today in a similar position. His ball watching has cost us goals, and he's gotten away with a few things too. He got away with letting Balotelli go in the box for one of DDG's saves. Then there's the sending offs, random elbows and then today he could have been sent off after chasing his first touch with a tackle a couple of times. In my books, that's "VERY bad".

3872~~~
I've said he's a sloppy passer, which you've agreed with here sort of by saying he made mistakes. I'm not sure what we're necessarily disagreeing on in that respect?

And if his passing is not creative, why are we playing him as our central midfielder?

3873~~~
Yeah it is weird that we have to defend Fellainis passing, since I dont think he is that great of a passer either. But completion wise I remember one game where he was on 85% and Januzaj on 60 something percent and people were calling out Fellaini for being a bad passer. It is a bit weird.

3874~~~
Because there's more to being a central midfielder than just creative passing ?

Especially when teamed up in a midfield with two #10s.

3875~~~
Mixed bag from Marouane today. Thought he did some great defensive work, but his contribution on the ball could have been a lot better. Had a shaky start, but I felt he grew into the game. He just needs to concentrate a bit more. Overall, I felt he had a decent game, though.

Defensive stats were pretty awesome:

<b>Tackles - 10
Interceptions - 3
Blocked Shots - 4</b>

3876~~~
Yeah because that's exactly what the haters are saying and nothing more....

3877~~~
Passing was erratic, but he did well winning back the ball in our last 1/3rd, it's hard to give him a rating because it was so up and down, disciplined performance both in tackles but also positional wise, not getting caught high up the pitch.. i thought, overall he did well I suppose.

3878~~~
i like Fellaini, he just bosses it in midfield. He needs to do it more often, i was disappointed in the last game, the 2nd half was great. I always have the feeling the Herrera lovers slate him and in the Herrera thread the Fellaini lovers slate Herrera. They bring different qualities to the team, LvG decides and people should get behind the team. Fellainis performance was good today and he helped us win with his defensive contribution.

3879~~~
Of course there is, but it's a bit like saying "He might not be a good goalscorer, but he's not a bad striker." If you're playing in midfield and you're not a particularly brilliant or creative passer, you're leaving a lot to be desired. And before I get jumped on - I don't think he's a terrible passer. Just a sloppy one who's not particularly great at it.

3880~~~
He's been a very good Premier League player for a number of years. Ridiculous post.

3881~~~
He played a lot better once Liverpool's attackers started to tire in the 2nd half and not close down aggressively. Not the only one who is better in those conditions

3882~~~
I really don't understand what he brought to the team today apart from physical presence, and how is it possible that van Gaal sees him as a defensive midfielder? His passing was poor, his first touch was awful, his shielding of the defence was terrible, it's like our midfield never existed defensively in todays match considering the amount of chances they created. Only thing I can applaud him is that he lasted 90 minutes after he got yellow after five considering his style of play.

I really hope we move him from this position, I don't care where, he simply isn't defensive midfielder for me.

3883~~~
I mean he is not significantly sloppier than Rooney Mata RVP such that it warrants special focus or attention. The high majority of his passes are succesful, if lacking a lot in vision or creativity but thats another subject. Just count the number of posts in the last hour saying his passing is shit...its unbelievable.

I dont prefer Fellaini in CM either, but considering we dont have Di Maria or Blind available, playing Fellaini as a pseudo defensive CM is not bad considering our back four. Who else would we play there at the moment?

3884~~~
A lot hold that opinion. Some <i>really </i>do not like him, granted, but that probably comes in part from the brigade that's popped up in the past month or so who are determined to defend everything he does and cannot seem to accept that some people don't think he's an overly great footballer. Both extremes are as annoying as the other to be honest. He's decent and has his uses, but leaves a lot to be desired as a midfielder.

3885~~~
Dire first half. 2nd half much better. Amazed LVG didn't substitute him early on after the yellow card given the chance of him getting sent off.

3886~~~
Absolutely agree. I think that the role where he's got two creative players alongside him suits him the best because he can pick the easiest option and just let them do the work. That's why I as well think he looks the best in the diamond because he can have even three creative players alongside him in the midfield.

3887~~~
Yes, he is. At their best, these three shit on Fellaini from a distance when it comes to not being sloppy. RVP's been brilliant to watch the past couple of games, and Mata's a player who could arguably do with being a bit more sloppy and taking more risks sometimes.

I agree we've got to probably play him there at the moment, but again, I don't really want to see him in the role long-term.

3888~~~
Yep, fair comments.

3889~~~
If you think he's just 'decent' I can't argue with you but like he's been proving many wrong this season he'll eventually change that opinion as well. And yes they came in part from the brigade who have been defending him nonsensically because there were no such haters last season <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3890~~~
He improved dramatically in the second half.

At this moment with the squad he has, LVG obviously sees Fellaini as a key part of his midfield, and I can't disagree.

3891~~~
He really hasn't, though. He's had some very good performances, was worryingly bad against Southampton (although most were), and gave a mixed performance today. I don't see anything wrong with calling him decent to be honest.

It's a bit frustrating that <i>some </i>(only some) Fellaini supporters seem to feel that everyone else is just stuck in their opinion of him, but as soon as someone points out a valid criticism, they don't listen and simply respond by saying he's been brilliant and we're all wrong.

3892~~~
Fellaini played in front of the defence. It's pretty natural to have bigger %. Go through the highlights in the first 30 mins and see how many times he lost the ball or was off in terms of position, not to mention he is lucky to stay on the pitch for 90 mins.

It was Fellaini's zone. Herrera was in a more advanced role since he came in.

3893~~~
Horrible passing in the first half - was very lucky not to give away a goal and his touch reminded me off last season. 

Second half was a lot better - defensively anyway. Made some brilliant tackles.

3894~~~
No argument from me there, once Blind and Di Maria are back I would like to see Fellaini dropped and brought back to play against teams like Arsenal where he can play the enforcer role which he excels at.

3895~~~
But why can't we play someone who's both better from a defensive point of view as well as got a great range of passing? (Carrick)

And why can't we complement that one player with players who can move their feet in defense, doesn't get overrun easily and actually provides movement and creativity when attacking? (Herrera, Di Maria, Rooney)

What I'm asking is: Why do we need to play someone who needs to be carried by his partners?

3896~~~
Fellaini can be useful when we close out games and we're packed in the back.

3897~~~
True. I think it's where Fellaini works best at the moment when we do play him, although long-term it's partly why I want to see us upgrade.

3898~~~
As I mentioned before he had the 3rd worst passing percentage behind De Gea and Wilson in the first half, it was at 70%

In the 2nd half everyone passed the ball better and everyone's percentages except Evans went up. Wilson went up to 76% for example.

Fellaini finished with a very respectable 81.3% to show he dramatically improved his success rate in the 2nd half, from absolutely abysmal to good. In the 2nd half Liverpool's attacking players werent pressing as fast as in the first half, typical of that way of playing players run out of energy and our players could feel more comfortable with the ball at their feet in midfield

3899~~~
Yep, this shows the dangers of just relying on stats all the time.

3900~~~
Thats the whole problem isnt it. He had a bad first 30 minutes and that is translated to him always being a bad passer.

3901~~~
So you think he hasn't proved a lot of the doubters from last season wrong? Many would disagree with that. 

And I'm not some of those supporters so I'm not sure but I do see genuine criticism of him being a bit of a rarity.

3902~~~
So who do you see as an upgrade? Remember we can't afford to have world class players in every position.

3903~~~
Precisely. He struggles against really quick pressing, we keep seeing it time and time again in games when people point out he has played better as the match went on, because the opposition tires and they don't press as much (not just this game, several times this season).

3904~~~
Abysmal 1st half, better 2nd half, but his passing ability makes him incongruous with Van Gaal's supposed possession-based philosophy. Still useful on occasion, but shouldn't be a mainstay of the side in my view.

3905~~~
Carrick and Blind's better defensive midfielders. By far.

Herrera's a better complement to Carrick/Blind in a two-man midfield. Unless you just play both of them.

Herrera/Di Maria/Rooney's better options in the box-to-box-role.

Herrera/Mata/Rooney are better options as an attacking midfielder.

Fellaini's probaby got the position nailed on if we're looking for a second striker who we can lump it long towards, or if we don't have confidence in our midfielders and defenders to pass it out of the back and decide to go long.

Other than that, though? And why should the above be our ambition - in any game? It nullifies so many of our best players.

3906~~~
I don't know for definite - someone like Vidal I imagine would be perfect, although whether or not we'd get him is another matter. Strootman could be another excellent option that has been discussed a lot.

And we should be aiming to have world class players in as many positions as possible - I don't see what's ridiculous about that.

3907~~~
Fellaini was shocking in the first half. He must have got an earful at half time to improve in the second. His first touch and passing are way off the mark for a midfielder at this level. He did break up a few Liverpool moves.

3908~~~
I don't think the problem to be his passing actually. The biggest problem for me is his awareness, positional sense and movement. He's slow, needs time to adjust on the ball to pass it. He needs several options and slow pace and he will look competent. I think he's a decent passer to be honest. When the game is at our half with 2-3 options for a short pass and space for a long one he'll def have a good option for a pass. Not to mention if he has 1 or 2 players around him that can cover ground and prevent more versatile and pacy players run past him, he is a big lad and much more able to intercept a pass or make a successful tackle. In more congested midfield he's a good option to have, as he provides physical presence.

3909~~~
Stats are terrible when they prove you wrong, yeah <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3910~~~
Improved somewhat in the 2nd half. But overall not a good match for him and the first thirty or so was plain awful.

Don't quite get the logic. I'd rather play McNair and let Carrick take care of that role (who is actually very good at it) if we are to persist with three at the back (don't think we should, but that's another matter). Fellaini looked completely out of place for longish spells today.

When we built up from the back our own half looked so bloody congested at times that having a cool head in that role who wasn't likely to mishit a single pass seemed like an absolutely necessity. The only one who fits that description is Carrick, so again - I don't get it. Fellaini was poor but I don't understand why the hell he was given that task in the first place.

3911~~~
Completely agree. Fellainis got much bigger issues than his passing, so I hope that doesnt become an area of focus for him. As others have stated, he is sloppy with his first touch, bad positioning at times, poor vision, too easily pressed, etc. Still miles above where he was last year and deserves a spot as a squad player, but yeah hes got bigger issues.

3912~~~
Think he was saying they dont tell the whole picture. But if you can average over 80% passing over the course of a season, youre at a good starting point from which to build into better more creative passing.

3913~~~
This is the critical point with Fellaini. He cannot play quick football, he makes stupid mistakes and loses the ball repeatedly when pressed. Looked better 2nd half cause he had time. 

He may be serving a purpose for LVG right now but I can't see him in the team beyond this season.

3914~~~
For me it's down to LvG working with him. He has improved in lot of areas compared to last season. Agree on above. For the poor vision he needs to have his head up when he has the ball in control and under pressure. He looks awkward and lacks confidence under pressure. However having said that he's much better in that respect compared to last season.

3915~~~
80% passing success rate is good, for a midfielder nonetheless? Especially considering that hardly any of them were high risk balls he played.

3916~~~
He was excellent in the second half, good but shaky at times in the first.

3917~~~
He was big boss man today defensively. Bit iffy in posession at times.

3918~~~
I do agree, but its also true that most players and especially those of a similar type to Fellaini - the Wanyamas, Tiotes, etc are all going to do better when they arent immediately closed down as soon as the ball goes near them. Because they dont have the touch and technique to perfectly get away from those hunting. Thats where you'd want to see them use their power to hold off someone if his touch is a bit loose, but he doesnt really do that as well as the rest and you cant always rely on it either.

3919~~~
He played well when he was on a yellow card. I was worried he'd be off before half time. He was brilliant at winning the ball cleanly for the most part.

His passing is erratic. Sometimes he looks slick in possession, playing one touch pass-and-move stuff with Mata and co, then he goes and fluffs up a simple square pass under no pressure.

3920~~~
Well he had an awful start but it's the first time he turned things around and went from having a poor game to a pretty solid performance. When I saw a few misplaced passes and a booking I thought here we go again. I was certain he was going to get sent off but he didn't and kept calm turning his game around and being very useful. Well done to him for that.

3921~~~
Above 80% is where a midfielder should be at. Whether he can add to this by adding killer passes, better positioning  and improve his build up play all while maintaining this success rate will determine whether he will have a place on the team long term.

If he can do all that and maintain his excellent tackling, then he will be quite a useful squad player for us.

3922~~~
You really don't like him ... At least you have been 100% consistent in your opinion!  

Reminds me of how you hounded poor Hargreaves <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3923~~~
With Fellaini we just got to make sure we don't ask him to do things that don't play to his strengths. His first touch isn't that great so we should try not to play him into trouble i.e. when he's marked, his vision isn't great so we shouldn't have him in a role where he has to pick the ball up and start things off. Fellaini is effective in and around the final third, bringing the ball down and bringing people into play. He did that well a number of times today. He is also good at being a physical and putting himself about, but he can get sucked out of position so its a bit unfair to him to ask him to play the Carrick role. Give him the freedom of the third man in midfield, so he can roam about and be a nuisance, without compromising our shape.

3924~~~
Posting that Fellaini was shocking in the first half doesn't mean you don't like him. It means you watched the match and had some kind of clue as to what was going on

3925~~~
He had some good tackling in the 2nd half, sure but positioning was poor as usual.

3926~~~
Understand your point but I would argue that none of those players are of the desired quality for Utd for the exact reasons you state. We have to be looking for better. 

Matic does the job well, Toure outstanding. We've got to be looking for better than what fellaini brings.

3927~~~
I disagree that he played very well today. His first half was awful, after the break he did well. Underwhelming overall. 

I don't hate the guy, I just don't think he's nearly good enough at the basics of football to play midfielder in a team that wants to dominate and control games. He simply ruins too many attacks with a poor first touch or an underhit or wayward pass. And if a destroyer is what you want, there are tons of players with better positional awareness and distribution.

3928~~~
Started off really poorly but had a good game in the end. Really got stuck in there and won the ball back loads of times. A shame on the ball he isn't that good. Don't like it when he plays deep as he isn't sure with his passing at all, but he's obviously a useful player to have. Think he had something like 10 tackles today, which isn't bad at all.

3929~~~
People criticize his flaws and these flaws were evident today. His passing was poor and too sloppy, he gave the ball away so many times but unlike last game, we were not directly punished for it. His touch was also very poor and he just kept losing the ball. In the build up, he doesn't have the skill and vision to build up our game and distribute the ball as I would expect from a midfielder. He was good a couple of weeks back but based on the last 2 games, he shouldn't be starting

3930~~~
His passing was very bad again.

3931~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Even Sir Alex admitted in his latest book he was disappointed with Hargreaves. He was referring to his his play rather than his injuries which are unfortunate.

3932~~~
Just because fans give an opinion on a player hardly means they hate him as a person.

3933~~~
Great work at breaking up play, bad at passing today.

3934~~~
I'm hoping once we have fit full-backs we will see Carrick and Blind with Herrera as a midfield Three. Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, RvP, and Falcao fighting for the front Three places.

3935~~~
For some reason though, a number of his defenders in this thread seem to take every insult to him personally, with the odd accusations of people being poor fans because they have a contrary opinion on him.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3936~~~
He's brilliant at taking the ball of the feet of forwards running at our defence. He's brilliant at defending set pieces. He's really helped us shore up a well dodgy defence. He doesn't offer too much from an attacking sense apart from attacking set pieces but in fairness to him he keeps the ball moving a lot better than any of us imagined but his passing is still not man utd level. There's just no way Herrera will oust him from the team this season in central mid as we would get walked all over in central mid if it was just carrick and Herrera. Herrera needs to bulk up a bit before being ready to be considered first team material in central mid

3937~~~
was shaky early in the game but improved later on. It s always nice to see a player proving his doubters wrong.

3938~~~
I really dont get the criticism after this match. We all know what kind of player he is and that he is limited on the ball. He isn’t a defensive midfielder – never was and never will be. He is a dynamic player, who needs the freedom to join the striker in and around the box, while adding hustle and strength in midfield. He needs at least one defensive/controlling player next to him, eventually two.

Personally I doubt that a top club (= club that wants to compete for titles in league and CL) wants him as a regular starter, because he isn’t top-notch quality and he shows his best in a niche-role (I am inclined to say opportunistic role), that many top club just don’t use.

So all that in mind LvG fields him as the only proper midfielder with 3 defender, 2 winbacks, 3 striker and a #10 in a weird 5-1-4. Overall Rooney played well, but he failed to support him in the first HT and Mata wasn’t even existing as midfielder during this period, while Liverpool constantly pressed him. There are maybe 4-5 players in the world that would look good under these circumstances. Carrick struggles almost every time when he is getting pressed and doesn’t get solid support. Even genuine world-class holding player (e.g. Alonso, Schweinsteiger, Kroos, Pirlo) often look fairly useless against strong pressing, when the rest of the team isn’t doing well.

So why would anyone expect miracles from Fellaini?

He deserved a lot of stick for his performance against Southampton, because he chickened out and was in hiding. He didn’t do that all today. He was available and tried to maintain possession and to link defense and offense. Of course he struggled heavily, but other than Mata or Rooney at least he tried to take over responsibility. Without him there wouldn’t have been a United-midfield in the first HT. In the second HT he got more support and looked much better.

LvG certainly deserves a lot more stick for using this lineup. Furthermore regardless of what the manager told Mata and Rooney, they should have supported Fellaini.

It’s one thing to acknowledge Fellaini´s limitations – we talked about this a thousand times – but it’s another thing to actually criticize him, while doing reasonably well considering the difficult circumstances. It’s not his fault, when the manager plays him out of position without proper support and it’s not his fault, that other player, who should have helped him, didn’t do that.

I am not his biggest fan and it was a mistake to buy him, but that doesn’t mean that I need to criticize him all the time. He is showing the right mentality and is performing on a reasonable good level this season – something that I can’t say about the majority of our players.

3939~~~
We're doing something wrong when expecting your central midfielder not to wildly misplace passes between midfield and defence is seen as a "miracle"

He was terrible in the first half because he couldn't do the simple things right. Nobody was expecting him to score or set up attacks, but giving the ball away a lot in your own half and getting booked within 5 minutes, and continuing to foul people getting the refs attention clearly isnt good enough.

Fellaini knows that and did better in the 2nd half

3940~~~
Because 1) Carrick is playing in 3 men defense at the moment, deal with it, LVG wants a ball playing player from the back and Carrick is our best <b>defender</b> second game in a row, it will look like this in the 352 system.
2) He's carrying likes of Mata, Herrera, ADM or Blind from physical point of view. This, plus he's putting a lot more tackles in than the aforementioned former three, so they carry him passing wise, he carries them in other aspects of the game that some here try to ignore for some reason.

If you need a reminder why we need to balance our midfield somehow and not just put three attacking oriented players ahead of the defending midfielder, Leicester game was a good example.

And Jesus, ADM wasn't available today, and you'd put who as a CDM today ahead of Fellaini? Herrera? Play a midfield trio of Herrera, Rooney and Mata? Seriously? 

He's not a perfect CDM as seen in two last games but still the most viable option that we have right now, given that Carrick is playing a CB and Blind is out.

3941~~~
Fellaini could be one helluva player if he had Mata's touch.

3942~~~
you would hate Schweinsteiger or Alonso.

3943~~~
Yes they are notorious for giving sloppy passes away 35 yards away from their goal. Thats definitely not the complete opposite of what they do.

3944~~~
He didn't foul anyone (in 1st half, dunno about 2nd because I had to leave) after his booking.

3945~~~
Fellani is a million miles away from looking like a starting player for us. People r lowering their standards trying to shoehorn him in

3946~~~
He's just nowhere near good enough on the ball and too clumsy without it to play in that deep role. This is not anything new, we have known this since last season. He could easily have been sent off today. If Moreno (?) had mad a meal of one of his challenges early in the 2nd half he could have been gone.

He definitely has a role to play in the squad though, he has proved his worth this season in a more advanced role.

3947~~~
This is how I see it, its not a question of Fellaini keeping Herrera or anyone else out for that matter. Its a matter of balance and until we get a better option we should stick with him.

3948~~~
I only remember him making one foul in the 2nd half. He did get away with one when he clattered into a Liverpool player off the ball, but nothing was given.

He had a ropey opening 10 or 15 minutes, but he grew into the game and did well. He's an excellent ball winner.

3949~~~
You're wrong, he did well today. He definitely has a part to play in this squad.

3950~~~
I'm wrong in your opinion ,not mine. Fair enough, squad player but nowhere near a starter

3951~~~
I watched the match with a pub full of Liverpool fans, an fellani is rightly viewed as r weakest link

3952~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">I like him.  Sure, he's not a 1st XI player but he has a key role to play in a squad of 24.  Like he has done this season with our crazy injury crisis. 
Once we are back to Europe next season, when the games come thick and fast and we need to win ugly, we'll need his strength and stamina.
Especially on a cold windy night in Stoke when the daisy flowers like Mata, Herrera, Di Maria etc miss the Spanish sun on their backs.

</span>

3953~~~
I am flabbergasted that people are defending his first half performance here.  Yes, he got better in the second half.  Yes, he has had a few good moments for us this season. However, if we want to be challenging for anything then I don't think he is up to the standard required.  Some of his first half misplaced passes were atrocious.  I would've taken any random Joe from the pub in his place...

3954~~~
Mostly forgot he was on the pitch.

3955~~~
I agree with you, I also think he tends to let players run post him that a defensive midfielder would pick up. His touch passing is about good enough but if you get him in the final third he's an excellent outlet for crosses and good at finding his teammates in the box.

3956~~~
No he doesn't. This has been said a lot and it makes no sense. He's acquitted himself very well in the PL. He's no pushover. People were saying this too before he even signed for us and I think its stuck in their minds as a default 'deficiency' to his game. You only need to watch his games before his injury to see that that statement makes no sense at all

3957~~~
He did the exact same pass from the Southampton game that led to their goal. He wasn't even under pressure.

3958~~~
I wonder what for you is a good midfield performance. I surely didn't see one today

3959~~~
Agreed

But, we should give credit where it's due. He's getting stick for doing a role that no one else is available to do at the moment with blind injured and carrick at cb.

It seems some people, looking at you Escobar, would rather see a midfield of mata-Herrera-Rooney. Sorry but that's just bonkers. We've already got wingers at wingback!

3960~~~
How many interceptions did he make today?

3961~~~
He has done okay of late, but as Souness described him, 'he just doesn't have enough football inside him'. 

The fact that he freezes or never elects to take any option that presents more of a challenge than a short lateral pass to an unmarked colleague makes it difficult to see him as a United midfielder long term. So many times I'm seeing passes,  ones that can be pulled off by any midfielder who is good at football, not necessarily Xavi - but Fellaini is too scared to even try it. People can say that he isn't in the team for that, but I'd argue that he is. De Gea isn't in the team for that, fair enough - but if you are midfield player, then there is a chance that you will find yourself in a situation where it is you, not the Spaniard next to you, who has the penetrative pass on, or the shot from the edge of the box. It isn't good enough to say it isn't your role, your team needs to win and everyone needs to do their bit, which includes a central midfielder taking initiative with the ball. 

To pluck a name, many times this season, if it were perhaps De Rossi, we would have got a good shot off,  or played the runner through instead of looking for safety. Amd De Rossi wouldn't have even been in the tean for that either, just that he is a good enoigh footballer that you can't take the piss and leave him with the ball unchallenged in your half for too long.

3962~~~
The people who didn't recognise the good work he did today, it's pretty obvious you'll never appreciate anything remotely decent Fellaini does. He won the ball back and set off Mata for the third goal, can you not remember even that?

3963~~~
Good at nicking the ball.

Happy with his peformance. His presence in midfield and ability to get a tackle in and catch attackers unaware was important.

3964~~~
Off course he doesn't, selective memory

3965~~~
He started badly but got better as the game went on. Never going to be a player who catches the eye but has done a good job so far this season.

3966~~~
It's gotten to the stage I probably overrate Fellaini just to balance the ridiculous level of depreciation he tends to get, even when he performs well. He's kept a good balance to our midfield, and although he's not as creative or attractive a player as Herrera, I think he's proved a better option over the past month or so.

3967~~~
Must have watched a different game, his touch was horrendous at times but I thought that was his best game since arriving.

3968~~~
True, I probably come across as a bit harsh on him at times. Did what he could today, albeit I'd say it was a fairly mixed performance.

3969~~~
Thought he was shocking first half but turned it around superbly second half.

3970~~~
I'd say he was 4-5 out of 10 in the first half and 7 or maaybe 8 in the second. But the second half we were 2-0 up and Liverpool's pressing was non-existant so the first half is a better indicator of his overall performance for me as that was where the game was won.

3971~~~
We gave a player more established in that role vice captaincy at the start of the season.

Agree that Rooney-Mata-Ander isn't a thing though. The team was already too attacking imo and lacked defensive minded players. No surprise that DDG was in action every 10 mins

3972~~~
What else is there to his game? As I said before, he can do a specific job in certain games (as shown over the last months) but he was not good today

3973~~~
Another shocking performance in the first half, his passing was awful at times, change of formation doesn't suit him especially is the opposition put any sort of pressure on him. Better in the second half when the game opened up and contributed defensively but we need better players in the first eleven eventually if we want to win trophies, his positioning and passing just isn't good enough for a cm.

3974~~~
He was clearly good today. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He started poorly but grew into the game and was one of our better players in the second half.

3975~~~
And how many times has he misplaced a pass or lost possession or put our defenders under pressure or helped us in the build up or to control the midfield? I expect more from a midfielder than just making interceptions. He was not as good as he was before the Southampton game and can't complain if he loses his starting place for the next game

3976~~~
He's really not taking any risky chances so no reason for him to be misplacing simple passes and setting off the opposition inside our own box. He needs to clean that shit up otherwise all his hard work elsewhere is useless.

3977~~~
A good performance where he lost possession and misplaced so many passes? Seems like we have a different understanding from a good midfield performance then

3978~~~
Thought he did very well defensively, he stopped Liverpool in their tracks repeatedly. I'm no great fan of his but he had a good game today.

3979~~~
Or you're simply blind to how effective he was today, thankfully our manager understands his performances and continues to pick him.

3980~~~
Well I clearly saw those misplaced passes and lost of possession due to his poor touch and lack of build up play which just doesn't balance out the things he did ok

3981~~~
I'm with you, he's only there until we get someone better to fill his position.

LvG was seemingly happy to let him go in the summer, and only a last gasp injury stopped him going, LvG has been surprised that he needs such a big physical presence so that's why he's playing, don't get me wrong at times he has been ok, but long term no chance.

What has benefited us is that now he is starting games, and even scoring a few goals we may actually be able to sell him for a decent fee, rather than just loan him, sure the grand plan is Strootman, in Fellaini out.

3982~~~
He started poorly but had a very good second half. Being booked in the fourth minute was very stupid but he concentrated more on the game then while being still aggressive enough and continuously dispossessed their players like they were children. Yes he lost possession at times but defensively did brilliantly in the second half, chested some balls down also. Should be definitely given some credit, anyway I don't actually see him as starting option as he is slow and our play needs someone like Herrera who can himself won a lot of balls and press better..

3983~~~
Thinks it's pretty evident a player in his role with his frame is pretty much crucial in the way we play. Obviously there are upgrades out there but for the time being I'm quite enjoying seeing his comeback. 

I'm pretty sure he won't be starting next season but at the moment his power is essential.

3984~~~
Play Carrick.

Play Fellaini with the two Spaniards in front of Carrick.

Win games.

It's that easy really<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3985~~~
People slating him cause of his misplaced passes when other players were poor in possesion in the 1st half also. Same goes for Southampton game, it seems some players can missplace places and nobody will notice but Fellaini not.

3986~~~
He was statistically the worst or 2nd worst offender in the first half. He was absolutely terrible.

3987~~~
He wasn't terrible. He wasnt good but terrible - that's a bit too much.

3988~~~
Fellaini today was excellent at breaking up liverpool attacks, and winning the ball back, but my main gripe with him is, he needs to pass ball forward more instead of passing back all the time

3989~~~
Yes some fans do but I've been following your posts regarding Fellaini for some time now. You really, really dislike him for some reason so I wont go into discussing it.

3990~~~
Feel sorry for him, it's painfully obvious that CDM isn't the position for him. Improved in the second half though.

3991~~~
I can't think of any reason for disliking him as a person. I've not met the guy, he's not had an affair with any member of my family, and he certainly doesn't owe me any money. It's true I'm not a fan of his playing style.

3992~~~
Bad ball control, bad first touch and bad passing. Essentially a poor footballer in definition but is still somehow useful for his presence and defensive efforts. I can see why Van gaal uses him, he gives us some sort of 'balance' doesn't he

3993~~~
Come on dude... I mean disliking him/his style as a player. 

EDIT: I have a feeling you don't look at the end product and what he brings to the team but dislike <i>his playing style</i> so much that you just don't want him in the team

3994~~~
If he really is a poor footballer he is the first 'essentially poor footballer' that has carried a club like Everton for multiple seasons.

3995~~~
Weird game, his passing was shocking but he's great at breaking the play up and winning the ball back!

3996~~~
It's hard for me even to look at him playing, really, 81% complete passes for a Manchester United midfielder? His first touch is also disastrous.

He was better in the second half, especially near the end - half of his challenges came after the 3rd goal. This isn't surprising, again, he is okay when he doesn't need to move around much - and the oppositions players are forced to play some risky passes.

He played okay/good for a few games and justified his appearances in the starting eleven, but he is just not quick, intelligent or even technical enough to be a United midfielder in a long-term, imo.

3997~~~
What's your point? He's a poor footballer right now that is being used for his presence and defensive efforts to allow the better footballers around him the freedom to play. What's wrong with that?

3998~~~
He's very sluggish over the first couple of yards, and his awareness is a little patchy at times. He needs to run into spaces after delivering the ball. In the first half he was quite poor, tbh. Some of his sideway passes are atrocious at the very least. Put mildly, he needs to stop doing those altogether. In essence, he is no Carrick with the ball. However, he does intercept the ball quite a lot and he is good at tracking players. If he is allowed space to run into, he's not that slow and catches up to a few speedy players at times. Against quick footed players like Liverpool had in the middle today, bar Gerrard, he's too cumbersome. Herrera would probably have been a better bet, but then again, Herrera is far from proven in the CDM role.

His second half was much improved.

3999~~~
Whatever negative you write about him you'll be accused of having agenda because it's not possible that somebody could actually think that he wasn't good or that somebody simply doesn't like his style of play without hating him.

4000~~~
extremely limited player. won't get a sniff when blind/di maria recover.

4001~~~
Better second half and put in a few good tackles but I thought his passing was really poor

4002~~~
He is growing on me, and I recognize what he can add to the team. However, I do panic that he is going to get a red nearly every game.

One of his tackles by the sideline I thought was very close to a straight red.  Against Southampton I thought he was lucky with a clear elbow. He is all elbows and legs.

4003~~~
Exactly. Don't understand why people immediately think you hate a person if you don't like him as a player. Anyway he seemed quite sluggish today. Was atrocious in the first half. Definitely did better in the second but he is just not a CDM like a Carrick or Blind. Does not have the calmness or the passing range of either. He is more Mikel with better physicality in that role.

Nonetheless I would like to see LvG to move to a 4-4-2 diamond formation with Carrick at the base, Di Maria and Herrera on either sides and with Mata heading the diamond. Then Rooney and RvP up top. That would make for some excellent football.

4004~~~
Carried a club like Everton? He didn't carry them anywhere. He was an effective part in a well drilled side.

4005~~~
He was one of our two CMs with the other being Rooney. Mata was further up front and could not link the play up well. When you consider this and then remember how he was basically doing nothing to help us control the game in the first half, you have to admit he was really poor.

4006~~~
Took a while to get going, with a very poor start to the game. But on the whole he wasn't to bad, especially considering the midfield was basically made up of him, Rooney and Mata. Not exactly the most defensivily sound group of midfielders we have. What I do like about him is his ability to get a leg in and take the ball off a player. Most of the time he comes away with it very cleanly and can give the ball off to someone due to his strength.

4007~~~
his passing can be awful at times but loves the way he breaks the opposition's play.

4008~~~
He definitely has to clean up his first touch and passing. It wasn't too bad prior to the Southampton match though so he just has to get back to that. He is a big asset defensively though. Amazing that people still want him gone from the club. He is clearly a handy player to have, even just as a squad player.

4009~~~
Wasn't great on the ball but I thought he put in an excellent defensive performance. Quite a number of clean, effective tackles and interceptions.

4010~~~
Not the best couple of games by him. I don't like him at the base of our midfield. He's not calm enough to play through. I think in a diamond he does his job well. He has suffered the most from the change to 3 at the back.

4011~~~
Had a pretty good 2nd half... but needs to cut out the silly bookings he gets.

On another day an early yellow like that will cost him a red.

4012~~~
Poor Fellaini - every game, he gets the most pages on a player thread where he is endlessly debated; often with the same points.

Would just like to point out his ratings as a whole on the Caf - An average rating of 6.2/10 which is amongst the highest this season. The only players ahead of him are Herrera, DDG, Di Maria and Rooney.

4013~~~
He's one of the players who should be worried about our January business

4014~~~
Need to sell, simply not good enough.

4015~~~
We tend to be very pragmatic about building from the back. It seems like passing it patiently all the time is desirable, but not an imperative; and sometimes hoofing it is the better part of valor. 

I know it's regarded as football barbarism of the worst kind, but when you play it long like that, it really helps to have someone with his target-man qualities; even when he isn't occupying the position of a striker. Don't think Van Gaal is blind to this fact.

4016~~~
All of our "starters" have been guilty of atrocious passing at some point this season. Again, I don't know why this is being singled out as the biggest issue! It's his positioning, touch, movement and vision which are lacking. His passing is fine, if average, for a midfielder!

4017~~~
No more than Rooney or Januzaj. In fact probably less, if you believe in statistics. Rooney and Januzaj sometimes dip into the 60-70% range for pass completion. Fellaini is consistently above 80%. The reason Januzaj has been permanately dropped is because he lost the ball so many times.

Just to restate what I have been saying all along: Fellaini doesn't misplace passes or lose the ball anymore than world class midfielders. Statistics don't lie. Very few midfielders are capable of consistently delivering 90% or higher pass success rate. Fellaini is in the 80s, which is where most "world class" midfielders are.

So if we want to criticize a player, let's do it based on his actual weaknesses (vision, movement, touch, clumsiness, etc.). His passing is actually highly accurate, if lacking in imagination.

4018~~~
As many have said, that was most evident after half time. His second half performance was very good. Showed all the attributes that have convinced Van Gaal to keep starting him. 

Really lost his shit in the first half though. Started with that terrible pass and immediate yellow card, then took ages to get back into the game. A carbon copy of Soton performance. Credit where it's due for second half display, though. Plus the discipline to survive such an early booking.

4019~~~
Well that should not be the case at all.

4020~~~
He was appalling in the first half but was much improved in the 2nd. 

But he really shouldn't be our DM although LVG can be excused for yesterday given our injury worries.

4021~~~
His defensive stats are fecking excellent, by the way. Be surprised if there's a DM in the league who did more to help his team win the ball back this weekend. All the more surprising, considering how long he took to get going.

Overall pass completion was mediocre but not terrible (81%). Better than Hererra's (75%) so I doubt Van Gaal will drop him any time soon, never mind sell him.

4022~~~
FYI,

Fellaini is on 87% pass success so far this season. That puts him above:

Herrera
Blackett (really? wow)
Rafael
RVP
Rooney
Evans
McNair
Januzaj
Shaw
Di Maria

And almost identical to Ozil and David Silva. Iniesta is only 5% higher than Fellaini. Just so you have some perspective...

Next to Valencia, Fellaini has the 2nd highest successful tackles on our team.

Has the 2nd highest number of interceptions of our midfielders (Blind is #1)

Worryingly, he is the 4th most dispossed player on our team.

If you look at the big picture, Fellaini is a handy player. Flawed in many ways, but his contributions are there clearly to be seen.

4023~~~
I gave him a six out of ten - his first half was absolutely dreadful, but he did well in the second half. His pass completion rate is a little misleading though - last two games, he's displayed a bad habit of playing a lax pass across his own box on his wrong foot. What's more, his control is absolutely abysmal at times - he's not necessarily losing the ball via his passes, but he tends to get it nicked off him a lot when pressed or when he's taken a bad touch. Made countless interceptions in the second half, mind you, and he did bloody well to be so disciplined on a yellow, because I thought he was a walking red.

Overall though, his style just jars with me. I'd prefer Hererra to be given a chance to show what he can do.

4024~~~
Because he's always passing backwards.

4025~~~
But don't you think it had a lot to do with the nature of the passes Fallaini made vis-a-vis Herrera. Not too high risk ones and mostly safe sideways or back passes. True that is not bad in itself but considering he did that most of the game, 81% is rather poor. Not to mention Cleverley got slaughtered over here for precisely that kind of thing. Also, he seemed to get dispossed quite easily at times and made the same horrible side-way pass which had led to the Southampton goal. All in all, he did well in interceptions and dispossessing opponents but his passing and ball control were below average.

4026~~~
I tend to agree - Herrera is on a 6.5 while Fellaini is on 6.2. I reckon Herrera would have scored high in the initial games where he was shining in the diamond. The initial period would have ensured the Caf giving him good ratings as well - he was value for the money definitely in those games.

4027~~~
First half, yes. Different performance after half time though.

4028~~~
They were not playing the same role. Fellaini was playing a DM like against Soton, and 80% pass completion is not good enough in that role. Comparing their pass completion rate to try to make Fellaini look better is pointless, different players being given different roles.

Why not ?? Herrera has done well in most of his games. There is not a lot of difference in the ratings, which is about right.

4029~~~
True, and all very valid points. But saying that he doesn't offer enough offensively with his passing is quite different from saying that he is a terrible passer who gives the ball away a lot.

I don't think anyone ever criticized Cleverley for being a bad passer (he's on something like 92% this season, on par with the very best like Iniesta!!!). Like Cleverley, Fellaini is just lacking in imagination and movement - but both are very tidy and good at passing in the wrong direction!

4030~~~
True, that is a problem not just with Fellaini but with our current squad at the moment.

4031~~~
But Carrick doesn't have to play CB if we drop this defensive, boring 5-3-2 formation that we haven't had a single impressive performance playing.

4032~~~
Shocking first half overall but was excellent in the second defensively.

I lost count of the times he broke Liverpool attacks yesterday.

4033~~~
Nope. 75 passes attempted against Liverpool. 34 of them were forwards. 22 sideways and just 19 backwards. So 3 out of every 4 passes was <b>not</b> backwards.

4034~~~
You have to see that in the right context. When you look at how safe Fellaini's passing choices are, 81 is not good enough. Nine out of ten times he gives it to the nearest man because he's so afraid to cock up himself, yet he still manages to miss every fifth pass. Not to mention the many times his completed passes put his teammates under instant pressure because they're underhit, imprecise, or the man is marked. The stats don't show that. Nor do they show the handful of times he conceded possession because he couldn't control a simple pass. 

Fellaini improved after the break yesterday, partly because Liverpool gave us more space and stopped pressing. He did well to break up some attacks. But when we had possession, he was atrocious and a major liability. Hope someone does a compilation of his first-half touches. It wasn't pretty.

4035~~~
I'm not denying he was shit in the first half. I'm sure there's a big difference between his pass completion % in both halves. There would have to be for such a hapless first 45 to end up with an overall 80% pass completion which is, as I said, mediocre rather than awful.

4036~~~
I understand what you are saying but as a professional footballer you are expected to make and get the 5-10 yard side and back passes correct. I think he had improved a lot right until the Southampton game but for some reason his performance has dipped again. My biggest gripe with him is how he watches the ball and completely forgets to track a runner (apart from the fact that he ambles when the opposition are streaming forward but I won't mention that as people will start showing how many miles/kms he covered which would still be completely irrelevant to the point). The Balotelli shot which DDG saved, Fellaini was almost next to him but still didn't see him and that Balotelli was about to take a shot.

4037~~~
There was a pass when he gave it to Rooney, about a 3/4 yard pass, and Rooney had a man standing less than a yard away from him (this was in our own half too) I almost threw the remote at the TV <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> luckily Rooney played the ball first time out wide and jumped to avoid getting clattered (the Liverpool player didn't go in too hard to either)

Anyway I think Fellaini had a better 2nd half, but his passing was a liability first half (almost cost us 2 goals) and he already cost us a goal vs Southampton.

Hopefully Carrick can play midfield soon, or maybe with Blind coming back soon things will improve in terms of passing in midfield.

4038~~~
I didn't mean "literally" backwards, but backwards relative to the direction the play should be going. He always slows down the build up of our attack because he always tries to go for the safest pass possible, which also leads to him spending more time on the ball with a bigger chance of him being dispossessed.

I'm not blaming him for that though because he knows that passing isn't one of his strengths, so I'd still rather him passing it backwards than attempting riskier passes that could backfire. However that doesn't mean he's a good passer and those numbers are pointless really.

4039~~~
Defensively he's very good, and that's where his strengths lie. However, Herrera is a much better passer than Fellaini, and I didn't think there would be any debate about it, so you kind of surprised me there.

4040~~~
Eh? Doesn't play normally aim in the general direction of the opponents goal? What does this mean? You say he only passes backwards. Someone shows the stats say otherwise. So you try to redefine "backwards"!

My word, this thread is full of people tying themselves up in knots when presented with stats that disprove their castiron view that Fellaini is useless. If there were stats that showed Herrera was God's gift to football the numbers wouldn't be "pointless".

4041~~~
For the first sentence, I mean when he should pass it to a free player 20 yards forward, he still chooses the nearest man who is probably 2 yards ahead of him (so it's technically a forward pass), but he's slowing the attack and in term of how the attack should be going, he's passing it backwards.

For the second sentence, I took a hint from your tagline.

4042~~~
What a load of crap! Your bias is caught out when presented with the stats so you end up having to redefine the word "backwards". You better ring up the Oxford English dictionary and let them know.

4043~~~
Weren't you also trying to use stats last year to prove that Moyes is good manager?

This is not a math lesson, nor an English lesson. You get my point and you're yet to disprove it. And I'm not biased, I acknowledge Fellaini's strengths and where he has improved this season, passing is not one his strength, regardless what your pointless numbers which measure very little say.

I advice you to watch more games too.

4044~~~
As mentioned frequently he had a much better second half - and he deserves some credit for that. To be a bit cynical, though, you could say that what this indicates more than anything is that he should not play in that position, within that system, against an opponent capable of putting us under sustained pressure.

In the second half Liverpool's efforts where more sporadic, their pressing less collective and systematic - and Fellaini had a much better half. In the first thirty minutes or so Liverpool gave us a bit of a game - and Fellaini looked quite dreadful. He had a game of two halves - and that was no coincidence and not simply due to him getting his shit together for the second half.

4045~~~
That’s not cynical but just obvious. Even his biggest fans would admit that. That’s not his decision so, is it? Considering that Blind is injured and Carrick had to play out of position he is the next best choice for this Position in this lineup. That tells you eventually more about the squad and the other players and less about him. It also brings up the question how LvG could possibly think that this is a good idea.

4046~~~
Indeed. And I don't blame the big feller - certainly not. I don't see why we have to play in that fashion, to be honest. Like I said above somewhere, IF we insist on that set-up, play Carrick further up the pitch and throw in that extra body back there, i.e. McNair or whoever.

4047~~~
For me, considering that he was booked after a few minutes and generally had a bad first half hour, I think he deserves enormous credit for his overall performance. Showed great character

4048~~~
Very good in the second half. For a huge guy he is very good at nicking the ball off the oppositions foot when they're advancing. Our 3rd goal was because he managed to steal it back when they were attacking.

4049~~~
If people are bothered by him taking easy passes then they are probably not going to enjoy us playing football under Louis van Gaal. He wants us to dominate possession, and like it or not that is going to involve playing short passes for the sake of passing at times.

4050~~~
I was cursing him after that awful first 4 minutes yesterday. Making a sloppy start; giving ball away and getting booked, was exactly what we DIDNT need. But... fair play to him, he improved steadily as the game went on, and finished it strongly. So credit where due I say

4051~~~
He's done a good job for us, but I think once Blind is fit, he will play in the CDM role and Fellaini will be on the bench

4052~~~
I agree. Unless we play the diamond, and then I think Fellaini will be preferred over Blind.

4053~~~
Credit where it's due, I've been one of Fellaini's biggest critics - particularly from a disciplinary point of view.  Yesterday when he got booked after 5 minutes I feared the worst.
But I have to say he showed great maturity, picking and timing his tackles very well.  Liverpool seemed to find it difficult to get any change out of him, although to be fair it was one of the less ill-tempered affairs between the sides and it never really looked like a red card was around the corner.
Seems to be a lot more intelligent than when we first signed him, long may it continue!

4054~~~
Is that the blind that in one of the games played a needless awkward back pass that afforded our opponents a chance? That was looped over the top else he would have got stick. The grass is always greener ain't it. The fact is some people were waiting for any old excuse and it's not about the players, it's about the people.

4055~~~
Though, that was probably the only mistake Blind's made in the last six months. The guy is ridiculously consistent. Though, I agree that the Felli-bashing is needless sometimes.

4056~~~
????

4057~~~
Anyone who followed this thread knows I have been one of Fellaini's staunchest supporters and I agree, he does not suit a defensive role in that system, especially with no other true midfielder alongside him.
I dont personally understand the need for a CDM in a 3-5-2, the idea is meant to be that central CB (Carrick) acts as a sweeper or Half-Back, carrying the ball out into midfield and acting as a playmaker. It is a role Carrick is perfect for in my eyes.
Instead we have 3 out-and-out CBs, <i>and </i>a screening midfielder in front of them - it seems overly defensive.

Either way, Fellaini isnt really a DM. His best games came for us as a box-to-box player, where he can put himself about, contribute in attack and defensive and use his strength(s). The CDM role does a good job of hiding most of his strengths and exposing his weaknesses. To be fair though, I think he would do a lot better if he had an actual midfielder like Herrera, alongside him. Mata offered nothing defensively and was invisible for most of the game (before popping up with a goal and assist), and Rooney always puts in a shift but isnt exactly a disciplined midifelder.

 I would actually love to see us play a 3-5-2 with one of Carrick/Blind as the sweeper and the other in midfield alongside Fellaini. Then stick Herrera/Mata/ADM as #10 and you have a great looking lineup.

4058~~~
Fellaini's not suited for that CDM role, but he grew into the game and it was almost as if he suddenly calmed down and was making the right passes and keeping the ball moving.. Mainly down to Rooney dropping deep and offering short options and Liverpool got tired of closing us down..

I still would rather have him play in a more advanced position vs big teams than as a DM.. He just doesnt have the creativity and composure to find a player when being closed down quick

4059~~~
Yeah, I was convinced he'd get a second booking. Really disciplined performance to keep his nose clean for so long. Especially after he got that cheap shot in the ribs, which must have wound him up.

4060~~~
I was of a similar mind. I was really baffled that LVG didnt take him off in the second half and risked him getting sent off. Gotta give credit to Fellaini for staying disciplined even with incidents like getting elbowed in the ribs.

4061~~~
To have a future as someone who starts regularly he needs to convince the manager not to go and buy Strootman or someone else, yesterday’s performance won’t have done him any favours in that regard, for someone who pretty much exclusively plays short, simple passes he gives the ball away too much. Even though he was better second half all he did was probably leave LVG wishing Strootman was fit enough to sign in January.

I think he is finding it harder lately because he is having to function as part of the team and execute a more traditional CM role rather than just being told to put himself about and get forward (which is how you get the best out of him). I haven’t seen anything to since he signed to change my view from his Everton days that he is a good player but only if you create a role and position for him, ask him to do anything else and he is a very ordinary CM.

4062~~~
In a diamond I see Blind furthest back, Fellani perhaps on the right.

4063~~~
It's a format which can make sense if you're up against a superior opponent, I would say. It makes no sense whatsoever to me as some sort of default choice, not even given the defensive frailty of Young and Valencia: If you absolutely have to field an extra body at the back, to compensate as it were, then field McNair and play Carrick as the DM.

If the logic is that you need A) a ball player/passer of the highest quality at the back and B) a defensive midfielder shielding the defence...then I'm puzzled. I can't fathom why the hell that should be necessary. And if we had looked impressive yesterday playing that system I would have gladly shut up - but we didn't. For large spells we looked porous and shaky.

4064~~~
LvG wants to win the League and the Champs League, that isn't going to happen with Felliani. As much as I have been impressed with him this year, it just highlights the need for a strong, physical midfielder, right now that is Felliani but I will be shocked if he isn't upgraded come Jan / Summer.

4065~~~
We will upgrade in the summer I am convinced about that, someone who can pass the ball a lot better, with better positioning but is also a strong physical presence, Strootman or Scheniderlin spring to mind. In the meantime though I think Fellaini will be needed and he may convince LVG he doesn't need to upgrade if his perfromances improve over the season, he may even still be sold but the most likely scenario is he will be a squad player next season.

4066~~~
Pretty much. Looking at our lineup I would expect Carrick to have been pushing forward into midfield to create effectively a 4-4-2 diamond, with a midfield of Carrick as the CDM, Fellaini and Rooney as CMs and Mata as the AM. Then Carrick can drop back into the back three to allow the WBs to push forwards and offer width, when needed.

Its a very unusual system to play 3-5-2 with a DM. When that DM is then not even a natural DM, I am not wholly surprised that Fellaini struggled in the first half, and that we as a team looked quite disjointed.

We have struggled for years when teams put us under pressure, but the answer is not to simply put more bodies in at the back, quite the opposite. We need our midfielders to show for the ball, find space and provide easy balls for our defenders to play out from the back. Neither Rooney nor Mata tend to do this. I do feel that Fellaini makes an effort to find space and show for the ball, but he is not a playmaker and will therefore be looking for the simple pass himself most of the time. What we really lacked was a true playmaker in the middle of the park.

4067~~~
Its these sorts of statements that annoy me. Against Chelsea, Fellaini shackled Fabregas superbly (and Matic as well, to an extent) and also contributed a lot to our general play. Yet people make these blanket statements that he just simply isnt good enough for <i>x</i>.

4068~~~
I would hope that LvG has ambitions that when we are playing at home, players like Fabregas and Matic will be needed to shackle our midfield.

Look Felliani is what he is, a physical presence that get's a job done. However, to be a feared team, you need a midfield that can create, score, tackle and boss games, we still haven't got that. Yes we are much improved in midfield (we couldn't have been much worse), but I don't think LvG is satisfied with what he has, he will want to upgrade. We are getting by at the moment, but with a new better midfielder and a top centre half we could be there.

4069~~~
I imagine LVG will want to upgrade by all means - the key to maintaining success is to never stop looking to improve. But just saying things like "We will never win the CL with xxx" is a silly statement to make, when the player in question has shown that he can compete against top teams and top players, and come out on top.

4070~~~
Funny you should mention Matic.  Do you think Chelsea are happy with what he's brought to their team this season?

The one time we played Chelsea Fellaini was clearly the more influential CM on the day. 

Taking the season as a whole, the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/marouane_fellaini/126/126/466/38/p|premier_league/2014/2015/nemanja_matic/126/126/9284/0/p#attack_score/defence_score/total_score/pass_completion/goals_scored/tackles_won/aerial_duels_won_%/interceptions/blocks/clearances#avg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stats comparing the two of them make interesting reading</a>.

4071~~~
I didn't say we will never win, I said LvG will want to win and by doing so he will want better players, we will get them? Maybe, maybe not, obviously this summer we were looking at a couple of midfielders that we didn't get, so Felliani got another chance. 

Can we win the league with Felliani? absolutely but is he the top drawer midfielder that will make us a dominant team? Probably not. It's easy to get excited about the last few Felliani games, Christ I was singing his name as loud as anyone v Stoke, but lets not forget he hasn't regularly come out on top and in places last year looked completely out of his depth, especially in the Champs League.

4072~~~
For all the "philosophy" talk giving rise to visions of free-flowing football, Van Gaal employed Van Bommel at Bayern so he is not averse to the charms of a niggly, dirty, pain in the arse to play against type of player.  I am confident Fellaini will be here next season, especially as we will most likely have the additional CL games, even he is more of a squad player than first XI. Now Marouanne just needs to learn the secrets of Van Bommel's special immunity from being booked.

4073~~~
To be honest, I don't watch enough of Chelsea to know how good / bad Matic is, from what I have seen he is hit and miss (more hit than miss). I was just saying I want a midfielder in the Felliani role that can be dominant, he breaks play up very well but he is pretty one dimensional and other than set pieces / crosses (shudder thinking of Moyes) I can't imagine our opposition will be too worried and have to formulate a game plan to play him. 

He is good at what he does, but we need someone that can do more, I can't envisage he will be anything more than a very valuable squad player next year, which is no criticism of the player.

4074~~~
Agree with most of what you are saying.

What’s even more surprising was that we didn’t play 532/352. We played 514 with Rooney in a hybrid role. Surrendering the midfield nullifies most advantages of a back5. There is no way that the team will control the match with this lineup. Its inviting pressure and allows the opponent to control midfield.

I´d understand that lineup with blind, Fellaini and Herrera in midfield and Rooney and RvP upfront. When you win the ball you can either try to hit them on the break or slow down to build up cautiously with your wingbacks and midfielder pushing forward. Anyway. I hope LvG stops with this weird lineups.

4075~~~
Your original post was:


Whatever the case, Fellaini has proved a lot of people wrong so far this season and as far as I am concerned, long may it continue. LVG is a manager who has shown good man management skills and he strikes me as someone like SAF who will want to support and mentor players, almost like a father figure at times. I personally dont think he is going to go out and buy a Strootman and abandon Fellaini as soon as the opportunity presents itself. Fellaini has largely done well this season - he has had dodgy spells in the last two games (which I do believe is at least partially due to the role/system he is being asked to fill) but has generally improved as the games have gone on.

4076~~~
Right - Fellaini was in essence the only true midfielder for most of the match. I suspect that virtually any player would struggle in those circumstances.

The average formation map helps paint this picture;

4077~~~
I'm only talking about matches that have already happened.

4078~~~
Abandon isn't the right word as I think Fellaini will be kept as a squad player but LVG will definitely go out and buy a better player as soons as he can IMO, there is no need to persist with someone with Fellaini's limitations if you don't have to and as has been said previously Fellaini isn't good enough to start regularly in a team that wants to win the League and Champions League unless he improves dramatically.

4079~~~
Yeah, I'm worried he'll get a red sooner or later and it'll cost us. He's been very useful so far this season in all fairness but you know one incident like a red and he'll get some serious stick.

4080~~~
In the 1st half he was.

4081~~~
He's started every game since he returned from injury, when both Blind and Di Maria were fit.

4082~~~
It wasn't even the whole of the first half to be fair to him. As soon as we scored the whole team settled, including Fellaini.

4083~~~
As soon as we sign the Stroot say bye to Fellaini.

4084~~~
Strange post. We haven't signed Strootman, and Fellaini seems to be very much in LvG's plans. Sorry.

4085~~~
Again we have this "he isnt good enough for xx" mentality.

Warning: Actual statistics ahead.

With Fellaini starting every game and playing the full 90 minutes, we have won the last 6 games. Prior to that we lost against City (due to Smalling primarily) and drew against Chelsea. Prior to THAT, Fellaini came on for Herrera against West Brom and was largely agreed to have turned the game around, and scored a goal.

Basically, since Fellaini came into the team we have been doing very well, have broken back into the top four and have all but caught up with City and Chelsea. He has played 90 minutes in the last 8 games (not getting injured, might I add), we have won 6, drawn 1 and lost 1 (with the note that the two we didnt win being Chelsea and City).
Before Fellaini came into the team, we had won 3, drawn 2 and lost 3.

Lets be clear, I am not claiming that Fellaini is solely responsible for that difference, but it irks me when people are confidently proclaiming that he clearly isnt good enough, when in fact since he came into the team we have nearly doubled our points per game. This is in spite of the fact that the games he has played in include Chelsea, City, Arsenal and Liverpool!

4086~~~
I don't think he would start if Blind and Carrick are fit (at the same time) and we have a full complement on defenders (so Carrick can play in midfield)

4087~~~
Can't see LvG starting both Carrick and Blind in midfield. It's one or the other IMO.

4088~~~
I wouldn't be so sure, especially noting our inability to retain possession  (especially notable since Blinds injury)

4089~~~
Good point. Just an observation from looking at the stats, it's probably better to use the "per 90" metrics for this type of comparison - "average per game" penalizes players who come on as substitutes (or are substituted). It does, of course, make your point stronger.

4090~~~
Is keeping possession really as important as people think it is to LvG? I mean, if it was, Fellaini wouldn't be starting.

4091~~~
Fellaini is playing purely because of his height IMO. If Herrera was the same height as Fellaini he would be starting because he's a better footballer. It's important to have tall players in the team like Fellaini, Carrick, Smalling, van Persie, Jones etc which makes it easier to defend against set pieces.

4092~~~
According to what he said after the Liverpool game yes.

"I am very satisfied with the result but still I think we can improve," said Van Gaal. "We gave a lot of unnecessary balls away and because of that Liverpool also had chances to score a goal.

"We had a lot of space in the second half and we could have played the ball very easily but nevertheless we gave the ball away and that is not good. I shall ask the players tomorrow [Monday] why"

Oops. My bad. Here's the "per 90" <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/marouane_fellaini/126/126/466/38/p|premier_league/2014/2015/nemanja_matic/126/126/9284/0/p#attack_score/defence_score/total_score/pass_completion/goals_scored/tackles_won/aerial_duels_won_%/interceptions/blocks/clearances#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">metrics</a> for anyone who's interested.

4094~~~
Yeah I agree. He did improve a fair bit in the second half.

4095~~~
I think we are odds on to sign the Stroot and when that occurs Fellaini will be on his way, if not sooner.
Not sure what you find so strange about that, sorry.

4096~~~
Doesnt that have more to do with Carrick's reintegration into the side?
He has been magnificent this season.

4097~~~
Fellaini is starting because Herrera hasn't done enough to earn his place. And Fellaini has played these last games in a very defensive role which gives him a bit too much responsibility in playmaking for my liking, but due to his better defending I can see why he's preferred to Herrera whose simple passing has been far from impressive and who's physically weak.

Height plays no role, Smalling, Carrick, RVP and even Fellaini play because Van Gaal thinks they're the best options we have in their respective positions. Physical ability might play some role, but I believe the best players will play and Herrera's lack of game time is caused by him not showing his footballing skills frequently, not by his lack of strenght.

4098~~~
You give all the stats your want to be honest but I still don't think he is good enough, this is still a patched up and makeshift side, I don't think we are anywhere near the finished article and once we are I don't think Fellaini will be part of it in terms of starting games. Like it or not he has his limitations that's why Moyes was the only manager who was prepared to pay his buyout clause, anyone who can't admit that and see that there are better options is just kidding themselves.

I don't think people should be so sensitive saying he isn't good enough to play for a top side is fair enough as far as I am concerned, if he proves otherwise then great but I don't think it's really a criticism to say he is no better than a squad player because I can't think of any top European side where he would get in the team.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Pretty sure some betting companies suspended betting on Thiago to us, and others in the past. Garay was odds on to join us for about four transfer windows in a row! It's quite strange. Strootman's not a United player. Fellaini is. And he's a started our last eight games.

4100~~~
So as soon as we play a team of dwarves Herrera will get his chance. 
Good to know.

4101~~~

"The stats say this is true but I still won't accept it"
That sort of logic is used by people who refuse to believe in Gravity or evolution. 

You say that if he can prove otherwise then great, yet all the figures show that he IS proving otherwise, but there are people who still just say he is shite and needs to be sold.

My question to either of you two or anyone else of the opinion that "he isn't good enough" is can you find a single piece of evidence to back it up?

4103~~~
What is there to suggest he is good enough? If we are going on recent performances then he comes up short and I don't think what he did at Everton suggests he is good enough. I think he is a good player if you set up your team to use his attributes and are prepared to overlook his short comings but if he is being asked to distribute the ball and occupy a position in a team that wants to move the ball quickly and play possession football he just doesn't have the skill set required.

I don't see why he has to be brilliant or terrible I think just say what he is a good player for a midtable side but a squad player for a top side. I think if he was a good DM he would be an asset anywhere but no really top side wants someone with his passing, first touch and positional ability playing as an attacking midfielder or box to box player and they are his best positions. The best sides want to dominate possession and playing someone with his ability in those positions makes it harder to do that,he has other skills but I don't think compensate enough at the highest level.

4104~~~
United have played Chelsea and City and Fellaini played well in those games. If you're worried about the Barcas and Bayerns then that's next seasons issue (hopefully) and maybe you get your wish and Fellaini is banished from the club.

But everyone throwing wobblers and calling him "a sack of shit" (according to the last match thread) might as well save their bile. He's plenty good enough for the PL. Van Gaal can re-arrange the squad for CL hopefully next summer if he thinks he needs to.

4105~~~
That's the kind of reaction that is just pointless, I haven't said banish him I have just said he isn't quite good enough and I dont think there is any proof otherwise, yeah he did well in those games but he wasn't great against Southampton or liverpool and I don't think assessing him over such a short period proves anything either way. 

I don't think how we are playing now is how LVG wants us playing, he is sending a team out to get results just like he did in the World Cup, over time he will want to implement a different style based on keeping the ball much better and as that progresses I see Fellaini losing out because he doesn't fit well enough into that style of football, maybe he will prove otherwise but I don't see anything in his career so far to suggest that.

4106~~~
Agree. If we are being honest, our upturn in form Fellaini has played more than a significant contribution.

4107~~~
Screw that, I've already got a fiver on him scoring the winning goal in the Champion's League final next season and I've got a good record on these bets so...

4108~~~
Well mate I have just given you a bunch of stats about how much better we, as a team have been doing since Fellaini came into the side. ESPECIALLY if you consider the opposition we have faced before/after.

Of course if you want to believe that this is pure coincidence then that is your business, but honestly it is pretty weak logic.

Recently <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> gave stats comparing Fellaini with fan-favourite Herrera, showing Fellaini rating higher in most categories.

On the other hand you (and others) are just repeating your same opinions with nothing at all to back it up except "I am entitled to my opinion! Stop repressing me!"

I was the first person to say yesterday that he didn't suit the position and role he was being asked to play against Liverpool and Southampton, but constant claims that he isn't good enough and should be sold/replaced at the earliest opportunity are just tiresome, as well as being completely contrary to what the stats suggest.

4109~~~
Actually the stats I posted showed him higher than Matic in most categories. He's only better than Hererra in some, mainly defensive, categories.

4110~~~
This run owes a lot more to carrick and de gea than fellaini and what about people like young and Valencia they have done well so should we accept them as first team players now? Your argument seems to rely more on the results of the team rather fellaini as an individual so I don't think you have put forward any argument. Carrick started six games and we won all of them, he has also played well in all the games I don't think the same applies to fellaini.

I also think stats are misleading because it doesn't take everything into account, someone like Leon Britton has had stats comparable in terms of passing on the same level as xavi but he isnt as good a player. I really don't see the problem with saying he has done well but we should be looking for someone better because he is lacking In key areas of his game.

It's just blatant that fellaini can't play as a dm, he can't play in a two man midfield and if you play him in a three man midfield you are sacrificing your ability to maintain possession and move the ball quickly, it's not a huge issue now in our current stare but going forward it will be no matter what stats you come up with. If strootman had of been fit in the summer fellaini was gone, if he is available next summer I think LVG will buy him and fellaini will be a sub, if that is far fetched to you fair enough.

To be honest i find the whole exaggeration of Fellaini's performances and ability and the constant throwing toys out the pram every time a counter argument is put forward just as tiresome.

4111~~~
Yeah, but don't let reality get in the way of a nice sounding "Fellaini is really good, you were all wrong" narrative.

4112~~~
Well mate, you are saying that I am putting no argument forward, but its infinitely more than your side of the argument which is purely based around "I dont like Fellaini" and "He isnt good enough". Personally I am (and have this entire thread) just been trying to have a reasoned debate and discussion - if anyone is throwing their toys out of the pram, then in my opinion it is in the anti-Fellaini crowd who seem to hang around this thread like vultures, waiting with baited breath for the instant he puts a foot wrong so that they can pounce like a pack of hungry hyenas (Too many analogies? Maybe...). Fellaini was arguably MotM against Chelsea and in our top three performances in several other games, but there is still a significant crowd on here with whom it seems like praising Fellaini is akin to gnawing their own arms off.

I completely agree and even said originally that Fellaini was not solely responsible for our upturn in fortunes. I have also said that he isnt suited to a DM role in a 3-5-2 (not sure why the 3-5-2 needs that role in the first place frankly, but there you go). Carrick has made a big difference as well for sure. But the bottom line is that LVG has trusted Fellaini, given him a chance, and obviously continues to play him. It is reasonable to infer from that that LVG has in fact been quite pleased with his performances and what he is bringing to the team. Interestingly enough, LVG - unlike the fans - was not here last season so is perhaps seeing Fellaini (and others, to be fair) with a fresh set of eyes, a clean slate without the mess of last season hanging over him. Maybe, just maybe he has come in with an unbiased view and actually values Fellaini's contributions, which is more than a lot of the fans seem to be able to do.

Its the innate anti-Fellaini bias that I cannot stand. And yes, it really is an exceptional case. Watching the game (vs Valencia I think it was) in pre-season when Fellaini got boos/ironic cheers every time he got the ball as soon as he was brought on. He in fact was our best player after coming on, and scored a last minute equaliser if memory serves. The treatment he got then was disgusting and one my lowest points as a United fan, I was genuinely embarrassed and angry.
I look at some of the people on here and what they have written about Fellaini and it wouldnt surprise me if they were in the crowd that game - the level of vitriol is worse than I have seen with any other player. Even with Rooney and his transfer request saga(s).

The above paragraph does not apply to every single poster on here of course, but to a decent amount it does. And then people starting piping up about old Walrus and the Fellaini-fan-club who say he can do no wrong. Its pathetic, and for me it only helps prove the fact that when all statistical evidence fails, resort to trying to discredit the "opposition" (ie the pro-Fellaini crowd).

I have tried to provide some actual stats backing up my argument. You can argue that they are not watertight and that there are other factors for why we have improved - but if you dont think that the introduction of Fellaini is one of those factors, you are kidding yourself. I have yet to see even any attempt from the haters to back up their "Not good enough" claims - just the same regurgitated insults thrown at me/"Fellaini Fan Club", and statements of how as soon as Strootman becomes available Fellaini will be a goner.

This is an example of what I was describing.

Apologies then.

4113~~~
Not suited to DM, not good enough to be a regular centre midfielder for Manchester United.

4114~~~
As I said this winning run owes a lot to the likes of Carrick and De Gea with a number of others (including Fellaini) having played a part in it, I don’t know what you are getting annoyed about very few people not just on this forum but anywhere will ever agree with you because he has and always will be a limited but effective player, I have no dislike for him in the slightest but you only have to watch him play to realise that he is severely lacking in some key areas required to play at the highest level week in week out. He can be a good squad player but that is his ceiling, if he wants to play every game he would have to go back to a club like Everton.

Fellaini has played in the 6 wins but he has been dire in the first half of the last two games, good and average in patches in other games and 6 out of 10 overall I would say, when he first came into the side he did well but we still only picked up two draws and a defeat. If you want to go overboard with praise fair enough but I don’t see anything there to suggest LVG will be rubbing his hands together at the thought of making him an integral part of the team in the long term because he doesn’t have to make do he can go and buy a better player.

Final point I will make is if you want to do some comparisons and look at actual stats then compare Fellaini and what he offers or doesn’t offer to other players who play in a similar position and think about the type of football we will eventually play under LVG. Don’t compare him with Matic because he plays a holding role and we have seen recently you don’t need stats to see who is the better player there, compare him with Fabregas or Toure or numerous others playing at good teams all over Europe who play in a similar position to where Fellaini has been playing. I am not going to get into who is better or worse but if you look at the gulf in terms of passing and technical ability it underlines my point I don’t think any top manager or team would have Fellaini in their first team because what he brings to the team doesn’t compensate for what you sacrifice by playing him.

Anyway that should probably be the end of it now because we won’t really know what LVG thinks until everyone is fit and we see what happens in the next two transfer windows.

4115~~~
Well, if you value stats that much, then here... (Warning: Actual statistics ahead.)

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi62.tinypic.com/2irsoxk.jpg" src="http://oi62.tinypic.com/2irsoxk.jpg"/>

I still don't think numbers that can be manipulated anyway you want to support your logic are a decisive evidence that should end any discussion, but if you see it so then I guess this Fellaini vs Herrera discussion is over.

4116~~~
Those attack/defence/total scores are impossible to interpret. Much better off looking at stats for specific events.

4117~~~
I'm guessing they're still based upon attacking and defensive contributions, but then again your mind's pretty much made up on this debate anyway, so...

4118~~~
I don't think Fellaini is keeping Herrera out of the side, it doesn't have to be one or the other, both of them can play in the same side, that Herrera isn't playing now is the choice of the manager. He was given a chance and he took it, and the coach has kept him in the side ever since. Fellaini isn't stellar or anything fantastic, but he does add something - in a physical sense, and he's quite good at winning the ball. I suspect LVG wants someone who can do this, and Fellaini hasn't done badly in that regard. Let's stop acting as if we've not had players like Oshea, Alan Smith, Brown, even Fletcher starting for our first XI, the thinking that a player has to be world class to start for a top team is flawed, the big Fella isn't world class by any means, but he's in the team on merit these days and I suspect he's being told to do a job of which we don't have anyone else to do. So, I wish people would just stop the Herrera comparison, they are different players and though Herrera is obviously better, I don't think it does him justice to ask him to do the dirty job in midfield, it limits his skill set. Fellaini on the other hand has the skill set to do the dirty job and that's why he's in the team.

4119~~~
I will say that Fellaini has played against tougher opposition than Herrera this season. Having said that, I'm surprised to see Herrera so far ahead in those statistics.

4120~~~
What debate? Bit rude to accuse me of having my mind made up about something without saying what the hell it is I've apparently already decided.

4121~~~
Do you know exactly how those stats are calculated? You shouldn't use them if you don't.

4122~~~
All those names you list are squad players sure they had runs in the team but they never really elevated themselves to players who were guaranteed to start and I would put Fellaini in that category.

I agree you dont need world class players in every position but look around at the top sides in Europe and they are stacked full of quality in midfield, that is the one area of the pitch where an emphasis is placed on top quality in every position and why they are able dominate possession and win more often that not against English sides, we aren't near that level yet so Fellaini has his place but if we start to improve it's almost guaranteed he will be phased out of the starting line up.

LVG will have learnt two things from fellaini this season, firstly he can use him in the squad and secondly if Strootman gets himself fit he is more of a priority signing than ever because someone who can add physicality and pass the ball a lot better will be a huge asset in the premier league.

I don't think that is a criticism of Fellaini, like a number of others he will play his part but realistically in the summer two or three players are going to be brought in to improve the first eleven to try and take the team to the next level he won't be alone in being more of a squad player going forward.

4123~~~
Herrera vs Fellaini. Since that's what the stats comparison was about I thought that was obvious.

4124~~~
Aye, well you seemed to have missed something rather obvious too.

4125~~~
Such a poor first half on Sunday. Just shocking. At half time I actually said we were winning despite him. His passing was completely shit, his efforts to win the ball back were clumsy and mistimed and his inability to deal with being pressed (both against Southampton and Liverpool) is a real cause for concern. He needs to take a touch and decide what to do and when he isn't given the time and space to do that it means possession is lost far too easily.

The past few games have highlighted his limitations - which most of us knew anyway. He's ok for certain jobs in certain games but he can be terrible outside of that.

4126~~~
No mention of the second half?

4127~~~
Slightly better, as the game grew out of Liverpool's reach.

4128~~~
He was considerably better but like you've stated Liverpool had more or less given up and thrown in the towel by this point. I watched the game again and it wasn't the entire first half in which he was shocking in, more like the first 20-30 mins or so. He got markedly better as the game progressed. Not downplaying the fact that he was shite for some periods in both these games but kudos to him for bouncing back at least.

I guess his poor showings have a lot to do with Southampton and Liverpool's early high intensity games which tend to progressively fade away. He's limited technically and doesn't deal well with being pressed. Tbf to him most of the team shat their pants as well.

His passing doesn't inspire confidence at all and I don't think he should be a first choice midfielder from next season onwards. We should look to get a more all round physical presence if we truly want to improve in midfield. In saying that, he has deserved his place in the first team so far on the basis of his decent performances and he's the only player who really offers any kind of physicality and ability to cause disruption in midfield.

4129~~~
That's exactly what am saying. He does a job and is very useful, once people understand this, they'll stop expecting him to be Busquets or Xavi. I'm not sure about Strootman, he'll have to prove his fitness first, then recapture his form before we even think about it, and even then, if we want an absolute world class CM, there's a better one in Italy that we should be pulling out all stops for. But that's for another day.

4130~~~
Not sure he should be advertising this before the starting XI is announced, mind.

4131~~~
A United without Fellaini, we better win, otherwise people will think we lost because Fellaini wasn't playing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4132~~~
nothing wrong with that, LVG said in the presser yesterday that Fellainin was ill and not in the squad for the Villa game

4133~~~
Love him or hate him hes really imposed himself in midfield the last 6+ games.

4134~~~
Going to be strange not seeing Fellaini in the team. He's arguably been our most consistent outfield player over the last 7/8 games. He also provides us with a great balance.

4135~~~
In term of performances or presence ?

4136~~~
Both

4137~~~
I am certain we will win today without Fellaini. Villa have been/are shite, have 8 players unavailable and we are on a great run of form. The likes of Herrera should have a field day against this lot.

4138~~~
under normal circumstances, but he has this match fixing stuff in his head.

4139~~~
Well then I guess it is up to LVG to decide whether Herrera is in the right frame of mind for the game. Personally I would expect him to be fine though, he (Herrera) certainly hasnt seemed at all concerned by all this match fixing stuff in his social media posts.

4140~~~
Some people will look for any reason to bash the lad. Lvg already confirmed he wasn't playing.

4141~~~
<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

4142~~~
Might have stopped their goal

4143~~~
We missed the "sack of shit" that was supposedly holding us back.

4144~~~
Games like this are why we miss him when he's not in the team. His presence at set-pieces could've been the difference today, even as an impact sub.

4145~~~
Or won some balls in the middle.

4146~~~
ouch!

4147~~~
He wouldn't have had any bearing on the result, we didn't win because we didn't do anything with all of the possession we had and he passes it as slowly and as sideways as the rest, we weren't bullied or out-muscled either.

4148~~~
Yes, yes and more yes.

Fellaini wouldn't have done anything to change the actual game plan we have. Said it time and time again, you need players like Silva/Aguero/Nasri who constantly move and pick up positions to play a possession based game in the PL. Teams are happy to sit back and give us the ball because we're so static they know we wont hurt them...

4149~~~
I think you cursed it...

4150~~~
If you've really taken notice of him, you'll find that he's actually done this alot more this season. But yes, we require a new playmaker instead of Mata. Really unfortunate that our injuries held us back. Blind, Afro, Ander were all out while ADM was coming back unfit.

4151~~~
Yes, he is very good with his back to goal releasing players but I don't think it would have helped much today because everyone was just so slow at moving around. Guess they were still feeling the effects of that post-Liverpool party.

4152~~~
What? I never said anything about playing with his back to goal. Go rewatch entire games of us so far with him. Watch him closely. He has gotten way better at not only breaking up play and holding the ball, but at finding pockets of space in midfield and making himself an outlet for the short pass as well as making offensive runs.

4153~~~
The short passing is what I mean. I can't say I've noticed him driving with the ball but I've definitely seen him receive the ball with his back facing goal and play somebody in.

4154~~~
Needed him to nick the ball. Delph gave our CM the run around.

4155~~~
We also put a lot of crosses in...

4156~~~
I'd agree with this. His absence shouldn't have made such a big difference, and others should stand up and be counted for but with the amount of attacking players we were getting turned over quite often when Villa nicked the ball. 

Fellaini in the side has made us more compactful and this is probably more important at this moment then it will ever be where we're playing wingers as wing backs, defenders in and out and an attacking unit still not fully clicked.

4157~~~
Lol apologies guys! Shouldn't have said it, as it has now come true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Still think if Herrera was fit to play ahead of Fletch, we wouldn't be missing Marouane too much.

4158~~~
Falcao and RvP are more than capable of heading them as well.

4159~~~
Aye and Villa were set up to deal with them. Put someone like Fellaini in the box who is good at causing trouble and we'll get more chances.

4160~~~
You really think we would not have had a better chance of winning the game with Fellaini starting instead of Fletcher? I mean Fletcher was by far our worst player and on top of that Fellaini is our most threatening player at set pieces.

4161~~~
Well then how about LvG uses the two #10's and Di Maria to open up some chances on the floor for our strikers? Trying to cite the absence of one player for that result is wrong, if we now actually rely on Fellaini to beat teams like Aston Villa we are fecked.

You could say the same with Blind or Herrera in place of Fletcher, my point was that this notion that if Fellaini or either of the other 2 started we would have won is simplistic and wrong. If anything Herrera was the bigger miss as he quickens up our passing in the final third and would have added the dynamism we lacked with Mata up there. However what we had on should have gotten the job done, player A, B C being missing is no excuse.

4162~~~
wow...look at the theads last season about Fellaini....everyone was catatonic about getting rid of him....hated him...now, he's like...well..someone we need? Fickle fans eh?

4163~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

4164~~~
We probably missed Herrera's creativity and pass-move game more than Fellaini's defensive gameplay today, given that we were screaming for some incisiveness and impetus with the possession we had. 

That said, Fellaini should return to the team when he recovers.

4165~~~
oh ok ok...not everyone....<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4166~~~
You said that Fellaini starting would not have made a difference today and to me that sounded that you think that Fellaini would not have made a bigger impact on the game than Fletcher managed to have. Fellaini has been one of our best players since he came back from his injury and to think that he would not have been able to make bigger impact than Fletcher today is just ridiculous.

4167~~~
Overall I don't think how poor Fletcher was for one half made any difference, we dominated the second half and created nothing, that had nothing to do with who was in the holding role as Carrick was there for the 30 minutes of ball possession against ten men we had. We didn't suffer from not having a more physical player in midfield, we suffered because Di Maria and Mata created nothing up front for our strikers, if we'd been bullied out of the game then I'd agree he was a miss, but we weren't and he wasn't.

4168~~~
To be fair, what Fellaini has been good at, breaking up play etc wasn't exactly what we needed today. What he hasn't been good at however, inventive passing, moving the ball forward quickly etc is what we were lacking today.
However I'm sure he would have been 10 times better than Fletcher

4169~~~
If you take the worst player out of a team and replaces him with a better player the team will have a better chance of winning the game, at least that is how I see it. Today had we been able to play Fellaini instead of Fletcher I think we would have had a better chance of winning the game, the same goes for Blind and Herrera also they are all better players than Fletcher. For me Blind is the best of those three in that deep laying midfielder role and it should be him or Carrick who starts in that position.

4170~~~
We chucked a load of crosses in. The big man in there would of been good for that sort of thoughtless football.

4171~~~
This would be true if the role the worst player was playing in had any affect on the result, but today it didn't. We didn't win the game because the trio of Mata, Di Maria and Rooney didn't create enough in the final 3rd, it had nothing to do with who was playing in the deeper CM role.

4172~~~
For me all eleven players have an effect on the result, for example Fellaini might have been able to do a better job marking Benteke at the Villa goal or he could have scored at one of our set pieces. the point is had he not been ill he would have made a bigger impact on the game than Fletcher did and thus we would have had a better chance of winning.

4173~~~
How times have changed. We missed Fellaini today. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4174~~~
The simple fact of the matter is despite whatever people can say about limitations, not being good enough, poor style of play or whatever else... Our points per game with Fellaini playing 90 minutes is far higher than without, and we have played tougher opposition with him than without. Call it coincidental if you like but we won the last 6 games, today Fellaini didn't play and we drew against a poor team.

4175~~~
We hardly missed Fellaini. Villa neutralised our midfield by narrowing the field. There was simply no room for Mata and Rooney to operate. We simply drew the game due to not reverting to 4-4-2 and bringing on wingers earlier in the game.

4176~~~
I think he'd have helped, Villa didnt look the best when we crossed and from our set pieces and he'd have been someone else would could put on Benteke from corners, keeping him well away from Evans

4177~~~
I am basing this on MotD highlights but Benteke bullied our defence. Fellaini would definitely have helped in that regard.

4178~~~
Fellaini is Matthäus compared to the current Fletcher.

4179~~~
I doubt he would've stopped Evans getting steamrolled by Benteke.

4180~~~
If Fellaini play in our next game, and we win; can we all agree that his importance to our play shouldn't be questioned?

4181~~~
He is an important player for United. I thought about our team today when Villa had set-pieces. I don't think we had one single player that would be considered a big, strong player. Evans isn't that tall, nor is Jones. We struggled in the air and in those duels inside the box. Get Smalling back and have Fellaini there, and we are much tougher in both attack and defense at set-pieces. Also, Fellaini is quite good at keeping the ball in midfield.

4182~~~
Yup. Without him in today, couldn't help but thinking how our team look like a bunch of pussies against a determine Villa side.

4183~~~
He looked the same against Southampton so its not quite that simple

4184~~~
Did he help Evans from getting completely bullied by Balotelli against Liverpool? Balotelli had several clear shots on goal when he came on. Wanyama bullied Fellaini against Southampton. His physicality is vastly overrated. He's just a tall guy with good chest control and average physicality which is shown for what it is when he's up against genuinely physical players.

4185~~~
Are we talking about the same guy who's been giving the ball away for fun in his last two games? He redeemed himself in the closing stages of those games, but he started them poorly, losing the ball and giving it away, he was even punished for this when Southampton scored off his poor pass directly to one of their midfielders.

4186~~~
Obviously it is still possible for opponents to get chances against us, especially when our defenders are being idiots. I am not going to get drawn into another endless debate of subjective opinions because there is no point, suffice to say that Fellaini has shown plenty of times over his career and plenty of times for us, that he is very capable of physically dominating a match. We saw it when he bullied our midfield/defense as an Everton player, we have seen it in the way he very rarely gets tackled or pushed off the ball where other players would do.

4187~~~
He's average physically. Its funny that people still have to mention that game against us when he was an Everton player two seasons ago. Every time he's come up against a fellow physically imposing player like Toure or Wanyama he's come up desperately short, even against smaller players. He's definitely made some good contributions, but lets not make him something he's not.

4188~~~
I think he would have helped. Defensively he would have been better marking Benteke than Evans. People can bash Fellaini's physicality all they want but he would have put in a better effort than Evans. Also when we were chasing the win he would have been handy up front.

4189~~~
He's perfect for those tough away games where you'd expect to get a little pegged back, but I'd still have Herrera and Di Maria over him when we're playing a bottom half team at home. 

Bit cliché but there was a Fellaini-shaped hole in the team today. Stupid illnesses.

4190~~~
Not really. That isn't the way football works.

4191~~~
Our defence was bullied in most previous games Fellaini played.

4192~~~
We weren't having trouble holding the ball as such, it was actually doing something dangerous with it when we got it. For a big guy Fellaini can get bullied with the best of them. Yes he would have been of help if it meant Fletcher didn't play, but he wasn't what was missing today. Mata and DiMaria are not creative to me, they are the recipients of other peoples creativity.

4193~~~
We had numerous corners in a row and our centre halfs were nowhere near them. Fellaini provides a threat both attacking and defending set pieces.

4194~~~
So why has he only scored one goal all season from a cross of any kind? Yes I do think he would have given them something to think about. It is academic as he was ill.

4195~~~
He tends to take their best header with him to pick him up. Plus he does pose a threat (RVPs Chelsea game came of him also)

4196~~~
Would the quality of the crosses coming in have been of any use to him yesterday? As he was ill we will never know. If he was available he would probably have played. I think people are forgetting that he wasn't actually dropped.

4197~~~
Tadpole I know he was ill I was just saying that we missed him. Nothing more nothing less. Same as Smalling but to a lesser extent.

4198~~~
He's good at retaining the ball, awful at passing, especially sideways. Agreed?

4199~~~

4200~~~
When's he back. I miss the big man.

4201~~~
Clearly missed against Villa, and will be tomorrow too.....

4202~~~
Retaining the ball generally means helping the team to retain the ball. He's not good at that at all. He's good at <i>holding up</i> the ball.

4203~~~
I don't think you can have good ball retention if you are a bad passer...

4204~~~
Yes you can. (Stats wise)

4205~~~
Yeah ball retention is just about making a safe choice, which in Fellaini's case is often to shield the ball and turn backwards away from pressure and find a safe pass. On a good day that keeps the ball very well, but is the opposite of progress and making avenues to attack

4206~~~
When is he back?

4207~~~
Has anyone else noticed this trend of LVG telling us 'player x has picked up a little knock or caught a slight cold' and then it turns into a month or two off because of injury? It's gotten to the point where when he says something like that, it would be more unpredictable if the player actually ended up not injured. Bringing me to next point, if it's in order to confuse other teams; surely it's past the point now where it's clever as I'm sure every manager with a brain out there has caught on to this.

So that begs the question; Why? I'm not going to accuse LVG of being an idiot, because he is anything but that. However it is incredibly frustrating and I am slowly losing my patience as to why he cannot just assess our injury situation honestly. Another thing I've noticed is even when he does admit they're injured, we don't seem to have any clear indication as to when players actually return. He consistently lies about the time it will take for them to come back. Either that, or whoever is giving him the information is completely and utterly inept.

4208~~~
Not really no.

4209~~~
I remember your username simply from all the times you have disagreed with one of my posts. You're telling me you haven't noticed the constant underestimation of a lot of our players injuries when they are first announced?

For the record, we had a long debate in Summer about Rooney where I was of the opinion he was past it and thought we should have sold him on. You disagreed were completely correct in that regard and I'm happy to eat my words on that matter. Something isn't right about the information we are being fed regarding our absentees however. I may be exaggerating or it may be purely down to coincidence but our injuries do seem to end up being a lot worse than what we are told originally; for whatever reason.

4210~~~
We've been unlucky with injuries and it's natural to get frustrated and look for people to be frustrated with but I don't think Van Gaal should be one of those people - if any such people exist.

Maybe it would be better if you listed the specific cases because off the top of my head I only think of Herrera but then I have been drinking all day.

Also maybe we shouldn't discuss this in the Fellaini thread.

4211~~~
It's our medical staff who tells LVG how long they expect the players to be out, LVG has nothing to do with it he only tell us what they tell him. If the players are out for longer then expected it's the medical department that should be blamed not LVG.

4212~~~
I understand that. But my whole point is that I think LVG may be lying about the recovery times on purpose, for whatever reason.

4213~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4214~~~
The injuries are frustrating regardless of if the media are informed or not. By the way he's not hiding his honest assessment from "us" as we don't get a Q&A sessions with him. And I haven't noticed him lying in any of the media in post or pre match interviews. Maybe it's just you? 
 I would suggest he gives the information he has available at the time he is asked.

4215~~~
When we start Fellaini I always feel like we're playing with a weakened squad, but I really like the idea of having him come off the bench to button things down or chase the late cross on goal.

4216~~~
Injury recovery times are unpredictable...it's not a computer game.

I hope Fellaini is back soon.

4217~~~
Not sure why you still feel that way. We crushed Liverpool with him, drew 10-man AV without him.

4218~~~
We drew with Chelsea and lost against City with him in the team.

4219~~~
I agree with it. Think he gives us an extra avenue when we square up against the big guns or are desperate towards the end of matches. Against the lesser sides I would not pair him up with Carrick or Blind and he cannot replace them, so I would start someone with more attacking intent even if it does mean that we sometimes give the ball away while trying more risky passes in the opponent half.

4220~~~
The problem with that style is that yes he can get by in a match using the ball like (turn away from pressure, find teammate and dont lose the ball) that but as a concequence the rest of the team needs to use the ball better than he is.

You can't have 2 CMs just turning away from pressure and finding high percentage backwards and square passes, because you'd never get the ball down the other end of the pitch. In my opinion its an overcelebrated contribution when Fellaini has played like that and things like his fast release pass to Di Maria a few weeks ago are needed a couple of times per match to make up for it.

In fact thats what I enjoy about Carrick and Blind as defensive midfield players, they are always capable and likely to play a good pass into the front players when its on. They dont just turn away from trouble and play the safe pass all the time like physical defensive midfielders tend to, like Fellaini, Tiote, Wanyama and so on. That makes your team predictable and easier to defend against because you either dont need to put pressure on that player (he's never likely to hurt you) or alternatively you can put lots of pressure on that player and he'll spend the game disrupting your attacks or getting the ball pinched by 2 players hunting him down with a high pressure style

4221~~~
Chelsea's a tad bit better than Aston Villa and we lost to City due to a red card.

4222~~~
This is what I hate the most about our players, some are even more guilty than others (Mata, Fletcher when he plays, Fellaini, Valencia). I know I mentioned more than CMs but it's like our players are so focused on keeping the ball, they lose any will of moving forward and playing positively.

4223~~~
If we're gonna have Fellaini in midfield passing back to the defence, we'd might as well play Carrick as a CB.

4224~~~
This post has to be a windup.

4225~~~
It was clear he was missed against Villa, and will be even more so against a very combative Newcastle midfield. He offers the best defensive cover than any other midfielder in the club, and he creates real problems to defences from set pieces.

4226~~~
Just get him ready for Stoke.

4227~~~
Just sell him in January and buy someone who offers something more than bullying and looking dangerous (despite not being) at set pieces.

4228~~~
Another training injury. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

4229~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2888335/Marouane-Fellaini-miss-Manchester-United-s-clash-Tottenham-Sunday-rib-injury.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ited-s-clash-Tottenham-Sunday-rib-injury.html</a>
The Mail don't say anything about it being broken and say that it was suffered in the Liverpool game, not training.

4230~~~
So he went from being ill (sharing the Belgian flu with Adnan) to having a broken rib?

Wtf is going on.

4231~~~
great

4232~~~
Means more Fletcher it seems.

4233~~~
You know what our players are like with freak injuries. He probably just sneezed.

4234~~~
An excessive amount of coughing fractured a rib.

4235~~~
*Darren Fletcher intensifies*

4236~~~
That Rooney fella has been doing pretty decent in midfield I hear

4237~~~
Defensive midfielder though, somebody to play behind Mata and Rooney. God knows if we can allow ourselves to rest Michael like we did after odd 60 minutes against Nouveauchateau. Our next game is on the first of January, Carras could not be rested enough to play against Stoke which will leave us with one option.

4238~~~
I'm really not sure he needed to repeat the "injury" trick from the summer ahead of this transfer window - nobody wants him to leave this time round <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

But seriously, if it is another training injury then how many is that from the 43+ total injuries we've had this season? Di Maria, Rafael, Falcao have definitely had training injuries; Jones as well? Must be a significant enough number to perhaps cause some questions to be asked about the approach to training sessions?

4239~~~
This. Is. Ridiculous.

I've stopped paying attention to preliminary reports of injuries/illnesses because in every case it seems that players miss more time than originally reported.  Fletcher cannot be used anymore as a #6, and Carrick can't play every game-but the cupboard is bare as I don't see Herrara as a #6. Blind needs to get healthy--fast.

4240~~~
Herrera, Fellaini

Never seen two broken ribs in one season

These players are really fragile

Vinnie Jones, Duncan Ferguson...never had this kind of injuries

4241~~~
I'd rather we played him in one position, but if Smalling and Evans are fit, then maybe Jones... I'll take it over Fletcher.

4242~~~

4243~~~
Real shame for the big man. He's been playing well.

As soon as our defenders seem to slowly return, about £120 million worth of the midfield goes down the pan. Frustrating.

4244~~~
Ah. Thanks. Reinforcements are arriving. Let's hope the kid's up to it.

4245~~~
if Pereira cant get a game, why should Powell

4246~~~
Should have find the replacement for Carrick long time ago, I say this for couple of seasons, we mainly need defensive minded midfielder. Blind is decent but not world class, Carrick soon 34.. We should never depend on the two, hope we find someone in the transfer market in the summer. Strootman may be the option as van Gaal played him as no6 for some time and yeah we still have Ben Pearson waiting for his chance, actually he is the perfect type of player for the job but perhaps van Gaal doesnt think he is physically ready yet. Mentally looks ahead of anyone there

4247~~~
I feel the opposite, when Fellaini ain't playing I feel we will get bullied in midfield!

4248~~~
Broken rib? Our guys must be running an underground fight club in Carrington.

4249~~~
wtf ? Again another training injury ? Just imagining the kinda force needed to get a broken rib... Another coincidence ?

4250~~~
City hammered us till the red card

4251~~~
No. Just pointing out that selecting two matches which we lost to prove that a player played poorly can be used for any player. If you cannot read what I responded to, it's your issue and not mine

4252~~~
Really is a strange coincidence that Ander was out with a broken rob as well, although his injury happened during the game iirc.

4253~~~
Is Ander at-least back or he suffered something too.

It is just amazing. Our defenders come back but then 3 of our midfielders get injured (with Blind who got injured before, it is 4).

When they wil eventually return, well it is time for Rooney, RVP and Falcao to get injured.

4254~~~
LVG mentioned that he is ill. Really, how long can someone stay sick for?

4255~~~
It's amazing how people can't accept that footballers can get sick.

4256~~~
Since he's injured, 2 draws and 1 win against Newcastle, Villa, and Spurs.

4257~~~
We need some of the midfielders back especially Fellaini for the Stoke game. We clearly looked knackered in the 2nd half against Spurs.

4258~~~
Problem is, Fellaini is a foul machine.  I'm all for toughness up and down the spine, but I don't like the idea of giving up free kicks in dangerous positions, as Fellaini is wont to do.

The man's best use is up front, marauding into the penalty box searching for well delivered crosses.

4259~~~
Yeah I thought he'd have been very useful for us in the second half against Spurs when their front three were really pressing our center backs and we adopted the hoof it strategy

4260~~~
There's no doubt we missed him against Spurs. Especially because he's a running machine and would have easily coped with the reduced recovery time

4261~~~
3 yellows in 11 apps isnt really the definition of a foul machine

4262~~~
I wrote "foul machine", not "yellow card machine".

4263~~~
Ah....my apologies, didnt interpret it properly

4264~~~
No worries.  It was a reasonable interpretation.

3 bookings in 11 appearances is actually a bit much, anyway.  And he gets away with elbows to the head that should be booked.  Marouane is a bit of a dirty fekker, truth be told.

But now that we've got that out of the way, he has put in some very tidy shifts this season and created a bit of havoc for opponents.  I put him down in the "important squad man" camp, right next to Valencia and Young.  Too good to ignore, but not good enough to regularly start for a legitimate trophy winning side.

4265~~~
Seem to be getting injury updates about every player apart from Afroman. What's going on? Has he really got a broken rib?

4266~~~
This team badly need him.

4267~~~
This is his game of the season, and he's missing it. Bollocks.

4268~~~
With all those Stoke attackers constantly pressing our players? He would've been dispossessed too many times. Set-pieces would've been safer with him though.

4269~~~
That's what I was thinking. This is precisely the fixture he is made for <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4270~~~
We have been bullied off the ball. His strength would have been handy this game.

4271~~~
I don't think that Fellaini is a great physical player. He gets bullied off the ball way too easy for a guy of his size. He can bully Arsenal midgets, but when he comes up against the likes of Shawcross/Crouch he often gets bested. Also, with all the wind and it's changing the ball's trajectory, he would've been lost here - his positioning is awful. He would've been handy at set-pieces though, in a static game he is using his height very good. 

He had a big problem with our distribution from the back - and Fellaini won't help there, he would only make it worse, in my opinion.

4272~~~
Each to their own I suppose. All I know is that you have a better chance of fellaini winning an aerial duel against these players than the likes of Shaw and Mata.

4273~~~
We miss him. Get well soon

4274~~~
I don't think it was the case that we missed him. I think it's a case of the team structure in this bloody 3-5-2. Carrick is sitting almost on top of the defence, with Rooney and Mata very advanced of the midfield. Away games at places like Stoke are cagey in the middle of the park and they had too much space and time to get out from the back. No urgency to press, and positionally all over the shop. Fellaini's presence and qualities may have helped in attack but Stoke would have just played around him like they did to the others today. How often did they have 3 against 1 in the middle? No combativeness, or fight to push them back.

4275~~~
Really needed him in these away games. Hopefully back soon.

4276~~~
Really missed his ball winning today.

4277~~~
This was certainly a game where his elbows would have come in quite handy.

4278~~~
If there's one game you want Fellaini for, it's this one. We're really shite at winning high balls, everyone apart from Smalling and Van Persie apparently so he would have helped.

4279~~~
I know he's not the best at sticking with his man when defending corners, but you never know, he could have stopped their goal if he'd been playing as I'm sure he'd have been on Crouch or Shawcross. In general he'd have been very useful today.

4280~~~
We really missed him today, he would've been a certainty to play if he was fit.

4281~~~
Agreed with the point made above.  If there were ONE match all season you'd want Fellaini starting for, it would be v Stoke away.

4282~~~
Another uninspiring performance with Fellaini out. It is fair to say our best run of form by an absolute mile this season was when Fellaini was in the team.

The thing that Fellaini has done which I believe has been very under appreciated, is that he shows for the ball. Whether playing as a DM, CM or AM, he always tries to find space and be available for a pass. We have really lacked that in recent games, the likes of Rooney, Mata and even Herrera play too far up the pitch, which I believe is why we seem to end up playing hoofball a lot of the time. Ironically, hoofball would suit Fellaini equally well, for obvious reasons.

4283~~~
Our midfield played its best football before Fellaini was even fit this season

4284~~~
He offered an outlet for our defenders to clear the ball to. Was why we were more effective in midfield, meant we didn't keep giving the ball back to the opposition with the long punts forward.

4285~~~
Honestly I disagree. We shipped far too many goals (Leicester and MK Dons come to mind) and the results were very poor. You can attribute some of this to injuries and defensive mistakes, but the midfield is also responsible for the defensive side of the team.

4286~~~
Needs to come back as soon as possible. Miss the big lad

4287~~~
Our best form came with Carrick's return to the team, for the reasons you mentioned. Not Fellaini.

4288~~~
Clutching at straws a bit he might be available a lot but he can't pass, playing three stikers and mata in the same team is reason we are struggling, introducing fellaini isn't going to improve the passing no matter how anyone tries to dress it up.

4289~~~
Didn't you watch the first half today?

4290~~~
Wig man is needed badly for scrappy opponents like Yeovil, but we definitely need a classier midfielder against the likes of Chelsea and City.

4291~~~
This has been argued to death already and I have no desire to resurrect it, suffice to say Carrick has also been a welcome addition to the team and has made a difference, but even since he has been back, we have struggled at playing the ball out from the back, and the CBs not having any outlets.

It's a simple observation. Fellaini did/does make himself available. He doesn't hide from the ball, and that is exactly what the defenders need at the moment. Fellaini himself doesn't need to have Paul Scholes' range of passing, he simply needs to get the ball off the defenders, protect it, and find a non-CB teammate to lay it off to. He did this, and now we do not have anyone doing it, and it shows.

4292~~~
I wasn't talking bout the first 45 mins specifically so I don't know what your point is.

Fellaini could have played 90 mins today and our passing would have been no better, carrick or blind would maybe have helped but not fellaini.

4293~~~
This. Today our midfield looked very unbalanced because both Rooney and Herrera played more like tens and when the defenders had the ball they had no one to play it to. We need a midfielder in there who will pick up the ball in the space between our offensive players and the defensive midfielder.

4294~~~
I'm sorry but I can't see what you're saying here. Fellaini has played far forward for us (e.g. pushing up on Fabregas vs Chelsea) where he's not building attacks except where Carrick's been at CB and he's played in the midfield two in the 352. He was awful in those games too (Southampton, arse, Liverpool) with his passing. He does the exact opposite of what you say, he's the first to play the easy pass back to our defenders.

4295~~~
It's genuinely laughable to try and argue fellaini is the difference, when he plays deep and collects the ball he really struggles.

4296~~~
Just going back to the Liverpool game where he did have the responsibility of taking the ball off the defence/playing at the base of the midfield 2 in the 352

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2014-2015-performances.394651/page-93#post-16830673">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2014-2015-performances.394651/page-93#post-16830673</a>

4297~~~
Fellaini obviously has a reputation (especially on the caf) as being the AM, the target for long balls etc, but actually watch the games and you may see what he does. I remember the Southampton and Liverpool games and I agreed that he didn't have fantastic games (though in both cases he got better as the games went on and actually ended up being one of the better players), and the stats show that actually his passing - accuracy, completion, average pass length, forwards/backwards ratio and whatever else - was pretty decent.

Again my point and the reason I bumped this thread, is the last 3-4 games we have looked pretty shit. A common (and justified) complaint has been our inability to play the ball from the back, and today was no exception. Whether you want to believe that Fellaini helped in this regard or not, I don't believe it is pure coincidence that since his injury we have (again) struggled in this regard.

4298~~~
I remember that game well, and at the time I even said he does not work in that role, in that system. That said, read a bit further and you will see a general acceptance that he got better as the game went on. My (unpopular) opinion is that some of the blame in that and the Southampton game, should fall on the other midfielders for not giving options for Fellaini when he had it. It was also a pretty common consensus that he shouldn't be used as a DM in a 3-5-2, hell there shouldn't be a DM in a 3-5-2 at all, we instead played a bunch of #10s and stuck Fellaini at DM to try to counterbalance it, it was completely bizarre at the time and we had the same issue against Southampton.

4299~~~
Sorry man, but you are just too obssesed with him.

We were playing even more crap football with him but we were just effective. We did the same today without him so I really see no reason to think we missed him much.

4300~~~
The only thing I came to this thread to say was that he at least didn't hide from the ball and gave our CBs an option to pass to. The last 3-4 games we have looked incapable of playing it out from the back and simply been hoofing it long (ironically a tactic that plenty on here associated with Fellaini).

If you cannot play out from the back then you will never be able to play top quality football (as a team I mean) and that is our biggest problem currently, and whilst it is fashionable on here to criticise the CBs, I think the midfielders are equal culpable. The likes of Herrera, Rooney and Mata simply do not show for the ball and give the CBs an option.

4301~~~
fecking hell, you'd think he was Redondo or Matthaus the way his thread is bumped every time we play shite. LvG only rated two performances out of our last run, the one's against Hull and Newcastle, he only played in one of them. We aren't missing him at all, we are missing a decent formation and the ability to play a consistent back 4 and having no pace up front.

4302~~~
We missed someone who could retain possession and keep things ticking along whilst providing a bit of impetus via their passing. Carrick that is. 

Fellaini would have been better than Fletcher (who isn't nowdays, sadly enough) but seriously doubt whether Fellaini could have made a significant impact on this match

4303~~~
Fellaini would have tackled more than Fletcher but gone backwards just as much. Would have been a threat at set pieces though

4304~~~
Pretty much. Carrick and Blind are our most important CMs. In an injury crisis we can shoe horn players like Mata and Rooney to play in midfield, but we have just two holding players of the needed quality

4305~~~
The thing I find with Mata and Rooney in midfield is that they are simply too attacking minded and refuse to drop back to get the ball off the CBs. I agree Carrick and Blind are very important, but we need other players who link up between defence and attack - I thought Herrera would be perfect for this when he signed but he too seems to be too attack-minded.

4306~~~
As much as people hate to accept it, we have a much more balanced lineup when Fellaini is there.. His physicality and aerial ability makes a huge difference when the back 4 is pressured into making long passes, atleast he's able to win it up the pitch and retain possession rather than giving the ball back to the opposition with every long pass attempted from the back..

4307~~~
Herrera seems to keen to get forward and play through balls.. In the 1st half he kept tsking up terrible positions, and the defenders had nowhere to go but back everytime they got ball..

For this formation to work(3-5-2), the ball has to move from defense to attack quickly, before the opposition gets the chance to block any passing opportunities..

4308~~~
But our midfield doesnt play well when he's in it, even when he has played well individually so he doesnt give it balance. What he gives in those areas you mentioned he takes away (from the midfield we started the season using) in passing, running with the ball and positive play all of which were present in the Blind, Di Maria and Ander midfield where midfield looked our strongest area

4309~~~
Maybe we should have got Tony Pulis on the blower then because that is how his teams play, not Manchester United. If we are so desperately poor that you and others think we need a limited player like Fellaini to compete with sides at this level then we are in serious trouble.

4310~~~
Had no pace, no width so how his his noggin going to get on the end of a chance?

4311~~~
He is not the answer.

4312~~~
Agreed.

4313~~~
Lost track of how many 50:50s our central midfielders lost today. Fellaini (the version we've watched this season anyway) would have definitely improved us.

4314~~~
There is no hiding that we have been a lot better when Fellaini is playing this season. Almost 0.9 points per game more with him in the starting eleven and that includes games against Chelsea, City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Southampton.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/zTyOXEv.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/zTyOXEv.jpg"/>

4315~~~
Quality of opposition is indeed an underrated stat in this. If you have a good way of getting stats, something like average league position of opponent (with and without Fellaini) would be very indicative.

4316~~~
Average position with Fellaini is 8.13 and without is 12.75 this does not include the 2 cup games.

4317~~~
Nice one, not as big a gap as I had expected to be honest, but still significant.

4318~~~
Except that's not true at all. We were terrible in build up play with him in the team same as without him, but we had the option to hoof it on his chest when he was here, so he was good at that - I'll give him that. But still, that's definitely not called "building it from the back".

Also, he played just one or two games as deepest midfielder, and most of the games he played he was even more attacking than Rooney and Mata, if anything, people were questioning why Rooney plays so deep and Fellaini stays so forward.

Two games he played as our deepest midfielder were against Liverpool, and second half against Southampton, and we were terrible in both games possession wise and building it from the back.

4319~~~
That proves nothing as it fails to take into account any factor other than fellaini and he has only played eight times. Who knows you may be right but to present such stats as being conclusive is just stupid and in a number of those games he actually didn't even play very well.

4320~~~
The two parts I have bolded I disagree with completely. The first is a simple matter of opinion, the second is just wrong - when Fellaini was first given a chance this season, in the majority of games he played a box-to-box role. In his last couple of games against Liverpool and Southampton he was moved to being a dedicated DM, a decision I (and most others) disagreed with, but even prior to that he was not an AM. He got forwards and into the box when required (as LVG no doubt instructed him to) and obviously if we are chasing a game you will want players who can be a threat to play further forwards, but aside from that in the normal passages of play he played box-to-box - look back on the caf and you will see how many people were surprised to see him being able to play well as a proper CM, not just an AM.

4321~~~
I do find it convenient how every time in this thread (and there have been a few such occassions) that Fellaini's critics are confronted with the stats, they will indubitably respond with some rubbish about how the stats mean nothing. Of course there are more factors involved than just Fellaini, but it has been proven beyond all doubt that the team has done far better with Fellaini in the team, than out of it, this season. Read into that what you like, if you choose to believe it to be pure coincidence then that is up to you.

Finally, and I hate to use this 'card' because it always annoyed me when people did it under SAF - LVG obviously valued what Fellaini was bringing to the team, as after his first sub appearance against West Brom, he played a full 90 minutes every game until he got injured.

4322~~~
I never said Fellaini was the sole reason for us playing better I only said we have been a lot better as a team points wise when he is starting . I personly think that Di Maria, Herrera, Carrick, Mata and Blind are all better footballers than him but Fellaini offers something different than those and we look like a much more balanced team when he is playing.

4323~~~
Beyond all doubt, from those stats, seriously? It's eight games and probably 2-3 of those where he was actually anything better than a six out of ten, if that makes us a better team then we must have very low standards.

4324~~~
I didn't say he played classic AM who played in front of two midfielders, I agree that he played box to box. Apart from Liverpool and Southampton 2nd half games, he played in 3 man midfield, alongside Rooney or someone else in front of Carrick/Blind, and he was sometimes even more attacking than his midfield partners. Anyway, he wasn't the one picking balls from defenders, it was Carrick or Blind, apart from those two mentioned games when our build up play from the back was awful anyway.

4325~~~
I just think those stats are from too small a sample and don't take into account a number o relevant factors such as the return of carrick.

4326~~~
The bolded bit is a bit OTT. I'm sure he wasn't the only variable in those games whilst everything else remained constant.

I am missing him a bit though (!). Games like Stoke and today he would be very useful in.

4327~~~
That's a bit harsh don't you think? Plus if Fellaini was seriously as limited as you claim he is, Van Gaal wouldn't be using him when fit. Look at Anderson, he could very well have frozen him out like Ando, and given someone like Andreas a chance instead. Fellaini might not be a world beater but he has certain strengths that none of out other midfielders or attackers offer! 

We're not in a position to be picky about the kind of players we have in the team or how attractive their style of play is. Looking at how shit we have been off late, even Tony Pulis' sides might outplay us and that is without the great footballing neanderthal that is Fellaini in the team. We produced some great results and performances with him in the team, and that is not just a coincidence. 

With him in the team we have someone to keep hold of the ball in midfield, someone whose physical presence can be intimidating in midfield and offers us a goalscoring threat on set-pieces. And of course the only player in our team capable of winning those pointless punts forward from either the defenders or De Gea and holding on to the ball after it.

4328~~~
I'd rather the defenders hoof to the big lad than nervously passing from the back. It's been that bad.

We would have beaten stoke with Fellaini. He is no savior but I have no problem with him being a squad player. I know he was expensive but there's nothing that can be done about it besides sell at a huge loss or sell right after the Euros if Fellaini dominates.

4329~~~
Spot on.  

Fellaini was never worth 27.5m but he's on the squad so let's forget about what he cost the Glazers.  He can play a useful role for United, even if he'll never be of the quality required for a CL-contending side, which I expect us to be next season.  I recommend we appreciate him for he can do, not what we wish he could do, and move on.  We still need IMHO a massive buy in midfield, which will no doubt reduce Fellaini's opportunities but at least, from his point of view, he gets to remain a player on one of the biggest clubs on earth.  The midfielder who needs to go, regretfully, is Fletcher.  The disease took a terrible toll on him and he's finished at this level.  But Fellaini can still play a useful for us for the next few seasons.

4330~~~
In the 3-1-4-2 against Southampton, when Fellaini played in central midfield, he rarely dropped back to link the defence and attack whilst our defenders frequently tried to look for him via a long ball. We would also do the same thing with the diamond though with much less frequency. If he was fit today and playing in central midfield, our play would not be any different at all simply because of how van Gaal wants his central midfielders to play: as attacking as possible.

4331~~~
This sums up the situation perfectly (especially the Fletcher bit, sadly.)

4332~~~
I agree

4333~~~
Hang on, wasn't Southampton one of the games where he was playing DM and screening the back three?

4334~~~
That was after Smalling got injured. Otherwise, he was drifting quite far forward, hence why he got into so many physical battles with Wanyama.

4335~~~
Smalling was taken off in the 18th minute, why are you basing your assessment of what Fellaini/the team were doing on 18 minutes of the game?

4336~~~
My mistake. Carrick moved to the back at the 38th minute, not after Smalling went off. The reason I use this period of time is because that was the time he was playing as one of the central midfielders.

4337~~~
Good to have him back. Looked lively when he come on. Displayed some nice touches and some good one touch play.

4338~~~
Koeman absolutely butchered his name in his post match interview.

4339~~~
Nice to see him back hopefully he starts against QPR he gives our midfield a lot of energy when he is playing.

4340~~~
We've clearly missed him and he's obviously one of our best central midfielders.

4341~~~
Thought he was the best of the three subs, though none of them did a whole lot, but he won a few headers. Will be interesting to see the role he plays now that everyone is fit.

4342~~~
Not a fan of Fellaini but he did OK when he came on. It would still bother me to see him in the starting XI but he is a useful option from the bench.

4343~~~
at least something changed after he came on. This is exactly the role he can fulfill at United, an impact player from the bench. Glad to have him as an option.

4344~~~
I also just want to point out that the gap between "Points with Fellaini starting" vs "Points without Fellaini starting" has widened after last night.

4345~~~
Although not a popular opinion we play much better when he's in the team, I'm glad he's back.

4346~~~
Along with Herrera, I am surprised Fellaini hasnt earnt a start after our poor recent performances.

4347~~~
Come on then, lets hear it.

4348~~~
Slowly becoming my favourite player. Love him I do. What a finish!

4349~~~
This is my vision of Fellaini when we signed him. We are in trouble away from home and he comes on, gets himself about and sticks one in the net. Well done, son.

4350~~~
Great stuff from him.

4351~~~
When he plays we win.

4352~~~
He's our best midfielder. There, I said it.

4353~~~
He really brings something  on the table.. How do you drop him? for whom?

4354~~~
Exactly the role he's best suited to here: impact sub. Good stuff.

4355~~~
Feck that, he should be starting every game for us.

4356~~~
Hope he won't start. Don't see him as more than an impact stuff. His style doesn't fit us in my opinion.

4357~~~
As I have been saying, the "points per game" whilst Fellaini is in the team is monumentally higher than without. The longer it goes on the less it will be regarded as a coincidence, I hope.

4358~~~
Good goal if you can get him in the box and get crosses in will always score goals, would still swap him for a midfielder who can pass the ball a lot better, ideally schneiderlein but I prefer seeing him play in midfield to mata.

4359~~~
He brings a package of presence, goal threat and variety that none of our other midfielders offer. For me he should be starting most games, we've generally played better when he has.

4360~~~
Maybe he should but that really says more about how the rest of our midfield is functioning atm.

In an ideal world our starting midfield would actually be working and we'd have Fellaini on the bench, ready to be thrown on as needed.

4361~~~
I love it when players shove unfair stick back down the throats of their naysayers.

4362~~~
Yeah, if we were playing the football we'd like to play, Fellaini would be a mismatch.

4363~~~
What I like is that he is a midfielder who plays like a bloody midfielder, not like a #10 or an anchorman.

This relates to what I have been banging on about for weeks with midfielders not showing for the ball.

4364~~~
Marouane Berbatov <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4365~~~
Not his biggest fan but very good today, it makes no sense playing mata and Rooney in midfield when we have actual midfielders on the bench.

The change of formation, fellaini and Wilson changed the game for us today.

4366~~~
Pretty much this, should be starting games, blind hope or not but I do hope that we're fecking off from that turgid 352 shit from now on and we can actually play our midfielders in right positions for once.

4367~~~
He does the simple things very well and because he's such a beast he can turn easily and free up a runner. It's him over Herrera all day at the minute.

4368~~~
Another player who did well when he came on. Our best run did come when he was in the team.

4369~~~
Did very well when he came on.

4370~~~
Come on and did great for us again. Super finish too.

4371~~~
Always said we need him for tough away games like this, great goal and performance from him today.

4372~~~
You dont, why must he be dropped ?

4373~~~
Changed the game for us. So important to acutally have someone in midfield that wins arial duels. And if that means dropping Mata then so be it.

4374~~~
Played well. Should start the next game.

4375~~~
His celebration - ignoring Van Gaal - anyone else notice it?

4376~~~
He actually went to celebrate with Januzaj, not surprised as he's been another one suffering from playing that idiotic formation and other stupid decisions.

And they're best buddies at United of course.

4377~~~
He patted Van Gaal on the back.

4378~~~
Yup. That was one of maybe three highlights from the match...

4379~~~
Played well, great finish. Should probably go back into the team on the basis of today.

4380~~~
Good cameo, good finish.

If we're playing him it should be as part of the diamond. The other midfielders can nullify his weaknesses and he can concentrate on linking play and getting in the box.

4381~~~
And some still refuse to put him in our best XI <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>. Fecking mindboggling, and use no common sense whatsoever.

4382~~~
Off in the summer then. Should be good material for the Sun as well.

4383~~~
Lots of fun backtracking here today. Thoroughly enjoying myself

4384~~~
Wanted him to be subbed on for Mata last weekend, but it came much much too late. When we're struggling to break a team down, he's a very good player to bring on as a MIDFIELDER. 

Only watched the last 15 minutes, but he seemed to be in total control. Thrilled for him.

4385~~~
He is not what we need to take us back to the top of PL, let alone CL, but I am so happy for him.  Gives effort where so many others won't/can't.

4386~~~
His fan brigade are out in force I see. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He did well when he came on no doubt about that, but if he is really our best CM then we better get investing in that area again pronto.

4387~~~
I am having a field day!

4388~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4389~~~
Shame on them for praising him after a good performance and goal that changed the game for us. It might've benefited or team but how dare they say good things about Fellaini!

4390~~~
Just start him. He does the job.

4391~~~
Praising him is one thing, you'd think he was Matthaus or Robson the way some are posting about his performance against the worst team in the league.

4392~~~
Exactly! No matter how well he plays he's NOT A GOOD PLAYER. Look at the evidence - he's tall, runs funny imo, and moyes signed him twice! We need to stick hard to the dogma!

4393~~~
for now, while we're pissing about trying to set in a formation that doesn't suit us, too many strikers and attacking mid, and players in the wrong position, he must play.

4394~~~
Loved that he ran up to Januzaj when he scored. At first, I thought he was going to re-enact the high five we saw from Van Persie with Van Gaal in the world cup. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4395~~~
Im pleased for him he scored and all, but still find it abit embarrasing its Fellaini whose saved us out of the rest of them. Least he did mind.

4396~~~
Saying he should start and was great when he came on = Lothar Matthaus

Just give him credit. He's been one of our best players this season, and our results are better with him in the side.

4397~~~
A team that, prior to him coming on, we struggled against and probably looked like losing to.

Is your sole objective of coming to this thread just to attempt to insult those who are praising a good performance that arguably changed the match, or do you have anything constructive to say?

4398~~~
He doesn't have to be those two. He just needs to be our best CM, over Herrera, Rooney, Mata, and Blind. And he does.

4399~~~
I did give him credit, the idea that he should be a starter for us is the road to ruin IMO and I will say it whenever it's made out like he should be, we need better if we intend to return to where we were.

4400~~~
He also performed well vs the best team in the league.

4401~~~
Apologies didn't see that.

In the clip I saw he ran straight past him to Januzaj, then bumped into him on way back and Van Gaal looked awkward.

It must've been shown from a different angle or something.

4402~~~
I didn't realize I wasn't free to make a little joke about how rabidly some rush to praise him, didn't know the Caf was so sensitive.

4403~~~
Well that shouldn't be hard since 2 aren't even CM's, and I don't think he is better than Blind at all.

4404~~~
Right now with the players we have available, he should be starting. Don't know how anyone can disagree with that.

4405~~~
Given how many games Herrera has had I am not sure how that judgment can be made.

4406~~~
Made a real difference. Scored a goal and was physical in MF. Should start on one side of a diamond with AdM on the opposite side.

4407~~~
It's close, but Fellaini scores goals, which is the most valuable trait in the game. Considering our lack of goals from midfield, I'd have him in the team on that alone.

4408~~~

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4409~~~
Blind is a #6 though, and really if we actually played Rooney where he belongs we wouldn't need to worry about goals. I mean look how crazy that is, we have Rooney, RvP, and Falcao, yet Fellaini is needed for his goal threat? Just shows what a mess we are in if that's the case.

4410~~~
Well, so you agree that he should be in our best XI then, and he should start in every game as his contribution is better than any 'CM' we have so far. Glad you can see that as well.

We had Fellaini-Mata-Rooney in midfield against Liverpool, and we won 3-0. I don't think Blind would do equal job.

4411~~~
Who said anything about Herrera? They should both start.

4412~~~
He's not needed solely for his goal threat, I was just making a point that it's a valuable trait in a midfielder. He's a good player, tidy in possession and disrupts the opposition. I'd start him all day at the moment, but you don't have to agree of course.

4413~~~
Fellaini should start because there is no competition for him in the squad he is a high energy and physical box to box midfielder and the only one in our squad. Carrick and Blind are both defensive midfielders who is best when they sit deep and dictates play Rooney, Mata, Herrera, and Di Maria are all offensive midfielders, all of them might be better players than Fellaini but he brings something to the midfield that none of them can offer and thats why he should start.

4414~~~
One of our most important players this year...

4415~~~
Of course he should start. Made an impact in every cameo he's had since being out injured. If only we could say that about every player. Sick of putting up with poor form for several games after an injury. Blind and Fellaini have shown that's not an excuse.

4416~~~
Spot on. There have been discussions about our lack of tenacity, or our lethargic approach but he's offered this once he got back to full fitness again. You see the difference as he's an all-round midfielder who can offer defensively and in attack, can tackle, get in people's faces whereas a Carrick is more someone who intercepts and keeps it simple, Herrera pass and move. You need a balance in midfield and Fellaini provides it. Is he in the top quality to challenge in Europe? No. That's why we looked at Vidal. Has the same strengths but less of his weaknesses, but while Fellaini is here we need to utilize him.

4417~~~
Fair balls to him. Fair f*cking balls to him.

That's all I've to say really.

4418~~~
Should be starting every away game and against the better sides at Old Trafford. Fair play to him because I can't recall many peak age players we have bought from other English clubs who have recovered from a poor first season. You can argue that United might not win the Champions League with him in midfield but first you have to earn the right to compete in that competition and he is what we need right now.

4419~~~
An ideal impact sub and option. Mix him and Herrera into one man and you've got a great midfielder.

Helped turn the game today. Another special moment for him. He's making a habit of these.

4420~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Louis van Gaal identified the lack of balance in the squad from day one but somehow made it even less balanced.

4421~~~
Strootman?

I don't know really, haven't seen enough of Strootman, just from what people have been saying sounds like it to me.

4422~~~
Yeah some of the stuff written about him on here last season from some posters was absolutely ridiculous.

4423~~~
You have to say he's one of our better players.

4424~~~
Fair play to Bogbrush, he came on and made a real difference. Deserves to be starting, not least because he adds a physical dimension to our otherwise flat midfield.

4425~~~
During our 6 game winning run Carrick took all the plaudits but Fellaini was our most important player in some of those games. It's no coincidence that we've just gone through our worst run when he was out injured or not picked. He gives us so m6ch power defending and attacking set pieces and his pace can be electric. It's frustrating that he is not a player that can really make a defense splitting pass but his over all play and energy in central midfield is miles better than anything herrera, mata or blind offer currently...blind looked more at home on the left of a back 3 against southampton than central midfield

4426~~~
Hello.

4427~~~
After defending Fellaini last season (and getting so much stick for it), he has finally made a lot of people eat their words, i was always under the impression that letting a 6 ft 3 giant that has a strong physical presence in games, leave for a mere 15m pounds to Fiorentina would be a terrible decision, especially when our team hasn't thrived in the physical department in the midfield since Keano.

 Felliani should be the 2nd name on the team sheet( 1st being jesus .. i mean De Gea of course) during away ties and against big teams.

4428~~~
This is the Fellaini that destroyed us at Goodison Park .

4429~~~
No, he wouldn't start for me, Blind and Carrick would start behind a trio of Rooney/Di Maria/Herrera with one of the #9's up top. 

I think Blind would have quite easily done an equal job with his superior technique and positional intelligence.

4430~~~
Fellaini is our key to finishing in top 4. Of course he's no Pogba or Scholes and you can even argue that he's not suited to central midfield but he gives the team presence, pace and power awhich is what we lack. Opponents hate facing him. I was his biggest critic last season but his passing in tight spaces, although not great, is way better then any of us first thought. To finish in top 4 Fellaini simply has to be in the team ahead of Herrera, Mata and Blind in central midfield

4431~~~
We'd get overrun with Blind and Carrick in midfield, they're both too similar and too slow. Only one should start.

4432~~~
The funny thing is that we seem so soft even now without him that if he played against us he would murder us again

4433~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1fjcoIVTdY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4434~~~
Pleased for him, but still I see posts 'he shouldnt start for us' or 'if we want to do good he shouldnt be a starter' and similar nonsense. 
Its hard to pay respect where the respect is due for some people.

4435~~~
He'll become a fan favourite at this rate. Likely to finish the season with as much credit as any outfield player.

4436~~~
He is our only real b2b midfielder, and should be a starter for the rest of the season. I think LvG wants that too.

People that wants him sold are crazy.

4437~~~
He could scored a hattrick blindfolded, arms tied behind his back and a dildo up his ass and some people will still say that because he was bought by Moyes and only plays long-ball.

4438~~~
This. 

Maybe they think they would die if they would just write - he has been very good this season, fair fe.ks to him.

4439~~~
I love the guy

He is also becoming a bit of a cult hero, I couldn't be happier for how it's turned out compared to last season

4440~~~
It's all very strange. I honestly don't think that some can accept that he's performing better than their 'favourites'.

4441~~~
Carrick and Blind are no slower than Fellaini and technically and positionally much better, which would compensate for them not being big.

4442~~~
The suggestion that some would have Herrera over him in our starting 11 is laughable. Fellaini has outperformed Herrera by a country mile this season, it's a no brainer. Herrera may well turn out to be a far superior player in the future (the jury is still out on that) but at the moment there's no question who should start. That said, they needn't be mutually exclusive. A midfield diamond with one of Blind or Carrick behind those two, with Mata or Di Maria (preferably Di Maria for the pace injection) in front of them should work well too.

4443~~~

4444~~~
I never liked him and didn't want us to sign him, and wanted to get rid of him this summer, but seriously he has been far better this season, and have actually been very valuable for us, he has now scored against WBA, and now QPR both away in matches, where we looked toothless, i would be happy for us to keep him as a squad player.

4445~~~
Deserves a lot of credit for bouncing back from last season. Fair play to him.

4446~~~
Fair play to him for turning things around. He's is a great asset to have.

4447~~~
People just don't want to see it.

4448~~~
Really happy for him... He's played a whole lot better this year.

4449~~~
I've had him down as a cert to be been sold in the summer as we'll need to sell some players that will actually command a decent fee, but other than DDG he is fast becoming our most important player this season, which is a pretty impressive turnaround from the guy.

4450~~~
I like Fellaini. Once you accept he's not Busquets or Xavi, then you start to appreciate what he brings to the table, he's not a world beater, but he's very capable. He's a solid player, valuable when attacking and defender set pieces, and weighs in with goals every now and then, and he works hard.

4451~~~
The closest thing we have to a cutting edge  this season. No nonsense, direct and today, decisive.

4452~~~
Moyes was right, his chest control is the best in the world. It does give De Gea a fantastic out ball when Fellani can bring down long balls like that. I think we saw today that he is actually quite neat and tidy too, whilst being fairly intelligent in his movement. I think under Van Gaal we have seen a much better disciplined Fellani than we did under Moyes.

4453~~~
Well done to come on and grab a goal. It's amazing what a bit of confidence does. All credit to him for turning it around.

4454~~~
He's keeping his elbows in check too without sacrificing his physical play. Hope that continues, feel like refs always waiting to make those calls against him.

4455~~~
Yep. He already scored 4 goals as well.

TBH, I thought that was another Hail Mary moment when he came on to start the second half, but he was really good and disciplined from the get-go. May it continue for him.

4456~~~
That was some strike for his goal

4457~~~
Hmmmm.....where are all those doubters gone?

4458~~~
Reminded me of how Berbatov would take a chance in that position. Very composed.

4459~~~
The goals make him a valuable member of the squad. He's not the most creative or best passer, although fairly accurate, or the best defensive player, but if he can score 8-10 goals then he justifies his place.

4460~~~
He's scored three goals.

4461~~~
and.....team wins more games now with him than without him!!!!

4462~~~
I love that fuzzy haired, pointy elbowed bastard.

I even love Ashley Young, and his cocky face and his weird hunchback running.

Van Gaal has turned villains into heroes.

4463~~~
I'm pleased that he's having an impact this season. Some of the criticism he received last season I feel was unjust.

4464~~~
he has as many goals as yellow cards. we win with him in the side which is mental.

Not sure why he still gets slated by a lot on here, perhaps it's because Fellaini still reminds people of the Moyes era?

Either way, he is one of our most influential players, like it or not.

4466~~~
I can't believe the complete turnaround he's made. He's now one of our more important players. Well done to him.

4467~~~
Should be starting. Actually no, needs to be starting. Gives us great balance in midfield. One of our best performing players this season. To turn it around like he has deserves a lot of credit.

4468~~~
Good to see him do well, the way he was treated during the summer was disgusting. Probably has won himself a starting place with this performance.

4469~~~
Have to put both hands up and admit I was wrong about him. I still think it was poor business but what he is producing on the pitch now, is a credit to himself and is a benefit to United.

Really hope it continues.

4470~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> You Mata's lover. I'm still hoping LvG can also turn Mata around, as I really thought he would be our missing piece (a.k.a Cantona).

4471~~~
Very good stuff. As with our other central midfielders id play him instead of ththew likes of rooney

4472~~~
That skill near the touchline <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

So happy for the guy. Works hard and when he's confident and on his game, all the nice technical stuff comes out on show as well

4473~~~
Agree with pretty much everything in both these posts.

4474~~~
Where are those feckers who booed him during the preseason game at OT? I want to see what their reactions are like. Probably licking his arsehole right now. Right dickheads, they were.

4475~~~
Great to see the turnaround in him. When he was signed, I expected him to do well contrary to others who thought it was a shite signing but he didnt do well in the 1st season. Really happy to see him turn it around this season. Has a presence about him which makes it tough to play against. Should start every game in CM alongside Mata, Carrick and Di Maria. Rooney up top with 1 of the other 3 strikers.

4476~~~
why he still gets slated over here?
not everyone is gentleman enough to admit he was wrong...

Admittedly it took some time for Fellaini to settle down and some fans preferred to be swayed by the hate spouted on twitter rather than be patient with a player who wad recovering from an injury.

4477~~~
if gets 20 goals and in the process gets 20 yellows....i wouldn't care so much about the latter

4478~~~
in truth it was meant to be a surprise that he has 3 goals not an indictment over 3 yellows.

4479~~~
He is just perfect for the diamond - Can bully opposition players, win balls back and gets cover for positioning in terms of Carrick. Played superbly yesterday - and how we've missed him
- Won back balls in midfield and final third
- Kept the ball fantastically well in the end
- Showed skill in the touchline
- Buried a chance which Falcao in his current form would have struggled.

I hope the Afro makes a comeback amongst the fans. And the celebration with Januzaj <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4480~~~
Having looked to be nailed on to be sold, he appears, like Young, to have been "rehabilitated" under van Gaal. Certainly looks much more like the player Moyes thought he was getting.

Took his chance yesterday and buried it. Fair play to him.

4481~~~
Just put him on and watch him muscle everyone off. I wasn't very fond of him last year but putting him higher up is obviously the way to use him properly.

4482~~~
To think we almost sold him to Napoli for peanuts.. We are lucky they weren't willing to pay a bit more.

4483~~~
Lucky he got injured. That ankle injury could be the best thing to happen to him in his career thus far.

4484~~~
I think its time to try to reintroduce the chant I came up with for him during pre-season;

Afro, Afro-man!
I, gotta be, an afro-man!

4485~~~
I think if we were to play a 433 next season, with Fellaini being one of the box to box midifelders, he could easily pick up about 10 goals a season, as he's really got an eye for goal and takes up good positions in the box - similar to Lampard. Although playing a bit further up (off the striker), he shown he could do that when playing for Everton.

4486~~~
That is the sort of role I think he should play - box to box. It does mean he needs a defensively minded player next to him in most games, and ideally an attacking playmaker like Herrera or Mata as well.

Give Fellaini almost a free role in the middle of the park and he will really thrive - not a free role like an attacker with no defensive responsibility mind, but a free role to get up and down the pitch and contribute at both ends.

4487~~~
So play as a central midfielder....

I agree though.

4488~~~
Yes!

4489~~~
Louis van Gaal always says he likes to develop players, improve them, it doesn't matter how old you are, for as long as you are willing to learn he will have something to teach.

I think Fellaini is determined to succeed and has been very receptive to advice from Louis van Gaal. He has always had the ability he has shown but I think with the aid of instructions from Louis van Gaal he has been able to express his ability well probably because he is more disciplined.

4490~~~
It was telling in when the cameras showed LVG talking to Fellaini on the bench, before he brought him on in the West Brom game earlier this season - this probably happens all the time but it was interesting to see LVG clearly explaining his thoughts to Fellaini. He was brought on at half time for Herrera (I think), and had a huge impact on the game.

Great video. God, I love when he takes Toure out at 1:41. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4493~~~
For once he Toure didn't make him his bitch in every play

4494~~~
He usually had the better of Toure when he was at Everton. When he signed there were statistics which pointed towards Fellaini being more effective but other than physically they're different players. Toure has that lazy elegance that Thierry Henry had and in lesser games can be very quiet but produce a wonderful moment to bail City out. Fellaini is more combative. Toure is a big game player though which Fellaini was at Everton but severely lacked last season. Going fine now.

4495~~~
I don't remember Toure making Fellaini his 'bitch'. At Everton, Fellaini quite often had the better of Toure. Plus, as <a class="username" data-user="80861, @Boycott" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80861/">@Boycott</a> said, Toure isn't that type of player, regardless of his big frame.

4496~~~
He's been really good for us this season. Couple of crap performances (who hasn't) but a lot more very good/important performances. Starting and off the bench. Badly missed him when he hasn't played too. Not a great way to assess individuals but our results with/without him could hardly be more different.

4497~~~
Toure absolutely killed Fellaini last season in both derby games and he was MOTM for both. Fellaini was so shit he was subbed in the 66th for Valencia in our 0-3 loss at OT and Toure totally bossed that game. Fellaini didn't exactly imposed himself when we lost to them this season either

4498~~~
When you say killed, what do you mean? If you mean physically (which I assumed the both of us were talking about), then we both know you're lying.

4499~~~
This video is fantastic, he looks the best against City, Liverpool and Chelsea in it. He was doing immense job with tackling against Liverpool, to think he's been on a yellow from like what, 5th minute?

4500~~~
He's been great for us this season, he really has.

4501~~~
I am not a fan of highlight videos but it shows what I have been saying - that a lot of Fellainis best work has been around our box, winning the ball, breaking up opposition attacks, dominating in the air and claiming every 50/50 ball.

He is far more than just an aerial threat and hoofball-target, his best work comes as a box to box midfielder and he has been one of our most important players in all the big games he has featured in (Chelsea, City, Liverpool and Arsenal for starters)

4502~~~
He was useless last season along with so many other players. This season he is completely different. He is actually playing like a big player instead of the frightened kitten last season but that can be put down to the wrist injury which would not be fun to play with at all.

I thought he was done here but he has been one of our best and most consistent players this season and had chipped in with goals. Some of you on here have been made to look silly. He's always been a very good player and more than a chester down of balls.

We will need him in all of the big games between now and the end of the season.

4503~~~
He's been superb this season. Also a bit of a cnut which I like in players. Makes his presence felt.

4504~~~
So does anyone have an idea why we've decided to convert him to right-winger?

4505~~~
He's been okay, nowhere near superb.

4506~~~
Awful today other than his height he offered nothing, not the only one but just not good enough.

4507~~~
What is he doing on the right wing?

4508~~~
The diamond is not a good fit for him, it requires too much lateral movement for a player with such limited agility.

4509~~~
Presumably he was the right side of the diamond but lacked the mobility or quality to play that role effectively.

4510~~~
Pub player Fellaini is back.

4511~~~
Rubbish yet again, hes had quite a few poor games this season. He is a useful player to have in the squad, come on and change the game with his presence, but it makes me sick when a good player like Herrera is twiddling his thumbs on the bench whilst this clown is masquerading as a midfielder.

4512~~~
Not one of his better games, he was playing too wide as Cambridge packed the middle of the pitch. We would have been better off just swapping him positionally with Di Maria.

That said, our crossing was atrocious for most of the game so a big strength of Fellaini's never came to bare. I do think it was a mistake to sub him as when chasing a game, his height is always a threat. I would have taken off Di Maria, who was equally if not more ineffective than Fellaini, and whose pace was really irrelevant in that sort of game.

I do find Fellaini being the lowest rated player to be overly harsh. Nobody covered themselves in glory but I thought there were worse performances than Fellaini's tonight for sure.

4513~~~
Was in there for his height but that's pretty much all he did offer. Herrera should've played instead.

4514~~~
Except he created two great chances and almost scored himself?
Not his best game but he was far more effective than Fellaini

4515~~~
For the amount he got of the ball and the role he was playing, Di Maria was extremely poor in my eyes. In any formation featuring a #10 and two strikers, the #10 should be feeding balls through, finding pockets of space and basically running the show. We know that our strikers have the movement and make the runs, but nobody supplies them.

I am trying to recall the two "great chances" you refer to (to be honest, the quicker I can forget that match the better), but what I saw was several heavy touches and miscontrols that gave away possession from attacking areas. I really think Di Maria needs to play a deeper role for us - the weird thing for me is I think Di Maria would be perfectly suited to the wide-CM role in the diamond, he fits it down to a tee. Instead we had Fellaini of all people having to operate as some sort of wide target man, and Di Maria as #10 - the fact that we couldnt score against a league two side in 90 minutes says enough about how well that worked.

4516~~~
He created the chance RVP missed, he also had that one 2 with Herrera where he put the ball across the box.
Like I said, he didn't have the greatest game but was more productive than Fellaini, by a country mile.

4517~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4518~~~
This long ball stuff looks right up fellainis street .

4519~~~
Hasn't really been long ball though, it's been quick passing on the floor through the midfield then crosses from the wing when we can't break through. Lovely stuff.

4520~~~
Get it wide, cross it into him and he'll win his fair share of headers by the looks of it.

4521~~~
You are joking, right?

4522~~~
Best chest controller in the Universe.

4523~~~
I have no problem with wingers taking players on and then crossing to someone in the box who is strong in the air. Sounds a lot like Fergie's teams to me incidentally.

4524~~~
It's better than what we playing a few weeks back, at least.

4525~~~
It might be effective, but playing Fellaini up top and constantly hitting diagonals to him for the knockdown is so unambitious, especially looking at the technical players we have, and the money we have to buy players.

I hope this wont be a long term thing.

4526~~~
Well he's better used as a target man than on the right of the diamond as it suits his strengths.

4527~~~
Big guy's doing a nice job.  He provides a target and makes trouble for the opposition.  Would be interested to see he and Rooney switch places though.

4528~~~
We had probably around 50 long balls/crosses in first 20 minutes, hardly anything like under Fergie.


Anything is better than that.

4529~~~
Hyperbole <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4530~~~
Yeah, but it was really like watching Fulham game again, and I am quite sure no one enjoyed that.

4531~~~
Yah but it wasn't really, that game was dire. This wasn't <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4532~~~
Because Fulham aren't league two side.

4533~~~
Yet we couldn't break Cambridge down last week. We've changed our strategy a little, while we're still playing lots of short passes along the ground we have added aerial threat up front. Imo that's not the same as a game where we literally went out with the intention of putting as many crosses into the box as possible, regardless of the level of the opposition.

4534~~~
I am enjoying watching Fellaini marauding the left wing at the moment, I'll answer you later. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

4535~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> sounds good to me <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4536~~~
I really hate people moaning about him. He has been one of our best players this season imo.

4537~~~
Fellaini provides a viable option as a plan B. And having an alternative plan when the original plan isn't working is always worthwhile. 

However, the worry is that Fellaini may be looked at as part of our plan A - even when he does not possess the footballing qualities of several other players who should be ahead of him.

He did well for Everton by being good in the air and physically strong, which was how Everton scored a lot of their goals. But that certainly shouldn't be Manchester United's main attacking outlet.

4538~~~
I like Fellaini very much but that position tonight is a waste of his talents. He's much better than a pidgeon-holed target man. The idea that he plays as a striker while Rooney plays in midfield is laughable. Both are considerably better in their natural positions.

4539~~~
I was frustrated with him tonight. There were a couple of occasions where I was shouting at the screen. Why the feck he played up top when Rooney is in midfield...should be a crime and automatic sacking for the manager. Baffling

4540~~~
You're right on the whole but from Van Gaal's perspective I think he wanted the game won quickly. Fellaini up top causes more direct problems as he occupies their defenders so crosses are more of a threat. Too often we play in front of the opponents which lets them settle into the game. Second half he was deeper as the plan was just to see the game through.

4541~~~
Credit where it's due to Van Gaal. He sure knows how to troll us fans. Drop Herrera and Falcao, then play Fellaini as a striker and Rooney in central midfield. When the summer transfer window closed you couldn't have imagined a more effective pisstake than that little combo.

4542~~~
Personally I didnt even think that tonight was a case of hoofing it to Fellaini. We worked our fair share of chances through the middle of the pitch, but as Michael Owen said in commentary, the fullbacks were going to be key to winning the game, and so obviously there were crosses and chances coming in from out wide as well. It was a stark contrast to some of the games last season where we were just aimlessly swinging in crosses however.

That said, I prefer to see Fellaini in a box to box role as that is - in my opinion - what he is best at.

<i>That</i> said, we have struggled to create chances and score goals recently. Our defence has actually conceded very few goals in the last few months - our problems have been at the other end of the pitch despite our array of world class attacking talent. With this in mind, I really dont mind LVG trying something a bit different. Pace is all well and good, but pace is not useful when the opposition is parking the bus (acceleration and agility are a different matter..) as we will likely not be counterattacking but rather trying to break down a stubborn defence, as was the case tonight. In these situations, having someone high up the pitch who can win the ball in the air and present a threat is invaluable, as it gives us an option.
Plenty of times last season, it wasnt just that we were crossing the ball endlessly, it was that the opposition <i>let us, </i>they were not worried about us crossing because they could defend it. Tonight, the fact that we could actually pose a threat from our crosses (due in no small part to Fellaini being up front) meant that they had to defend the flanks more vigilantly, which in turn opened up more space in the middle for the likes of Mata and Rooney to exploit.

4543~~~
Happy for Fellaini, played very well today best player on the park for me

4544~~~
Obviously an effective tactic, but not one I really like seeing us use, having him up top. Grabbed an assist, but I don't think he did too much all game. Him and RvP were both relatively ineffective, though in the second half Van Persie was getting chances at least. Didn't do poorly or anything, just average. Pointless playing him up top with Rooney wide, but it makes more sense then Fellaini in a wider position like he used on occasion when he played in a diamond.

4545~~~
This.

4546~~~
Fellaini chesting the ball in the box and hitting it almost with his outside of his foot is becoming his trademark finishing move.. He is best as CAM. Fullstop

4547~~~
Making Rooney his captain, selling Kagawa and Welbeck, giving Fellaini, Valencia and Young important roles in the team, happily leaving Herrera and Rafael on the bench, playing Di Maria as a striker, letting Phil Jones take corners.....

<i>Imagine</i> someone had suggested all that when he was appointed.....

4548~~~
It would be stupid to not use his height and aerial ability.

4549~~~
He played a part in our first two goals. We have struggled really bad to cut through teams who sit deep and stay compact narrow. He allowed us to combat that and it worked. He was bringing down balls with ease. Sure, you can complain all you want about it not being the ideal style but if the other team is going to give the open space on the wings and try to cram the box then you have to do what you have to do to break through them. Fellaini allowed us to do that today.

4550~~~
I thought his use up top was utilized well. I'm sure Cambridge had not planned for that at all. Using his height helped unlock them and led to a goal.

4551~~~
He did well enough, I still hate the idea of him playing up top though. We shouldn't have to play like that, or changing our tactics around to beat Cambridge.

4552~~~
Surprised to see him up top, especially when we had a striker in midfield, but I thought he did pretty well, especially in the first half, where he provided an assist for Mata, and was generally a threat in the box and linking up of play. Went quiet second half, though. 

Can't imagine this is something Van Gaal will do often, putting Fellaini up top. Think he just thought we'd try and play Cambridge at their own game (getting it into the box) and cause them problems, which we did.

4553~~~
At least, It will give West Ham something more to chew about dealing with potential tactic of Fellaini as no. 10.

4554~~~
That's the best way to use him, once we get the team fully sorted I hope we don't have to resort to it much, but LvG was smart to not use him in RM as he doesn't have the mobility that Rooney has.

4555~~~
He's been useful practically everytime he's played for a long time now. Always want to see him put on the bench at least.

4556~~~
I have no idea why people think he was some stoke type of player for Everton who scored because of his physicality. He played some real technical football there, had great passing and really good finishing for someone who isn't a forward. 

On his day he's simply unstoppable. His main weakness that I've noticed of him in his Everton days is his consistency and just how he slumps in form when he's low on confidence.

4557~~~
He's better near their box than in/near ours and it does make the crosses involve some kind of plan behind the tactic, a target I suppose, but I don't like it and it's not how we 'should' play.  Then again, the how we should play hasn't been creating chances for/with these forwards so it's sensible to change and go to a different Plan B, even if it's just for a while.  Which I hope it is - just a while.

4558~~~
Needs to start next game. Put him in the box as West Ham are short of CBs at the moment.

4559~~~
Seemed like one of the few times we actually looked for him on crosses, made a difference.

4560~~~
He's been quite poor as a proper striker given that his movement and positioning has been quite poor, overall, but I see why van Gaal put him there, and his plan did work. Fellaini offered an aerial threat that no one else offered, and when Cambridge tried to park the bus in the middle, at least we had someone dangerous to aim for from the wide areas, which meant that Cambridge couldn't just let our wide players have the ball. He won quite a few aerial duels in the box, and it was his header that allowed us to get the first goal. His presence attracted opposition defenders towards him, and this gave the likes of van Persie and Mata the spaces in the box to get the goals.

I don't think this will be van Gaal's long-term solution, though. I do believe that he might go for someone better than Fellaini who can provide the same physical presence, but for now, Fellaini is someone who can provide us with something different and, essentially, a plan B.

4561~~~
Because that's not what his role is when he's played as a target man.

4562~~~
Well, of course, but for much of the time, he stayed high up the pitch and was rarely involved in the match once we scored the first goal. Still, though, it worked out, so it's not as if Fellaini was useless up front.

4563~~~
I don't think any United fans know what style they want. We seem to moan when this team keeps the ball instead of attacking, we moan when this team attacks and loses the ball, we moan if this team plays a pass off the ground, we even fecking moan when we cross the ball.

In essence no one knows what they want accept a good old moan(You would've thought this of all seasons we would be a bit happier).

4564~~~
Do folks still hate him so?

4565~~~
Peter Crouch would have been a decent buy had LvG wanted options. 

LvG is confusing players and fans with his tactics.

4566~~~
It is so painful to watch when we just lump balls forward and hope Fellaini chests them down. That's surely not what we want to see. He's a waste upfront imo and we dont play well. Play him in midfield if we need steel but not upfront. I thought he didnt play well overall either even though he was involved in the goals

4567~~~
I don't see whats wrong with it honestly. Why limit yourself to 1 style of play, when you can have Fellaini become a battering ram too?. Him winning headers in the box and holding the ball up works in certain situations, and tonight it did. 

LVG had 2 options to play tonight, try neat fancy quick short passes to cut through a team, or try to get behind their defense and score cut backs/crosses. At present I feel we suit the 2nd option better. 

The main thing was apart from the 1st minute we looked comfortable all game, and Fellaini helped us with that.

4568~~~
It is/would be... but that's not what we were doing yesterday.

4569~~~
I didn't watch the match but is that how it panned out? What is LVG's problem with Rooney as a striker? If he was not satisfied with our midfiled options, he should have tried for a player this January. Continuously playing our best striker in midfield while playing actual midfielders as strikers (Di Maria, Fellaini) is more baffling than anything Moyes tried here, and that includes that dreadful Fulham game.

4570~~~
Moyes already knew that which is where he utilized Fellaini. When Fellaini started performing well for us in midfield, I hoped he had turned a corner with us and we would see his best abilities in midfield where he can use his strength and height but for some reason LVG is insisting on using him upfront and us pinging balls down his throat all match long.

4571~~~
I think that's a good assessment. It's difficult to pass your way through a team that parks the bus, as Arsenal have found many times. Which is where you need a plan B. Cambridge can pack the box as much as they want but it won't help if we have someone in there who will dominate in the air and decent delivery from the flanks. If anything, Van Gaal deserves credit for being tactically flexible enough to take a very different approach to the first leg.

4572~~~
We had plenty of crosses / long balls pumped forward with him being a target. IMO he's lost upfront, he doesnt have the right movement or skills do to so. He's not creative enough either. I prefer to play the ball on the ground and have Fellaini in midfield where he's better

4573~~~
Agreed, Fellaini is surpisingly good at turning with the ball, given his size. The most balanced midfield I have seen this season was Fellaini - Herrera and Blind. I can't remember what game it was in, but we looked very solid.

4574~~~
I don't get the idea if plan B was his approach. If the idea was to get Fellaini into the game with his height and heading ability as much as possible then play with proper wingers and full backs who can actually cross the ball. We had no wingers and played with Rojo who is not a regular left-back, who lacks crossing ability and McNair who is hardly a regular right back (although admittedly he was actually one of our best players).

4575~~~
No, but for Fellaini to be useful, we will need to play a game with a lot of crosses. Similar to how teams managed by Pulis do. Which at times we're doing. And for that Fellaini is useful (like yesterday when 2 of the goals came after he pinned down a cross).

I hope that we go away (far, far away) from that style of football. Saying that, there might be games when we need to play like that. And in those games, Fellaini would be very useful (that is why I changed my opinion on him from 'sell immediately' to 'probably keep him for the matches we need physicality and heigh').

But, many of United fans want to see United play better as a team. And for that, neither Rooney nor Fellaini should play in midfield. Herrera makes the team tick better than both of them. Rooney is a brilliant striker/No. 10 and should play there, while Fellaini should play when we need physicality, height or when we're chasing a goal and the other team has parked the bus. But not if we want to play free-flowing ball, which I think is what we should aim for.

4576~~~
I think that he is (currently) better at crossing than Shaw. I also think that we made very good crossing yesterday (which was kind of unusual for us).

So, I think that was exactly the plan, and it worked considering that the first two goals came from crosses aimed at Fellaini.

4577~~~
Nah, apart from the first 5-10 minutes, which were a bit crap - we generally passed the ball around and looked to work it out wide before getting it into the box - it wasn't a case of pumping long balls forward at all. The problem was that too often we crossed from way too deep - and crossing from deep is seldom as effective as crossing from closer to the box... when we actually worked the ball to the byline we looked dangerous.

There's nothing wrong with crossing the ball (unless you're doing it ad nauseam when it's clearly not working) but you have to be smart about it, and when we were smart about it yesterday, we threatened.

4578~~~
Yea it's pretty strange reading this thread again. I wasn't content with him being played as a striker and laughed my ass off but I think that yesterday's tactic defended itself, comfortable 3-0 win and total control after first 15 minutes or so. We hardly lumped the ball and I don't think we've been crossing all that much more than we would be if Falcao was playing instead of him.

4579~~~
With respect I don't see Rojo being the better crosser. How many goals came from crosses from actual full backs?

4580~~~
One goal came from RvP's clever play in the area. The other came from a corner, and the 3rd from a shot outside the area. 

No direct goals came from wide areas.

4581~~~
He's definitely got a role to play in the squad but I can't stand seeing him up top in place of Rooney which then means Herrera only gets 20 minutes here and there.

4582~~~
Aye - I mean, most of our attacks started in the attacking third anyway (the number of times our pressing - which was very good - did in Cambridge, and them gifting us the ball high up the pitch was quite amusing) - and even when they didn't, we had a free run up until quite far past the half-way line pretty much, so it's not like we even were in the right areas of the pitch to hoof it long.

4583~~~
Who are they, though? Shaw has shown that his biggest weakness is crossing. Valencia's delivery was awful in the first leg and Young wasn't fit enough to start the game. He could have maybe started Rafael but, as it turned out, the bloke he did pick at RB was arguably our best player. So again, credit where it's due.

4584~~~
The opener did.

4585~~~
That's the same goal.

The first goal from a Di Maria cross from the byline.

The chance that led to the corner for the 2nd goal was also an attack that developed from a wide area.

4586~~~
Di Maria wasn't playing as a winger.

4587~~~
Well, the Mata goal came after Fellaini pinned down a cross and then later the ball went to Mata. The second one came from Di Maria cross which reached Fellaini, whose shot got blocked and went to RVP.

About Shaw-Rojo, I think that Rojo is the better crosser though there is not much into that. He made a few good crosses yesterday IMO.

On general point though, I agree with you and I don't like much this approach of pinning a lot of crosses to Fellaini. It won't work against teams that do not allow us to keep the ball for 70% of the time, or against teams which are better than us at that aspect (and a lot of teams in EPL are taller and stronger than United).

It just can be a good alternative at times when the plan A isn't working. But shouldn't be used as plan A (which we are doing under LVG, in fact that seems to be almost the only way of attack).

4588~~~
Well no, but he was the wide points of the diamond, so there was onus on him to put in crosses - as there was with Rooney (who, as an aside, spent a lot of the game on the far touchline... especially in the first half).

4589~~~
So pretty much every game United's only way of attack is pinging balls to Fellaini in the penalty box?

No. That's ridiculous even by RedCafe standards.

4590~~~
How many touches do we need to go back to prove a point?

What I'm trying to say is Fellaini playing as a striker with heading ability as a reasoning then play with wingers and full backs. 

Di Maria, and Januzaj could have played as wingers.

4591~~~
I don't really get your point, Sults. Surely you saw the dozens of crosses we kept pumping into the box? Irrespective of the formation we played (which was fairly fluid IMO) we clearly used the width of the pitch very well and put a lot of decent crosses into the box.

4592~~~
They could have done - but we still had more than adequate width in the system we played with yesterday. Yes, The width would have been stronger with more natural wingers on the pitch, but it's not like it wasn't there. It was Rooney and Di Maria's job to provide it, along with McNair (who had a very good game) and Rojo.

4593~~~
LvG is overcomplicating the game, and we're trying to justify yesterday's approach. Basically, we could have blown away Cambridge with simplicity despite him playing people out of their natural positions. Watching United play football has become a bore for me personally for the first time in more than 4 decades despite having a fantastic squad.

4594~~~
He had an impact yesterday but I didn't like the style. We should be able to beat Cambridge 3-0 with guile and skill rather than resorting to kicking it high for the big man. It's a bit depressing that this is what we resort to against such inferior opposition with Mata, Rooney, RvP and Di Maria in the team. 

And to play Rooney on the right wing because you need to make room for Fellaini in attack, is quite frankly insulting. Wonder how long he'll put up with it.

4595~~~
Cambridge were too poor (understandably) to counter our formation. I don't get why we see the formation last night being some sort of tactical genius from LvG. Looking back on the match last night even the commenters were confused with our tactics.

4596~~~
Absolutely!

4597~~~
This was roughly my assessment as well. It really was nothing like some of last season's games where we swung in endless crosses and looked hopeless. We worked the ball well and and attacked through the middle and down the flanks. Having Fellaini up front meant Cambridge could not simply sit back and let us cross the ball, so forced them to adapt.

4598~~~
Yea because Rooney is being played the whole fecking season in midfield / now on the right wing just in order to accomodate Fellaini.

Dear God.

4599~~~
Yet we failed to in the drawn game at their place. Hence we tried a different approach.

4600~~~
He's being played in midfield the whole fecking season in order to accommodate someone, be it Fellaini, RvP, a young kid not yet ready for the first-team or a guy getting picked on reputation rather than merit.

And Di Maria. Forgot him.

4601~~~
I didn't use a Stoke analogy initially but, now that you mention it, I'd certainly say he's more of a Jonathan Walters or an Andy Carroll than a Cazorla or Fabregas. He is probably better technically than the two former but there is no doubting that physicality is his main asset.

Although they've had a disappointing first half to the season, Everton are a much more footballing side under Martinez than they were under Moyes. They use McCarthy and Barry to keep the ball with Barkley in a more advanced, attacking role - their attacks stem from possesion-based football. Under Moyes they were about getting it into the box and winning second balls (in the air or otherwise). Fellaini was the main physical threat for Everton using the approach. 

I'm not having a go at Fellaini himself - he provides a useful alternative for United and, in the Premier League, you have to win ugly occasionally to challenge for titles. But I don't think he'll help the team to play the type of free-flowing football that is consistently needed over a season to win the league.

4602~~~
So he got the tactics wrong in the first game? 

Personally I thought the first game was not won due to us being away from familiar surroundings, high winds, and a bad pitch. This was at Old Trafford on a beautiful evening. We should be able to win most games against such opposition. I personally don't think it was due to a different approach but simply having superior players.

4603~~~
Why is Fellaini picked out as the player that's most unable to do that though? we've far worse players on the ball than him.

4604~~~
Because I disagree with the part in bold. Which midfielders do we have who are less comfortable on the ball than Fellaini?

4605~~~
I suppose to put it better, we've players that are prone to brain farts on the ball. Including Rooney when played in midfield. Fellaini was fine for the most part on the ball last night and has been for most of this season.

4606~~~
Well that's a slightly different argument because I wouldn't have Rooney in midfield in the first place.

But if you look at the actual midfielders: Blind, Carrick, Herrera, Mata etc. All of these players are far more comfortable on the ball than Fellaini in my opinion.

4607~~~
I thought the tactics in the first game were fine and I agree with your take on why we didn't win. I also don't think we won <i>because</i> of the different approach, I'm just explaining why I think he decided to try a slightly different tack.

To be honest, he could have sent probably have sent out 10 men in a 2-2-5 formation and we'd still have won but I don't really think the team he <i>did</i> select is worth getting worked up about. The Rooney in midfield thing has been going on all season and most of us hate it. It's obviously here to stay for this season, though. Whether that's because he really doesn't rate Rooney as a striker or thinks he brings something to midfield that the alternatives lack we might never know. But it's clearly a response to a squad of players that isn't where he wants it to be. So it seems reasonable to stop crucifying him for it unless it continues after this summer.

The other decisions in formation and tactics last night were really no big deal. A bit of squad rotation (which is essential to give game time to fringe players - in a season when we're playing so few games) and using Fellaini in an advanced midfield role to unsettle a defence and keeper that dealt very comfortably with the high ball the last time we played them.

I just think you're inclined to be very negative about Van Gaal so are looking for reasons to complain. I sympathise with your stance, as I've had my own reservations all season. You have to remember that we've endured weird team selection, tactics and formations with Fergie plenty of times before though. Usually during transitional seasons (remember when the fans used to chant "attack! attack! attack!" or the Alan Smith and Rio Ferdinand as CM experiments?) We've also endured some really dull football, in the very recent past under Fergie. So I do think you're exaggerating about this season being the worst football you've watched in 40 years. We've had plenty of ups and downs but the downs were always ignored (by you and me anyway) because we had 100% faith in the manager to turn things round. It seems unfair to be constantly on Van Gaal's case, when he's probably just going through the same difficult period Fergie often went through when he had a squad that was missing the last few pieces in his jigsaw. I think we have to be patient and forgive the occasional eccentricity. Last night was an utterly dominant performance that got us the result we needed. Seems churlish to use it as yet another excuse to criticise IMO.

4608~~~
It doesn't matter if you wouldn't have Rooney in midfield and it doesn't change the argument because LVG has played him there many times now. I agree that the players you've listed are better on the ball, but I don't think that Fellaini is doing anything bad enough to merit the 'can't play free flowing football' tag. His passing and ball control is relatively good.

4609~~~
Good post!

It's true LvG is starting to get on my nerves with his selections and the quality of football on offer despite having really outstanding talents at his disposal.

4610~~~
Starting to? He's been on my nerves all fecking season!

Still, I'm trying to be philosophical. I always thought Fergie's successor faced a hell of a job and I was determined to be patient. I'm kind of annoyed with myself for being so quick to criticise. From here on in, I'm going to be a bit less judgemental and look for signs of improvement, rather than the other way round.

4611~~~
Yes but what I'm saying is Rooney isn't a midfielder to begin with - it's essentially an experiment that most of us would probably like to see come to an end. I'm comparing designated midfielders with midfielders. Even if Fellaini is a better option than Rooney in midfield, and it is an if, it doesn't change the list of other alternatives available.

We'll probably have to agree to disagree on the last point. I think playing Fellaini in midfield would hinder our chances of playing free-flowing football over a sustained period of time - simply because we have better, more capable, options who suit that particular style better.

4612~~~
There's a lot of things that are hindering our chances of playing free flowing football, I suppose that's my main point. I think it's unfair that Fellaini is the main culprit. Yeah, we'll agree to disagree though.

4613~~~
One question, would you like to play someone like Crouch up front for us? That is pretty much how it looks like we can use him there and he will offer some aerial threat but it is not the way we should play. 

I think his best position is as 10 but we have got many good 10s, if he is shifted to the right side of midfield he rather crosses than is the target man at the end of crosses if he is up front but then it seems almost our main tactic to go wide and put some crosses in. If he played as 10 he could arrive in the box late and could help little bit at the top of the midfield to gain some strength and he is good at combining there, giving one twos and instinctive shooting, volleys etc. Just like he played for toffies against us and in his best season there.

But again we have got different and better options. Rooney is better option in this system, he had his best games there this year.

Good option coming from bench to change the tactics imo, Herrera should start any day ahead of him regarless his "leightweight" stature

4614~~~
That comparison is not quite fair. You're comparing two players who are of really poor quality to two players who are considered one of the best at what they do. I know you're trying to compare their roles but it doesn't give the full picture. Saying he's more of an Andy Caroll to me is as absurd as saying he's like Fabregas. Personally, I think he's really unique and a lot of his technical play goes over-looked. So yeah physicality is his main asset but it would be pretty useless without his technical ability (and yes I count his first touch on his chest part of that ability)

My definition of a "footballing side" might be different. I'm not of the school of thought that Arsenal = total football. The best teams almost always have a balance to them. I found Everton's Moyes side really good at establishing that balance and organization. Again I know you haven't said this but many here compare Moyes' Evertone to something like Stoke which is totally wrong. They played some good attacking football at times but always had a solid base.

It's also not about how Fellaini can help our "free-flowing football" (though I can debate that he does help in that aspect as well. Just because a player is physical doesn't mean he holds up the ball too often. If you notice he likes to pass/play forward). You say this but I'll emphasize on it: he's a very useless player to have in the squad that can easily slot in the first team if either plan A fails, we face a different type of team or go for a different set up. He gives us plenty of options and top teams always have such options under their sleeve.

4615~~~
I wouldn't say it's an unfair comparison. Walters scored a hat-trick at the weekend and Carroll has scored a few in the last few months so they're not exactly of "really poor quality". They have strengths that are more similar to Fellaini's strengths than the strengths of Cazorla or Fabregas. The latter two players were just two players I picked of a certain style - but the point is in Mata, Carrick, Herrera and Blind we have four players who are superior ball players to Fellaini. So why use Fellaini if we're playing it on the deck?

I haven't got the stats to hand but I'd imagine Martinez's Everton are on the ball a lot more than Moyes' Everton were. I would see such a statistic as an indicator of being a more footballing side.

Well it is about how Fellaini can contribute to a certain style, if that's the style we're looking to play. That's what he needs to be measured on and, ultimately, there are better technical players at our disposal. I presume you haven't meant to say I called him useless because I clearly said he "provides a <i>useful</i> alternative". But the key word here is alternative.

4616~~~
I don't see what is wrong with playing him in that role, he is at his best when the ball is in the air, it's as simple as that, you don't play fellaini for his passing or movement, you play him because of his physicality and aerial ability. I thought he did ok yesterday and will be important against west ham, I think LVG will use him in certain games to do a job and that will be his role for however long he remains at the club. 

If the manger gets in the players he wants in the summer and can get the team playing how he wants I think fellaini will be one of the biggest losers in terms of game time but that is a problem for next season.

4617~~~
Is Fellaini the problem of our awful dire style of football? When he was out injured and we only won 1 in 5 games, did we play much better?

4618~~~
Is Fellaini the only problem with our style of football? No.

Did we play well in his absence this season? No.

Do either of those questions change any of my points above? No.

4619~~~
Well said.

4620~~~
There's a time and a place where he should play there. Against Cambridge it was a decent pick as they couldn't handle him in the air at all. It does make the football worse. This was the first game in a long long time that we played with Mata and Di Maria in midfield and no scrubs in midfield. Play wasn't that great really. I thought, especially in the first half, Fellaini was getting in the way a lot of the times. He was going near Mata when Mata was trying to opening himself up and often he went far out left where Di Maria's space was. That's basically stifling the two most creative players. Not cool.

4621~~~
I've not delved properly but a quick google puts Moyes 2012-3 team on 52% possession compared to Martinez' 2013-4 team on 53%. Given that Everton have been woeful this season I can't imagine they're looking any more impressive in that department this season. The idea that Moyes' team played bad football is rejigging history to fit the narrative of Moyes' time at United, in his last season especially they actually played pretty good football. I remember thinking at the time that their reliance on goals coming from good team play rather than individual brilliance was in contrast to how we were scoring goals at the time.

Coming back to Fellaini, he's perfectly capable of playing football on the floor. He puts in a huge defensive shift whilst passing forward more than he gets credit for, keeping the ball moving and keeping possession well. What he doesn't have is the eye for a killer pass than Herrera does, but he's assisted/scored a fair few goals from set-pieces already this season so he clearly has worth in that department. His value to the team comes because he's completely different to our other midfield options whilst also being able to play the patient possession style LVG wants. The strengths of the likes of Rooney, Di Maria, Mata and Herrera all overlap whilst Fellaini offers us a different (and valuable) dimension.

4622~~~
Agreed. Baines and Mirallas played some great stuff in Moyes last season at Everton. Agree with the entire post tbh.

4623~~~
He's a #10.

To be honest, he shouldn't fit into our strongest 11, but he's a good option to have to bring on if we need a goal, or for rotation.

4624~~~
I can't believe I'm going to say this but get him on up top, at least the ball will stick when it gets up there, it couldn't stick to RvP or Falcao is they were covered in glue.

4625~~~
It's the sensible option. If we're going to play hoof ball then Fellaini is a must.

4626~~~
Couldn't agree more, countless balls up top and Falcao just stands there without a chance of actually getting it. Throw Fellaini in and at least he'll have a chance of getting on it.

4627~~~
Or we could, you know, try and play football which suits Falcao since he's a far better footballer than Fellaini.

4628~~~
Or maybe we should start tailoring our game plans around players who aren't past it and shit like Falcao. Fellaini has been much better season and needs to be on at HT.

4629~~~
He'll be the go to substitution now. He'll be on within the hour I think.

4630~~~
So it's not at all possible that Falcao could be having a bad season? He's automatically just gone to complete shit and is past it? As poor as he's been, I think it's a bit premature to completely write him off as a footballer.

4631~~~
He couldn't do any worse than falcao so why not just throw him on while there is plenty of time left.

4632~~~
Can't emphasize more, we need him in midfield, more than any current player. Not even Blind.

4633~~~
Based on this season that is debatable.

4634~~~
Big Fellers enters the arena and United nick another result <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4635~~~
Why the feck is he always at the far end of the box whenever we get a set piece? Our deliveries rarely beat the first man let alone get to the far post.

4636~~~
It's not.

Fellaini has been miles better.

The man needs to be starting games. We look far better with him in the team.

4637~~~
Weird not to start him today. Did Giggs not advise LVG on how Big Sam's teams operate?

4638~~~
Lucky Moyes bought him. Changes games for us hoofing it to him. Defenders hate playing against him. 

Massive player for us whether you like it or not. Good on him.

4639~~~
I didnt think he played particularly well when he came on, but his record this season of us winning games with him starting/nicking results when he comes on and that sort of thing is quite astounding.

4640~~~
Should have scored his header. Thats what he's on there for

4641~~~
Maybe after all hoofing it to him is our answer to top 4, it is maybe not pretty but it surely has shown it can be effective.

4642~~~
The hate, the hate...

4643~~~
Falcao should have scored his 1 on 1 chance, Fellaini did well in the set-pieces today

4644~~~
Far from something awe-worthy but he added a new option to our play, something different for their defence to care about, just like Herrera would today I feel. With amount of our crossing and WHU's aerial threat it was fecking stupid not to start him.

4645~~~
I've been banging this drum for ages but he needs to play. Whilst he didn't get the assist for the goal he forced the mistake from the defender and generally speaking we look far more threatening with him on the pitch. Perhaps we'd have dealt better with Big Sam's set pieces had he started.

He's come on today as a Plan B, but he should be used as part of a varied Plan A. A gameplan where we're equally likely to score from a Fellaini knock-down as a Di Maria run is a far more difficult one to defend against than whatever our current 'Plan A' is.

4646~~~
He's feckin' great... has easily justified a start place.

4647~~~
Yes, Falcao and RVP should have scored their chances.

Fellaini should have scored his header

4648~~~
For any of the Fellaini haters who think he will be gone in the summer. Id say no chance.

He is officially our plan b and LVG I bet loves him a lot

(I do too <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>)

4649~~~
Thought he was pretty useless. A big man who can't play big.

4650~~~
Hate

4651~~~
This. Hoofing the ball to Fellaini is our plan B, I am sure Moyes is proud.

4652~~~
If he started, I believe there's a big chance we'd have won this game.

4653~~~
The header was impossible to score from, was too high for him. Did well to even get close to putting it on target.

Having said that, I thought he could have done better when he came on. Still, made an impact.

4654~~~
This game was ideal for him to start and I'm not sure why he didn't really.

4655~~~
He's much more than a player to just put on up top, in my opinion. Put him in the midfield, and allow him to make late runs into the box - similar to his goal against Hull. By doing this, we can still have his physical presence in midfield.

4656~~~
It's about as pretty as a fat chick with a cock but "Angel passes to the big man" are getting us into better scoring positions than the hopeless strike partnership.

4657~~~
He should have started. At the very least LvG should have realised he needed to come on sooner than he did. Games like West Ham away are the games that suit him. He's really grown on me. I was probably his biggest detractor on here.

4658~~~
Do not understand why he didn't start, perfect type of player needed in the middle of the pitch for today.
Do not understand anything Van Gaal does.

4659~~~
I thought he was average after he came on. He didn't do anything special, although his presence played a big part in the goal I think. However this is all on the manager. He should have started in midfield, not been forced to come on and play as a target-man. He's better than that. We struggled all match defending set pieces - Fellaini would have helped that. Blind was left isolated in midfield all match - Fellaini would have helped that too.

Personally I would have had him and Herrera on at halftime but LvG for whatever reason didn't. He took too long to make the sub too.

4660~~~
Almost had a great goal too.

Although seems like he's still not fully fit.

4661~~~
Why don't we play Fellaini from the start?  He's our best (only?) attacking threat lately and our Plan B is better than our Plan A!

4662~~~
He should be starting, our best form coincided when he was a regular in the starting lineup, drop either RVP/Falcao and put Rooney upfront to make way for Fellaini.

4663~~~
The only issue I have with him is that when he plays, we’re too much direct in our play.

I don’t think that he can be the player we need to balance the team in our midfield. He excelled when he played as a number 10, when he was close to the box and playing high on the pitch. He provides an extra solution to the midfield.

And he has to compete, normally, Mata and Rooney who are also good at that

He should have begun the game as a second striker against the Hammers yesterday to give a solution when our defense where struggling to find somebody free under pressure

4664~~~
He should start every game. In central midfield. Ok as a plan B up front when we're chasing the game but all his best performances this season have been as a CM. We'd still have the advantage of his height at set piece.

4665~~~
Last year has wasn't playing big. This season he is. 

Most hate it but I don't mind lumping to a big man. Difference with us is that the knockdowns fall to Rooney RVP Di Maria Mata etc.

4666~~~
I don't mind it because it - by default - means that there is at least one person on the pitch for us who isn't acting like a complete fanny.

4667~~~
West Ham were playing with a makeshift CB. So I would have started with him up front anyway as it was known West Ham had CB problems.

He is a handful unlike our current strikers.

4668~~~
IF we could play sexy on the floor football then fine, but at present we can't, especially away from home.

4669~~~
If that is the best LVG can come up with then we better hope Fellaini performs. I hope we play him in midfield rather then upfront

4670~~~
How's this going for you? You seem to be sticking with it from what Ive seen.

4671~~~
If we are going to play dohsgite football and create absolutely feck all through craft, imagination and speed...like we are right now then start him in the number 10 role. He causes havoc and even we are capable of hitting him with a long ball.

Quite frankly he would be more use in the current style of utter shite we are intent on playing.

4672~~~
Why? He is positionally shite in CM, can't dribble, can't pass and is a liability in the tackle. What possible qualities does he have to play centre mid based on the above?

4673~~~
This seems like a fair and objective assessment.

4674~~~
I think Fellaini is a useful nuisance. You can see defences don't know how to handle him, Jesus he caused us all sorts of problems.

Great thing about Fellaini is that he creates space for others while being that nuisance. I have no issues with keeping hold and using him so.

However his general game just isn't good enough. Christ the amount of ball he gives away in the middle of the park with a simple 10 yard pass is astonishing at times. Stick him in behind Rooney/Falcao/Wilson/RVP with Di Maria/Herrera and Blind behind him and I think you have a real threat.

4675~~~
I don't understand why he still gets stick. He has been one of our only consistently good performers during this entire season. I for one think he deserves more starts in the current set up... and long term he'd be a great squad member too. 

Do I want him to be a first team regular past this season? no but I do like the fact he brings something else tactically to the table and he isn't a technical eyesore as some make out.

4676~~~
Play Fellaini as a false 9, he'd be better than RVP and Falcao at this rate.

4677~~~
I think he is a decent option...but I don't want to see him in CM. Further forward I think he provides something very different.

4678~~~
Considering the appalling starting XI selected, add in the form of our "attackers" (RvP, Falcao, AdM), add in Rooney's poor play in midfield....then yeah, if we'd started a balanced formation with either of (or even ALL!) Fellaini/Herrera/Mata in midfield, it would have increased our chances of victory ten fold IMO.

Makes the team selection, and the constant use of Rooney in midfield fecking infuriating.

4679~~~
Rooney is a forward. Stop it. It's fecking nothing short of incompetent management IMO.

4680~~~
Based on this season's form, and the form of others, you are spot on.

But I think the objective answer is a couple of things, IMO.

i) one, is his price tag, and association with Moyes - it's not fair on Fellaini, but it is what it is. Some will never let it go
ii) his playing style - I think most of us "dream" of United playing brilliant, direct football, and we're comfortable in possession without panicking when pressed. Fellaini seems to be utilised best as a number 10, higher up, which at his very best, causes problems from "long balls". Yeah it's a great plan B to have (like yesterday) but it's not what we should be striving towards. Simply put, he's way too expensive to be an impact sub.

Just as a side note though - I agree with what you said. I don't dislike the guy - but essentially he's not what we need at either DM, CM or AM, IMO.

4681~~~
But he is an option further forward for me. Especially against sides who are playing 10 behind the ball. It's different and if plan A is misfiring(as it seems to be more often than not) he is a menace and decent as a plan B.

4682~~~
This should be our team:

4683~~~
Yeah, you'll get no disagreement from me there. As i said, opinion is just - he's an extremely "expensive" plan B, and I'd assume that would be another issue some would have with him.

My personal opinion on Fellaini - good footballer (and very good footballer if used in his position higher up), but it limits the team into playing a certain way - mainly lumping in tons of crosses/long balls up to him. So yeah, if you don't mind building our game plan around him, he might get close to justifying that price tag, but it's not really something i would want us to do.

4684~~~
Proving to be fairly effective this season, though not for the reasons that we would like. Regardless of how our team has lined up, we do seem to be playing a fair amount of speculative long balls, which plays straight into Fellaini's hands (chest?). He's not the sort of player to be involved in intricate build up or clever one-twos, and his speed of thought is pretty slow relative to top class midfielders. I'm not sure if that is to do with his size, but he does look clumsy. First touch and passing are not his strengths, and when he plays a deeper role he gets caught out of position a fair bit. Can be decent at defending higher up the pitch though, where his strong tackles are less likely to result in a dangerous free kick, and is actually capable of winning the ball back in dangerous areas. 

The funny thing is that Moyes couldn't play him in this advanced position despite it being his best, because he was scared of the press saying that he's turned United into a long ball team. LvG is using him in the only position which really suits him and he looks a better player for it. The problem is that his best position is as an advanced midfielder/sort-of-no. 10, which is exactly where we are overstocked at present. Is a great player at what he does, but is a bit one dimensional to fit in our vision for the future. Who'd have thought at the start of this season we'd see so many posters clamouring to get him in the starting lineup. It's actually hilarious. Fwiw I think that we're going to need him to grind out some ugly results and get ugly points to reach top 4.

4685~~~
Fellaini is better when the ball is played at his feet than when we are bombarding him with long balls.

4686~~~
How's it going? Not great! Still, I've set out to take a long term view and I'm going to stick with it for as long as I can. The fact we've only lost 1 in 17 is a big deal. Becoming hard to beat is a great first step in building any decent team and he's achieved that much already, which is a big improvement on last season. Some of the team selections he makes are really hard to understand but Fergie made loads of strange decisions in his time in charge too. By contrast, Moyes was far more likely than either Fergie or Van Gaal to pick a team that 90% of redcafe would agree with and that didn't end well at all.

4687~~~
He's not my preferred midfielder either but I just dont see him playing upfront

4688~~~
Not how people on here felt last season. For what it's worth I agree though.

4689~~~
Blind - Fellaini - Herrera should be the base we build around for the rest of the season.  Sadly, I doubt we will ever see it happen on a regular basis.

4690~~~
We weren't hard to beat last season at all. One things that's been a refreshing improvement is how we've made Old Trafford a bit of a fortress again.

4691~~~
Is it okay to say he's a good player yet?

4692~~~
We were champions at the time, so we should've been well past that stage.

Instead we messed up our transition from the Ferguson Era, so we have to work our way up again.

4693~~~
We actually weren't that hard to beat though, and I don't remember us losing only 1 out of 17, or anything close to that. Plus, Moyes took over a squad that finished as champions. Van Gaal took over a squad that finished seventh.

4694~~~
Better with him in the team than out of it. Results prove that.

4695~~~
I have to agree. The best run of 6 wins (Palace, Arsenal, Hull, Stoke, Southampton, Liverpool) came when he was playing 90 minutes. Even a Chelsea draw and the City game that was very close until Smalling got red carded.

4696~~~
I'm happy the guy has turned it around. I haven't been his biggest fan but the loud, ironic cheer he got everytime he touched the ball in our friendly at Old Trafford at the start of the season was shameful. When he plays, there actually is some aggression on the pitch and we create a couple of chances (which is a couple more then usual).

4697~~~
Indeed, funny how people tried to attribute that all to Carrick

4698~~~
He played in midfield IIRC and that is where he should play only imo

4699~~~
Yep.

4700~~~
I have been selfishly harsh on him, but he is a good player and always have been.

4701~~~
Thank god someone else thinks this. I do think some simply see a big man and go with the cliched assumption.

4702~~~
Considering we don't seem to have a plan A at the moment (if we do, I have no idea what it is), Fellaini continues to provide the "best" plan B option.

4703~~~
I agree with you, but where do you play him in the XI for a starting role? When he comes on, he plays almost behind the strikers, so that would be the tip of the diamond..

4704~~~
I think that Van Gaal’s B plan should be tactical changes rather than player changes. Switching from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2, or 3-5-2….

But I really do like what Fellaini became to us. He’s very important for our game. When he started all those games in November/December, he was study, precise and was always a proper player. Now he’s benched sometimes, he proves that he can be trusted and changes things when he plays

I remember that in desperate moments, we had Stevie Bruce upfront, or more glamourous, Sheringham, and we had long balls, so I can’t see what’s really wrong with playing our B plan in this kind of games…

The mistake was not playing Fellaini from the start against West Ham

4705~~~
I think playing behind either one or two strikers is where his strengths are best utilised. To be honest, I wouldn't like to see him starting as the default option, but we are so devoid of ideas that there is merit in playing him.

4706~~~
Agreed. Against a physical side like West Ham he should have started.

4707~~~
agreed , but we were the aggressors in that match. stoke , west ham , everton. but how about him in when facing a team like le arse where he can be aggressive v a team that doesn't like the elbows etc. i think they'd hate playing against him. good option off the bench.

4708~~~
More effective than most against West Ham, still can't get a game. Big names not big performances are what count at United these days clearly.

4709~~~
It is starting to look that way. Honestly I am borderline disgusted that RVP and Falcao are both starting again after such a bad performance last weekend.

4710~~~
Don't get why he's not starting tbh. Probably been our best outfield player this season.

4711~~~
I've never been a huge fan of his but hell, he should be starting ahead of RvP or Falcao for sure. Still wouldn't be in my first choice 11 ahead of Mata or Herrera but he should be ahead of those strikers we have up front

4712~~~
Don't play RVP & Falcao if you aren't going to play the creative midfielders to supply them.

Looks life another borefest is ahead and Van Gaal will bring on "Mario Fullarney" to save the day.

4713~~~
I thought he was going start in place of Adnan today

4714~~~
Don't think he ever was to be fair, looking at LVG's recent comments about Herrera he sees Rooney, Mata, ADM as his opponents and not Fellaini. No idea what to make out of it though.

4715~~~
I'm not sure why I thought that but he's played Fellaini in midfield before, so I'm finding it a bit odd why he's all of sudden seems to class Fellaini as a striker. All a bit strange.

4716~~~
Fellaini did a good job in midfield too which makes it all the more strange.

4717~~~
He's better upfront then Falcao and RVP <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

No, seriously.

4718~~~
This guy.

4719~~~
Like Herrera he's not had the best all-round game today but has come up with the goods. Made up for both of them.

4720~~~
I feel happy to be one of the few who stuck by him through last season. He wasn't good at all, but knew he had a part to play. Hope that's the winner.

4721~~~
He's an enigma.

Was pure shite tonight. Couldn't pass, fouled everything and was generally crap. Yet he makes things happen in the box.

4722~~~
He's been crucial for us at times this season.

4723~~~
Strangest feeling just happened, just felt abit of Love for Fellaini <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> He's actually looking like a value for money signing if he keeps on putting in performances and scoring goals. Fairplay to him. Future key player?

4724~~~
He's actually quite fantastic upfront isn't he? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4725~~~
He could be like a good Heskey to our shit Owen (Wilson).

edit - Only joking, I do rate Wilson

4726~~~
Bench RVP and Falcao and put him upfront from now on.

4727~~~
He's done more up top in 20 minutes then Falcao has managed in about 3 months.

4728~~~
He's proven that he can play for you in midfield and as a striker. Great versatility.

4729~~~
Absolutely spot on.

4730~~~
Rubbish in midfield but has done really well up front, much better option than falcao.

4731~~~
Will usually do a job in midfield and will always be a threat when pushed up front. Nice player to have in your squad....

4732~~~
He's 27. Not exactly one for the future. He still doesn't look anything like a £27m footballer, though he is handy for when you decide to play long ball football.

4733~~~
He's actually proving to be quite a good signing this season. Makes it even more amazing that he looked that poor under manager who worked with him previously and brought him to England but manages to put in far better performances under a manager who probably didn't know he existed before he came here.

4734~~~
We've played better with him all season. Not sure why people are surprised as he's terrorised teams in that position for Everton for many a season.....

4735~~~
Scary to think if he never got injured he would have probably been sold to Napoli.

Probably our MVP at the moment.

4736~~~
feck it - play fellanini and rooney upfront - certainly a lot better then rvp and falshit

4737~~~
Not sure why he's casted as a being long ball donkey exclusively, he gives the ball away a lot less than the likes of Di Maria, Rooney and even Herrera.

4738~~~
Hard to believe its not Scholes, its Fellaini you know!

4739~~~
If I ever have children, one of them will be Marouane, another one will be Fellaini.

4740~~~
Well played lad.

4741~~~
He is so loveable

4742~~~
Biggest grin on my face when he smashed that rebound in. Gets his head down, works hard, is determined. And bloody effective more than anything. I like him more every time I see him.

4743~~~
Our plan B worked once again <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

4744~~~
Right now I prefer him to Falcao & RVP tbh. He's done really well this season. start him up top.

4745~~~
Yes. 

And our winning record with him playing is astonishing.

4746~~~
He's a legend. Still can't believe that some don't see him as a 'United player'.

4747~~~
that's pushing it quite a bit <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4748~~~
Marou-ane-ane-ane
He's our Belgian afroman
Marou-ane-ane-ane
He'll elbow your fecking nan

To the left, to the right
To the Moroccan beats all night
He is class on the grass
And he shits on Fabregas

4749~~~
Fellaini is a great plan B, I would not go full out with fellaini playing off rooney, but when we need to try and win a game I would use fellaini and rooney in the last 35 minutes of the game. I was one of the fans that wanted him gone, but like always a foolish mindset to go in. I think he should be starting games for us, and a great asset to have especially in away games, and a plan B when we are chasing a game

4750~~~
He could be our Jan Koller with hair obviously.

4751~~~
I am actually beginning to like him as a striker with Rooney. Never thought I would say that.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4752~~~
Obviously we'll be looking for a more fluid style next season but with RvP and Falcao offering next to nothing I think Fellaini as the target man with Rooney playing around him is the way to go for the remainder of the season.

4753~~~
I've always said it, play him in away games. Opponents can't handle him.

4754~~~
I would much rather see those two up front than RVP and Falcao, both can drop into midfield at times as well to make an extra man there. Rooney gives us more pace and fellaini is ten time better with his back to goal in comparison to falcao, he is also better in the air and probably quicker as well.

4755~~~
One defender on him is not enough. He has been very useful once again.

4756~~~
He is on form and should be playing most games.

4757~~~
I actually quite like him as a striker <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>.

He can hold the ball up well and outmuscle defenders allowing for our nippier players like Di Maria/Herrera or whoever to receive a lay off in the box and get a shot away, with the centre backs occupied by the big man. Certainly in away games it is a good option anyway. I think he's vastly better up there than in midfield.

4758~~~
Immense player. Just holds the defender off and opens up passing lanes for balls into him. And his chest control is one of the best I've ever seen - the one from that De Gea miss-kick was amazing.

4759~~~
this

4760~~~
Oh how the tune has changed on this forum

4761~~~
He has proved he is a good plan B(altough our plan A isn't far from plan B tbf). He hasn't proved he is a good midfielder because for his every good performance in midfield there were at least one or two bad ones. I like him more as a forward than as a midfielder.

4762~~~
Fellaini was unplayable as a forward player, and that is where I've always felt he does the most damage. I was pleased he got to start tonight because his recent performances, barring one dodgy half against Cambridge, have all been productive. The likes of Van Persie and Falcao have been allowed to coast through games on reputation, while Fellaini has had to sit on the bench despite proving a game changer several times (and recently too). Lately I've had the feeling that big names are being rewarded above big performances under Van Gaal. Fellaini deserved to start, he deserved to have the chance to influence the game. Until someone else comes along and plays that role off the front better than him, Fellaini deserves to keep his place. No more favouritism Mr Van Gaal.

4763~~~
I wish people would stop using this phrase, when Fellaini has been arguably one of our most effective outfield players this season.

4764~~~
When we move to to a plan B, yeah.

4765~~~
Even with our plan A, he's a better option than any of our strikers other than Rooney. And a pretty good option in midfield too.

4766~~~
Because our "plan A" has been superb

4767~~~
Our plan A is passing the ball about in defence, plan B is more direct!

4768~~~
When he plays up front he does a fine job holding the ball up and he doesn't have a negative effect on our buildup play like in midfield, so I'm more than happy to see him getting chances up there

4769~~~
Was glad he started today. Important player for us in these type of games. There will be plenty of games in the league when he'll be needed to start too. Can be a right mischief to handle. Dug deep today. Hats off to the guy. Lesser players would have just left the club after the abuse/lack of support he received.

4770~~~
Poor 60 minutes in attacking midfield, then did an excellent job upfront for 30 minutes.

4771~~~
Well what happened when falcao came off? And we put fellaini closer too rooney? it became a plan B. So yes fellaini became a plan B, when the shape was changed from falcao and rooney, to fellaini and rooney, that is another alternative

4772~~~
A complete liability in midfield, he should always be as far up the pitch as possible.

Why it's taken so long for van Gaal to realise this I'm not sure. He's genuinely one of the worst passers of a football I've seen play for United. You don't want Fellaini picking the ball up off Blind, with 20-30 yards of open space to head into, he just doesn't know what to do with it.

Get him up front, as far away from our goal and as close to theirs as possible. He should only ever face forwards when he's in their 18 yard box.

4773~~~
This season some doing the same regarding other players

4774~~~
Not sure why people are claiming his passing was bad tonight when he actually had over 89% accuracy which was the best on our team. Obviously he doesnt have the eye for a pass or the passing range of some of our other players and everyone knows that but saying hes a bad passer just isnt true

4775~~~
Agreed...manager too

4776~~~
What it means is that we wouldn't need him if we were playing the way we would like. Only because we're so disjointed are his skills needed.

4777~~~
I prefer him in midfield, where he can make runs from deep into the box, but he could score so many goals playing off the front man, as he did with Everton. Great player to have in the squad, in my opinion.

4778~~~
Still don't like him or the way we play with him in the side. We shouldn't have to resort to long diagonal balls or hoofing it up top all game to get something happening offensively. The only reason we need Fellaini as a Plan B is because our Plan A is to stick as many players as possible out of position and see just how slowly we can move the ball around.

4779~~~
He's big and burly
His hair is dark and curly
Marouane, Marouane

4780~~~
Honestly I'd like to see us start the next match like we finished this one with Fellaini playing behind Rooney.

4781~~~
Good forward, poor midfielder. He isn't a good enough creative passer to play in midfield, but holds the ball up well upfront. 

Fellaini up top, quick wingers whipping crosses into him with England's version of Tim Cahill upfront next to him in Rooney, have we become David Moyes Everton?

4782~~~
The thing is when Fellaini plays up top it doesn't matter how we play he gives defenders a problem to think about. That is something we are seeing very rarely from other attacking players. We don't have to just launch the ball at him all game but I don't see a reason to be ashamed of having a tall player up front. He's got us out of some sticky situations this season and deserves to start. By having that option it creates oppurtunities and space for other players also. 
This is all coming from someone who gave him a lot of stick and never thought we should have signed him. If anything I just admire his determination and will to play well for this team after what was a v poor first season. That's more than I can say for some players at the moment.

4783~~~
Something must be fecked up with your screen or eyes then.

4784~~~
The thing with having Fellaini up front is that you don't have to use him as a target man for most attacks for him to affect the game. His mere presence means defenders have to worry about that possibility and adjust accordingly, which in turn leaves our other players with more space to work in.

4785~~~
Many people see what they want to see when it comes to Fellaini.

4786~~~
Effective player for us now. There'll be games when it's right to start him and in others he could be exactly what we need from a sub. He may have been expensive but that's done now, the important thing is he's producing good displays and will be an asset in the squad.

4787~~~
I have nothing but respect for a player who can take his chances when they are given, a hairy beast with a short memory for criticism and time spent on the bench.

Seeing such a physical player operate in the box was a revelation, he also deserves credit for his instincts and finishing. He was the right kind of player to use in a tie like this. He's exciting in his own right, creating space and chaos around him. I love that accurate, rising shot he takes from close range.

4788~~~
Who last season would have thought that Fellaini would be the CAF's MOTM whilst Falcao would be averaging around 3.8/10 ratings...

Good on Fellers, he offers something different and in the box is by far our most dangerous player.

4789~~~
The more I think about it, the more I see him bundling one over the line against Liverpool at Wembley to spoil Gerrard's party.

4790~~~
It would be cool if someone with video compilation skills can make one about his turn around? Last season everyone was making fun of him. Also TV shows "how does this (fellaini's picture) equal to 27 million" and what not. 

IDK. I just love emotional videos... I wonder what would be a fitting song.

4791~~~
Wait til he elbows one over the line in the final, and the story will be complete.

4792~~~
This long ball play to him is so overstated too. When he went up front we didn't just start hoofing balls in his direction. He was actually played in along the ground a few times and we continue to cross as we do with van Persie and Falcao in there. The difference is he is actually effective and wins the ball.

4793~~~
The most pleasing thing for me is, him being 'pain in the arse' for opposition defenders when we put him upfront and put crosses in. Him being 'pain in the arse' used to be my biggest worry when he was at Everton and we played them. Is/was he worth 27m is history and can't be changed. As long as he keeps working hard and provide us with such a solid plan B, I am happy.

4794~~~
Why?

Anyone can say he averaged 90%, but passing is a lot more than that - it's about making the correct decisions, being able to spot a team mate (and having the technique to pull it off), making yourself available etc. Fellaini doesn't have the touch, movement, spacial awareness or passing range required of a United midfielder - which is fine, it's not his game.

I have no problem with him playing much further up the field where he is very effective and where we are utilising his best attributes.

4795~~~
People were hoping he'd be gone by the end of last summer.

4796~~~
His overall play wasnt good, he didnt contribute much at all. He scored the goal, so fair play to him but him being played upfront cant be the solution, unless our game plan is to hoof it up towards him

4797~~~
His holdup play was more than fine, and he had the turn where he took the ball in, fashioned a chance and make the keeper save his shot. He was unlucky

4798~~~
You'd think that if he averaged 90% of his passes he must be doing something correct (and his average per season is around the same number, probably around 85% or so, mind). No, he's not the most creative player in our squad, far from it but it doesn't mean that he's 'the worst passer in United mifield', far from it, he's keeping things ticking and making things simple, no shame about it when you've got other players who are responsible for creation (and yet fail their duties). He was playing the game with his back to the goal so it's hard to expect fireworks from him too.

Can't really see where the 'doesn't have the touch, movement or spacial awareness' comes from too to be fair, sounds like a bunch of cliches, can agree about the passing range (although I can't really say I'm missing holywood passes from him).

4799~~~
This

4800~~~
That and the goal. Not much else though. He wasnt available except when we hoofed it, he didnt create much or brought others into play. I just dont believe that it is our best option to play him upfront and hoof it towards him. I prefer him in midfield with the licence to go forward

4801~~~
That gives us severe problems in the buildup, he's too happy to pass the ball backwards or square. We dont need that, we have Blind, Carrick, etc

4802~~~
So does he upfront where he does not add much to our general play except heading long balls

4803~~~
Thing is he's done quite well in big games in midfield - some might say very well but you'll get folks reverting back to target man syndrome. He didn't have a bad first half. He's not the reason the team play like Zombies for the first half. It's an attitude the term is going out with that needs to effects the whole team. People are critical of his passing, while some wank constantly over Blind who has done ok but has yet to prove he can play great offensive balls consistantly. Therefore a lot of his passing has been simple too. 

But some knew who we bought. So in this instance, we are benefiting from Fellaini up top because the ball is sticking. That's important. It sticks. You don't always get that with Robin or Falcao. You might with Rooney, depends how ambitious he is. But Fellaini don't run around like a wanker losing it all the time and that allows us to build higher up the pitch. That will give players confidence that as soon as they go forwards, the ball won't be played in behind them.

4804~~~
Van Gaal in full on cryptic mode:

4805~~~
He has fantastic chest control which he can use at any time up front, but almost never in central midfield as he has to vacate his position and go hang out near the strikers.

He has the strength to hold onto the ball under pressure from physical CBs and just needs to find a square or backwards pass from there to put a teammate into a good position, which is much more suited to his passing range as it generally wont matter if he slightly underhits a pass and he doesnt need to thread the needle with accuracy either.

And this season he's always been a threat when we can get decent balls into the box, he's popped up with some important goals. Some have definitely been from set pieces, but he's less of a liability in the meantime when he's doing a basic target man job up front.

There are obviously limitations to what he can do up front, hes not going to be very good running the channels or threatening runs in behind the defence. Someone else will have to do those things, but you generally wouldnt want him to be doing that anyway as you'd want him making himself available in the middle when you have the ball, not on the wing.

I actually wonder if he might be the best option when we play Wilson up front. Let him shoulder the target man responsibilities and look for flicks to set Wilson free.

Just like Andy Carrol, you can question how good the football is to watch but you cant question whether its effective.

4806~~~
With the shower of clowns we've got in central defence this season, he should start every game for his contribution at defensive set-pieces alone. Could have made all the difference against West Ham, for starters.

4807~~~
jones would have got in the way.

4808~~~
He's basically saying when we are playing so rubbish that we can't work the ball up the pitch, lumping it up big Fella up top does the job nicely.

4809~~~
He is by far our worst passer in midfield, everyone else is on another level. 

They're not cliches, they're what Fellaini lacks. He is not good enough to play in midfield for us and never ever will be. His performance against Bayern last year was the first time I had to laugh at a United player, he was on a different level to Carrick, let alone Kroos and Schweinsteiger. That's the level we should be aiming for.

4810~~~
So you say the likes of Smalling and Evans are better passers?

4811~~~
I have seen us shift around our players a lot but never Smalling and Evans into midfield.

4812~~~
He said in his previous post "worst passer ever at United", which I was referring to, not the midfield part...... But thanks for the comment nonetheless, as if I didn't know that.

 He can refer to himself as the worst passer as a midfielder, which is probably true considering he would be compared against Mata, Blind, Herrera etc. but he actually is in the top 10 most accurate passers in the team this season, which doesn't really back that ridiculous argument up.

4813~~~
I know it's not a very good way to judge a player but anyone know our win % with/without him? Reckon the difference is huge.

4814~~~
With:

W8 D3 L3 = 57%

Without:

W5 D5 L1 = 45%

so a higher win % with than without, but worth noting that in 2 of the 3 losses he played he was a late sub. No involvement in those two games would have seen a 66% ratio. Win/Loss excluding the draws actually works against him.

4815~~~
He played against "better" opposition too didn't he? I mean he started against Chelsea, City and Arsenal where you would expect us to probably drop more points. So to have a higher win % with him in the team is impressive. He definitely has a role with us now at least, even if just a squad player.

He was playing injured and bereft of confidence last season. If we played them again now I'd be confident he would put in a better performance. Not saying he would run the game, but he would be better.

4816~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so Quality > Pressure = Quality.

4817~~~
I brought a wrecking ball since you parked the bus.  A GIF of LVG operating a crane with Fellaini's head as the wrecking ball would be hilarious.

Edit: This will work
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/1zW9ENS.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/1zW9ENS.gif"/>

4818~~~
Could be in for a red today. All he seems to be doing to storming into players. Hopefully that yellow has calmed him down.

4819~~~
Change him now its still possible, shouldnt be more than a sub who comes on when we need a goal.

4820~~~
He is the only guy with some strength in the midfield. He should be a must in away games.

4821~~~
He is what he looks like...Shit on a stick

4822~~~
He's fixing brainless but that's what he's been put into the team to do. We're sacrificing a proper midfielder to play him as a third striker.

4823~~~
Playing Fellaini ahead of Mata is bizarre. This is just normal stuff from Fellaini.

4824~~~
This is the problem with Fellaini. Start him and this is the 2nd game in a row where he has ghosted the first half.

Right now, he'd be the man to be subbed to change it up. In a technical game, he's found wanting, more often than not. But if Swansea score and take the lead, a la Preston, he's the man we need to change the game and go direct with someone else to be the fall guy (probably RVP who has been no more as effective as Falcao thus far).

The Fellaini conundrum.

4825~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
He's got strength, though.

4826~~~
It's as if he purposely switches off his brain and decides to just commit stupid fouls after stupid fouls.

4827~~~
Real contrast of opinions on the match day thread

I think he has been pretty good today. Hold up play has been impressive

4828~~~
Me too. Yes, he's made a few fouls.

RVP should be the one to go.

4829~~~
He's been shite today and is going to get sent off anyway

4830~~~
I'm one of his biggest critics on here but I thought he was decent in the first half. Better than the other two strikers. If they're actually strikers, I can't really work out our formation.

4831~~~
Agreed but he's a liability now so he has to be subbed off. Shame he's a bit of an idiot. 

There's always that criticism of "if you play Fellaini you have to play long ball", but we've not done that at all and he's still been very useful. The only time's we've gone long to him is when De Gea had literally no other options and each and every time he's plucked it out of the sky with ease and started off another attack from a good position. Generally got involved pretty well in and around the box too.

4832~~~
Diamond ? With Fellaini playing just behind RVP and Rooney.

4833~~~
Agreed.

4834~~~
Not being used to his strengths today, he should be ahead of Rooney so Rooney can get onto the second ball.

4835~~~
A bit Jekyll and Hyde today. Some brilliant chest control and turns from him, but he's still a dirty bastard. I'd replace him with Mata for the second half.

4836~~~
Absolutely mental. People just see what they want to see.

4837~~~
Because of the yellow? If not his performance does nowway warrant the hook at half time

I'd love to see mata too though, but for RVP

4838~~~
Having a decent game. His hold up play is excellent

4839~~~
Because I think he's walking the tightrope with regards getting himself sent off, he's made some terrible challenges today, but other than that I think he's been good. I also think Mata would be better suited to the game, we've played some nice stuff in Swansea's half.

4840~~~
Not really. I've praised him a lot this season. He's not played well at all barring a couple of good chest controls

4841~~~
Decent, but he does commit the most pointless fouls. Swansea player facing his own keeper, in his own half, let's just have a kick at his ankles...

4842~~~
Holding things up well. He's always there at the back post but we'd rather give it to Fabianski.

4843~~~
He's been alright first half. Certainly not shite as some people are suggesting. 

I'd just personally prefer Fellaini playing a bit deeper. I think the tactics are obviously to play him behind the forwards so he's closer to goal if/when we put crosses in, however the crosses so far have been predictable. The Swansea keeper has worked out when we're going to put it in, hence coming out and collecting it. I think if Fellaini made runs from deep, he can get a run on the defenders (not that he needs it), and the keeper won't be able to read the crosses so easily. His goal against Stoke was a perfect example of this.

4844~~~
Thought he's been really poor so far. Good chest control for long balls of course, but he makes a foul verging on a yellow card so often and he's already picked one up, if he doesn't come off he's a guarantee to get a second yellow. Also with the ball at his feet I feel like he's given it away a lot today. He shouldn't be starting in the hole behind two strikers, doesn't really work. If we want to go direct, with a 4-4-2, and use him as a striker for crosses then by all means do it, don't put him at #10 when the other 5 attacking players around him all are more suited to the ball in their feet.

4845~~~
I don't know what game some of you are watching, he has been one of our best players!

4846~~~
How has he been one of our best players? He plays as a 10 and doesn't do anything except fouling and chesting down high balls

4847~~~
Useless unless we're playing direct long ball at him. All he did today was make a large number of fouls.

4848~~~
His control, hold-up and link-up play was better than most of our other attacking players.

4849~~~
He didn't create anything, no good pass into the danger area, he fouled a lot. He didn't offer anything today except a couple of balls that he chested down. Once he got the ball, he didn't do much with it. Are we a team that should just hoof the ball forwards?

4850~~~
Really poor today... Very little quality in anything that he did.

4851~~~
He was at fault for Swansea's winning goal, just too slow to react. He really lacks the basics expected of a competitive top flight midfielder: poor work rate, stamina, inconsistent passing, positioning etc.. He is much better as an impact player not as a starter

4852~~~
He was shit and wouldnt stop giving away stupid fouls. I'd prefer him as an impact player to get us a goal after 60/70 minutes, I don't like him as a starter.

4853~~~
He was okay in the first half, pure distilled shite in the second. Very surprised he didn't get sent off. He had like 4 warnings before his first yellow!

4854~~~
I'm not entirely sure he knows what he does with the ball under his feet. Has got a decent header and a chest control in him but that's that.

4855~~~
Should never be starting a game for us. For his size, he is really shit in the air.

4856~~~
Granted our crossing and long balls are pathetic but for someone with his height his heading accuracy is utter sh!te, if he could head with some sort of direction he would actually be a threat in the air.

4857~~~
A poor performance from him. 

I still think that he should be playing as one of the two strikers,  rather than behind them. He is not suited there.

4858~~~
He does his job when we want to go route one with ten minutes left, but he's useless at this actual football thing and should never start for us.

4859~~~
I thought he was alright until he played right up top. Then the football gets ugly and he's expected to work miracles from shit long balls where the opposition know it's coming to him, and he has 2 or 3 opponents around him. It is possible to go direct and put the ball into the box without just aiming everything to one man. It's so predictable.

4860~~~
Did well when moved higher up and focused on winning the Rojo punts, but playing as a link man in midfield is not his strong suit.

4861~~~
Terrible decision to play fellaini and two strikers, he should have played instead of RVP or not played at all.

4862~~~
He just isn't good enough. Poor touch, can't pass and a foul machine. Being him on if we're chasing a game, but it's counter intuitive to play him in a side that's attempting to create chances through possession based football. He doesn't have the technique to fit in the side and he becomes an easy way out for our players to aim at instead of doing what they're supposed to.

4863~~~
Either a striker or a conventional midfielder. Don't try and shoe-horn him to try and get a bit of both.

4864~~~
On the one hand I thought he was poor but on the other I didn't want him taken off in case we had to go direct towards the end of the game. It's a tough call to make when he is basically our entire plan B.

Much prefer him coming off the bench as an impact player.

4865~~~
I see he is back to copping more flak than he should. Two of the fouls he gave away weren't even fouls. Referees just blow their whistle whenever he is near somebody, it must drive him insane. Anyway, I thought he was average. Wasn't as bad as many are saying here. I'd prefer him a little deeper in midfield where he can help Blind more defensively. He would probably be more effective higher up if Young played a full game because he seems to be our best crosser.

A final thing, does the team know he stands at the back post? I reckon they crossed the ball there about three times against Swansea. Every cross doesn't go near him. It's frustrating.

4866~~~
he is hit and miss, providing good option to hoof the ball at him to get straight to the final third, good player to have in the box but apart that he is very clumsy gave away 6 fouls and that is only what I remember, all needles, he is slow can't run with the ball and make a final pass, yeah he is a different player but we don't need to play this way just because we have got him in the team.. 15mins to the time and we need to score put him on pitch and cross the ball , not from the start..

4867~~~
He's so bad today, only second worst to RvP. And I'm a big fan of him.

4868~~~
He did alright but he was played in the wrong position and we probably could have afforded to have him on the bench today. Van Gaal is so confusing, today he plays him as a number 10 but away at West Ham he leaves him out.

4869~~~
No way was he worse than McNair.

4870~~~
I always cut young player some slack.

4871~~~
Fair enough. Even with some slack cut I would say he was still worse though.

4872~~~
Plan b didn't work yesterday, he had a poor game. His position awareness when defending corners was not good.

4873~~~
The big guy has to play. Its not only about plan B but he's one of the few players we have who worries teams. The oposition have to account for him which opens up the game for some of his team mates.

4874~~~
I thought he was decent, just about did the job he would have been expected to do but too many silly fouls like usual. At least they arent in dangerous areas when he's playing so high up the pitch

4875~~~
Agreed. If we were able to Play some nice flowing attacking Football I might think different. However at the Moment he is one of our most dangerous Players.

4876~~~
That's my another concern, not Fellaini himself on corners but how we set up for them, he's given the 'free role' in defending corners and it's a bit pointless imo, should be marking somebody. Same goes for attacking corners, he's put always on a far post while Rooney/ADM's corners never get past first man and are always aimed at first post for somebody to play it through to the second post which happens maybe in 1/10.

It's almost as if we're doing nothing in training in that regard as well.

4877~~~
It has now reached a point where we deliberately use him to make us play worse as a team...

Plan A) aim cross to Fellaini, Fellaini chests down, passes back, aim cross  to Fellaini, Fellaini chests down, passes  back, aim cross to Fellaini, Fellaini fouls someone or crosses ball back across the goal with his head, at which point nothing happens because crossing the ball well with your head is impossible.

Plan B) aim all balls to Fellaini, Fellaini loses ball, win it back, aim all balls to Fellaini, Fellaini loses ball...


It's completely embarassing. I'd be laughing at us if I wasn't a United fan.

How people glean from this that he "needs to be in the team" I don't know. He absolutely definitely needs to not be in the team if this is going to be the idea whenever he is.

4878~~~
People grossly exaggerate this "long ball" team we supposedly come with Fellaini in the team. Look at our goal against Swansea. Fellaini was involved in that and it wasn't hoof ball. We don't become that much more direct at all. Unless it is the final ten minutes and we are down.

4879~~~
Didn't really get a chance to do his thing today as we didn't hit enough angel passes when he came on, almost bagged a goal though.

4880~~~
He's shown more as a striker this season then both RvP and Falcao have to be fair. At least with him you know he can bring the ball down, hold it up and outmuscle defenders, and actually win headers. RvP can do it but is very inconsistent this season. Falcao's just weak.

4881~~~
Sadly, that is spot on.

Imagine saying that a couple of years ago <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4882~~~
he's maybe good instinctive finisher but far too many awful "prepared" finishes. The shot was horrific not for the first time hitting the row z from great goal scoring opportunity. But I am okay with him coming on as sub from to time..

4883~~~
He has a horrible ball striking technique.

4884~~~
yeah while having good volley technique at the same time, didn't show that much for us yet.. He could be a good beach soccer player IMO..

4885~~~
He should aim to hit double figures this season. A thing I like about him is when he plays there's more urgency and things happen. He drags defenders towards him, unlike RvP and Falcao he can work with that and it lets other midfielders to take the space.

4886~~~
When he come on, he was hardly asked to play as a target man. That could have been down to us getting a goal before he was introduced, but he often dropped and linked up play when he was in the number 10 role behind Rooney.

4887~~~
Surprisingly, he was quite good as a No.9. He could be our Emile Heskey if we play him there <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4888~~~
Might as well play him as a target man next to Rooney.  Would probably score more goals than Falcao by the end of the season

4889~~~
Would still like to see him in midfield more. Just a standard cameo. Would suspect if we hadn't scored he would have been more involved.

4890~~~
Pointless. No idea what he is meant to be doing.

4891~~~
Thought he had a good enough half

4892~~~
I don't think he's been all that bad tonight. Had a couple of moments where he was surprisingly competent on the ball, and he's occasionally looked decent at dropping back and picking up the ball. His positioning still occasionally looks a bit all over the place though, and he's naturally a very limited player when in an advanced position.

For someone who's criticised him a lot though, I don't think he's been all that bad.

4893~~~
Yeah he's done okay. Needs to position himself more central in the box IMO, rather than always going to the back post.

4894~~~
Works as a plan B sometimes. Absolutely useless as a plan A from the start of a match. I despise watching him playing in the team in that role. Hated watching it at Everton and hate watching it here. He's barely contributed to anything, apart from the general shitness of our attack.

4895~~~
Eh? Thought he's been good.

4896~~~
He hasn't done that badly, but Jesus Christ, how is he playing up front for Man Utd? We need to score and he's playing up front ahead of Radamel Falcao.

I have no idea what system, line-up or formation we're playing these days. Don't think anyone has been able to figure it out, and we're in the latter stage of the season.

4897~~~
Don't mind him playing as such, he has done well this season.

Two problems though:
1) If we start him it's then very difficult to take him off as we may need to resort to extremely direct football towards the end of a game.
2) LvG keeps talking about how this is all part of a process but surely playing Fellaini up front can only be a short-term measure? You'd have thought he isn't the best suited to the football we're supposed to be moving towards.

4898~~~
He did ok but it shows how poor we are in final third that we have resorted to using him in that role.

4899~~~
Played ok, but he's just not a very good footballer. Puzzling why he's picked when we're not even playing to his strength.

4900~~~
Cannot believe he lasted 82 minutes.

4901~~~
He really is not good enough upfront. Doesn't contribute anything whatsoever and slows us down so much that it hurts to watch. He shouldn't really be ahead of Mata, really not

4902~~~
I hope i never get to see 80+ minutes of Fellaini in behind the striker for Man Utd ever again.

Especially when we have Mata on the bench. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

4903~~~
Played reasonably well I thought. Not sure why people are moaning

4904~~~
Agree. Him and Rooney were causing them problems. Fellaini did well in deep positions too but really should have scored that chance in the second half. He had more time than he thought.

4905~~~
Fellaini played well tonight. Stop moaning because Mata wasn't selected to start. He actually worked the GK more than our main striker. Ridiculous.

4906~~~
I was shocked that we started long-balling after he went off.
He did seem to me a strong choice ahead of Mata, expecting him to hold up play at a usually tough ground.  Turns out we may have been better off starting Mata, but I don't think Fellaini was terrible.

4907~~~
What are we, Everton? He's nowhere near technically good enough to play as a #10 for us.

4908~~~
Long-term no, although I suppose it can be a mildly effective short-term tactic.

4909~~~
Yep. He also ran well with the ball. Just the usual nonsense about Fellaini in the thread.

4910~~~
What did he do well then? I didn't see a quality performance of a no. 10 at all, he rather slowed us down and didn't do anything with the ball as usual

4911~~~
I thought he did ok, forced a couple of saves from Krul but should have scored that header. It's obvious he isn't the type of forward that should be playing for United but right now he offers us an option that is more useful than Mata or Falcao IMO.

4912~~~
He was alright tonight. Did about as well as he could have with that big chance, shot across the goalkeeper and it was a good save. Overall play was good in places but he could have been more adventurous at times I though, some times when he had an opportunity to shoot or pass forward he chose the safe option.

4913~~~
Didn't see him slowing us down to be fair.

Going by our comments combined one would think he's mastered the art of camouflage.

I like him in his target-man role to be fair, creates space for others to attack the box and forces our players to move fecking forward. Shame his chance in the second half didn't go on, would've been a cracking goal.

4914~~~
Forget his dismal performance, walking off the pitch when we are chasing a game? The feck was that about<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4915~~~
I was ok tonight, but when he starts and it's not working LvG seems reluctant to bring him off as he is also the Plan B. Should have ran off the pitch also, hate seeing that when we need a goal.

4916~~~
I thought he was poor yes. From a no.10, I expect him to create chances, move into space, passes the ball around and brings Rooney into play. He is too casual for me and doesn't have the skills or quality to play upfront

4917~~~
Fair enough that, I'd probably agree with you but I'm not really sure what his role was today, as said, I think he played something like a target-man, can a #10 be a target-man though? No idea.

4918~~~
Definitely!

I'd argue that's what Fellaini done for Moyes at his best for Everton. He was in the hole, but they'd pick him out like a target man, then he'd either lay it of to an oncoming mid, slip it to a forward, or run with it if he was in space.

4919~~~
I don't think he's set out to be a number 10 from LvG. He drops far too deep then if he is. For me he's used as an additional midfielder but with an emphasis to go up when we get into wide positions and do his thing. For a better way of putting it, shoehorning him in because he has qualities at both ends of the pitch which the manager values in getting results.

4920~~~
So basically we're back to our good ol' 'lack of off-ball movement is killing us' debate.

4921~~~
I guess that's his best role upfront but once he has the ball, he doesn't do enough for me that would really make him an quality option upfront

4922~~~
Some of the comments about his performance tonight are highly unjustified. He didn't set the world alight but he did a pretty good job, I thought.

4923~~~
He killed us doing that all game in the opening game of 12/13.

4924~~~
While I'm far from his biggest fan, this simply isn't the role he's being used for. Rooney's often the harder worker, and someone who will create a lot more by moving into space etc. Kind of strange since he's more of a striker than Fellaini admittedly.

4925~~~
That really annoyed me. But then no one was yelling at him or urging him off. Not the olayers, not LVG, no one. It symbolises our complete change in mentality since Fergie days.

4926~~~
Yeah, Di Maria did it too. Poor form from the pair of them.

4927~~~
No. 10s in the last few years have made people think one dimensionally in that a number 10 must be a technical player who operates in tight spaces playing amazing through balls and quick one twos. A la silva. 

Fellaini is obviously not that number 10, but like you say we aren't using him like that. Just because he isn't that classic 10 doesn't make him a bad option. In the role he is being asked to perform there he actually does it quite well.

4928~~~
People are being ridiculous. He was fine. No worse or better than anyone else out there. Was solid enough. Could have scored one or two if things had been different.

4929~~~
I'd always keep him as a squad player. His skill is pretty limited, but his aggression is something we sometimes will always need.

4930~~~
He's done alright. I do think that, generally, the best no.10's are the much more technical ones who can create and have good skill, but like you say, Fellaini has his uses.

4931~~~
For me this was another example of how Fellaini is an option but not a starter.

Could have, should have but didn't is generally the trend when he starts coupled with large spells of ghosting in games. When he comes on it's impact and drive and direction for the team while scaring the bejesus out of opponents.

As a general rule, with the ball at his feet he lacks the quality required of a Manchester United midfielder or attacker. With the ball away from his feet he works hard, is an imposing beast, a very underrated ball winner (probably from the next point) and intimidates opposition. With the ball in the air, he is a colossus and a battering ram.

4932~~~
Pretty much. 
Yup! That's probably the best example of it.

4933~~~
Tired of people moaning about him, if we had lost today it certainly wasn't because of Fellaini, he worked hard for the team and did his job out there.

4934~~~
not very effective if you expect him to create chances, but can definitely score some goals if played in that position week in week out

4935~~~
This is true, can't criticize one of them for doing it and not the other. Was rather annoyed.

4936~~~
Because playing behind a striker doesn't make him a #10. He worked drew 2 good saves from Krul, held up the play very well. He played well.

4937~~~
Thought he did ok tonight. Worked hard, held it up and bought players into the game on a couple of occasions and had two good chances where he didn't do much wrong other than not score. 

Far from our worst performer but he certainly didn't set the world alight. He's not a pretty or typical 'United' player but he offers something different, is effective at what he's clearly being asked to do and is an agressive presence that we often lack.

4938~~~
I thought he did well. Just didn't have much of an understanding with Rooney. To me, it felt like he was instructed do something (drift to the back post) but kinda forgot he still needed to link with Wayne.

4939~~~
I thought he played well tonight, he had a couple of chances on goal which is more than most of them had.

4940~~~
He lost his man on the brilliant De Gea save on the set piece. I really hate his inattention to defending. Still mad about that Schweinsteiger goal.

4941~~~
I think he should have started on the bench and mata played at the start. mata is better when playing from the start for me. Fellaini has a good super sub thing going on

4942~~~
I have been one his biggest critics but I have to say he is playing well this season and today's game he showed quite a bit. Next season he should be our super sub when we need height and aggression.
There are players today who had a bad game but he wasn't one of them.

4943~~~
Agreed, I think if we started with mata in the CAM we would have been more fluid.
Fellaini had a good game tho.

4944~~~
Weird as he's usually assigned to nobody (and so was he yesterday I think) during corners/set pieces and is meant to roam around the middle of the box to head it out of the first post fails to do it.

Wouldn't dismiss it as bullshit though as our defending/attacking during corners has been pretty fecked up at times this season.

4945~~~
Holding up the ball and 2 chances is not really what I'd expect. I also thought that he was way too slow with his play and thinking. It may not be his game or position but I just feel he shouldnt play that role

4946~~~
He's definitely standing next to the Newcastle player (Riviere?) when Herrera is about to be beat for the header by Coloccini, but then Riviere peels off and Fellaini is stationery. Similarly, Sissoko justs waltzes by Valencia.

Why is Herrera even contesting a header with Sissoko?

4947~~~
No idea, as I've said, our tactics overall and especially during set pieces have been baffling this season.

4948~~~
I thought Fellaini did his job pretty well last night. He held up the ball really well and kept possession under pressure high up the pitch on plenty of occasions, could have had a couple of goals. 

His role at the moment is confusing though, he's clearly been told to play as a striker when we're in possession, which means we lose a midfielder to help us in the build-up. If we were playing more direct that'd be fine but effectively losing a midfielder when you're trying to play a possession-based game is obviously going to stunt our play.

I think the best way to use him is as physical presence in midfield who picks his moments to get into the box or as a pure striker, he's performed very well for us in both roles.

4949~~~
He's basically playing that "box to box" role Van Gaal keeps banging on about, albeit in a slightly unusual way. Goes from being a target man when we're in possession to a straight forward CM when we're not. It's crude but effective. No matter how unpopular an opinion this might be, we're a better team this season with him in the XI than we are without him.

Be interesting to see what happens if/when we get a legit well-rounded CM like Strootman or Vidal. Poor auld Marouane might be out on his ear.

4950~~~
Yeah I agree with all that, I have no qualms about Fellaini or his strengths/style of play and I think he's been great this season and deserves to start. My issue is more that using him that way doesn't fit into LvG's preferred style, its not really a surprise that we look a bit disjointed going forward when we're telling one of our midfielders to get up front and be a focal point and telling the others to keep possession and not try and be too direct. It's a judgement on LVG's tactics rather than on Fellaini.

If we do bring in a proper box-to-box player I can see Fellaini being kept on anyway, he's a good player and the best in the league at being a massive nuisance in and around the box. He gives us tactical options that the likes of RVP and Falcao can't and we'd be daft to voluntarily lose that.

4951~~~
Don't get Strootman.

I don't want another Hargreaves situation <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4952~~~
I think Fellaini's technique and touch is still being underrated by people. He definitely isnt a David Silva or Eden Hazard, but he is competent enough on the ball that he doesnt slow down our attacks or anything, and is happy to simply distribute the ball to other more creative players anyway.

4953~~~
The problem is that he's currently playing as the nearest man to the striker. His only creative teammates are behind him, so he inevitably slows the play down.

I agree that Fellaini's technique is underrated, but he does have ridiculously slow feet. That means he's really plodding when it comes to adjusting his body shape to release a pass.

He has two positions that he should be played in: defensive midfielder, where he can lay off easy passes to the people ahead of him; and target man, where he can lay off easy passes to the people behind him. Making him play anywhere in between gets the absolute worst out of him.

4954~~~
No no, its all pragmatism, and Fellaini is our most improved player.

4955~~~
I still would like to know if it is tactics (which I assume it is ) or Fellaini himself who decides to run up onto the last man when we are in possession. I understand why it happens, but it bothers me. Our build-up is hindered because we lose a midfielder and he just stands up there watching the play. He is more than capable of knocking the ball around. I'd rather see him running into the box from a deeper midfield position than having his starting point being alongside Rooney.

4956~~~
Fellaini going up beside Rooney and into the far post is definitely tactical, but the fact that he does it whilst we're building up and trying to get the ball forward isn't. It looks like Fellaini is completely mistiming it with his run forward, and it leaves the full back/winger with no passing option into the middle, thus slowing down to play a longer square pass to Blind or back to the central defence.

4957~~~
He's been maligned for not being a Man United type player. But his technique is actually very good and his passing rarely is backwards it's usually goes forward. Paul Scholes and Gary Neville have made less than flattering remarks about him and this is unfair. He might not have fitted the class of 92 playing style granted but what he does have is the same aggressive attitude as that squad. And it's an underrated trait we are badly missing in this squad. Fellaini and Rooney give us attitude RVP also no one messes with these players. I'm struggling to think of many more as most of our other players are pretty mild mannered and don't have that aggressive streak. We are currently a better team with Fellaini And he's done very well this season. It would be a travesty to see him sold in the summer even if we buy 2-3 outstanding midfielders.

4958~~~
Fellaini's performances as an individual have generally been good this season. He's kept the ball very well as well when in possession and he's been a threat in the box in the final third. However, Fellaini is a tactic and if there's anything to complain about it's that, not Fellaini himself. He does exactly what's required of him each game, forget having a player that's going to receive the ball between the lines, commit players and thread balls through defences because that's not his game. A lot of people are happy to defend Herrera's underwhelming performances due to him being under instruction, it's the same with Fellaini. Personally, I think it's a good tactic to have this season as well and I'd be playing him against most sides we come up against away from Home.

4959~~~
Fairly one dimensional player, but he does what's asked/expected of him.

Still don't think he's United starting XI quality - or well, shouldn't be, IMO. 

I guess even that's debatable with the state/options of our midfield over the past 2-3 years.

4960~~~
I really don't see much point of him in this formation or the role he's been playing lately. He is neither helping our midfielders dominating the game, or helping them out defensively(I think it's incredible how much of running Blind and Herrera are doing in this formation), and he is stoping Rooney from being involved in the game at all. I really have no idea why van Gaal is insisting on playing him lately when he bringing us nothing special.

4961~~~
So many fouls.

4962~~~
I think he's had a decent half, a bit ponderous on the ball at times but that seems to be the orders for him and Herrera. I am sick of every 50/50 going against him as well just because he's an Ent.

4963~~~
Its not his fault, but he absolutely kills our attacking football playing as a #10.

He just doesn't have the ability on the ball, in a possession based system, for it too work.

4964~~~
He's looked incredibly slow and clumsy tonight at times. He's arguably still a decent outlet because Di Maria's crossing has often been on point, but he really has looked like more of a long ball outlet than anything else tonight since his general play has been lacking at times.

4965~~~
Having a proper box to box midfielder like Schneiderlin instead with Hererra playing as the attacking midfielder would suit us a lot more than Fellaini.

4966~~~
Been a very Fellainish performance alright.

4967~~~
Yep.

4968~~~
He's good at what he does (apart from the stupid needless fouls) but his presence stifles us as a team. We need pace and intelligent movement instead of him.

4969~~~
It's also been high tempo game which isn't helping him at all, hopefully we bring Mata very soon.

4970~~~
He had a decent first half, but should be sold or kept as a Plan C. He just isnt the guy for this type of football we want to play. He is too slow and commits too much fouls. He occcasionally has his moments when we cross or long ball to him, but otherwise with the ball at his feet just not good enough. He has to improve if he wants to be a starter.

4971~~~
Think he's doing well, done more for our cause than herrera by a mile. This is exactly the type of player that causes arsenal problems, not point switching to mata just to prove a point that we're not a long ball side or whatever

4972~~~
Weare never going to play good football with this guy in the team. There is too much temptation to lump it up to him.

4973~~~
He's been involved in all our best passing moves. But I guess you done even need to watch the game to post that boilerplate.

4974~~~
I'm sick to the back teeth of watching him wave his hands around like a fecking clown when he loses a header.

Don't have a clue why he's in the team. Utter shite.

Edit. Should add don't know why he's starting. I get it as a plan b but not from the start.

4975~~~
He's absolutely terrible. Foul after foul. So slow in possession. Literally all he offers is a route 1 option and it's pathetic for a club like United. Shouldn't be anywhere near the team. He's such a whingey prick too having a go after he's pulled up for elbowing somebody for the 90th time this season. Absolutely infuriating.

4976~~~
It's embarrassing he start's for us. Even though he's big, his heading is awful. Most them are just back passes to the keeper.

4977~~~
Think he's a decent player and I'm impressed with how he's turned it around but the way we play with him on the pitch is absolutely shocking

4978~~~
Shouldn't be playing for United, much less starting in the hole.  We should have cut our losses last season.

4979~~~
As each game progresses, we seem to be just turning him into more and more of a long ball player. Which he is, I suppose. Sometimes it can prove useful, but we really shouldn't be playing that way in the long-term. His technical play is often very poor and his touch was sometimes terrible.

4980~~~
Despite being an absolute oaf, slow in possession, constant fouling machine waiting to get a red card (<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>), being poor technically, not being able to play on the ground and so on and so on, he probably contributed the most to our attacks yet again.

4981~~~
Pretty much this. We won't win big games with him upfront

4982~~~
Fellaini is not the problem, he's actually holding up the ball well and creating chances / keeping possession. The problem is a lack of pace up front and a defence that has carthorses like Smalling.

4983~~~
I think he was okay aside from the usual, way too many stupid fouls.

You'd ideally want more from one of your attackers, but I would have been content with his performance if he just didnt keep bringing players down all the time

4984~~~
He's much better when we aren't just lumping the ball up to him.

4985~~~
The amount of fouls this fecking guy commits. Was decent at best, but that's all you're going to get from him really. He should never be starting for us, or very sparingly. A sub when it's necessary sure, but not a starter.

4986~~~
As Danny Murphy said on commentary, he comes alive when we're in the final third. Those back to front balls do nothing. He'll bring it down and lay it off but is that any different from just building your way up. First half was great as we played with the ball well. Second half was dead.

4987~~~
The problem is that he is playing as more of an AM than any of our other CM's and he's just so limited. There were several times the ball came to him in midfield to orchestrate a break but he has neither the passing range or the ability to drive with the ball at the opposition, so we just stop dead.

4988~~~
He's great as a Plan B impact sub with ten minutes to go when passing it into the net isn't working. He's atrocious as a starting number 10 expected to create. It's not like we played the long ball game well, either. Sure, he knocked it down a few times, but never to any of our players. His second touch after chesting it down was usually a tackle or him fouling someone.

4989~~~
Yep, played a nice ball over the top for Di Maria, and one earlier in the match too

4990~~~
He is absolutely diabolical!!

4991~~~
lack of pace? We had Rooney, Young, Di Maria. You mean lack of quality

4992~~~
Atrocious tonight. Managed to mess up at the pivotal moment every single time he threatened. The fouling was incessant and although it isn't his fault, contributed towards a horribly one dimensional final ten minutes.

4993~~~
He has this hard man image but in reality he's a snidey little fanny with shit control who is supposed to be a target man who can't even hold up the ball. I have never hated a United player but I hate this bastard with a passion. Not United and never will be, how is this utter cnut getting a game!

4994~~~
He is what he is. The problem is the manager who constantly uses him and make the team compete for the "Find Fellaini" contest.

4995~~~
He's a good back-up player but LVG seems keen to play him in every game.

4996~~~
Are you just going around posting this in every thread on the forum?

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/playing-fellaini-ahead-of-mata-in-the-10-role.401933/page-2#post-17207333">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/play...ta-in-the-10-role.401933/page-2#post-17207333</a>

4997~~~
Rooney has slowed down massively, the rest are wingers. We need someone like Sanchez to lead the line and stretch the defence.

4998~~~
to lead the line? He plays as a winger for Arsenal too. We are just slow in posession and for our counter attacks. In other words, our players think to much, hesitate, and pass back or give the ball away.

4999~~~
I think overall his performances have shown that there should be a place for him in the team more often than not

The problem is that to play him in any of the positions he can play, he needs a lot of balancing out by other teammates

If you have him in a front position, you'd want someone fast and alert to get onto his holdup play and provide a contrasting threat so the team arent predictable

If you have him in central midfield, you need other players like Ander looking to move the ball more positively and faster to make up for his willingness to go backwards with negative play

His own performances have been worthy of getting starts, but we've struggled to play well in midfield or as a team even when he's played well because of his skillset not really fitting the positions he plays.

Ideally you'd want your tall, physical player in the Matic or Wanyama position in front of the defence, but he doesn't have the concentration and positioning for it

5000~~~
I'm honestly sick of watching him play. I don't like his style, so even when he does have a decent game I don't enjoy watching him. The chance he had in the first half summed him up for me - didn't realise there was space to run into and because of that he wasn't quick enough when the pass came in and the chance went away. I simply don't understand why he's seemingly a better option than Mata.

5001~~~
Ironic that his role in the team is to provide balance

5002~~~
His control (chest control aside) is poor, his passes are always ever so slightly off their mark and his overall play is too slow. I don't think he offers anything defensively either when it's not a set piece. He has shown he has some uses but I would much rather see Mata.

5003~~~
He's a massive square peg, in a tiny round hole.

5004~~~
I can't believe he is playing for us at all, let alone has somehow managed to become integral to the way we play.

5005~~~
Thats just because we have so many small and technical types that hes the one one with strength <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5006~~~
People are (typically) being overly harsh. Aside from the fouls he didn't do anything wrong at all IMO. Some of the fouls were harsh and paid just because he is Fellaini too. He contributed more than Herrera, Blind, and Young anyway. His passing was fine too, aside from one lay-off to Young which was just slightly overhit. I genuinely think people are seeing what they want to see.

5007~~~
Yeah, he played ok. Two through balls that were better than anything from Hererr et al anyway.

5008~~~
He did alright but anything over £15m for him in the summer and I'd bite their hand off.

5009~~~
That is what sticks out in my mind too. People are calling for Mata but honestly, when is the last time he played a ball through to the strikers? If anything, Mata is just as defensive in his passing than Fellaini. Fellaini's passing was fine.

5010~~~
He was ok today but I'm sick of him. Just seeing his name at 10 on our team sheet fills me with despair. He's not a United player and never will be.

5011~~~
I really don't think so. Most people can recognise that he's had a fairly useful contribution at times this season, but it remains that he's not a very gifted footballer for this level, yet has somehow become integral to our playing style as of late. A lot don't like that, which is fair enough.

5012~~~
He was effective and did what a good physical player does. Reason why he looks good in this team is because we create nothing outside of this style, we have no quick interplay, no great crossing or wing play, nothing at all just punting the ball up to the big man.

5013~~~
I keep reading that but I did not see anything from him that showed he wasn't on the level technically. His passing was fine.

5014~~~
We used to make jokes before Moyes started his job that we would sign him and use him like we currently do. I don't like or dislike him and he was't bad today, but it shows, how much standards overall have dropped that he and this style of play with him is integral to how we currently play.

5015~~~
The Tottenham game alone he played like 3 or 4. How many has he started since then?

5016~~~
Think you have summarised my view of it pretty well. He didn't play bad, but fact of the matter is we as a team seem to play pretty bad and with a style of football that is god awful to watch.

5017~~~
He is a percentage footballer in the role he played tonight. The odd time it will work and we will score. 

Id much rather Mata,Herrera,Rooney or even Januzaj in his position tonight.

5018~~~
For all the abuse, he created several good chances for us today - both from aerial balls <i>and</i> from good through balls on the ground.

For me, he was much more effective than Herrera in the first half, and with Herrera being on a yellow I could see why LVG chose to take him off rather than Fellaini.

Ultimately there are a lot of posters on here who simply cannot and will not accept Fellaini irrespective of his performances. He was OK today, he gives another angle to our attack and created more chances than most, and yet still people call for his head while excusing far worse performers.

5019~~~
IMHO: He is a waste of a starting place for a creative Mata or whoever … it kills me to watch him pointing out other players to pass to rather than him, he seems to have no faith in himself any more. I was excited when we signed him as I thought we'd be inheriting a Keane-type midfield enforcer but we've got an unconfident, ball-shy player who seems to think that hiding in the mediocrity of this team will further his career … we'd be better off with Crouch! When he hit that ball back towards DdG with 30 seconds left to go tonight I just gave up … he's playing to make sure LvG doesn't rip him a new one NOT TO WIN!

5020~~~
He did contribute more than a lot of players but that isn't really the problem, I think. 

He will always be a threat in that sort of game given his rather unique talents. However, if we're looking to build beyond this point into a team that plays with coherency, rhythm and excellent technical quality then Fellaini's presence becomes more of a hindrance. He just isn't that sort of player.

Or, to put it another way, Fellaini may be more effective right now given we're playing poorly but he also makes it less likely that we'll see any really change in that standard of play.

I'm not blaming him though, it's just one of a whole list of factors feeding in to how underwhelming we've been.

5021~~~
He was good in the Spurs game I will agree, but other than that Mata is not the creative master that people seem to think he is. People canbe critical of Fellaini for not creating if they want, but it is not like anyone else really creates much more than him in this system anyway.

Again, I don't think that Mata creates that much more than Fellaini does.

5022~~~
There is no excuse for a man of his size to be bullied off the ball by anyone, let alone Francis Coquelin and Laurent Koscielny... No matter what he did or didn't create or whatever, to get muscled out of the way by someone half your size is ridiculous.

5023~~~
I mean, he wasn't bad today, in fact this season he'd be in the top 5 performers this season, but the fact he's being used as our 'number 10', our 'advanced playmaker' is a damning indictment of the state the club is currently in.

5024~~~
His overall game is often incredibly slow and clumsy.

5025~~~
He's an odd one this season. He's undoubtably playing well. One of our best performers in fact. Yet I still can't shake the feeling he's holding us back by simply existing. 

The defensive subs today, for example, seemed engineered to keep him on the pitch. Bringing Carrick on for the more forward minded of our CMs, to form the most low lying defensive partnership we could, was basically commiting to the idea that Fellaini is our default, go to No10. Which is understandable, albeit a bit worrying, in an away game we're losing, but very concerning in a home game we're doing well in. Doubly so in a squad that has Rooney, Mata, Januzaj and Di Maria all capable of playing in that position. There's no use pretending he's acting as some kind of physical midfield enforcer either when we're playing him in a 3 with Carrick and Blind. The only reason we could possibly need both of them on is to allow him to roam forward with gay abandon. Which he always seems to do anyway.

We're now in a situation where he's playing well, at least by his standards, so on the surface seems a sensible pick. Yet however well he plays, his influence on the team is reductive. He encourages us to seek him out from most of our crosses, and look for high balls when breaking out of defence rather than a potentially cleverer pass. 

I can't fault the guy personally, because he's doing everything he can, but his strengths are limited to chesting down punts and then doing little creatively with them. Even the argument that someone like Mata is too easily bullied seems unconvincing considering Fellaini provides little to no cover himself. He basically just fouls people whenever he tracks back beyond the center circle. Which is why neither LVG nor Moyes have used him effectively as a DM, and why we needed to play both our holding CMs tonight to allow him to stay on. 

The only thing he provides that none of our more natural No 10s do is an aerial threat in the final 3rd. But you can't help but wonder if the players we have could come up with something better if they weren't instinctively reliant on that tactic as a fall back. It's not like we don't have the options. 

I can't blame him, cos he's doing his best, but with the talent we have, playing to the strengths of our least talented players just seems like a completely mad thing to do.

5026~~~
He's not even that good as a hold-up target man, especially when the ball's played along the ground. The ball just bounces off him, and he has to chase it and end up barging into an opposition player.

5027~~~
Spot on. Absolutely spot on.

5028~~~
Seconded, great post by Mockney

5029~~~
Exactly this. He's doing well individually, but he's more of a problem then help because him being there is a huge reason why we so quickly revert to hoofing it forward instead of playing it calmly, and as the #10 position is supposed to be the creative hub of the team, it's hurting us by having a target man be there instead of an actual playmaker. 

Apparently he had 8 fouls and 38% aerials won (against fecking Coquelin for the most part as well) though today. So I don't think he played well at all today. Ruined most things that went his way apart from a couple of decent things.

5030~~~
Thirded, spot on

5031~~~
Not exactly happy with performance but he seems to be doing what's asked of him. I'm not really a fan for his style of football but I can't really criticise him for the long balls up to him. That's LVG's job to sort out how we play.

5032~~~
He's done very well all season and has turned his United career from a horrific travesty into something we can look back on confused about. I hope he gets the goal that secures 4th place, then gets a move for 15 million to a club where he can start every week, elbowing smaller opponents in the head and running around like a dog sent from the city to go live on the farm. 

He needs to leave and we need to start playing football again, but I will happily cheer for him at his next stop.

Some team in La Liga that wants to buck the trend and emulate Simeone's physical style should buy him. He'd dominate there if Sevilla or something decided to go direct. Or the inevitable West Ham move. Kevin Nolan's 1100 minutes are just sitting there.

5033~~~
People saying he did better than Herrera with his through passes etc....Maybe if Herrera was afforded the freedom to play Fellaini's role, he'd do similar? I've not seen Ander make a risky pass ever since he came back from being dropped.

Not saying he was poor, but with him in the team, the likelihood of us going route one when things get desperate really annoys me. It's not as if we're any good at that supposed plan B.

5034~~~
I agree with all of that and still can't make out if we use that tactic because we have him or that's the tactic LVG wants and he's glad we have him. Either way, if he is one our main routes to scoring, we are fecked. 

The one thing that annoys me the most about him is the constant fouling. 99% of the time it's obvious when he will foul someone.

5035~~~
Playing well, no hoofball involved.

5036~~~
I don't think he's ever looked as good for us with a ball at his feet as he has today. He's still got that physical presence which he's always going to naturally have, but his passing has been good and accurate, and not only has he not slowed down the play, but he's been one of the best players in a game where we've been pulling off some impressive and direct passing. And with a good finish for the goal too, it's been a really good day for him thus far.

5037~~~
MOTM so far for me. Best I've seen him. So useful in the final third.

5038~~~
Marouane "Thomas Muller" Fellaini

5039~~~
Trequaristista

5040~~~
Fellaininho!

5041~~~
To balance out most of my other posts in this thread; great first half. Took the goal very well, played some good passes and made some very good runs as well.

5042~~~
I love it when we actually treat him like a footballer and not a one-dimensional battering ram. He plays so much better and has been lot more decisive in attacking areas today.

5043~~~
He's been excellent alright.

5044~~~
Playing excellent today. Anybody who watched him at everton know that this is how menacing he is. Love his position, tactically spot on by LVG. 

Says a lot that fellaini young and blind down the left wing are better than mata herrera and valencia down the right, who would have guessed that this time last year

5045~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a> Come on then mate, I am ready to take it on the chin after an excellent first half as a box to box CM from the mop. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5046~~~
I agree with the sentiment but to be fair Valencia isn't a RB and Mata isn't a wide player

5047~~~
Delighted for him and I'm not in the least bit surprised with the way he had performed there in that first half either. He's been heading in the right direction for a fair while now and today he has shown what he is capable of when everything goes right for him.

5048~~~
That was a monstrous half from him. Brilliant

5049~~~
Fellaini has done everything you could ask of him. Unlike against Arsenal, when played through on goal he just took a shot and we profited. Played with confidence, played with effort and whatever the coaching staff have asked of him he's performed. Deserves a pat on the back. I've never been Fellaini's biggest fan, and he'll never be a #10 of the calibre of someone like Mata, but he plays for the system, plays for the team. You can see why Van Gaal likes him, give him instructions and Fellaini will follow them to utmost of his abilities. That's more than you can perhaps say for some members of our squad. Good on you big fella!

5050~~~
Yeah that is roughly what I saw when he came on against West Ham (I think?) For his first game of the season (I think) and you could see LVG talking intently to him before he came on. Sure enough came on and scored in that game and you could tell he was following LVGs instructions.

As you said he plays for the team and does what is asked of him, for better or worse - easy to see why a manager would like him.

5051~~~
MOTM today, was like his performance against us at Goodison in 2012-13.

5052~~~
Absolutely destroyed Tottenham in the first half, shame Mata and Rooney couldn't find his crosses in the first half, he's been bloody brilliant.

5053~~~
My MOTM today. He won every duel, linked well, scored a goal and then Carrick scored after Fellaini won a duel. His best performance in a United shirt.

5054~~~
Great game from him today. Took his goal well and pop up at useful space around the field.

5055~~~
Do that more often bog brush.

5056~~~
Showed what a terror he should be when used offensively. Great finish for the goal and a good threat throughout but mainly in the first half

4-1-4-1 with him clearly being given the main job to support the striker is perhaps the best way to use him

5057~~~
Great performance, weird celebration.

5058~~~
ok, i dont think he was that good. lost the ball more often than other players.

5059~~~
Perhaps not as good in the 2nd half, but he was absolutely brilliant in the 1st half. Offered a physical presence like usual, but also looked very good on the ball and scored a goal too.

5060~~~
everyboy played worse in the second half bar Smalling.

We had 0 shots on target in the 2nd half.

5061~~~
Still looked relatively comfortable though and played some decent football.

5062~~~
My man of the match today.

5063~~~
Put himself about quite well today and scored a very good goal. He was the catalyst for some of our best moves even when he wasn't directly involved by drawing Spurs playing towards him leaving space for Carrick and Young to exploit. Dunno if I'd start him at Anfield though. Cool heads will be needed there and Fellaini can be a bit too physical - the last thing you need in that cauldron.

5064~~~
Very good first half, fair play to him. Less energetic and decisive in the 2nd half but fully deserves the plaudits today

5065~~~
His best match in a United shirt today without a doubt IMO.

5066~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5067~~~
Scoring some key goals for us this season and dare I say, one of our key players now.

5068~~~
Top performance today, I bet there's a few people in the match day forum eating their words.

5069~~~
See. He can play in central midfield!

5070~~~
The way he took that goal and hit that one well waited through ball for Young tells me the big guy can do more than just stand with that thing.

5071~~~
And we can play Fellaini without resorting to hoofball.

Honestly, I can't remember a player changing my opinion so amazingly in a long time. Well done to him.

5072~~~
Great performance from Marouane today. Was a constant threat for Spurs, both in the air and on the floor, with his good hold up play and running in behind. Scored a great goal, too.

5073~~~
Well deserved win for United. Spurs just didn't turn up. Our chances for top 4 are slim, but still remain.

5074~~~
Wrong thread?

5075~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Good game from Fellaini today, especially in the first half, like you said. He was more advanced then Herrera today when we were in possession of the ball, but off it, he got back and our midfield got nice and narrow, which stopped Spurs from finding pockets of space and forcing them to play sidewards.

5076~~~
Fellaini was good today he made him give up.

5077~~~
In the past couple of games, he has found himself in the same situation as he did for his goal, where he had the chance for a good shot, but didn't take it. He was on his weaker foot and slotted it beautifully. Hopefully in future situations he does this more often, because he can finish. 

Great game too, he's showing now that he deserves to be wearing the shirt for sure.

5078~~~
Moyes must regret not having the balls to play him in that position for United. I personally reckon he wanted to but feared the backlash about the style of play.

5079~~~
Well, he needs to show it though. Today was a great game but he didn't show much of that recently so hopefully that gives him the confidence

5080~~~
Last week against Newcastle I recall him playing several excellent through balls and creating chances.

5081~~~
Probably would have scored 10 goals in that game against Fulham at home <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5082~~~
His best position is in the final third, he showed in the first half today he can cause havoc and be almost unplayable at times, he is an average midfielder if you try to force him into a traditional box to box role and even worse if he plays in a deeper position but given freedom and license to attack he will score and create goals.

That was always the problem we had last season, moyes bought him to solve our problems in midfield and he just isn't capable of that and then moyes didn't seem to have the bottle to play him further forward so it just didn't work. He has done enough now to make himself a useful squad player long term and a key player between now and the end of the season.

5083~~~
His best 45 minutes in a United shirt for 18 Months.

5084~~~
Couldn't agree more and have thought this myself. That in itself tells me it was too big for Moyes.

Well done to Fellaini, an asset if used correctly.

5085~~~
Doing a great job for the team, we've struggled to move the ball out of defence quickly. When you have 4-5 players pressing our key players Blind/Carrick/Herrera, Fellaini provides a great option of a long pass. Still lacks the mobility or raw ability to consistently impress in that position but I can have no complaints for now.

Beautifully taken goal today, didn't think he had that finish in him.

5086~~~
Excellent peformance. Bullied the Spurs players at times and his finish, which really set our win in motion, was top notch.

5087~~~
So much more useful/threatening in the final third when we're not just pumping it up to his head.

5088~~~
It makes a huge difference if we have several options and playing high to Fellaini is one of many instead of hoofing it towards him is the only one. You could see today that because Spurs didn't know what we would do next, Fellaini had all the time once he got the ball

5089~~~
Love the way he goes mental when he scores, he probably knocked out a few in the attendance with that right uppercut of his. He really is an asset when he's used correctly, he even looked fecking quick during the run leading up to the goal.

5090~~~
In pre-season, when he came on, every one of his successful touches were ironically cheered. By the home crowd. Now, a little over half a season later, he played a huge part in winning what was essentially a must-win game in the race for fourth (or better).

Say what you want about him, but the story speaks favorably of his character. Also, there a fine margins between heroes and losers in football.

5091~~~
His finish really got us going today, great goal, fair play to him.

5092~~~
His first good game in a while, but I hate when he is receiving very good pass into his feet from our midfielders and he just stands there waiting the ball to reach him and opposition press him and we lose the ball in very dangerous situation which usually results in counter attack at least two or three times per game. The type of mistake like the one when we conceeded second goal against Swansea when they nicked the ball and Shelvey scored.

5093~~~
Love his celebration!

5094~~~
Really good performance. I gave Carrick MoTM  but Fellaini was a close 2nd. Dropped away a bit in the 2nd half but the match was already won by then. Really good finish on his left foot for the goal. Proved what I have been saying all along, he is more than just a tall player we can hoof the ball too. He is more than capable of playing with his feet. His runs in behind were very pleasing.

5095~~~
Imagine if he scored the winner against Liverpool? God status.

5096~~~
I am begrudgingly starting to be convinced that perhaps he and Mata being platooned as the 10, depending on the opposition, would not be the end of the world. If we spend the entire summer budget on making De Gea the highest paid keeper ever, signing Bale, getting a rightback to cover Rafael and a massively expensive CB like Godin or Hummels this would minimize disruption in the squad. 
-----Rooney--------    (RVP, Wilson)
DiMaria-------Bale  (Nani, Young, Januzaj)
------Mata----------   (Fellaini)
--Carrick-Herrera-  (Blind)
Shaw-------Rafael   (<i>Fullback</i>, Blind)
-<i>Godin</i>-Smalling-   (Rojo, Jones)
------De Gea------   (Valdes)

5097~~~
Goal and an assist, lovely taken finish; complete contrast to when he bottled it in the Arsenal game which shows great character and confidence.

Calling it now, he's going to do something massive for us in the Dippers game.

5098~~~
Why sign him then?

Another great performance btw.

5099~~~
Yeah he was magnificent.

Using his strength in the final 3rd isn't a bad option if you aren't constantly trying to hoof the ball to his head. 

We've fallen into that trap a few times this season.

5100~~~
The ovation when he left the field was one of those moments that you would not have believed would ever happen less than one year ago.

5101~~~
From the Beeb:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31901145" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31901145</a>


I agree with that analysis for the most part. The key part that I want to reiterate (and have said a multitude of times already this season) is that United have always played direct football. As Phil says though, direct football =/= hoofball. We are at our best when we are moving the ball around the pitch at speed, swinging in crosses and attacking from both wide and central positions. Fellaini is fast becoming key to that strategy in the way he plays, and today was a very good example of this.

Not once have I watched us this season and felt we were playing hoofball to Fellaini (except as a short term measure when chasing a game, for example) - we have used his presence to vary our attacking options and when it all comes together as it did today, it produces some excellent football.

5102~~~
Again, all credit to him. I put my hands up, I wrote his United career off in the summer but he has done very well. Would love to see him elbow a goal in from an offside position in front of the kop.

5103~~~
I disagree. I don't think Moyes wanted to play him as the most advanced midfielder. At the time, we had Rooney, Kagawa and Mata, who I doubt he would have bought if he had any intentions of playing Fellaini further forward.

From the players we went in for, it was clear Moyes wanted a defensive midfielder and a ball playing midfielder, hence the bids for Khedira/Fellaini and Herrera/Fabregas.

5104~~~
Afro-man at his very best. We need him to continue his bullying against liverpool. I was amazed at the space he created in dangerous position and was heading, chesting and controlling those long balls with utmost ease. With Mata able to play on the left, he can really make no.10 his position. Has scored 5 goals and would love to add more by the end of the season. Would love to see him climbing on top of Skrtel to head one pass Mignolet at the Kop end! Common Fellaini!!

5105~~~
what a finish. 

hope we can use him to great effect for the liverpool game.

5106~~~
Was he teaching Rooney how to box the right way <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5107~~~
Just imagine the hurt from Liverpool fans if Fellaini scored. RAWK would shut down.

5108~~~
Loved his celebration and overall passion he has been showing last few months.

5109~~~
That ball Rooney played into his chest - wish he volleyed it. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5110~~~
The goal was a very nice finish, with his "weaker" foot. Something that gets overlooked a lot when Fellaini is discussed is that he's extremely comfortable on either foot. Almost as ambidextrous as Carrick. Which is a great attribute for any CM yet nowhere near as common as you'd think.

5111~~~
Deserved standing ovation for him yesterday. 

First really good game in a while from him. He didn't constantly foul ppl for once, wasn't using elbows and was actually good with the ball at his feet.

5112~~~
What excites me now about Fellaini is he can be a useful weapon in europe next season whether it be euro league or proper europe. His aerial threat will give us the edge in quite a few games

5113~~~
These two, definitely. I was very impressed by how calm he was for the finish. I'm actually really excited about seeing him play these days - which is quite incredible when we think about last season.

5114~~~
For me, Fellaini looks just a bit sharper and more mobile than he used to.  He's given a very decent overall performance this year and deserves his place in the starting eleven.  Looked tired towards his substitution and probably went off at the right time.  I think he must have turned a few heads this season that gave him the stick a year ago.

5115~~~
I know people dislike the idea of us playing long ball, but if we were to face a tiki-taka side tomorrow, Fellaini would be my first name on the teamsheet. There are few players in the world better at doing what he does and it would be silly to ignore that. He'd be the perfect player to knit together a counter-attacking system. 

Drogba did it a couple of times against Barca in their prime. Fellaini could do it for us.

5116~~~
My big concern about afro-man in Europe is falling foul of fussy referees. He's such a big, awkward looking fella he's always going to be under scrutiny and does seem to keep getting booked for fouls that a smaller player might get away with.

5117~~~
Thought he was outstanding yesterday, by far and away his best performance so far in his United career for me.

He was pretty much unplayable for that first 45 minutes.

5118~~~
Yea it's annoying as feck that fouls are called against him even when he's visibly not fouling, players know that they can drop around him and ref will give it most of the time.

5119~~~
Him and the refs must be equally frustrated by each others. Fellaini gets loads of nonsense calls against him (half his fouls against Arsenal weren't fouls), but at the same time he's often lucky with his reckless use of elbows and studs.

Anyway, it's great to actually have one aggressive player it hurts to play against, we've become such an overly nice team full of schoolboys.

5120~~~
This. 

Been saying this for ages now. Slowly but surely everyone will back him now and when he has a shite game like all players do we wont say he's useless

5121~~~
Not to derail the thread but this is very true about life as well.

5122~~~
I too was one of the many on here calling him a waste of space. He's done really well for us in the last few months.

5123~~~
He got sent off in the Champions League last season in exactly the manner you're talking about. It's definitely an issue to think about next season.

What a performance yesterday, he was fantastic. More of that please.

5124~~~
Indeed. The media made a point of him committing twice as many fouls as any other paler in the Arsenal game - except he didn't, he just kept getting penalised for doing nothing wrong.

5125~~~
Better off just letting him do what he wants .
Seems to work lately

5126~~~
When you have Blind, Carrick, Fellani, Herrera and Mata is the team you really can move it long or short. The fact that De Gea can pick out Fellani over 60 yards is a big plus too.

We were the defintion of mixing it up yesterday and it short circuited the Spurs player's brains.

5127~~~
Absolutely, well pointed out.

5128~~~
It's really hard not to like him. Fantastic mindset and coaching I'm sure to persevere through all the doubt and criticism to make something of himself here.

5129~~~
Yeah, or its like when Redknapp just told Pavlyuchenko to "facking run around a bit" and simplified it for a player not adept enough for team tactics. Maybe Van Gaal just told Fellaini to "fecken chest and head the ball in their box a bit". Fellaini's turned into a sort of Duncan Ferguson styled on Sideshow Bob drenched in coffee but it seems to be working.

5130~~~
I think one of the reasons we clicked so well vs Spurs was Young being in form on one wing and running at players and combining well with Blind, while on the other flank we had Mata, Herrera and Valenia combining brilliantly with their passing and movement off the ball. Rooney was making smart runs, and Carrick was controlling the tempo from midfield, switching the ball from one flank to the other. and Fellaini being the disruptive force that he is in the air.

In the last few weeks, we've had to deal with an out of form RvP and/or Falcao, and also Di Maria being out of sorts.. There was no particular way Spurs could setup against us as we kept mixing it up. Hope we can continue to perform this well against Pool too.

 Is Di Maria eligible to play vs Liverpool?

5131~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
What a terrible post.

5132~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5133~~~
Duncan Ferguson was twice the better header than Fellaini, though. Not to mention he looked a bit like Keanu Reeves.

5134~~~
Your attempt at concealing your total dislike for the player, in humor has failed miserably. I can't believe some people find it so difficult to accept that some player has been able to do his job well (pretty consistenly, mind) on the field and have to resort to finding ways to still make him seem like some kind of a lucky joker.

Maybe he isn't the player we'd like to see starting for us next season (considering that we would hopefully buy right), but right now that lad is doing one hell of a job for his manager.

He's been silencing his critics with his showing on the field and that is an immensely difficult thing to do especially when every odd/every fan/every statistic/every pundit/every media report has been harshly critical about you being fit enough to be a part of the club.

I don't really mind if he moves on in the summer but I have nothing but respect for the way he has turned it around. You need to have true grit and determination to not give up when your own fans boo your every touch during a game.

Let's show the dude some respect. He's more than earned that right.

5135~~~
Leave Marouane Fellaini alone!!!!!!!

5136~~~
Great option squad player atleast and could become a permanent fixture and if we are going to move players on there should be many a player moved before this guy.

5137~~~
Your ongoing point is correct - good on him, but there are some exaggerations in there. His own fans never booed his every touch, just a minority of cnuts booing when he was subbed from time to time.

5138~~~
Glad he got injured at the start of the season. He'd be turning out for Napoli otherwise

5139~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OVhM3zIKTin/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

5140~~~
He had a good game against Spurs but against Arsenal he was hopeless.

It's nice to see him turn it around a bit, but does anyone really want him starting for us next season?

5141~~~
Fellaini is a player who pisses me off, he clearly has a large set of qualities against Chelsea he showed that he was potentially a good Box to box, against West Ham(2013) or Leverkusen he showed that he could be a good defensive midfielder and against Tottenham he showed that he could be a good offensive midfielder/target man.
The rest of his games shows that he is terribly inconsistent and that we can't trust him, not because he is a bad footballer but because you don't know which Fellaini is going to step on the field.

5142~~~
He's a decent option if used correctly but if we are serious about challenging for the title next season, Fellaini should be an option off the bench, not a starter. Still, very happy it's finally working out for the guy.

5143~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">When we treat him as an actual footballer he plays decent to pretty well most of the time, when we treat him as a battering ram he does not play that well. </span>

5144~~~
I agree regarding his attitude - from the booing in preseason and most fans basically wanting rid of him ASAP, he has stuck with it and when the manager gave him a chance, he took it. Fellaini honestly has pretty much the perfect attitude for a player, and this I suspect is why managers like him.
He listens to instructions (this was obvious when he came on vs West Ham).
He never goes missing and will still keep asking for the ball and trying to impact the game, even when things arent going well.
He works hard and puts in a lot of defensive work (not just at set pieces).
He doesnt complain or moan.

In pre-season the booing was really bad. It was honestly the worst thing I have witnessed as a United fan (in the context of the club).

I think as Cooksen says - it depends as much (or more, in my opinion) on how we set the team up. When we try to just play Fellaini up front and hit long balls to him, the entire team plays poorly including Fellaini. When we give him something of a free role and (silly as this sounds) build the team around him a little, he tends to be extremely effective.

When I say "build the team around him" I basically mean having a striker in front of him (Rooney), some wingers, and at least one of Carrick/Blind behind him (Herrera playing as the 2nd CM also helps and is his best position anyway in my opinion).

This.

5145~~~
I'm guessing you missed the pre-season game where he managed to score? It was disgraceful....

5146~~~
Why is this not bumped? He ran Mata close today for MOTM

5147~~~
Cracking game again, bossed it.

5148~~~
He was everywhere on the pitch today and our best player after Mata.

5149~~~
Beast mode today. Superb performance... controlled everything that came his way, used his strength in the right way, really crisp, smart passing... and some cracking defensive headers to boot. Hats off to the man... his turn around is complete.

5150~~~
Fantastic, we can fight any team in the air with him, he's like the fecking RAF.

5151~~~
Best player after Mata. He destroyed Liverpool's midfield in the first half. Who would've thought? Also very important in that final 20 minutes, he cleared pretty much every single Liverpool set piece.

5152~~~
Pele

5153~~~
You can only respect a player who has worked so hard from being a laughing stock to a regular starter. I seriously believe he can play his physical game without making many fouls as he did today.

5154~~~
The big man, Mata and Herrera were all magnificent today. Turning out to be a quality signing (bring back Moyes) who was set to bin RVP cough cough

5155~~~
Schmeichel couldn't stop praising him today.

Fantastic again!

5156~~~
What a turnaround, he's actually a decent passers too. Funny how a bit of confidence can raise a player's level so much. Fair play to him.

5157~~~
Fantastic.

5158~~~
He's the man who ties everything together. Vital player who allows the rest of the team to play with a swagger.

5159~~~
I didn't want to be the one to do  it again...

5160~~~
Don't think there's another player in the squad who I admire more than him. The abuse he received, especially in that pre-season game when he was rumoured to go to Napoli. Booed. At Old Trafford. In a pre-season game. Disgraceful stuff. Something that we'd slate if it happened to any other club.

Big love for the guy. I was patient with him for so long that I feel chuffed that it's working for him now. Missed today's game, but glad he's getting excellent reviews.

5161~~~
Was excellent today.

Whoever signed him and Mata must be a bit of a genius. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5162~~~
Great shift from the mop, kept his concentration defensively and provided a threat in attack.

5163~~~
Very good these past 2 games. Causes so many problems for the opposition. Happy to have him playing in this kind of form.

5164~~~
I'm not a fan of Fellaini, but today was the best performance from him in a United shirt for me. Mata was MOTM, but after him it was a toss up between Fellaini and Herrera.

Great performance, and hopefully he can carry this form into the Villa game.

5165~~~
Thought he was excellent today, he's really sorted his feet out and can run with the ball effectively.

5166~~~
Has played himself into the starting XI now. Bossed the midfield.

5167~~~
Magnificent. Behind Mata best palyer on the pitch.

5168~~~
A great option for us as he can be the target man and drop deeper into midfield. It's going to be very hard to change this current team. It's quite interchangeable now that we've good options. I guess we can play great football with him in the team <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5169~~~
Has looked good in our two best performances of the season. Good on Afroman!

5170~~~
Brilliant today, they couldn't deal with him, Mata or Herrera. Not just on long balls too, but his movement is so intelligent. Great energy as well, runs all day long to close down and win the ball back. Fellaini-Carrick-Herrera is looking like a brilliant midfield.

5171~~~
van Gaal's transforming him into our own Thomas Muller.

5172~~~
I was saying this even when Fellaini was as popular as herpes among United fans: but he isn't and never has been shit.

He's a very good player who is now starting to look like he belongs at a club like Manchester United, mainly because Van Gaal is utilising his strengths correctly (Moyes knew how to do this as well, but the consensus is he didn't have the bottle because he feared attracting a 'long ball/anti-footbal' label).

5173~~~
If a baby was thrown at him he could bring that baby down on his chest without harming it.

5174~~~
His " The Boss" top performance and won everything, proper box 2 box today he was everywhere and was always available for a pass short and long! 

I'm happy for him as his worked hard for his place.

5175~~~
Bloody class out there.

5176~~~
Do you miss him?

5177~~~
He's an incredible weapon that brings something unique to us that no other player does - his physicality and aerial threat/intimidation alone are unrivaled.

5178~~~
Arguably on a level with DDG in terms of his importance to the team when he's in his current form.

5179~~~
Brilliant performance. Good to great player, absolutely worth his place as a Manchester United player. Never thought I'd say as much this time last year. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5180~~~
LVG has definitely realised how to utilise him. You give him some freedom and license to get up and down the pitch - having Carrick/Herrera behind him is vital and allows him to influence the game in attack and defence.

5181~~~
He's not good enough to be box-to-box in a midfield 2, but he's perfect for a midfield 3. It masks his weaknesses and allows him to make use of his best attributes without worrying about getting caught out of position. This formation is bringing the best out of everyone.

5182~~~
Very disciplined performance too.

Managed to avoid a booking which hasn't always been easy for him, and was a big part of everything we did well in the first half.

5183~~~
He looks a bit sharper and quicker these days too, I wonder how much impact that back injury really had.

Thank feck he didn't end up at Napoli.

5184~~~
This. Never been a fan of the guy but we couldn't have done it without him today.

5185~~~
Yes because he is a great player and I love his personality but at the same time we got McCarthy as a replacement and it gave us the funds to get Lukaku so its all good.

5186~~~
Going to wind up something of a cult hero at this rate, phenomenal today.

5187~~~
He's a bit of liability in any position but the one he's playing now, but he's proving himself a very good player for us.

5188~~~
I'm truly worried that someone actually thought of that possibility <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

5189~~~
Fair play to him he was disciplined and sharp today. Looks much fitter than last season

5190~~~
There were times in the match where I was feeling "Go for the cross you scouse cnuts, Fellaini's got this."

Feels really reassuring having him in the lineup.

5191~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5192~~~
Unsung Hero, I remember when we used to play Everton and the 1 player that always worried me was him and I can imagine he was the centre point of Rodgers team talks before the game, he is now becoming such a nuisance for the opposition and thats brilliant to have on our side, he thoroughly deserves his name on the XI right now.

5193~~~
Mata takes the headlines but Fellaini was brilliant at keeping Liverpool at bay. Different kind of player to Keane, obviously, but reminded me a bit of him today.

5194~~~
I'm shocked how good he is. The more they criticise him for his style of play the better performances he produces<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Destroyed both Liverpool's midfield and defence.

It's astonishing the turn around from last season for him and Young, we even had a thread on here asking who should start out of Di Maria and Mata with Fellaini and Young definite starters!

Even after years of watching football there's some things you just don't see coming.

5197~~~
This guy was getting booed/ironically cheered in that pre-season friendly at OT. Love that he's proved the doubters wrong.

5198~~~
Absolute beast defending those set pieces in the second half. Got his head on everything.

5199~~~
Faded towards the end again BUT he set the tone for our dominance right from the first whistle.

5200~~~
Definitely adds to 'turnaround' and speaks a lot about his attitude and personality - you do wonder how many of our other players and 'superstars' would take that sort of abuse on the chin and then go and prove everyone wrong. 

Even when he is playing badly, Fellaini never sulks or hides.


Also can we finally get his chant going?

<i>Afro Afro man!
I got to be, an Afro man!</i>

5201~~~
Too true, it's certainly part of the magic of football!

5202~~~
He's going to be a very important player for us in the Champions League next season.

5203~~~
Really happy for him.  Still unsure whether I accept he should be a United starter in the future, but his mental attitude to get past last season really shows something.

5204~~~
Starting to look like a £27.5m player. Great against Spuds last week and brilliant against the scousers again today. 

He beings brilliantly balance to midfield and his passing has really improved. Am very happy for him too, considering the stick he got.

5205~~~
Great again. That role he's playing is perfect for him. Hopefully he stays fit because he's crucial right now.

5206~~~
The thing I enjoy is how easily he breaks up the play. So full of energy to today and dominant in the air. This is Fellaini at his best. It works because we use him as an option rather than long balls all the time. Our attacking play was varied today which was great

5207~~~
Irrepresible, his presence is palpable, good or bad really. Some still dont see him as part of our best set up, good thing then that the game isnt played on paper. Maroune brings entangables with him along with that monstrous frame. A joy to behold in this form.

5208~~~
Been everywhere today, bullied Liverpool the feck out alongside Herrera, they simply destroyed them in the middle. Who'd have thought, bloody hell.

5209~~~
This is why I have been preaching for weeks. Diversity in attack is key - opponents know that with Fellaini around, every cross, every corner and set piece can be a potential goal. We saw last year in games like the Fulham match that if you have no aerial threat in the side, teams will just let you swing in cross after cross and happily defend them.

Having an aerial presence actually allows us to attack through the middle more effectively, as the opposition cannot simply pack the middle and show you out wide.

5210~~~
His height when defending corners is so undervalued, I think he cleared every single one, it was almost like watching Sol Campbell.

5211~~~
Absolute beast again.

5212~~~
very happy for him. I think he's shown great professionalism during his time at utd.  He came into a sticky situation for a lot of money so the pressure was on for him to succeed. Add to that injury problems, and warming the bench, and then you see what he's gone through to get to this point. He's definitely not the best midfielder, but he's showing great effort and rising to the challenge of being a utd player. If he keeps his consistency he could become a favorite.

5213~~~
In good form and bossed the midfield and air battles. Great stuff, massive respect for the lad from fighting back considering how badly he was treated at the start.

5214~~~
He got boo'd by our fans once and to come back from that to how's his playing today is a credit to him! 

Moyes knew him better then anyone but it's LVG who has shown his confirdence in him to get the best out of him! His even using his left foot which shows that his beginning to believe in himself.

I have to give credit to LVG too as his been critized of his man managing skills but it's his way or the highway and that's what you need at big clubs, no player is bigger then the club and that's what SAF had also!

5215~~~
I wish he had better dribbling skills and little more pace then he would be a monster. We utilize him well now. Can he get better under van Gaal to be a long term starter? Iliked his game today as he was very clean in tackles and didn't get yellow which is what is most irritating about him, causing too many fouls, he was very disciplined today and i was in contrast to the home side who couldn't bear that they are gonna play in Europa league at best next season.. Fellaini earned his palce for next game but needs to play at his best to be useful for us..

5216~~~
Simple but hes doing something this season which he wasnt last season, running. Sounds weird but last season it looked like he was jogging but now, along with his strength and the way he protects the ball, hes getting into great positions to be found and its working. He gives away a few silly fouls here and there , but some of them are good to stop the opposition from countering.

Respect for fighting and breaking into the team and with the 433 formation, its no longer just booting it forward to him, its actually passing it to him, whether it be in the air or on the ground. LVG doing what Moyes was scared to do, and its benefiting United and Fellaini.

5217~~~
Every good move we made today started with him as a target, including both goals. He's key in terms of us turning defence into attack. Ideally the whole team would be better at that and we'd do it through movement, passing and ball carrying, but until we get there he's a very effective cutch.

5218~~~
I've become such a fan of the big guy it's unreal - he brings so much to the team these days!

5219~~~
He has to start. Not because he's the best of the bunch, but because he brings something completely different. His aerial presence, strength have big influence in our attack and gives us other options. DDG, Valencia, Smalling, Jones, Blind, Carrick, Herrera, Mata, Fellaini, di Maria, Rooney is the way forward for me. Harsh on Young but di Maria just gives that extra.

5220~~~
Like I said before the game, you can analyse him all you want, but no team can train to stop Fellaini. Absolutely bullied the Liverpool players today. Held it up well, bought people into play, got back and defended well, especially set pieces. He was excellent. And if we're in trouble at the back, he's an outlet.

5221~~~
He's been great lately. We've managed to incorporate him into the team whilst still managing to play attractive football. He's a hand-full for defenders, arguably the most potent aerial threat in the league.

He needs to start every game.

5222~~~
Don't know about that. I mean, Young was really good again today, and although Di Maria come on an provided a great assist for Mata, he didn't really impress me after that.

5223~~~
Such a great option. Really liking him.

5224~~~
He's now a better player than he ever was under Moyes, at Everton and United.

Fellaini and LVG deserve massive credit for his development this season.

5225~~~
Really like how we have used him in the last 2 games, the way he links up with the left wing is great.

5226~~~
Definitely one of our players of the season. I wouldn't have thought I'd be saying that this time last season.

5227~~~
Another good game by Fellaini. Especially in the first half he seemed to win every single header. This Fellaini is an asset for United instead of the liability he was last season. Very happy to see him continueing his good form.

5228~~~
Imagine a team of 11 Fellainis.

5229~~~
Stoke ?

5230~~~
I'm sure I'm not alone in giving him stick this season, and quite a bit of it too. More than happy to admit I will be glad to see him stay. This position van Gaal has him playing suits him an absolute treat. Fantastic option to have, a unique player in the league.

5231~~~
Thought he was our best player over a duration of 90 mins today. Didn't give the ball away and was taking the piss out of Liverpool with his touches.

5232~~~
Indeed. They got 4 or 5 set pieces in the last 15 minutes and I was absolutely shitting myself every time, as I knew that's their biggest chance of getting a goal with 10 men. Fellaini cleared them all though. I added one point to his rating just for that.

5233~~~
Starting to play like he did in his everton days. He was actually a great big game player back then. Was harsh for people to judge him in a team last year where no player was playing well. Although a lot of the credit has to go to LVG for playing him like he has tactically, looks a lot like moyes didn't have the balls to play long ball

5234~~~
Set up Blind in a brilliant position and almost created the 0-3, he has been poor but he still far more likely to make something happen than Young. Assist vs Arsenal, assist today and could have even more. On the other hand he will lose the ball plenty. But that's more him being in a bad patch imo.

5235~~~
Fair play to him for making some good contributions. He's playing well but I still don't think Fellaini starts long-term for a United side that wants to win the league.

5236~~~
Superb. He was a monster in the first half today. Was everywhere, won the ball, chested things down with ease,  bulled the liverpool players and his ball retention was good too. Set the tone for the game.

5237~~~
I said this before and I'm hoping someone takes note: It would be great if someone could make a youtube video of his comeback which includes clips of the boos and when on tv they said how this (fellaini's picture) equals to 27.5 million. Then that performance, the first good one of the season where he chest controlled and scored can start with some motivating music. 

Please no rap music though. Some sort of beast music.

5238~~~
He's our new Fletcher <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5239~~~
Fellaini was a complete beast again today. I know its not the United way but I wouldn't swap him for anyone right now. Opposition defenders simply cant handle him, he gives us something different that the opposition cant work out how to stop. Plus he wins the ball in the air 9 times out of 10 in defensive and attacking areas. Sorry to say it but he should be one of the first names on the team sheet with the way his is performing at the moment.

5240~~~
He really turned the corner. Another great game and I wonder how many km's he runs a game. Just him and Herrera could move quicker into midfield at times once we're not in possession. 

Today, he was also great at defending corners. Every single one he headed away and in this role and form deserves to start!

5241~~~
He's like a Kangaroo grabbing everything in his chest.

5242~~~
He is not my type of player but he is really good in few things,those things look important in our games at the moment. Wish those who praise him remember that,because if those things dont come good,people will have a go at him again just like in first season.

5243~~~
The biggest improvement in his performance today was he didn't give away nearly as many fouls as he normally does. I still don't think he should be regularly starting for us but he has been putting in some good performances lately.

5244~~~
Absolute beast at both ends. I think something that's easy to overlook as spectators is that opposition absolutely hate playing against him. He's big, he's dirty and he's constantly in your way. At the very least ona good day like today, he'll disrupt opposition rythym.

5245~~~
Before LVG arrived, I honestly thought Fellaini would be ostracised and eventually sold 6 months later.
I remember reading before LVG arrived that Fellaini was worried about playing under LVG and was already considering his options (at other clubs).
I absolutely did not expect him to become so integral to our setup and LVG placing him in such a central role of our attack.

In early Sept, we had: Rooney, RVP, Falcao, Mata, Di Maria to fill 3-4 places.
6 months months later: Fellaini is ahead of most of those names. Who would have believed it?

5246~~~
Me, I believed it

I stuck by him last season too convinced he could become an important player

5247~~~
He was dominant in our goal area that last 20 minutes or so. Every corner and freekick was headed away with total confidence.

5248~~~
I expected him to come good this season, but I actually thought he would be playing a deeper, Box to box role alongside a Carrick, Blind or Herrera (and be rotated amongst those players). I didn't expect him to become quite so important for us in an advanced role I have to admit.

5249~~~
Massive praise to the best man, we're using him to perfection at the moment.

Not relying on him in a 2man mid, and not expecting Mata-esque magic as a number 10.
Love it.

Probably the best player in the league in terms of aerial ability.

5250~~~
Stevenage are basically the ugly side of him without any of the pros.

5251~~~
Not for me, not close.

5252~~~
don't forget though, those that slagged him off are idiots since he was injured for much of it and those around him played like strangers.

5253~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Loving that analogy. Was really composed on the ball today and was well involved. Has become quite an important cog in our midfield. Really looks suited to the tempo we set. Yet another sign that things are coming together for the team

5254~~~
Honestly I'm happy to see him stay and have been very impressed with him but I think he needs to be a squad option next season and not an integral part of our game plan if we want to progress this style further.  That said I'm sure he can get a fair amount of appearances anyway and he would be a great option to have in games where we need to alter our style.

Fair play to the lad though, he's been excellent recently and not just as a battering ram, his footballing abilities and touch has impressed me.  Who knows maybe under the tutelage of LVG he can bring them aspects of his game to a whole new level.

5255~~~
He intercepted so many of their passes in the 1st half, and in 2nd half his aerial presence in our box was invaluable

5256~~~
Yep, he seems to have regenerated his intimidating aerial presence to the point where defenders concede one on one chances to him.

5257~~~
Yea i know and agree,not having a go at anyone just a bit annoyed when i see how some posters throw players/manager under the bus like they are garbage just because they not doing good IN THAT VERY MOMENT,thats all.

5258~~~
It was funny though one time seeing Sterling win a header, that both of them were going for, but at least the ball was in their box

5259~~~
I want to see a video of all his touches today. Same with Herrera and Mata. Thought Fellaini was good, but got a feeling his video might be more impressive than what I initially thought of him after the game.

5260~~~
I know his writing isn't everyone's cup of tea, but this is priceless from Barney Ronay:

<i>The Fellaini chest remains one of the mini-marvels of the modern game, an adhesive, velvety-soft cradle, like an ancient baseball catcher’s mitt, into which the ball just seems to nestle from any angle. Arsenal had countered Fellaini’s influence at Old Trafford by putting Francis Coquelin in his pocket of space, a defensive midfielder with the discipline to do little more than hoover up the fruits of his knockdowns.

Here at times it was almost painful to see Fellaini drift malevolently towards Can, who must have found himself wondering if, all things considered, this was really what he signed up for; a player schooled in pass and move and engineered to German academy standards being battered under the high ball by an angular Belgian repeatedly snaffling the ball into that marsupial pouch he appears to keep somewhere below his chin.</i>

5261~~~
5 goals this season. None last season.

Mata has 8
Herrera has 5
Di Maria 4
Blind has chipped in with a couple too. 

We're starting to see goals from midfield again!

5262~~~
What's scary is Mata's total could be double if he'd played consistently.

5263~~~
His form is more him playing in his proper position than anything. He's never going to be able to do what Blind, Carrick and Herrera do in CM, he looks awful at it. But can he menace from further up the pitch, bring others into play with his back to goal, turn and take up dangerous positions? Yes he can. But does that mean that the naysayers (including me) were wrong about his ability in a deeper role? I don't think so

5264~~~
Excellent performance from him today, played his,role to perfection

5265~~~
I tell you what. Moyes, shit manager but got us Mata and Fellaini <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5266~~~
Can't fault him for his effort. Was good today and used his physique very well in challenges and tussles. Defended well in the air from set pieces.

5267~~~
Van Gaal has done a good job getting Fellaini and Young back on track.

5268~~~
playing his arse off for the <b>team</b>

5269~~~
I look forward to unleashing him in Europe, he's been utilised brilliantly by van Gaal and is best suited to a box-to-box role in a midfield three. He's genuinely impossible to defend against on his day, we saw a more defensive minded performance from him against Liverpool and it was excellent.

5270~~~
The swift passing and moving mixed with long balls to Fellaini destroyed Roger's tactics and bamboozled their midfield and defense.

Long balls to a big man who is mobile and can play football is something you can't really prepare for.

5271~~~
He was a beast. So glad I supported him from the start and he is turning it around. He was crucial for the end of the match with all their set-pieces, he cleared so many crosses with his head. Just bullied their midfield and defence.

5272~~~
Yep. All credit to him.

5273~~~
Any videos of his individual performance vs Liverpool yet?

5274~~~
He was always a big game player for Everton. Used to play well against us, City, Arsenal and Chelsea. 

He's doing what we should have had him do in the first place. He is bullying the opposition. 

And we not playing hopeless long balls to him.

5275~~~
One of my favourite players at United now. There is so much to learn from the big man

He was castracized last season as a symbol of our failures. He received abuse from commentators and fans alike.

He was booed at OT by our <i>own fans</i>. I have <i>never</i> seen that for any other player in United colours. <i>We are not fecking Madrid. </i>

He was nearly shipped off to Napoli. 

He chose to stay. And fight for his place. And fight he did. Like a tough-as-nails man which he is. To the point that he is our best outfield player this season.

Hair-raising stuff. Salutes. I wish I could learn from Fellaini.

5276~~~
He's well and truly cemented himself as a very important player in the squad. It wont be long before all the pundits who were writing him off jump on board the Fellaini train. Well done to the big man. He deserves to be here.

5277~~~
Can't say I always felt love for him, but nowdays he's welcome to stay at my house at any time. I think some fans should have a good look at themselves in the mirror and come clean in this thread.

5278~~~
Great performance, very close to the level that he produced against us at Goodison couple of years back by single handedly destroying us.

5279~~~
I think that it was me.

5280~~~
Has made lots of people in here (me included) look like right plonkers for the way we criticized him last season. As many have mentioned, his physical presence and aerial ability is just fan-fecking-tastic. Also, hes shown hes not just elbows and hair either, the big man is actually quite technically gifted

5281~~~
Great performance from him, again. His link up play is good too. Now, he's winning all the headers.

I think that only Mata and Herrera were better than him yesterday.

5282~~~
He loves it out there right now. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

Giving his 100 percent every game, great to see.

5283~~~
He's playing with confidence on his best position. Last year he didn't had confidence and was playing as CM, which isn't the position where he is at his best.

5284~~~
Big credit also to LVG for bringing the best out of him and Young as well and of course to the players who fought back. I would have never thought that'd be possible but fair play to them

5285~~~
That sort of performence will do well for us if we get into Europe next season. Having options like him is invaluable.

5286~~~
Brilliant, fecking brilliant!!

5287~~~
Another really good performance. Another nail in the coffin of the redcafe myth that he can only play as a target man.

5288~~~
This doesn't usually happen with us. What's supposed to happen is that he got sold in the summer for £5m or less and started putting in these performances for someone else.

This makes it all the better.

5289~~~
He allows our more technically brilliant players to get on the ball more. He's absolutely vital to how we're playing right now.

5290~~~
It's nice to see him played in the position that earned him the transfer in the first place. Last season trying to shoehorn him into a defensive midfield role, or a square bank of two was awful to watch. He's clearly at his most dangerous peeling onto opposition defenders and playing between their midfield and defence.

I also like the fact that we aren't just aimlessly lumping it up to him anymore. We are playing shorter 30-35 yard passes up to him, which he can pluck out of the air or flick on, rather than the 50-60 yard lumps from central defence we were attempting earlier in the season. Carrick is vital in this respect.

5291~~~
There are a lot of United fans eating huimble pie with regards to this man. I am one of them. I defended him for ages and then gave up and called for him to be sold. I am made up that many of us have been proven wrong and he looks the part. There are other players i'd have over him, but right now he is more than doing a good job and I enjoy watching him play. Congrats Mr F!

5292~~~
This.

5293~~~
He's been in or around that level for nearly the whole season. We should buy players that destroy us more often. Ronaldo is another one that comes to mind. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5294~~~
Incredible the way he's found himself in this false 10 / false left-winger / false midfielder hybrid... who knew that was a position?

5295~~~
Crucial part of the cog that has helped turn around our season. He contributed to the grinding out of results when the football wasn't pretty and then these last few weeks with the new system he's been vital.

I just think we have a really well balanced front 5/6 right now. Carrick, Herrera, Mata, Fellaini and Rooney with Young (current form) and Di Maria (if/when he turns his form around) just all compliment each other really well and it's promising to watch.

Invest in the defence and add another wide player and we've already got a team capable of challenging in my opinion. Doesn't require a 'huge' overhaul in the summer, which in my opinion will disrupt things too much. 1/2 starters and then 1/2 squad options/young players to develop is all it needs.

5296~~~
Philosophy!

Seriously though I mentioned in another thread - I really like the energy and defensive attributes that he brings to the #10....or whatever you want to call the role he is playing.
I think if it were a player like Mata or Kagawa in that role, we wouldnt look nearly as good because they simply wouldnt offer as much defensively as Fellaini does. Furthermore this has a knock on effect on some of the other team choices - the fact that Fellaini contributes defensively allows us to play a more creative, attacking CM behind him in Herrera. Again, if it was Mata as #10 then I dont think LVG would be wanting to play Herrera in CM as well, he would deem it too imbalanced (and I kinda agree...).

The role he plays is like if you took a classic "box to box midfielder" and just shifted his "action zones" (that sounds very American) forward a notch. He operates from deep in our half, right into the opposition penalty area. Its not a traditional role, but Fellaini is a rather unique player, and whatever the case - it seems to work. Fellaini in this role allows us to play attacking players like Herrera and Mata around him, without us getting overrun. Furthermore he seems to be starting to forge a good understanding/partnership with Rooney, which is always good news.

So yeah, basically what I am trying to say is that whilst the attacking attributes of Fellaini and his aerial prowess/strength are what are normally focused on and praised, I think at the moment his most valuable asset is the way he defends from the front in that role, and that particular quality is something we can pretty much build a team around.

5297~~~
He has played really well and deserves to start in our forthcoming games.

However, I have been wondering about what happens when Van Persie is available again. IF he does come back in, does anyone else think Fellaini might be the one to make way? Van Persie goes up front, Rooney drops back to play the role Fellaini has been playing? 

Not what I want to see happen at all. But wondering if this could be what Van Gaal has in mind.

5298~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SbxPh2BuCE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

5299~~~
I am delighted for Fellaini <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> He could make it here after all <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5300~~~
I don't think RvP or Falcao will get back into the team, unless they were to replace Rooney. I think van Gaal realises that this team/formation is the way forward, and he's said himself that if you play well, you'll start every game.

5301~~~
humble pie on my part. he has a role as a starter. never thought it'd happen.

5302~~~
Definitely a possibility. Although, based on the season so far, you'd have to say Hererra is more likely to be in the firing line.

Would be such a kick in the teeth if that happened, though. Van Gaal's willingness to keep Di Maria on the bench has restored a bit of faith in his reputation for always putting the team ahead of individuals, no matter how stellar their reputation. Starting RvP as soon as he's fit instead of Herrera or Fellaini would be really depressing

5303~~~
Its possible, but LVG often says he doesnt like to change his team if he doesnt have to. Bear in mind too we've only just started an epic run of difficult games and we're clearly playing the best football of the season, it would be hard to imagine that LVG would want to play around with things, no matter how much he respects RVP.

5304~~~
Have to admit I was completely wrong about him. He really brings out the best in our more technical players. Not sure I would start him in home games against sides in the lower half, but in big games and tricky away games he has to be in the first XI.

5305~~~
I hope you are right <a class="username" data-user="86698, @Captain Hindsight" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86698/">@Captain Hindsight</a> <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> <a class="username" data-user="84350, @bishblaize" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84350/">@bishblaize</a>, that is my feeling too. Its new territory I guess, how he deals with one of his own being marginalised. I can see why Pogue takes some comfort from the handling of Di Maria but that is quite different given he doesnt have the same relationship with him. But he has this reputation for being hard in these matters so hopefully he lives up to it.

5306~~~
The defensive side of his game has improved a lot too off late. We are the most balanced atm when he's in there and I hope LvG doesn't change it once RvP returns. He, Herrera and Carrick are a great midfield combination when out of possession. Carrick sits deep and makes the interceptions and clearances while Fellaini and Herrera close players down, get stuck in and make life difficult for the other team.

5307~~~
Played well and making me eat my words - honestly didn't think he had it in him to make it here.

5308~~~
Fair play to him, he's taken a lot of stick off the fans but he's worked hard and turned his career around here. Adds that physicalitiy to our side that's been missing for a long time and an absolute pain in the to defend against. Basically playing how he used to play against us for Everton!

5309~~~
His ability to allow us to transition from defence into attack in a matter of seconds and the consistency of this ability is unbelievable.

5310~~~
As gash as Wayne was yesterday, I think that they create a nice partnership together.

5311~~~
Would be interesting to know how many kms he run against Spurs and Liverpool. His work rate has been very impressive as well recently

5312~~~
He was very good yesterday, not quite as good as his Spurs performance (where he was genuinely unplayable at times) but still very good nonetheless.

5313~~~
I think his first half was better than that. He was more of an attacking threat against Spurs, but at Anfield he was instrumental at marginalizing their midfield. He played that role to perfection.

5315~~~
Many complained he dropped off  in the second half vs Spurs (I think that was a bit exaggerated). But I think he was good all the way through yesterday. Yes, the team as a whole dropped off, but I thought Fellaini was winning the ball and using it well all the way to the end.

5316~~~
In both games, he dropped off after 30-35 minutes. He actually did that in the last three games.

5317~~~
He is undoubtedly a very good player - you don't get an expensive transfer to United otherwise. More importantly, he can be an immensely effective player in disrupting the opposition and making something happen, particularly with his headers. It won't always work and he can be a foul and yellow card magnet, but he should always be at least on the bench. I hope he stays, and think he will. Don't care whether he is "aesthetically pleasing".

He is our one player who can scare the pants off defenders just by his presence.

5318~~~
I'm looking forward to seeing Fellaini in this role up against Toure when City come to OT. Think we might finally have the presence in midfield to disrupt City's flow and stamp our authority in the game, after seemingly years of City having their way with us in midfield. Even when we have won, such as the 3-2 at the Etihad, they were still more than holding their own...

5319~~~
He was great defending set pieces too. But that's his bread and butter.

5320~~~
He binds up so many players and creates havoc and chaos for the opposition. Right now, he is unstoppable in his fluid position. The opposition would have to play a 2 meter tall right defensive midfielder/inverted wingback to mark him out of the game.

5321~~~
Sums up my experience as well. good on him.

5322~~~
So now the question is.... If someone come up with an offer of 20m+ next season, should we take it?

5323~~~
No, he's proved to be an extremely useful asset to the team. I imagine we may sign a midfielder to displace him but even if we do, I doubt that guy will have many of the same qualities Fellaini. £20m+ is a lot of money but we don't need the money, so unless it's an extortionate amount, I wouldn't sell him.

5324~~~
He's David de Gea's favourite team mate at the moment. He single handedly will ramp up David's pass completion percentage. Brilliant in defending set pieces too. In the form of his life. So happy for him.

5325~~~
And miss out on all the CL ties to come with Fellainho rubbing the Chevrolet logo in a multitude of diminutive continental players' faces?

5326~~~
We finally have a midfield to disrupt them with Herrera and Mata also. At times before it was Carrick alone.

5327~~~
He was very good against Liverpool, and he was very comfortable with them pressing him on the ball. Last season, under Moyes, he was very uncomfortable on the ball and struggled whenever opponents pressed him, but now, he looks much more composed and calm on the ball. He's been a great outlet for us in the past few matches, and the opposition are always confused as to whether to give him time on the ball or not because he's demonstrated that he can pick out a player in a dangerous area.

At the moment, Fellaini looks like a different player compared to how he was in the beginning of the season, when he was slow, sluggish, passive on the ball, and unsure about what to do with it. The confidence that he's currently oozing is helping him perform at his best, which is great for us as it means that his mere presence can create spaces for others and provide support for other attacking players.

I still think that he shouldn't be someone who should start regularly for us as a key player, but he's certainly a first-team player for us who can be relied upon.

5328~~~
Vote for Fellaini

<a class="externalLink" href="http://fanawards.90min.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fanawards.90min.com/</a>

5329~~~
He's an absolute weapon. His physicality and aerial abilities alone are worth him starting. He's also managed to turn into quite the box to box player.

5330~~~
Always liked the big guy and am delighted he's doing well! He's one of our key players now.

5331~~~
Fellaini has been an absolute beast recently, I honestly don't think we would be anywhere near as good without him. He and Herrera have been superb in recent games and should always be in the first 11 IMO.

5332~~~
This is where he has improved. He was often just a big physical lump before, but he's actually making himself a bit of a nightmare for opposition teams at the moment and is a really good presence in midfield right now, as opposed to being a liability who's very tall.

5333~~~
Yep, I think this will change Van Gaal's logic a bit in terms of the urgency of going out and buying another midfielder. Carrick is definitely going to stay for another year at least, so it will be hard to squeeze another midfielder in.

5334~~~
Nearly 12km against Liverpool, think it was 11.7km His work rate has always been impressive, I remember last season when we played Shakthar(iirc) away and he was subbed in 65th minute having ran nearly 10kms which is crazy.

5335~~~
I'd still like to see him sign another top midfielder long-term. As excellent as Fellaini and Carrick have been lately, we can't guarantee that they'll definitely be able to maintain their recent form constantly. Carrick's getting on a bit age wise as well. We've been excellent in midfield lately, but whether we'll able to consistently maintain this level is yet to be seen.

5336~~~
This was said a lot last year with a completely different meaning, and it was 100% true. Now look at the guy!

5337~~~
For around 25m, yes.

A good season shouldn't hide the fact that he is limited and that we still need to improve, and the box-to-box position is one of the priorities.

5338~~~
Even if LVG does bring in someone that's somehow even more effective than Fellaini playing the way he is, I'd still not sell him for the sole fact that he'd still be an amazing squad player, which are invaluable to title winning teams.

5339~~~
I would actually bring a better/more suited player with the money, otherwise you are right.

5340~~~
What do you mean by 'more suited'? He's probably one of the biggest reasons we're playing so well.

5341~~~
Yeah, he's a useful player to have about even if he isn't starting, particularly as he seems to have a good attitude.

5342~~~
Fellaini has to give everything in order to reach the level that we need, he manages to do that for 30mn and then drops drastically after, at half time, he comes back in good shape and than drops again, at this level we need players with a greater marge who don't need to be at 100% of their abilities.
As for the 'more suited', I think that he is playing Herrera's role and that Herrera is playing the role of the missing #8.

5343~~~
More suited towards what we appear to be evolving into long-term.  Which would mean Herrera moving into Fellaini's spot and the fabled pure #8 replacing Herrera...

Edit: or maybe what JPR just said.

For anyone that is interested in some Fellaini stories. From the 2nd article: “Fellaini has qualities that <b>now in this moment he can contribute a lot</b>, and that's why he is playing,” said Van Gaal. Probably doesn't mean he has much of a chance long term as a starter.

5345~~~
Fellaini has done well but if we can get a midfielder who is physically strong, can tackle, pass and is technically sound (sounds like im describing Koke<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>) i wouldn't mind letting him go. Having said that id still prefer to keep him as a squad player. He will always be useful in certain types of games.

5346~~~
That's not too bad, I guess he was one of our top runners.

As others said, he's still a rather limited player but LVG found the perfect role for him that brings out the best. If he now can add some assists to his game he surely would justify his place in the starting 11

5347~~~
Football eh? Zero to hero. People say he's limited like its a revelation. He never came as the next Paul Scholes! He's not doing anything now that he wasn't at Everton, just we were playing him out of position until now. He's a weapon indeed and doing to other teams what we hated when he played against us. Teams now have to think about him in more ways than any other current player cause most good things that happen of late, he's played a pivotal part in. People also forget how many defensive headers he wins from set pieces too.....

5348~~~
His place is more than justified already. Why does he need to add some assists?

5349~~~
No, absolutely not. Why should we?

5350~~~
When we attack he plays behind the striker and obviously it would be great if he could provide assists in that role as well

5351~~~
It would be great but shouldn't be the difference between him starting or not. He nailed down his first XI status with that performance against Liverpool, which didn't feature any assists.

5352~~~
I'd say even before the Liverpool game it was clear that he would start. Anyway, I'm happy that he turned the corner and has become a very valuable player for the club

5353~~~
He is doing what he can do, we probably see his best football right now. His strenght is useful to us but he remains the weakest point in our midfield and I still say he is not starting material for United. I am hapopoy to have him right now but still wish for a new CM in the coming transfer window. Somebody with the same strength but better passing abilities like Pogba, Toure (only refering to the type of player!)

5354~~~
Aye, that was the impression I got from those quotes too. I'd guess Fellaini will be the one displaced if we get another midfielder in the summer.

How some or most fans treated him at the start of the season in a game vs Valencia,football fans what a bunch of ...

5357~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OLzut9Yl1O7/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

5358~~~
Looks like he has continued his good form in the national team.

5359~~~
He's Belgium's top scorer apparently now that Van Buyten retired.

5360~~~
Yup, remember that. The guy has been phenomenal recently, one of our key midfielders now.

5361~~~
Absolute wrecking ball. Love the hairy bastard.

5362~~~
Just scored another one. Beautiful goal, again with his left foot.

5363~~~

How can you not love this guy.

5365~~~
I've been saying that for months <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5366~~~
Both goals from his weaker foot, second one's a beauty, happy as feck for him.

5367~~~
He's really two-footed. Only noticed that this season.

5368~~~
We have to give Moyes's some credit for bringing him to United but I feel that it is Van Gaal's influence that is advancing the player. Whatever the case, he will always be a very useful player, at the least, for us.

5369~~~
Tbf it's pretty easy. Beautiful goal and he is in a great form right now, but he isn't the most likable character.

5370~~~
Brimming with confidence at the moment. Really making me eat my words. Last season, I honestly rated his footballing ability no higher than a League One player. In great form right now, brilliant goal tonight.

5371~~~
His attitude is spot on and an example to other players of getting your head down and working hard. I find him very likeable, personally.

5372~~~
Goal!

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x2kxxgw?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

5373~~~
He is finally showing the sort of form we saw at Everton for a couple of seasons that made a lot of people stand up and take notice, credit to him for completely changing my mind on him.

5374~~~
Yeah, but he is a dirty player and a very frustrating one when he is off-form. We should give him credit for his attitude, this is spot-on, after all this abuse (he didn't deserve one from his own fans, no-one does, yet the critique was justified) he pulled himself together and become a useful player for us. But I still don't like him

5375~~~
I can't believe there is still people who wants him sold in the summer. The way he has worked himself back into the team after being booed by our own fans deserves a lot of credit and he is becoming one of my favorite United players.

5376~~~
He had a decent run around this time last year in a defensive midfield role. Seemed Moyes was going with a 4-5-1 / 4-4-1-1. A tough 10 months with circumstances like being the symbol of Moyes, plus being quite injury prone didn't help. He proved himself at Everton to be considered here though.

5377~~~
I don't see him as a dirty player myself. He is physical and combative - so was Roy Keane. The crap about his elbows has been massively exaggerated on here - probably so people could use it as yet another stick to beat him with last season. His height causes problems in this respect but I don't think he does anything intentionally, and since he has been at the club there haven't really been any such 'incidents'.

Of course you are welcome to your opinion on him, as am I and everyone else - but I find your assertion of him as not likeable to be wide of the mark.

5378~~~
He still fouls a lot but I feel the darker side of his game is disappearing under Van Gaal. I think the way that he has come back this season really emphasises the strength of his character. These are the types of players that you need a top club.

5379~~~
I posted probably a dozen times in this very thread to that effect - there were a lot of mitigating circumstances for Fellaini last season. Whilst his performances were poor, the fans turned on him basically immediately.

5380~~~
They fans turned on him before he kicked a ball last season

And then he was the butt of many jokes

5381~~~
hope he tells other red devils de Bruyne, Naingollan and Witsel to join the Red devils army of Manchester

5382~~~
He wasn't playing much worse than many others in the squad though. But he was Moyes' buy and cost too much, so he became a scapegoat for everything that went wrong it seems.

5383~~~
He didn't really. He had some OK performances against mediocre opposition, which some people got excited about because he was comically bad otherwise especially in the bigger games last season.

5384~~~
I always thought that he was the target, the stooge if you like, for what the fans really thought of Moyes. It was almost a religious mantra for some fans loyal to Fergie that they couldn't criticise the new manager no matter what, thus the anger was directed at the next most logical target.

5385~~~
Chuffed for him. He's playing with such confidence at the moment, it's fantastic. 

This.

5386~~~
I still liked him more when he was playing in midfield this season. When he plays behind the striker, other than the last two games, it becomes quite an easy option for our players just to look for him when we can do much with passing the ball around with the players we have.

5387~~~
I'm with you for the most part but the last two games I think he's been playing more between the lines, or box to box as opposed to a direct focal point like he was against Arsenal and Swansea.

5388~~~
He is no Roy Keane - there is a difference, imo, you have players that foul for a reason (and that reason can even be a criminal one, like when Keane fouled Haaland) and you have players that just foul - foul constantly and, often, meaninglessly. Fellaini is the latter - though he is doing better under Van Gaal, I have to give him credit for that. My definition of a "likable" player is a player that opposition fans can and do like. I didn't like him at Everton because of his dirty/stupid/clumsy side and very few did, iirc - same logic applies here, I don't think that many opposition fans like him now.

5389~~~
I don't think he is majorly a dirty or cynical player, my main gripe is that he'd give away so many clumsy and unnecessary fouls at times.

5390~~~
That's simply not true. Before he came to United there were a number of incidents, notably those 3 with Shawcross which are undeniably terrible assaults. Then when he arrived, he commited two bad ones on Zabaleta (which was awful) and Gosling. The one against Allen I'm willing to accept the height argument but the other two certainly don't fall under that umbrella.

Aside from "that tackle", I don't remember Keane doing anything where it wasn't either a hard tackle or a reply to a bad tackle. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't remember him making leg breaking tackles or elbowing players.

Although on a positive note, Fellaini seems to have cut it out of his game too under Van Gaal. He still gives away a lot of silly needless fouls and gets booked due a totting up process but he's certainly toned down his negative physicality this season which is good to see.

5391~~~
Cleverley is a much better footballer........ Fellaini has really revived and looks like a certainty for club en country, happy for him.

5392~~~

5393~~~
never been a fan of the player but he really is likable.

5394~~~
fecking hell, those goals are amazing.

SIGN HIM UP!!!

5395~~~
You have stated yourself that you dont like him, so it doesnt surprise me that you are coming off a bit biased here. Most have agreed that Fellaini (just like other tall players) gets unfairly penalised a lot of the time simply due to the height advantage he holds.

There have been a few games this season where he has commited too many fouls, but these were primarily when he was being played as a DM - which with hindsight we can see is clearly not his best position. In his last few games when he has been in a more attacking role, he doesnt tend to concede anything like as many fouls - and again, some of those given against him are largely regarded to be poor decisions from the ref.


None of the incidents you have mentioned really stick out in my memory, to be honest. I have noticed that during his time here though, the fans have had a tendency of making a mountain out of a molehill whenever Fellaini becomes involved - like the 'spitting' incident (against Chelsea I think? Could be wrong) where the 'fans' on here were going out of their way to try to argue that Fellaini had done something wrong, even when all evidence pointed to the contrary.

Again, I think Fellaini gets penalised a lot due to his height and because he sometimes appears awkward. When your arms are at the same height as other players heads though then I think you have to accept that accidents will happen sometimes. Fellaini definitely doesnt strike me as a dirty, malicious or cynical player - combative, physical and occasionally aggressive yes, but not dirty. Frankly we have needed a bit of bite in our midfield for years, so I for one have no problem with him acting a bit of a hard man at times, as long as he doesnt get himself sent off.

5396~~~
I actually do quite like the guy, but you seem ridiculously biased towards him. He doesn't add a lot of "bite" in the sense of making hard, fair tackles. He's done well this season in becoming a lot more defensively aware and has started really using his physicality in a legal way, but last season he was almost useless in midfield in terms of "bite" as he was too slow to even cover the ground.

Having a problem with this is not making a mountain out of a molehill.

5397~~~
Can't disagree with you about me being biased, obviously - I am. But, then, so are you - you've stated yourself that you do like him. It's hard to find a non-biased opinion here, and the truth is probably somewhere in between. To blame his height for his elbow shenanigans is like blaming Ivanovic's shoulder for being in the way of Suarez's jaws, it's absurd, really.

<a class="username" data-user="64859, @Joemo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64859/">@Joemo</a> has some good points - about the difference between combative and dirty players and about his disciplinary/mental progress under Van Gaal. Most of his fouls comes from him being too slow/stupid in the first place (I'm talking about football intelligence here, of course) and then trying to make up for it with his hands. A childish behaviour. But Van Gaal seems to be a very good influence on him.

I have no problem with him as long as he plays good and doesn't do our club any harm - and he is certainly a success so far in this season. But in the future/ideal United I don't want such players in the team - I want intelligent players without the occasional brainfarts to have the main roles in our team - ergo, I don't "like" him - and it's pretty easy to don't like him, as I stated in my original point. I want comment here more probably, it's not fair to the guy, he doesn't deserve to be criticized right now

5398~~~
Only just noticed the guy in the crowd (bottom right) giving Fellaini an small applause for that elbow. Good challenge.

5399~~~
As you said - this season he has been using his physicality in a legal way. He has bullied opposition midfielders and defenders plenty of times, just look at his highlight reel against arsenal, for example.

5400~~~
He's quite good with his left foot isn't he? Something that doesn't get mentioned much.

5401~~~
I will be furious if we sell him. For now, he should be a starter. If he continues like this, give him a starting place next season. 
What a great aand useful player he turns out to be.

5402~~~
Definitely. It's one of his many positive traits that were forgetten in the midst of last season's calamity. It was evident at Everton and remains so now at United.

Another one of his best - and woefully understated - strengths is passing the ball, often very simply, behind opposition lines and into attacking space. He might not be be able to ping balls out wide like a Carrick or Scholes, but his passing is very, very consistent and almost always played at the correct weight and speed.

Anybody surprised by what we're seeing right now just didn't follow him closely enough at Everton. His box to box strengths were always clear to see.

5403~~~
Which is why I hated him for a dozen of minutes against Arsenal.

5404~~~
Fellaini had some good games last season, suggesting otherwise is grossly unfair. His lumbering performances in bigger games were used as a microcosm of the perennial averageness we succumbed to under Moyes. Fellaini, unsurprisingly, bore the brunt of the frustration. He was Moyes' man and somewhat representative of our woeful record in the transfer market.

Our entire midfield was terrible last season, and Fellaini wasn't much worse than Carrick, if worse at all. They were left out to dry by Moyes' tactics. A defence that defends on the 18 yard box and two strikers holding hands at the other end of the field leaves a static midfield two up shit creek, irrespective of who plays there.

5405~~~
Fellaini proving he was a good signing after all. Don't see the need for Strootman personally, don't think he's that much better to be quite honest. Strootman is the better passer but Fellaini is more of a threat up front. If we were to invest in midfield once again, I would say go all out for Pogba.

5406~~~
Scored a couple of good goals tonight, Belgium were flying.

5407~~~
Continuing his good form I see. Keep proving those critics wrong, Marouane.

5408~~~
He's a top class midfielder when on form. Who would have known?

5409~~~
Me, and a lot of other people who were backing him last year.

5410~~~
Pleased that his form has continued. Is really starting to change some opinions which is just brilliant.

5411~~~
I was backing him too, my comment was more sarcasm than anything else.

5412~~~
I guess the multiple posters who just referred to him as "sack of shit" won't be changing anytime soon though.

5413~~~
Having taken a fair bit of stick earlier this season (and even at points last season) for defending Fellaini, I do feel a bit vindicated now when every day this thread sees another half a dozen "Made me eat my words" style posts.

5414~~~
I love him.

For all of the 'what a bloody awesome guy' comments inexplicably aimed at Falcao, I actually find Fellaini's character somewhat inspirational in how he's turned this around at United.

He's come back so strong, and with so much determination. It's really impressed me.

5415~~~
Oh, my bad.

5416~~~
I feel the need to say something, though. Fellaini has been good lately, but he hasn't been great and he hasn't been consistent during the course of 90mn. So while I think that we should appreciate his contribution, we shouldn't go over the top and pretend that he is a confirmed top player, for a top team, and that we can make plan with him as a starter next season, without thinking twice.

The same thing applies to Young, Valencia and a little bit for Rojo and Jones.

5417~~~
Our lanky poodle Messi....

5419~~~
Ye, you were definitely one of the posters I was thinking about when I wrote that.

5420~~~
I will happily give Fellaini credit for his performances this season. But he was really bad last year, which is why people gave him stick. He was a parody of himself last season - he elbowed people randomly (3-4 times at least), could barely win a header (got beaten by fecking Lahm and others), against Bayern he had that forest gump run 60 yards where he ended up slide tackling himself, gave the ball away every time and didn't track Schweingster for his goal. If you'll remember he had a massive tendency to switch off and not track runners - which again people gave him deserved stick for. You should revisit his thread from last year to remember some of this stuff. He was comfortably worse than Carrick last year too. Carrick wasn't a liability like Fellaini was. His "good" games were literally him just actually being competent like keeping passes simple and making some tackles, it's not like he put in performances like Carrick and Herrera have in recent games.

In light of that, I have to give him credit for turning it around. I would say it's probably 50% him playing further away from our goal. Playing deep he couldn't use his biggest strength (i.e. back to goal), couldn't cause havoc in the box and sort of exposed his lack of turning ability when people ran at him, and his passing isn't his best part of his game. In the games where he played deeper (i.e. Liverpool @ home, Southampton & arsenal away) it's no coincidence IMO that we were overrun in midfield. He gave away a goal vs Soton and within the first few minutes at Liverpool almost did the same and had scythed down one of their players 30 minutes late, to get a yellow. In contrast, his best performance prior to these recent games was vs Chelsea, where he was playing further forward pushed up on Fabregas. So I think his current role is what is bringing out the best of him, and I can see why the Belgium manager said something to that effect. The rest is confidence, fitness and I think he's improved too. He's playing much more intelligently too in the positions he taking up - last season and at the World Cup he just sort of lingered in the box statically but now he's dropping off his man at the far post, moving on to the full back and the centre back and midfielders and is causing a lot of problems.

Fair play to the lad.

5421~~~
Moyes must be feeling so smug right now.

5422~~~
He shouldn't though, he completely fecked him over with how he played him last season but not having the bollocks to use him as a direct focal point.

5423~~~
I'd say he's feeling anything but smug.

5424~~~
He used him very well at everton. The whole team sucked last season. Fellaini didnt have a pre season and then got injured for a good few weeks very soon. People had started turning on him and Moyes by the time he was fit and available again and we were playing some really shit football.

5425~~~
Last season he wasn't that bad at all. He was injured for half of it, played through injury for a bit and sometimes played nice football. People were posting a gif against Bayern and pissing themselves but anyone can have a nightmare moment. He's great at the moment.

5426~~~
Fellaini's won me over this season, but he was that bad last season.

5427~~~
This is also true.

I've already argued this season that some of Fellaini's form has been inflated in part due to the silly exaggeration of his poor performances last season. I always maintained that he had good games last season, and his performances in the big games, games we lost convincingly, were seen to serve as a reminder to how Moyes and his own guy Fellaini had seemingly sabotaged the club.

Even <a class="username" data-user="43344, @Eugenius" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/43344/">@Eugenius</a> kind of confirms this in his good post above, with his reference to the Bayern Munich match, a game that people used to encapsulate Fellaini's entire season, even though he was never quite so awful elsewhere.

Fellaini has been good this season, but not brilliant, and if the club aspire to win league titles and get back to the summit of European football then he isn't going to be good enough to hold down a regular role in the side. Neither is Valencia, neither is Young, and the jury still hasn't settled on Smalling and Jones. He is, however, certainly worthy of a place in any top Premier League squad, which was always the case from his time at Everton. He's been one of the <i>better </i>- not best - midfielders in the league for a good while now.

5428~~~
We are playing him as a footballer not as a battering ram and it is paying off.

He can be an important squad player for us in the future and can be used to hold the ball up (like what he did vs Olympiacos last year)

5429~~~
He should be 'first name on the sheet' this season. But of course he can be upgraded next season. It will be tough to find a ready made one that is better than what he can offer though.

5430~~~
We will have to see who is available, but there's a very good chance he could end up playing WITH this new signing the way he's been this season. If he kicks on that is. Have to admit I thought he was rubbish, and that he was not United quality, but he's been proving me wrong. I do not think he will stay with us long but he is playing very well.

5431~~~
I'm happy he's doing well and has found his uses but it's relative to where we are at the moment. If we're to progress, then we need to strengthen and purchase genuine quality to compete rather than playing someone purely on their effectiveness due to the circumstance. He's made himself into a useful option though which is fantastic for him and fantastic to us and long may it continue.

5432~~~
It annoys me that the most memorable moment which has stuck in my mind was that famous dribble vs Bayern. I'm fickle

5433~~~
It was shocking and was the proof that something was wrong with him, because Fellaini has weaknesses but controlling the ball isn't one of them, his lack of positional awareness, agility, his defensive naivety and sometimes slow decision making are his weaknesses, but he is a good technician.

5434~~~
Yup. I think last season he was clearly suffering from the pressure. Moyes wasn't doing well, and everyone was looking at Fellaini being one of "Moyes' mistakes". So many of our players last season were awful, but he was the scapegoat among fans unfortunately. We usually gave new signings time to settle, but because we were doing awful in the league, that patience wasn't given by the majority of the fans.

Van Gaal seems to have given him the confidence and license to roam he's needed.

5435~~~
That was definitely part of it I think - he was associated with Moyes (and still is).
Other factors last season are;

*He played the first half of the season with a wrist injury.
*He didnt have a pre-season with us at all (I remember when we signed Berbatov and everyone used this as a big reason for his slow start and were prepared to write off his first few months at the club)
*The entire team was playing shite.
*He was played in a position that we can now see is clearly not his best.
*He was our only midfield signing when there should have been at least one more - we wanted and needed a proper CM like Herrera/Kroos/Fabgregas/Thiago etc (this is less a reason for his underperformance but rather another reason why the fans hated him).

Basically quite a few things that contributed to him performing poorly and to the fans getting on his back from the word go.

5436~~~
that is all true and even then Fellaini was actually nowhere near as bad last season as many made out - obviously he had some poor performances but still he also played well on several occasions and that was why I always wanted him to stay and be given a chance this season. 
There were many who never wanted him in the first place so jumped on every negative and ignored any good performance as he became scapegoat no1 - it is great to see that he is making them eat their words this season, it takes a lot of strength of character to come back from that.

5437~~~
I don't think many disliked him last season mostly because he was Moyes'. It's more into he's one of our big signing, our season was shit, and he was unbelievably shit also. 

Just look at his underwhelming WC, and tell me if it's because he was signed by Moyes. That triple tackle on Messi right on the edge of penalty box, was one of the dumbest thing I've seen in that WC.

5438~~~
Lots of excuses are made for him for last season but the truth is the biggest problem was moyes played him out of position, he isn't a holding midfield player, he isn't even a real box to box midfielder and he can't play in a two man midfield. He is ordinary in anything other than an attacking role because he doesn't have the skills required but get him playing further forward and the right service and he can bully teams.

Long term I don't see him playing week in week out because I think someone else will be brought in to play behind the striker but he will be an important squad player, credit to LVG for having the balls to use him in that role though this season.

5439~~~
I still remember when he played vs Olympicaos.

That was probably the most comedic yet what was needed performance.

5440~~~
This is actually what he currently is and doing it very well. He is physically strong, runs a lot and intercepts and breaks up play. He's everwhere on the pitch and runs around 12km a game. Going forward, he also proved that he is a valuable asset - so for me, typical box to box

5441~~~
Ok I like the guy now, he's transformed his career around. He's turned into a valuable player for us. 

Let's hope di Maria can too have a better second season.

5442~~~
Personally i blame Fellainis plite last season solely on Moyes. At Everton Moyes would use him further up the pitch to offer something up front, but at United he realised with the forwards we had at his disposal he couldn't play him in a similar manner. This brought around him thinking to play him as a holding midfielder (Fellaini mentioning how that was his prefered position probably didnt help matters!). 

Regardless it was one of the biggest mismanagements of the Moyes era, where he would opt to have Fellaini (or Cleverley) as the deepest lying midfielder where he would often push Carrick further forward. This unbalanced the team but was the only way Moyes thought he could use Fellaini without looking like a long ball team, something our current manager will do if he needs to. 

I know people still want to use the "he only looks good when we pump long balls to him" but i think they arent appreciating how well hes been doing on the ball in the games hes played this season. I was his biggest critic last season but credit to the guy hes answered his critics and will only improve in this team.

5443~~~
It's less that we're no longer playing him as a battering ram and more that he's really stepped up his overall game recently.

5444~~~
I wasnt saying that he was a sack of ... BUT I certainly did not approve of him.
I felt that he wasnt good enough to be in our team, however, as we are seeing now, he has cemented a role in the first team. 
After De Gea, Rooney, Carrick and Blind, he is probably our most important player. He gives us an aerial outlet (plan B). Without him, I dont think we have a plan B, which is why he is a guaranteed starter.

And one thing I have noticed him doing extremely well, is the basics. Notice next time he plays, this is what he does: ball gets passed on the ground or in the air to him. He receives the ball. Brings it to ground (if necessary). Controls it. Then immediately passes it to a team-mate and runs forward. There is no delay in decision making. The pass to a team-mate is performed within 1 second. I saw this happen time and time again, against Liverpool and Tottenham. And he is able to do this very well. I rarely saw him make a mistake when he was doing this. Our opponents just dont know how to handle him.

Its interesting that some people want us to sell Fellaini. I wouldnt sell him for less than £50M. Reason: if we replaced him with another player, who has EPL experience, I believe that new player will cost £50M to do the same job that Fellaini is doing.

In summary, I've completely changed my mind about Fellaini. And I'm sure his work ethic will continue to win over Man Utd fans.

5445~~~
I remember the City game where we got hammered at the Etihad. After we went four down, Moyes changed it up, moved Rooney up front with Fellaini in behind him, and we looked a much better side.

5446~~~
Don't agree if he can consistently find his A game he is more than capable of being one of the first names on the team sheet in Europe or in the PL. I would say he is as unplayable as anyone outside the top few players in Europe at his best and I don't think we have seen his best yet either.

5447~~~
He did have some strong matches the second half of last year, but they were dismissed as only being due to poor opposition because it wasn't fashionable to give him any credit at the time.

5448~~~
Yep - in fact many were still rolling that out earlier this season after West Brom etc but now he has proven he can do it in the big games as well

5449~~~
Imagine his good form has transformed into something permanent. If he raises his game a level he will be unstoppable, although even in this form he's beast. He may be still quite young one never knows when a certain player reaches his potential. Yaya Toure started to be world beater around this age. I hope Van Gaal make him even better player in the years coming because it will be joy to watch such special and extraordinary tactics with Fellaini in the team which no one can use simply because Fellaini is one of a kind..

Always thought he's the best as10, Van Gaal deserves credit after all because he had balls to play him there ahead of Mata, Rooney or anyone, well it took him time and we got lucky with RVP's injury but still good job manager..

5450~~~
First name on the team sheet for who? He's doing well and his strengths are clear but he's a level below some of the midfielder's already at the club, never mind the best ones in Europe.

Fellaini wouldn't play in front of Modric, Kroos or Isco at Madrid, or Rakitic or Iniesta at Barcelona. He doesn't displace Vidal and Pogba at Juventus, nor does he displace Matuidi and Verratti at PSG. You get my point.

That's the standard the club clearly aspire to reach and Fellaini, as unplayable and awkward as he can be to play against, just isn't up to the mark against the very best players in the long run, and I think he'll be reduced to more of a squad man as a result of that in the coming months.

That doesn't mean to say that I don't rate him, or that football manager's do not either, but I think they'll all wanted something more, a little more nuanced, if possible, if they aim to be the best.

5451~~~
I think it's fairly obvious that Fellaini isn't among the very top class of midfielders.I think it's also fair to say though that there arn't many in that top class of midfielders and they are all very difficult to sign.

If we are able to sign someone like Pogba or Modric then fantastic,great improvment to the team.Otherwise I'm happy for Fellaini to continue as a starter.Either way Fellaini has proved his doubters wrong this season and has shown that he can be a great asset to the squad at the very least.

5452~~~
I think what he means is that when Fellaini is having a great game there's not a lot you can really do to stop him. It's a bit like when Valencia was at his best a few years ago. Everyone and their dog knew what he was going to do and what was going to happen you just couldn't stop him because he was that good at doing it.

5453~~~
Whilst I agree with the general notion of your post, I disagree with your opinion of him not being a real box-to-box midfielder. Not all box-to-box midfielders are 100% defensively reliable. See Pogba, Modric, box-to-box Rakitic, Nainggolan, Witsel, etc. He may be easy to get past at times, and he may not be good at reading the game and positioning himself, but his aggression, anticipation, and ball-winning abilities still make him useful at our end. His stamina is also very useful in tracking back and adding numbers to the midfield, which he has done in the past couple of matches for us.

Yes, he's definitely not as defensively reliable as, say, Strootman, Matic, or Vidal, but he's still useful in winning the ball and recovering possession as demonstrated countless times in his career.

This is something that I've noticed with Fellaini. With his set of skills and qualities, when he's performing well, he's difficult to contain and suppress. Even during his first season at Everton, he was causing problems for many defences, including ours. For this reason, I find him to be a very valuable player for the first team. He may not be a regular starter, but he can be like Park and O'Shea were for us if he doesn't drop his performance levels.

5454~~~
In his current position using this system none of them would replace him more to the point. He's playing behind a striker in a dual role like a Number 10/CM hybrid  and doing it as well as they ever could. If a man is unplayable, it really doesnt matter if its finesse or a hammer blow thats achieving it.

5455~~~
I've been a big defender of the big man. I was disgusted by the abuse he was getting on here. But strangely I wouldn't even be that upset if we decided to sell him. If LVG wants to go for some new players, and thinks Fellaini does not quite fit with his vision, then fair enough. 
Because Fellaini has proven himself a very good player, and stuck it to the pricks who abused him. He could leave here with his head held high, and plenty of teams would love to have him.

5456~~~
I think it would be a mistake to sell him. I am a big fan and want him to stay obviously but he has such unique qualities that would, at the very least, be useful as an option off the bench.

5457~~~
Definitely. He will always be useful in certain types of games and he'd be a very good squad player. Park Ji Sung wasn't the most talented player we had but he was a great squad player and contributed so much.

5458~~~
I can't believe what I am about to say given how I felt 18 months ago, 12 months ago and even 8 months ago.

It would be a mistake to sell Fellaini. Hats off to the lad in a big way. I can imagine most wanting to run and hide given the stick he took in both the stands and the media. I'd have understood if he wanted to get the hell out as soon as he could. It's a real show of the mans balls that he still here, and more so than that performing.

He is vital to our side right now...it's as simple as that. I'll maintain one thing from the moment we bought him. He is no centre mid, and he is no holding mid. I'm sorry, there isn't alot to convince me otherwise even if he does play there for Belgium etc. I think he has been poor there for us in all honesty.

What he is however is an absolute pest in the final 3rd. Defenders hate him and you can see it. He is incredibly difficult to deal with in and around the box. He is a totally different type of threat to others around him and, to me at least, is just a different weapon in the armoury. I like the fella. I never wanted him to be bought...but after a very rocky start he is showing his worth.

He's never going to be the prettiest, or most technically gifted...and it might be that as our style of play develops and LVG brings other players in..he will see less first team football. I don't know. For now he is a goal threat, he brings others into play well and is a target for balls into the box, especially if the tippy tappy stuff is failing.

It's interesting. Teams love to drop deep against us and defend especially at Old Trafford. Someone like Fellaini is the perfect answer to that if plan A isn't getting the desired effect. He is more than just an aeial threat though...as shown against West Brom and Spurs for example...add QPR to that. 3 really really good goals.

5459~~~
Quite right

5460~~~
Louis van Gaal likes this.

5461~~~
Another convert has seen the light - welcome to the Church of Afro <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

But as far as I can see he is now playing for us in the exact same midfield position he plays for Belgium? Box to box as part of a 3 man midfield where he contributes both to attack and defence. He is often more advanced than Herrera when we attack but in fact if you look at the average position charts they are virtually in line.

5462~~~
As good as he has been, I think he'l move back to the bench once Van Gaal gets the kind of midfielder he wants. Herrera or Mata would be our long term No 10.

5463~~~
Looked very much like one against Spurs and Liverpool.

Agree he's not great when he's the deepest midfielder. A bit too reckless for the role and needs to have the freedom to get up and down the pitch.

5464~~~
I understand that and partially agree, but I think Van Gaal, and most other top teams, will alter tactics to accommodate a midfielder less limited. So while Fellaini is very good for now, I think the role he's playing right now will change when more players are brought to the club and Van Gaal fully sets the team up the way he wants it.

The big man has been good, sometimes very good, but he hasn't been unplayable either. Difficult to deal with, at times, certainly, but this isn't as good as it gets. We can do better, and that isn't intended as a slight on Fellaini.

But then I could be wrong. Perhaps Van Gaal rates him more highly than this. We'll have to wait and see.

5465~~~
We're bringing in a box-to-box CM who's good defensively, van Gaal confirmed this. Since he always plays with 2 defensive minded midfielders, Carrick/Blind + Fellaini, we lack backup for the big man. If he gets injured we have to shove Rooney there or play both Carrick and Blind in midfield which isn't ideal.

Fellaini will get his games and be a perfect plan B, although he'll probably be backup in the long run to the new CM.

5466~~~
A defensive-minded, box to box midfielder is exactly what we need so if that is truly the case then I'll be pleased.

5467~~~
He's said we're bringing in a midfielder to bring balance. If you know that he always plays with 4 defensive minded players (2CB+DM+BTB) that's the only missing piece of the puzzle. He wants an all rounder who does his job in defending, a Strootman type.

So you'll be pleased <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5468~~~
He's just scored again for Belgium against Israel away.

5469~~~
Afro-Man strikes again

5470~~~
There's no stopping this man.Confidence must be so high right now.Great for him and us.

It's a joy to check livescore and see that he's scored for them again, fantastic.

5473~~~
Oh good. Glad to see he's continuing his best player in the world form.

5474~~~
If can do that in the club we won't have to think about signing new striker.

5475~~~

Wait, did it just hit his without him knowing? Shades of Ronaldo right there.

5482~~~
Villa apparenlty missing a few defenders this weekend, the afro man will score.

5483~~~
Need a picture.

5484~~~
easily goal of the season.

5485~~~
hehe gotta love that goal! one for the career reel when he hangs up his boots

5486~~~
He can do better too, there is further improvement to be realised by the big man.

5487~~~
Should we sell him when the right offers comes along?

5488~~~
Players like Welbeck don't have the killer instinct that Fellaini has when getting into space. Top 3 players of our season so far for me.

5489~~~
No way, contrary to popular belief, he will required for certain games next season and so on. As he's shown over the last 6 months, he got a set of skills which makes him unplayable, at times, which can irritate opposing teams. He's the kind of player, when starting, will have opposition teams setting up plans to stop him from playing.

5490~~~
I think there is every chance that he will continue in this role next season, and go from strength to strength. If he was a new player this year and we weren't biased by last season's shit show with Moyes, we wouldn't be contemplating moving forward without him. He has beaten out Mata, Di Maria and Rooney for a spot as a forward thinking midfielder, he's scoring goals at club and international level, and I see no reason why he won't continue in the role. Like it or not, he is a very good player.

5491~~~
I love how he makes those back post runs when we have possession in midfield, isolates the full back and when the ball is drifted in to him it causes huge problems, its good to see we don't have to play long ball football to accommodate him.

5492~~~
Not a chance. Should we have sold Park, Ole and O Shea in their prime just because a right offer came in? Fellaini is an invaluable player to possess rather he starts every game or not.

5493~~~
Depends on who would come to replace him and if Van gaal are serious about the club/system/philosophy thing.

He is a good player so <i>a priori</i> there is no need to sell him.

5494~~~
I have no idea why discussions about selling Fellaini are even coming up - he's been one of our best players this season (arguably the best outfield player, definitely top3), he's going nowhere.

5495~~~
GO FRO GO

5496~~~
Interesting point regarding how he might have been perceived if we signed him this year. I think as far as redcafe goes his reputation damages him - if it was some player signed from a foreign club who was putting in the performances that afro has, nobody would be talking about selling him. but 'because it is Fellaini' he simply "can't" be a first team starter for us.... Just, because.

5497~~~
It's not just because, one of Mata, Herrera or Fellaini will lose his place for a Box-to-box, and I think that it will be Fellaini, I'm maybe wrong though.
And from there you have to think of the fact that Fellaini isn't the direct replacement for the defensive box-to-box who will probably come, so Fellaini could be the victim here.

But it could be Mata or Herrera.

5498~~~
When given parameters to work in, he can be unplayable. His form is such right now that other teams have to gameplan for him, which is extremely valuable.

5499~~~
If we achieve Top 4 then I think it will be less of an issue as we'll have more games, they can't all play every game. If we don't mess up the league cup so early as well then I can't forsee any issues in giving them all plenty of game time

5500~~~
It will be an issue, if we want to sign two b2b, and give Pereira and Pearson an opportunity.

5501~~~
I guess we could benefit from having extra games finishing fourth and playing qualification rounds. More players involved, I hope the two have a good preseason if the former stays.

5502~~~
This.

5503~~~
Given that he is now a regular first team starter and one of our most important players, I would say that he is integral to our Plan A. 
Obviously if we have to switch to long ball (Plan B), then he becomes the focal point.
For those wanting to sell him - why would you sell someone who is playing well in our team, just to replace him with an identical player, such that we dont know if the identical player will be able to play as well as Fellaini. It makes no logical sense.

Fellaini is arguably one of our most important players, behind De Gea, Rooney, Carrick and Blind.

5504~~~
Why does anyone have to lose their place? The point being made is that if Fellaini had come to the club this season - from some exotic far away league where nobody had heard of him - and was performing as he has done this season, there would be no talk about being him being sold, upgraded or replaced.
Yes, van Gaal made a comment about bringing in another midifelder, but that was a while ago and since then we have started playing some very good football. This notion that we need to go out and sign another 5 CMs this summer and Fellaini should be first out the door, seems not only ludicrous but a bit spoilt.

The midfield of Carrick, Herrera and Fellaini has a great balance to it as is. The only one who may need replacing soon is Carrick, and that is due to age (although the way Carrick plays, I can see him playing another couple of years at least without declining too much). After most of us have spent the last 5-6 seasons bemoaning how crap our midfield is, it baffles me that we finally have a good one, and everyone is desperate to change it.

5505~~~
Fellaini will get competition. One of the reasons van Gaal didn't play 433 before (not the only reason!) is that he lacked his 4th defensive player. The BTB midfielder always is his 4th defensive player and he's tried Herrera, Rooney and Fellaini there.

A combination of Herrera and Fellaini works fine (although it's a bit weird), but we're still buying that CM. If Fellaini doesn't play van Gaal would stick Blind next to Carrick to still have that 4th defensive player, this isn't ideal. Fellaini will duke it out with the new signing and always be a plan B/great alternative. He'll get his fair share of games still.

As it currently stands:
6: Carrick, Blind
8: Fellaini
10: Herrera, Mata, Rooney

So we're just going to add depth, in current form Fellaini isn't going to get dropped though.

5506~~~
The thing is, I don't agree with you, I appreciated in his performances for 30mn but he hasn't done anything special after that in our current setup.
Against Arsenal he was as good as he was against Tottenham or Liverpool, but after 30mn he dropped and we all struggled in midfield, for me in a sense that shows how good he is when at 100% and how short he is when he isn't. We need someone who doesn't have a gulf between his best level and his average level, we need a better standard.
The same thing applies to Young and Di Maria, we can't afford that, if we want to be the best, keeping Fellaini is in my opinion a good thing because of his attitude, because of the tools he can bring but I also see his limitations. But that doesn't mean that he is a starter and if he isn't a definite starter then like everyone else, he isn't intransferable.

5507~~~
He's really turned into a beast. A unique weapon whose size and height adds a unique dimension to both our attacks and defensive setups.

5508~~~
If we buy a top class CM and Fellaini keeps him out, then we have a top class CM in Fellaini playing. If the top class CM pushes Fellaini out, we have a top class CM playing. Win win.

5509~~~
I think some people are getting ahead of themselves here. Fellaini's been good, but he's been playing as a number 10. He was pretty poor when played deeper. He's making a real difference to our play mainly because he can actually hold the ball up and allow us to get up the pitch (RvP doesn't have the athleticism anymore, and Falcao's touch is dog). But he's not that player that LvG was looking for when he was shoving Rooney into midfield i.e. a powerful player who can play a disciplined role and pass the ball. When it comes to doing the actual centre midfield nuts and bolts like defending, passing, controlling the game it's Carrick, Blind and Herrera who are much more important and Fellaini can't do what they do.

5510~~~
well I don't believe that there are many people on caf who think Fellaini will succeed as midfielder. I can speak for myself but I think he's a really unorthodox number ten we are excited about. He's too slow to be a box to box and too clumsy and not enough on the ball to play deep as midfielder either..
ie Yaya is also better in the advanced role but Fellaini is different to anyone..

5511~~~
His playing style is such that 10 minutes into the game yesterday can basically tell what kind of day he will have. If I see a ref who isn't biased about him and allows him to be a bit physical without fouling then I kind of know that he will do well but as soon as I see a ref who gives free kicks against him just coz its Fellaini he completely falls apart

5512~~~
As it currently stands, I don't think Van Gaal sees Fellaini as an 8, otherwise he wouldn't be playing him so high up. This could all change next season, and I like Fellaini as an 8, but at the moment, it looks like Van Gaal prefers Fellaini as a number 10, where he can use his aerial presence, great hold up play and goals.

5513~~~
That's why I said it's a bit of a weird one. Normally his 4th defensive player would be the 8, Fellaini is unique though. In a midfield 3 with the point backwards he is the most forward (10), with Herrera a little closer to Carrick. It works though, and ticks van Gaals' defensive boxes.

The new man would be a real 8 and Herrera would become the number 10. If Fellaini plays they'd switch around.

5514~~~
Ahh right. I see what you mean. It is definitely a weird one. Van Gaal's currently using Fellaini like Blanc uses Matuidi for PSG, in my opinion, in the way he's always the most advanced midfielder, does all the running in behind, but also gets through a lot of defensive work.

5515~~~
Just looking at some of the posts about Fellaini at the start of this season....



^<b>this one is particularly apt</b>

5516~~~
I lot of these I told you so posts are getting silly now. He's played well for most of the season and in particular our last 2 games. 
It still doesn't come close to justifying the fee we paid for him and he still isn't good enough to play for us long term.

5517~~~
Playing well for most of the season as a key player in a top four side does not justify £27.5m????

5518~~~
why have you quoted my post here?! 

If you want to name and shame then take a look at last seasons Fellaini thread - the abuse he was getting then and over the summer from certain posters was ridiculous

5519~~~
I know, they would be much worse but I just wanted to look at the start of this season. To be fair there was also a fair amount of optimism with LVG coming in and how he might help him. I wasn't looking to name and shame, it was just interesting. I am amazed as anyone how well he has done this season.

5520~~~
In terms of your particular post it just goes to show, if you play well, the fans will come round and give credit where it's due - same for Young.

5521~~~
Outside of last season, he's shown he is good enough to play for us long term. As far as his fee, last season has taught us that it's hard to say a player's fee wasn't worth it after one season. Whether his fee will be justified or not will be have to be revisited in a few years.

5522~~~
Its not just van Gaals defensive boxes that it ticks. I love the balance that having Fellaini in the false-10 role (yes, I made up another role).

For me, Herrera is not a #10, he is a box to box midfielder but with more creativity and flair than most players of that type. He is combative, high energy, good technique etc. The problem with Herrera however is that he isnt disciplined enough to play as a holding midfielder, which limits how you can use him in a number of formations (a classic 4-2-3-1 requires two fairly disciplined holding CMs, for example, as do most variants of 4-4-2). We have all been frustrated when Herrera has struggled for gametime this season, but I dont think LVG has ever felt comfortable playing him as a CM with the likes of Mata or Rooney in front of him at #10, because the lineup then lacks a bit of balance.

Yes I am aware that this is not the Herrera thread - the reason I say all that is that it takes us back to the point <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> made - Fellaini is rather unique. He can play that attacking role, contribute goals, assists, holds the ball up well etc etc, but he still contributes a lot more defensively than most #10s. This extra defensiveness gives LVG the freedom to play Herrera in the [slightly] deeper CM role. Hence the Carrick/Herrera/Fellaini system which I love.

Basically, if we bought a box to box midfielder in the summer, we would be looking at Carrick/New signing, with Herrera as a #10. Personally, I think Herrera is wasted as a #10 and if I am being honest I actualy think Fellaini is more effective in that role and brings more to the team. So basically I dont think we gain anything from that change, as the new signing is unlikely to be lightyears better than Herrera in the #8 role. The only player I can really think of that offers a definitive upgrade on what we have now, is Pogba replacing Fellaini as the most advanced of the three midfielders.

<a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> you have stated that you think we will buy an 'upgrade' to Fellaini in the summer (or at the very least some stiff competition for him) - my question is how would you see our midfield three lining up next season then? What sort of player would we buy and what would our first choice midfield trio then be?

5523~~~
What you described about Fellaini is right. He offers defensive balance from 10 since he's no good further back, to a normally too adventurous 8 for van Gaal. It's a little different but it works. But if Fellaini gets injured/needs a rest, we're screwed.

This means van Gaal has nobody to partner Blind/Carrick-Herrera/Mata in midfield. Following his own rules he'd field Blind-Carrick-Herrera if that happens. So we're buying a defensively good box-to-box player who will compete with Fellaini. This does mean Herrera will play as a 10, but he'll be partnered by the new midfielder who can also contribute in attack. I'm pretty sure this is what van Gaal wants to do next season.

5524~~~
<a class="username" data-user="79008, @Sparky Rhiwabon" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79008/">@Sparky Rhiwabon</a> To be fair, I still don't think he has the passing range of Clev or Fletch, but he did well to displace them.

5525~~~
Ha ha, maybe, but are you suitably surprised?

5526~~~
He's a key player now? He's only started 12 games for this season also factor in that we have been playing dreadful football for most of the season. Hardly anything to shout about. 

He has done well but he still has clear limitations. He's also is constantly fouling and looks like he could get sent of any second. He can't be starting for us if we truly aspire to be champions again.

5527~~~
Not in the slightest haha, but I have a ridiculous infatuation with old Clev <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> 

I think that in Van gaal mind the perfect midfield is a midfield with two hybrids #6/#8 and a a #10

So next season we will ideally play like that

<span style="color: #ffffff">----------</span>Rooney<span style="color: #ffffff">-----</span>
Di Maria<span style="color: #ffffff">------------</span>Mata
<span style="color: #ffffff">---</span>the new 8/6<span style="color: #ffffff">--</span>Herrera
<span style="color: #ffffff">--------</span>Carrick<span style="color: #ffffff">--------
</span>
The new signing should have been Strootman but with his injury I doubt that it will be him, Nainggolan who replaced Strootman seamlessly could be our man. Now like I said for all I know Herrera could lose his place and Fellaini stay in the first 11, but I doubt about it because Herrera don't really drop during the game and he is better in almost everything. Fellaini and Herrera will fight for the same position.
The prototypes are Strootman, Xavi, Vidal or Klaassen against Spain. A box to box who controls the pressing of the team and orient the game with the deep lying playmaker.
There is also an outsider, De Jong that Van gaal described as his "pressing general".

5529~~~
Many will but there is always some who refuse to change their opinion, which was the point in my post!


why not? there is nothing better than bumping old post to show people how wrong they were <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

I'm not that amazed, he was a player I always wanted and rated - even last season I spent a lot of time saying he should be given a proper chance to show what he can do. Feel free to dig up my old posts!

5530~~~
Maybe its just me but I vastly prefer to see Herrera playing as a true #8. Im not a huge fan of him as a #10, and I think that midfield that both of you have proposed, of basically Carrick, a defensive #8, and Herrera - is too defensive and does not offer enough in attack.

Say we had a Strootman or Vidal, lining up as Carrick/Strootman/Herrera to me is a very defensive shape. We have seen in the past how we have struggled to break down teams that simply defend deep and put 10 men behind the ball.

5531~~~
With this midfield Mata and Di Maria doesn't have to defend that change a lot of things, and the fullbacks will be able to bump forward with more freedom, that's also a midfield who won't lose the ball much .

That's basically the same balance than Rakitic-Iniesta-Mascherano.

5532~~~
Indeed, Mata and Di Maria don't contribute much defensively and can focus on their strong points this way. 

Also it's not MY way of playing football, but van Gaal's. Why did you think we avoided 433 for so long? He didn't have a defensive BTB player for that 4th defensive player.

352 he had 3CB+1DM, which is enough for him. With the diamond we always saw Rooney/Fellaini in midfield, because they offer defensive workrate, 2CB+1DM+Rooney/Fellaini. It's about having 4 defensive minded players and Herrera obviously isn't seen as one. When Blind and Carrick were both injured, Rooney played CDM and not Herrera.

Since he's so adamant about this he's bringing in a new 8. You might do it differently, but van Gaal won't. If Fellaini doesn't play he'd have to revert back to Rooney in midfield or a 352 again.

5533~~~
If Mata and Di Maria arent defending <i>and</i> the fullbacks are constantly bombing forward then we are just left exposed on the flanks in my opinion.
Not that they need to do much defending in the current system anyway.

You seem very adamant and confident that you know <i>exactly</i> what LVG plans to do. Have you got the lottery numbers for the weekend as well?

Seriously though, I think you are overstating the whole "we <b>must</b> have 4 defensive minded players and no other system will do". With the current system we have 2 CBs, a holding midfielder and then both of Herrera/Fellaini who contribute in attack and defence, and thus far it has worked pretty well. I am a believer of the "if it aint broke dont fix it" school of thought in this scenario. The current system is working and working very well - I am not convinced that pushing Herrera up to #10 and bringing in a Strootman will actually offer an improvement in our overall effectiveness as a team.

Part of the threat that Fellaini offers which hasnt been mentioned in this particular discussion so far, is the height factor, which changes the way teams have to defend against us. For years we struggled against teams who simply set up to contain us - it didnt matter if we had Kagawa, Mata, Rooney et al, they just packed the central areas, forced us to play it wide and cross the ball, and headed it away comfortably. Having an aerial threat for me is important in our attack because it prevents the opponent from doing this - if they simply allow us to swing in cross after cross, Fellaini is likely to head one into the back of the net eventually. If you take that element out of the side and dont replace it with a strong aerial presence (which we wont be, if Herrera is playing as #10) then what is to stop teams from just doing the same again? Show our wingers outside, let the fullbacks have it, let us cross the ball for 90 minutes and happily defend those crosses.

5534~~~
If a Strootman type of player comes in next season, I don't see it affecting Fellaini too much - hopefully we'll have more games to play and it will give us the luxury of being able to adapt our approach depending on the opposition.

Strootman / Herrera to domination possession.
Strootman / Fellaini for more strength.
Or Fellaini for one or the other to add height.

Either Carrick or Blind operating behind and Perriera or Januzaj as cover for Herrera gives us a decent midfield with cover.

5535~~~
That's how van Gaal works, it's general knowledge about the man. He's proven this season that, unless he had injuries, he always followed that 4 defensive players rule. It's not up for discussion with him. You can read up on how he plays the game on the internet, I'm not pulling it out my arse. I'm not trying to be a know-it-all, just trying to provide some information. I don't know what he's going to do, but I do know what he did (since I know some of his ways). You might disagree with him, like I do too with some of his decisions, but he's not going to change.

He's confirmed we're buying a CM to bring balance to the midfield. He means the defensive balance since that's the most problematic position for him, because we have no backup for Fellaini, whilst Herrera and Rooney couldn't provide what he wanted from his 8. So that wasn't exactly hard to call either. Makes sense to me that the CM will be box-to-box and good defensively (a Strootman) because that's the only thing we don't have from a typical LvG midfield. There's no way he'd bring in another #10 unless one leaves.

Normally Fellaini would be 8 and Herrera would be 10. Fellaini is unique in a way that he's better at 10, whilst still being able to provide defensive cover for Herrera who's at 8. He's switched those 2 around since Fellaini isn't good at 8, so they share some of the work.

A tall player (like Fellaini) has always been his plan B in his carreer if his team couldn't find an opening in the opponents defence with passing, to switch it up with crosses. Turns out for this season Fellaini can be plan A because he's our only defensive option in a 'weird combination' (weird for van Gaal's methods) with Herrera. That's great for Fellaini, he's saved his carreer here by doing so. He's also a safe option for a punt from de Gea/Jones, since our backline is still coming to terms with building from the back and aren't great under pressure yet.

It's a win-win solution in the end for this season, but like I said: if Fellaini were to get injured, we have <span style="text-decoration: underline">no backup</span>. He'd play either Blind and Carrick, or Rooney next to one of those. That's the reason he's been playing players out of position: for the defensive balance of the team.

How would you line up our midfield without Fellaini and no new CM?

5536~~~
Carrick (6), Blind (8) and Herrera (10)

I disagree with you that Fellaini cant play 8 - he can play that role if required. He has played well as a deeper midfielder in his Everton days as well.

I've seen you say a few times that LvG says he is going to buy a box to box midfielder - can you link those quotes?

5537~~~
If Fellaini carries on playing the way he's been doing in the last few games, I don't see why he can't start for us next season. On his day, he's absolutely unplayable, and gives us something different. 

Next season, I can imagine our midfield trio's will be something like:


I like Herrera, but I just can't see Van Gaal regularly starting him as a 10 next season. Although he's picked up a few goals this season, he's not really known for his goalscoring, and Van Gaal likes his goalscoring attacking midfielders. I could see Fellaini, on the other hand, picking up about 10-15 goals in the most advanced midfield position if played often.

5538~~~
''Asked if he is choosing to play Rooney there out of necessity, Van Gaal said: “Of course that’s the case. I’m looking for balance and I need it in midfield. The last games I played with Adnan Januzaj and Ángel Di María in the midfield positions. Then you need a certain balance for those kind of creative players. So when you have these creative players and you think that [Radamel] Falcao and [Robin] van Persie are also creative, then you have four creative players. Then you have to look for balance in your team.”

Van Gaal is clear that in the close season buying a midfielder to fill this gap is his No1 focus. “Yes, of course,” said Van Gaal, who also claimed Rooney is happy to play there.''

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/15/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-transfer-priority-creative-midfielder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...-united-transfer-priority-creative-midfielder</a>
The title is misleading, the reporter probably didn't understand him. Read the article if you like. He talks about balance (4 creative players need balance - meaning what he's always done: 4 defensive players)

The #8 is a defensive player. Rule one for these 4 players is don't lose the ball because the team isn't in the right spot to defend when they've got the ball (as per instructions from van Gaal, this is part of how he plays). Fellaini works well in a tandem with Herrera, they both do defensive work. We can't rely on Fellaini building the attack though, he's much better further up the pitch. That's why it's a weird formation, a normal van Gaal team has Fellaini at 8 and Herrera at 10. Fellaini is much better further up the pitch though and Herrera adapted well to compliment him. It's a win-win for now, but isn't a long term option (for a whole season) unless we buy a 2nd Fellaini.

I think Strootman-Carrick-Herrera is much more balanced than Blind and Carrick together, as they're both similar players. Since Carrick will be 34 and Blind is sometimes needed as LB, relying on them 2 staying fit for a whole season is too risky. Fellaini can't play every match either. It's a much safer option to bring in a new CM. Luckily van Gaal is planning to do so.

5539~~~
Fellaini has 5 goals, Herrera has 5 goals and Herrera played consistently deeper than Fellaini. What you are saying is very close from wishful thinking.
And Van gaal wants a #10 who can deliver the final balls too.

5540~~~
I'm not just basing it off one season, though. Herrera has never really been a goalscoring 10. Fellaini hasn't neither, but in 12/13, he picked up 12 goals in 36 games for Everton, and I feel with the creativity around him next season, he could go on to replicate, or even better that next season. I think he's better in front of goal than Herrera, and picks up good positions in the box. 

Herrera and Mata are known for their 'final balls' yet we hardly created anything against West Brom until Fellaini come on.

5541~~~
In those quotes I see LvG talking about balance but nothing specific about buying any type of player as you have claimed - that is just your interpretation.
Also the quotes were specifically about him being forced to play Rooney in midfield, obviously we have moved on from that now as he is not playing there so he has clearly changed his opinion on our alternate options since saying that. In the end he found the solution in Herrera after he adapted his game to fit the LvG philosophy (as you have noted yourself).

Also you say that LvG always does the same thing, but he has very clearly talked about the fact that the PL is different and requires him to adapt his own ideas. He specifically talked about the extra need for physicality for some games in England and that is exactly the reason why he favours Fellaini.
Fellaini is doing well in his role at the moment, but he has proven in the past for Everton and Belgium that he can also play 8 if needed - after all there is not a big difference between 8 and 10 in the way we have played the last few games anyway, they both have similar defensive and attacking responsibilities.

5542~~~
NLMax, it seems to me like Van Gaal's preferred lineup may be too old-fashioned and reflective of a time when money and therefore talent was less dramatically unequal, so you focused more on a balanced team and less on sheer technical quality and had bigger squads rather than leaner but incredibly talented ones.

When you look at Bayern, Barca and Real Madrid (and even Chelsea this season with Cesc so deep) it seems to me that the trend is going towards getting the best offensive talent you can playing in at least close to their best positions. That seems obvious, but what it means in the midfield is that the 2nd most defensive midfielder is often a much more attacking player. Madrid play Modric in front of Kroos there, Barca play Iniesta and Rakitic (who got the job by excelling as a 10 for Sevilla) as sort of co-number 8's in front of Busquets and Bayern have often this season (admittedly Javi Martinez has been out) picked Gotze in the closest thing they have to that role, and that's in front of an aging Xabi Alonso.

Point is, if we want to threaten 90 points every year and sweep aside CL group opponents without any fuss, I don't know if being solid is anything more than a plan B. For me that means Herrera is basically the perfect number 8 for the next few years, unless we can get Verrati, Modric or another mobile genius there. Herrera can play as a 10 or as one of 2 CM's in front of a DM in a 4-3-3, but in most games we play, we want a holder who can really pass the ball beautifully behind Herrera and then 4 attacking geniuses.

If we're really serious about getting back to a teams that competes for the CL and wins the Prem more years than not, I think we've got Rooney as our 9, Di Maria and Mata as two of the other 3 remaining players in the attacking 4 and then a massive hole at the 4th spot (and then you need depth in the form of a backup 9 - hopefully Wilson - and a versatile, productive attacker to fill in for injuries. Januzaj has the talent to be either the 4th guy or that versatile backup.)

Herrera is the 8, in front of either Blind or a new DM. Carrick is lovely but will be really showing his age soon. The best teams have Kroos, Schweinsteiger/Xabi Alonso and Busquets in that deepest role. Blind is a clever footballer, but Carrick's replacement can't be someone like Nigel De Jong. It has to be another excellent distributor, if not one of the very best in the world, as those other ones above.

The other thing you see with these teams is smaller squads and about half the cover/depth provided by top youth players eager to get into the team.

Basically, our club should think of our front 6 going forward, for me, like this:

--------Rooney---------        (Wilson)
Di Maria--Mata--SIGNING    (Januzaj, SIGNING)
-----Herrera------------        (SIGNING)
------SIGNING-----------      (Blind)

and really, if we need another 9 when Rooney is out or suspended, it may well be Januzaj up top as we try to compensate for power and other typical strikers qualities with mobility and technical play like Liverpool do with Sterling up top. 

If there's a role for Fellaini, it's only as a bench option in certain big games or off the bench.

5543~~~
Bring balance to accomodate creative players (the only plays who are allowed to take risks). Di Maria, Januzaj, Falcao and RvP - do you think he wants another number 10 to bring that side balance? No, he wants a midfielder who does alot of defensive duties. Another deep CDM wouldn't really link them well, so it's pretty obvious what he means. A jack of all trades: a Strootman.

He's changed formation but still accomodated his 4th defensive player, in a way van Gaal has never done before: with Fellaini at #10 and Herrera further back, both doing defensive work. So indeed, he adapted (in that same interview he said this he states he doesn't change everything).

All I've been trying to say is that he's going to buy a BTB midfielder who's good defensively, probably to compete with Fellaini (they could play together though). Of course that CM will also help in attack. If you won't believe me or disagree that's fine. Van Gaal has always worked like this and I'm sure he will continue to do so (as he's proven it this season - playing players out of position just for defensive balance). I'm done with this discussion for now as I can't really explain this further, I've tried to explain it as best as I could. Do what you like with this info <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

<a class="username" data-user="84160, @NoPace" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84160/">@NoPace</a>  I cannot see LvG going 4-2-3-1 and playing Mata central as well as Di Maria and another winger, it would leave us way too open. 

I have no idea if LvG plans to buy a CM to upgrade Fellaini or take Herrera's spot or simply compete with them for the two #8 spots, but regardless I think he'll buy one and we will stick with the 4-3-3.

5545~~~
I think you might be right, but long-term, my point was it's okay to be a bit open. The best teams are open, they just keep their number of conceded goals down with top defensive talent, technical ability allowing lots of possession and pinning teams back with their attacking threat. We've only scored 52 goals in 30 games so far. We're on pace for 65ish goals this year after getting 64 last year. That's not enough.

5547~~~
I personally I am with you, I grew up on a United style that was "You score 4, we'll score 5" and I'd be happy to see another #8 added that had real attacking quality to go alongside Herrera, but LvG seems to have an element of caution to him and very strict ideas that if he can he wont move away from. I think the key to more goals next season is getting two wide players either side of Rooney that are capable of double figures each.

5548~~~
United did play attacking football but we did that because we were rock solid at the back (gk-def-dm). Throughout the years we had exceptional players in those roles and whenever we lacked quality talent there we struggled (the transition period between Schmeichel-VDS, the transition period between Stam-Rio, and Keane's decline).

5549~~~
I have seen the LVG quotes and comments and yes, he has alluded to us buying a new midfielder. To go from that to the level of confidence you are displaying that we are definitely going to buy a defensive box to box midfielder, and how we are then going to line up - is a bit of a jump.

I realise that LVG favours his 4-3-3 with a forward facing triangle (ie two deeper players and one more advanced in midfield) in order to get his four defensive players - but he has also repeatedly stated that he is not stubborn with these ideas, and he is happy to change things if he feels a need/benefit in doing so.

My point is simply that these things are not so set in stone as you might have us believe.

I think Herrera is better than Fellaini as #8, and Fellaini is better than Herrera as #10. I think Herera is better at #8 than #10, and Fellaini better at #10 than #8. Therefore to me, having Fellaini as the furthest forward and Herrera deeper is an absolute no brainer, and I dont think we would benefit from playing Herrera in a more advanced role. Furthermore though, having Fellaini in the advanced role allows LVG more tactical freedom to introduce creativity and flair behind him (ie Herrera).

I dont think we will see Mata playing at #10 for the above reasons - he doesnt contribute enough defensively and therefore would unbalance our midfield somewhat. When he is out on the wing, his lack of defensive contribution is not so badly noticed, especially as in the current system, both Herrera and Fellaini have license to play a bit wider at times forming the triangles we have seen between them, the wingers and the fullbacks.

The one thing I do agree on is that we lack any suitable backup in midfield, with all of this in mind. I dont think Mata will play #10 for us anymore, I dont think LVG will want to put Rooney back into midfield. Blind can cover for Carrick happily, and I do think that Fellaini can 'do a job' at #8, in the same way I think Herrera can do a job at #10, but if one of those two are injured/suspended then there is definitely a drop in quality or balance in the side.
For that reason, I can see us bringing in a CM, but I dont think it will be one of the names mentioned. I think LVG is happy with what we have as a first choice midfield, so if we are bringing someone in, it should be either a 'too good to pass up' world class player like Pogba, or a good prospect who can potentially cover/replace Carrick whilst also being able to fulfil the box to box role. (I actually think McCarthy or Besic from Everton would be well suited for this).

5550~~~
It is not that I dont believe you or even disagree, I was just interested to see what quotes you had been refering to as I had not seen anything as clear cut as you were suggesting and I now understand that it is more your opinion rather than anything specific he said. You could well be right though and I wouldnt be suprised to see us bring in another midfielder, but it wouldnt be my first priority either.

Of course many expected us to buy Strootman but I think he is probably no longer an option due to injury situation so I dont know who else might fit the bill.

5551~~~
Fellaini isn't a better #10, he is not even playing as a #10, we don't use #10 at the moment, we are playing with two #8, Herrera defensive #8 and Fellaini attacking #8. Fellaini is weaker defensively and less creative.

Fellaini is playing higher than Herrera because he is less of a liability there, Herrera showed more discipline and more composure than Fellaini in a deep position, otherwise Herrera or Mata would play there. 
With Carrick injuries and after that Blind injury, Van gaal didn't had the opportunity to use them together and see if they can support Mata or Herrera or even Fellaini (he did tried against Arsenal and we lost the midfield battle).
Fellaini is also playing there because our defenders in particular, weren't comfortable enough in possession and sometimes needed a direct route, Van gaal tried Van persie and Falcao for that role but neither are as good as fellaini for that.
After that Fellaini showed that he was also the best at running from inside to outside and stretch the defense, he is also very good at playing like a deep second striker, with late runs in the box.

Now with Carrick back and Smalling, Rojo and Jones a lot more comfortable in possession we stopped launching the ball forward, De gea isn't searching for Fellaini anymore which diminish Fellaini's role now he is playing a lot more like a proper attacking #8 and in that more orthodox role, Fellaini is a lot less influential (he is still good, though) and in that role Herrera is better but we have no one to take Herrera's place, until Blind tries it, if Shaw comeback one day. 

For the Herrera is better in that role, I know that because he played that role for Bielsa and was excellent and after he played like a pure #10 for Valverde and was even better.

Now you are just being biased. I use the terms #10 and #8 not as rigid positions, but effectively a #10 as "the most advanced of the midfield three" because its much quicker to type #10 than that, likewise #8.

Regardless at this point you are simply undervaluing Fellaini's contribution and exaggerating Herrera's. Saying things like "less of a liability" is not exactly an objective outlook at all, is it?
You claim that Fellaini is weaker than Herrera defensively - I disagree. You only need look at his games against Chelsea and Arsenal - two examples against top opponents, where Fellaini's ball-winning was key to our midfield - Herrera would not be able to do that. Secondly, you are ignoring Fellaini's value on defending set pieces and crosses, which is a notable part of "defending".

So no, I dont think Herrera is better than Fellaini defensively, and I suspect many would agree. I dont think Herrera is particularly more disciplined than Fellaini either - neither of them have the discipline to play a true holding role (this was shown when we tried to use Fellaini in that capacity against Southampton). He has also shown discipline at times to avoid picking up bookings.
The reason the current system works is because the they have Carrick behind them, and both Herrera/Fellaini make defensive contributions to balance things out.
You also mention composure - which to me sounds like a typical case of "Fellaini is tall therefore must have no technique, Herrera is Spanish so must have great technique". Fellaini has provided several key passes and goals that have demonstrated his composure.

I actually really like Herrera as a player, so I dont want people to read this as me just putting him down, and forgive me if this comes across as a bit hostile, but you are basically talking crap with a lot of this;

"Fellaini is playing higher than Herrera because he is less of a liability there"
"Fellaini is also playing there because our defenders in particular, weren't comfortable enough in possession and sometimes needed a direct route"
"De gea isn't searching for Fellaini anymore which diminish Fellaini's role "

These statements are simply not true, or at best are heavily biased.

Pulling out some cherrypicked squawka stats doesnt really change anything, I can just as easily find stats which support Fellaini. They are different players with different roles and contributions.

See?

This was posted a few pages back and I draw your attention to it not as a Fellaini highlight reel, but because I recall watching it and noticing just how many clips there were of him winning the ball in our half - that is what I am talking about when I talk about defensive contributions. And this is why it annoys me when people claim that Fellaini just camps the opposition penalty area and chest controls 60 yard passes. He wins the ball back superbly and often releases an attacking player with a forward pass (even though apparently he slows our tempo down, cant pass etc)

There are also good examples of his composure - such as his pass to Di Maria against Arsenal which led to the goal. These attributes tend to be overlooked and ignored when it comes to Fellaini because it doesnt fit with his redcafe reputation of being the big awkward fellow who cant control anything below his waste.

This isnt even mentioning some of his other strengths such as;
*Formed/forming a good attacking partnership and understanding with Rooney.
*Has shown himself to have an excellent attitude and mental determination off the pitch.
*Also has a good mentality on the pitch - never goes missing, always wants the ball and tries to contribute even when having a bad game.
*Offers something very different to what most teams have - forces other teams to have a plan to deal with him (and often they fail), giving other players more freedom.

On top of this, he still has several years at his peak and who is to say that under LVG he wont improve further?
If he DOES improve further then he could become an extremely important player for us over the next ~5 years simply because he is unique and offers something different.

Anyway I dont think this discussion is going anywhere so I think we will need to just agree to disagree. I am always cautious of posting too much in this thread because then I get marked as the Fellaini Crusader.

I'm probably biased, I base a lot of my remarks on impressions/feelings, so I will always be opinionated.

And no I don't think that Fellaini is weak technically, but I think that he lacks composure sometimes, which is not good in deep positions, he is also attracted by the ball way to much, he is very good at pressing the ball and sometimes try to do it when he shouldn't, Herrera was like that too.

And you are to defend Fellaini, he deserves some support.

5554~~~
I'm struggling to think when that might have been - late fifties and (very) early sixties perhaps?

5555~~~
90s and early 2000s. 

Of course that style of play translated to us getting schooled in Europe multiple times.

5556~~~
It's not about winning 6-5, it's about winning 4-1 every week instead of risking tight 1-0 and 2-1 games, which lead you to slip up too often to post the obscene 90 point seasons the best teams put up now.

5557~~~
Excellent post.

5558~~~
That style of play is also a myth. Until 06-07 we'd only scored more than 80 goals in a Prem season twice and, over the 15 seasons to that point, we averaged less than 2 goals a game. And that's including 99-00 and 01-02 when we scored 97 and 87 goals respectively. In the Prem we let in 3 or more goals 40 times in those 15 seasons - we won 5 of those games (and had six 3-3 draws). That's not to say that the game wasn't more "end to end" in those days - it was. But, strangely, that didn't result in more goals (for or against) than we've seen in recent years.

It's true that we didn't do well in Europe initially, but that's not uncommon (think City more recently). Our first four years were very mixed - lost in the first round, lost in the second round, lost in the group stages, lost in the first round - but after that we qualified for the knock out stages almost always (from 96-97 onwards). I suppose that the lesson we learnt was that direct football doesn't work at the highest level of European competition.

5559~~~
On the subject under discussion (which I'd rather lost sight of), it's pretty obvious that we aren't playing with a #10 at the moment. We're operating with a defensive triangle (Smalling, Jones and Carrick), a left sided triangle (Blind, Fellaini and Young), a right sided triangle (Valencia, Herrera and Mata), and Rooney. I suppose if we insist on defining them by a number, Fellaini and Herrera could both be thought of as #8's, and Mata and Young as #7 and #11 respectively. Both Fellaini and Herrera are, to an extent, box to box players in this framework. Fellaini, because we're using him in both penalty areas and as an outlet target, has a bigger range than Herrera, but their basic roles (as the pivot in the triangle) are the same. They have both done spectacularly well in the last two matches - long may it continue.

5560~~~
I'm still not buying that Fellaini is playing as a box-to-box midfielder. I mean look at his goal against Tottenham, he was running off the shoulder of the last man. He drops into midfield without the ball to give us an extra man there but that's exactly what Rooney was doing playing off RvP in 12/13 and you can't argue that he was playing as a no 8.

5561~~~
Look at the heatmaps. Fellaini and Herrera are playing essentially the same role with the exception that Fellaini is expected to get into the box occasionally. Their average positions were almost identical in the Spurs and Liverpool matches. Between them they carpeted the area between the boxes.

5562~~~
This is a screen cap from the Tottenham game and is generally how Fellaini positioned himself vis a vis Carrick and Herrera as his starting position.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/81666000/jpg/_81666658_juanmata,anderherreraandantoniovalenciawithanexampleofamanutdpassingtrianglevtottenham.jpg" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/81666000/jpg/_81666658_juanmata,anderherreraandantoniovalenciawithanexampleofamanutdpassingtrianglevtottenham.jpg"/>

5563~~~
was it after united grabbed the lead? because at 2 or 3 nil he was pulled back.

5564~~~
Rooney was playing behind the forward, centrally, in a 4411 or 4231. He was a 10 who helped out defensively - similar to Oscar for Chelsea. Fellaini, on the other hand, although slightly more advanced than Herrera, is playing on the left of a three, whilst Herrera is on the right. 

Fellaini shares a similar role to Matuidi of PSG, who constantly running off the shoulder of the last man, but also comes back and makes a three off the ball. In a 433, if the forward drops off, which Rooney likes to do often, you then need one of the midfielders to run in behind, and it seems that Van Gaal has given Fellaini that role.

5565~~~
<a class="username" data-user="52832, @finneh" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/52832/">@finneh</a> posted a diagram of the average positions against Spurs and Liverpool

Top one - Spurs
Bottom one - Liverpool

5566~~~
I typed out a reply and realised this is just getting into levels of interpretation. Either way, Fellaini is starting matches pulling out towards the left wing, playing with his back to goal and pushing onto the RCB and RB. By virtue of being our outlet ball, he spends a lot of time ahead of the ball. I can't see how you can compare that role to what Herrera does, or any other orthodox CM player. He did tuck back in into what was a more orthodox midfield 3 position against Liverpool and Tottenham in the second half, to be fair (where he was noticeably less prominent/effective in both games).

5567~~~
I think people are getting too fixated on trying to determine Fellaini's position. I don't think calling him an #8 or a #10 is really the right way to define it. For me he seems to be playing some sort of hybrid role. I have seen him take up positions as a #9, a #10, #8, and a winger. He sort of floats in and around these positions. An 'advanced #8' would probably be the best way to say it. 

Just to weigh in on that <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> and <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> debate, Fellaini's defensive contribution far exceeds Herrera's and I think that post from <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> was excellent.

5568~~~
That's not true, Fellaini does things better than Herrera and Herrera does over things better than Fellaini. You can see it with your own eyes and the stats proves it too.

Fellaini is better in all the physical things (clearances, takles won) and Herrera his better in all the positional things hence his high number of interceptions.
None of them are perfect defensively but Herrera's strong points are more suited  for the role that Van gaal gave him.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/ander_herrera/126/126/1538/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/marouane_fellaini/126/126/466/38/p|premier_league/2014/2015/michael_carrick/126/126/575/0/p#tackles_won/aerial_duels_won/blocks/defensive_errors/clearances/interceptions/defence_score/fouls_committed#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...nterceptions/defence_score/fouls_committed#90</a>

5569~~~
Fellaini's positional sense and tendency to switch off while defending worried me far more when we signed him than any lack of technical ability.

5570~~~
For the record my post that started this wasn't me saying we actually won games 5-4 regularly or scored record tallies every season. I was talking about the cavalier mentality we played with, not how well that actually panned out.

5571~~~
I agree with that. However I think that Fellaini's defensive qualities, the physical stuff as you said, is at a higher level than Herrera's defensive qualities.

5572~~~
de Gea's positioning was all over the place Vs Liverpool. 

Shocking.

5573~~~
Seems van Gaal is really impressed with him.

5574~~~
Its what I have been banging on about for the last week - if it aint broke dont fix it.

5575~~~
And rightly so. He's been in terrific form, and gives us something very few teams can offer.

5576~~~
That is the quote from the conference (taking from the BBC).

Honestly not wanting to beat a dead horse with this one, but it backs up what I thought from when Fellaini came on against West Brom and scored his first goal for us, earlier this season. He listens and does what the manager asks - we saw in that game (it was West Brom or West Ham, cant remember which) that LVG was talking to Fellaini at length in the dugout, before he brought him on. It was clear that he was giving Fellaini various instructions, and Fellaini came on and changed the game around.

You can doubt many things about the afroman, but his attitude is not one of them. He has shown the balls, grit and determination to be a United player, and has shown that he will listen to the manager to good effect. At this point and based on these quotes I would be shocked if LVG sold Fellaini anytime soon.

5577~~~
The manager is completely right, there's no way he doesn't start every game on current form. He's been excellent and has no doubt won some respect and maybe even turned around some opinions recently. What's more, he also had a fantastic week with Belgium, pretty sure he scored three goals?

5578~~~
Looks like Fellaini has become a favorite for LVG.

5579~~~
It's the case with Young as well. The two players who got the most shit thrown at them last year. They both have exemplary attitudes and work their balls off for the manager and team.

5580~~~
I have personally been more surprised at Young's turnaround. I always thought that Fellaini would come good if LVG gave him a chance, but Young I expected to be one of the first out the door. Credit to him as well.

5581~~~
It was West Ham Big Sam was on about Long Ball Utd and LVG brought out a dossier to prove him wrong.

5582~~~
Ah yes, now I remember!

5583~~~
Yep, no chance of him being sold. Even if we sign someone to replace him in the first team he'll still be an excellent squad player to have around.

5584~~~
Expecting one of the gif masters here to do a Star Wars/Fellaini combo. "He will bring balance".

5585~~~
I agree, he deserves to be in the team somewhere. His 2nd goal against Cyprus was a peach too

5586~~~
His ability on here was often downplayed to a laughable extent. It was made out that he was some lug at Everton with no technique or actual footballing ability. This of course was far from the truth. He was actually excellent for Everton.

I wasn't ecstatic when we signed him but I thought he would be a good player for us. He was thoroughly underwhelming last season and I really started to doubt him. But fair play to him, he's turned it around and has been excellent lately.

5587~~~
Always been a supporter of his, because I think he's always offered us something we have lacked. Aggression. He had a terrible season last year, but you can understand why. LVG has re-invigorated him and allowed him to relax and trust his ability. Very pleased for him, because I think he suffered the Moyes effect last year.

5588~~~
May the (aerial) force be with you.

5589~~~
I wouldn't disagree with this. The English game was helter-skelter end-to-end back then. Exciting,  but useless against top European sides who could slow the game down and use skill (dastardly foreigners!!). And, when it came down to it, lack of skill was why so few goals were scored in the Prem despite all the effort. (Does that tell us something about the national team?)

5590~~~
I remember supporting Fellaini a bit last year and you get a lot of stick when you do that, so it's surprising to see so many "I knew he'd come good" posts, but fair play <a class="username" data-user="1538, @togg" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/1538/">@togg</a>, <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> and <a class="username" data-user="52575, @Robbie Boy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/52575/">@Robbie Boy</a> all don't seem to be that harsh on the lad (although Robbie Boy seriously doubted during the world cup)

5591~~~

5592~~~
That was my post on 3rd September, when we signed him, and I stand by every word <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

5593~~~
that comparison is a bit misleading seeing as he mostly played a more defensive midfield role last season

5594~~~
It's more an indication of how much his attacking play regressed last season, which is explained by the role he was used in.

5595~~~
Can't deny I doubted to him to the point that I wanted rid. The only reason I wanted to keep was because I knew we would have take a massive loss.

I didn't want to sign him as he wasn't what we needed but I thought he was a good player for Everton. I never necessarily doubted his ability as a footballer; it was more that he was a terrible fit that wasn't utilised properly. Fair play to him, he's winning me over and I hope he has another good game against Villa tomorrow.

5596~~~
I agree with most of this - he wasnt the right signing for us at the time, and we overpaid, which is part of the reason for the animosity towards him.

5597~~~
Although he didn't get credited with an assist, he basically assisted the RvP goal against Chelsea. It was his header that forced Courtois to save and allowed RvP to score the rebound.

5598~~~
Eating my words here, which is a good thing in this case.

5599~~~
Fellaini is the result of having too many pussies in midfield. He brings physicality that we need to bring some balance in midfield. Hence why I want Carrick to be replaced with someone whose more defensive minded. It would allow us to release both Herrera and Di Maria in CM.

5600~~~

5601~~~
and your point is?

5602~~~
meant to be I am in total agreement with that :-)

5603~~~
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

5604~~~
As soon as he goes off, we concede from a set piece. Coincidence? <span style="color: #ffffff">White text, but is it needed?</span>

5605~~~
Is it just me or did he restrict some of our balls from getting into the box?  we were more likely to get the 3rd goal without him on the pitch, despite the fact that Falcao was basically a -1.

Still happy with his contribution to the team though.

5606~~~
I think Villa marshalled him pretty well, although it is worth noting that the man he had been marking on set pieces scored as soon as he went off.

Not very effective although it looked to me like he was playing a bit deeper than normal. Young and Blind both had a lot of space on the left to work with though, and you could argue that Fellaini contributed to that simply due to the fact that Villa were manmarking him constantly.

5607~~~
Did okay. Won the ball back a few times very quickly. Should have scored with that header. Headed it too low

5608~~~
Poor up front today not enough movement but worked hard getting the ball back for us a number of times.

5609~~~
Although I've seen a white text...

Not really, I think he's been on Benteke (alongside with Rojo) on corners/free kicks this match, in the replay you can see how easily Falcao gets outmuscled by Clarke or whoever outmuscled him, Fellaini wouldn't be moved like that.

Noting flashy today but nothing flashy was required I guess, shame about his header not going in, can't forget his great touch/pass to Rooney in 5th minute when we should've had a penalty and a red card for Villa player. As soon as he went on, we've lost the stability in the game though, he shouldn't have gone off, especially not for Falcao.

5610~~~
He works part of a machine now. When hes double teamed, then it frees up Mata. When Mata is marked out, it allows Herrera time and space to get into the box. We now have threats and hes one of them. Hes not slowing the play down and gives us an outlet. And of course important for defending set pieces.

Also proof (along with Young) why it can be dangerous to write of player who are not performing especially when the rest of the team arent performing either.

5611~~~
Gave an option for the back post ball and made a couple of good tackles, solid performance.

5612~~~
This is pretty much it - if the opposition choose to man mark one of Our attackers then it freed up room for others.

5613~~~
For the first 30 minutes or so he was poor. Didn't get himself about enough, basically just stood and waited for the ball at the back post. Hutton got injured and when the players were getting water you could see Giggs have a word with him, he was a lot more lively after that conversation and overall I think it was a fairly good performance.

5614~~~
I never think it's a good idea to take Fellaini off against crap sides like this because half of our height goes away for the set pieces.  But he did have a poor game IMO.  The international break was pointed out to me in another thread and it's interesting to note that he had to visit the Middle East as opposed to the two games England had at Wembley and in Turin.

5615~~~
Not his best game this season. I thought he looked a little tired maybe because of the amount of minutes he has played in the last month?

5616~~~
Fellaini played a good ball for Rooneys penalty that wasn't given.

5617~~~
Looked a bit tired and constantly had two men on him the whole game. Sanchez stuck to him like Sterling to a £5 note, so was always going to be tough.

Think he'll be very important vs Arsenal, Chelsea and City.

5618~~~
Pretty quiet today, but felt he held it up well when he got the ball and brought others into play.

5619~~~
He was solid. Did some good things and made some mistakes. I suspect that he was a bit fatigued from the international break too. Also, Villa handled him very well and seemed to be man-marking him at times. His touch to Rooney (for the penalty that should have been) was good. Always a worry when we don't have Smalling and we sub off Fellaini, it leaves us with no height in defending set-pieces.

5620~~~
Thought he was really poor in all honesty.

Didn't get involved at all, wasn't putting himself about physically, missed a great chance....I noticed he was wearing that bandage on his wrist again, I hope that isn't going to restrict him (like it supposedly did last season) <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> He was quite evidently less physical today then he has been recently.

5621~~~
He was being asked to get into the box ASAP to help overload Villa and the crosses just weren't reaching him. Wasn't really being asked to make the same intelligent runs forward he's been making of late, more a case of playing as a second striker today and with better crossing and a better finish on one occasion could have had a more productive game.

5622~~~
May not have been his best but it was far from his worst.  I thought he did well enough...he could have taken that header better but honestly I thought the defender was getting a touch on it and he probably got in on the ball slower because of it.  The balls that were put in toward him were too long and he couldn't do much on that.  I thought he played well.

5623~~~
Wasn't great but he was fine. A little too deep for me when we had the ball but from where he has come from, I'm happy enough with that performance.

5624~~~
In most parts of the game it looked like they glued Sanchez on him,due Villa playing with 2 CMs,there was so much space on that left side because Sanchez went so deep to man marking Afroman.We did not exploit that much,only few times,one of those was Rojo`s strike. He was good today,even without his  true impact like in prev 2 games,now LvG can find solutions in scenario where they man mark him.

5625~~~
An off day for afroman but he wasn't poor.  Nothing to be too concerned about.

5626~~~
Looked a tad jaded but still provided the platform for the first goal after another bad touch from Wayne.

5627~~~
I think tired after the international games but still a solid performance.

5628~~~
We'll win more game with him in the team even if he has a bad one. Our team has a variety of weapons now, Fellani's height and power, Rooney's finishing, Young and Valencia pace,  Mata and Herrera's passing, Carrick and Blind's composure, super sub Di Maria, we've got it all. I know we wont win the League this year but to see it all gelling is a satisfaction in itself especially after last season.

5629~~~
This - although I wouldn't give up on the League just yet - where there's life there's hope, after all.

5630~~~
Sanchez had the better of him yesterday.

5631~~~
van Gaal is right he is undroppable at the moment. What a contrast to last season. He is definitely worthy of being at the club.

5632~~~

5633~~~
Just had a chat with a colleague being Arsenal fan. He used to make some Fellaini jokes everytime we met. Now he called him "one of the best midfielders in the PL atm".

5634~~~
A tag many had given him the season before he signed for us.

5635~~~
You mean the season he played as a target man up front?

5636~~~
No the season he played the same role he's playing this season. An advanced midfielder who can operate as a target man on set pieces and counters.

5637~~~
He was a deep lying target man that season too.

5638~~~
Everton didnt play a 4-1-4-1

He was in behind a single striker, the same role Mata had at Chelsea

5639~~~
Formations might not be the same, but he didn't operate as an out and out target man.

5640~~~
Well he did, but not as the furthest forward. I'm referring to the way they used him. They used him as a target and he was the main man to support the real striker

5641~~~
Remember the momentum we used in the second half of the 2005/06 season, springboarded us next season. So this could be a vital stepping stone in preparation for next season, and we could go far next season

5642~~~
Fellaini is playing the exact same role he did in his last season at us so that article is a load of shite.

5643~~~
I always remember him playing centrally for Everton. If nothing else, the way he mainly sticks to the left flank is new to him, surely?

5644~~~
Nope. He always drifted to the left for us and linked up with Baines and Pienaar.

5645~~~
Well there you go. Nothing new in the world.

5646~~~
I have said it before but I honestly think Moyes wanted to use him in this role but didn't have the balls because of the backlash about 'hoofball' the media and maybe fans would of gave him.

5647~~~
Yeah, if I had to pick out the one thing that really scuppered Moyes at United it would be his anxiety about what the media/fans might say and letting that influence decisions on the pitch. Say what you like about Van Gaal but he literally could not give a feck what others think of his decisions. An important quality in a manager IMO.

5648~~~
Yep, a clear indication that the job was too big for him.

5649~~~
As soon as he came off, Villa scored.
Who knows...if he didnt play the whole match, maybe Villa would've scored a few more. We'll never know.
Fellaini is part of our first team and VERY important for both Plan A (possession/passing) and Plan B (hoofball).
Fellaini is an integral part of our first team and regardless of form, should start every game. Of course, if he has a series of bad performances, like any player, he will be put on the bench.

5650~~~
Can you imagine if you posted that three months ago?  You'd get a tag line for that alone.

Agreed.  He is not an ornate passer but keeps it effective and simple.  He gets it to the open man, the guy with better options or someone in position to score.  After he passes, he moves.  Simple but it makes the team better.

One thing I notice against Villa was how calm he was when pressured by two men.  It was like they thought his technique was a weak point.  However, he'd hold them off and calmly lay it off with a short pass.  He looked calm and collected.  He gets that if there are two on him a teammate will be open.  Stay calm and find him; the rest will take care of itself.

5651~~~
It's remarkable how it has worked out for Fellaini so far. Imagine a game-winning goal in the derby <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

EDIT: Apologies for the repetition in the tweets, wasn't sure how to embed it correctly.

5652~~~
Imagine the reaction if LVG made him captain <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5653~~~
Nice words from Van Gaal. I expect a better game from the big man today, though.

5654~~~
<i>Too</i> creative? Is that a bad thing?

5655~~~
It is if you have no control of the ball in the final third. When that happens, the ball doesn't stick. We're a much more comfortable team now in the final third of the pitch because we've played with more confidence. Hopefully we'll have more of that today.

5656~~~
We need a big performance from him today

5657~~~
He's talking about their mindset and focus, and I imagine he's mainly talking about Di Maria here. It's just another way of saying he doesn't want a risk taker in the middle, he wants a steady functional player.

5658~~~
Need an absolute monster performance

5659~~~
Probably lost in translation.

Too risky is probably closer to the truth. Think Giggs. Never really had the best ball retention rates because he always liked to try things (which worked out for us a lot, but can't have too many doing it).

5660~~~
Chuffed to bits for him.

5661~~~
That head and chest he has are both second to none. I have genuinely not seen better chest control by any other footballer.

5662~~~
We're getting better and better at using him with each passing game.

5663~~~
Probably the only thing I have been correct about all season. What a guy.

5664~~~
I was just thinking the same.

5665~~~
Fellaini has won every 50/50 ball against Yaya so far. Yaya looks like he wants no part of Fellaini.

5666~~~
Epic battle between Toure and Fellaini.

5667~~~
Moyes knew his shit in that respect!

5668~~~
He really has been superb. Credit to him, pretty much undroppable now.

5669~~~
He is a God

5670~~~
This is the Fellaini at Everton that was in the team of the season. I still can not believe Moyes had troubles figuring out how to use him last season. His aerial advantage makes him so useful and adds another dimension to our attack. Van Gaal is doing a good job playing him as a target man, while when defending giving him more of a box to box role.

5671~~~
Playing like <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/> so far.

5672~~~
He's been great in this first half.

5673~~~
Steam rolling everybody in site so far starting to look a great buy from Moyes. Shame on some people!

5674~~~
Young and Fellaini

If you had said this last year...what a difference!

5675~~~
Poor start but has grown into the game magnificently since his goal. He's such a brilliant player to have when he's confident as he'll be absolutely everywhere on the pitch and working for the team in both an attacking and defensive role. His passing can still be sloppy sometimes but he's also shown to be capable of playing intricate football at times and playing the correct options on pretty much every occasion, without panic. Still annoys me that he is unfairly treated by the referees sometimes for fouls which wouldn't be fouls by any other player but he's actually improved in that aspect too. Well done Fellaini and well done LVG for correctly utilising him. He'll be a great player to have in the CL next year, i don't think a lot of European teams will know how to deal with him when he's playing in this type of role which seems to be a mish-mash of his season where he played AM for us and the season where he was playing as a CM. Best of both worlds.

5676~~~
The problem was I think was that Moyes knew how to use him but was afraid to go down that route tactically because he would of been crucified.

5677~~~
This. He is now playing how he used to play against us.

5678~~~
Yea, Moyes was a coward and because of that he lost his job. I questioned his decision to play Fellaini in midfield when he was an absolute beast at Everton as a suffoco.

Now the question is, why should we look for a replacement for Fellaini in the starting eleven when he is such an advantage to is for tactical purpose when on the pitch. I might have to reconsider my viewpoint on that previous opinion I hold that he is a better plan B than a plan A.

5679~~~
Aye, fans would've slaughtered Moyes if he'd sacrificed Rooney or RVP to make room for Fellaini in a target man role.

5680~~~
Wasnt he injured when, or shortly after he arrived too or am I dreaming.

Hopefully one or two people might learn to reserve judgement for more than 5 minutes in future.

5681~~~
Doing very well. When we have the ball on the deck though, he is peeling off and getting on the toes of the CB, we need to find him and he can just back in all day.

5682~~~
If Moyes had deployed him like his he'd have been slated for turning us into Everton or something.

5683~~~
He's shutting down and dominating Yaya Toure.

We spent many a derby wishing we had a player who could even compete with Yaya.

5684~~~
Following Toure all over the place

5685~~~
Funny really because this team at the moment reminds me a lot of Moyes Everton team in his last year here. With better players ofcourse.

5686~~~
The most important player to Van Gaal's United. Weird. Fantastic too.

5687~~~
Another brilliant performance from him again today.

If he keeps this crack up he'll be getting my player of the season award.

I've great time for players that operates the way he does.

5688~~~
From being jeered in a pre season game at Old Trafford to being given a standing ovation in the Derby at the end of the season. Quite a turnaround.

5689~~~
The Immovable Afro.

I absolutely love this guy. Immense again, immense in most big games this season, what a character he is.

5690~~~
What a man.

5691~~~
still hated by many on here, but feck them, he's yet again proving he's a big asset to the squad.

5692~~~
Compare this game against the home game against city under Moyes, and it looks like a completely different player. Even won quite a few 50-50s with Toure which last year didn't happen.

Big fella has been awesome for us recently and is just so hard to handle. Think he will do well against Chelsea too hopefully.

5693~~~
Almost unplayable when on form.

5694~~~
Get Moyes to be in charge of transfers. Fellaini and Mata. Done the groundwork for Herrera and Shaw. Rejected Mangala. 

The man has an eye for talent.

5695~~~
is good

5696~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Turned down Fabregas though.

5697~~~
Great goal from this guy and unmoveable object on the field

5698~~~
Eh?

5699~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCZ_w61UIAAUZA5.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCZ_w61UIAAUZA5.jpg"/>

5700~~~
Well played the big man

5701~~~
Who remembers the people on here saying "Yaha vs Fellaini.. dear me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> "

5702~~~
There was never any doubt about that, and he had a very good transfer record at Everton (e.g. Pienaar, Arteta, Jagielka and Coleman signed for less than £10m combined).

It's just that in his last few months here, the dislike of him reached hysterical proportions, and there was real pressure not mention that he did have some redeeming features. Any suggestion of that was quickly shouted down.

All Fellaini is doing now is reproducing his Everton form for United. And there was never any reason why he couldn't, if he was given the chance to.

He has been given the chance, and now we can see what he's all about.

5703~~~
Wait, it was someone else wasn't it?

5704~~~
To be honest, I think he's one of those players who has the potential to be an absolute nightmare for opposing teams on his day. Has the quality and physique to be a real star for this team. He's already showing glimpses of what happens when you have a good manager who is able to play you to your strengths.

5705~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5706~~~
Once again, as a huge supporter of his, I'm so bloody pleased for him. He was on a hiding to nothing last season, injuries plagued him and he became part of a team inherited from Fergie that didn't believe in the manager who believed in him. LVG has managed to find that obvious talent and harnessed it for the benefit of the team. Delighted for him.

5707~~~
Should he be a starter next year? Doesn't he deserve to reap the profits of finishing in the top4, since he has been one of our best players this season? 

He is so calm when getting the ball, and we really need him on the pitch as an option when we can't pass our way through. And then he also scores goals, i'm very curious to how he is used next season.

Love him! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5708~~~
Fantastic performance from the big man. Fair play.

5709~~~
City didnt know how to handle him. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5710~~~
Yes he should be. I'm sick and tired of 'he could do a job' and 'if we want to be good in Europe he shouldnt be a starter.' He had a great season so far and he deserves to be a starter.

5711~~~
Fantastic game, it was great to see him dominating City like he did. I still remember how terrible he was at the Etihad last season, it's so good to see him finally showing what he's capable of.

5712~~~
Absolutely.

5713~~~
He's showing intelligence in his game now too, finding good positrons, reading progression of play. In the first 5 minutes when City had the ball at the back, we had Rooney gently closing play down and the rest of our midfielders were deeper in a bank of 5. Cobra Kai squared the ball to Kompany and before it had left his boot Fellaini had burst from that bank and forced Kompany to scuff it.

He knows his job and he's becoming a serious asset.

5714~~~
He had good seasons at Everton but this must be his best in the league now. Keeps on delivering.

MOYESY KNOWS

5715~~~
Starter next year? Or a squad player?

Starter for me. No team seems to know how to play against him.

5716~~~
He was still better in his last season for us us. 11 Goals in 31 games whiles being the hub of the team.

5717~~~
There's always Arsenal and Chelsea to score hattricks against to be fair. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

5718~~~
Felt good seeing his reception when he went off, what a turnaround its been for this guy im really happy for him.

5719~~~
To be honest it wasn't just the goals. He was fantastic all around. His form comes as no surprise to me or Silentwitness because he was like this on a regular basis for us.

5720~~~
I'd been leaning towards him being someone who was useful right now, and would be more of a squad player in the long term, but he's been brilliant to be fair to him. If he can continue to play like this, he'll probably be a main starter next year.

5721~~~
Yea I know, been fan of his in your side, been fan of his in our side, you can't believe how happy I am to see him recapture his form.

5722~~~
I feel the same way. He was a cult hero at us and I will be a bit disappointed if he gets a bad reception when we meet at Goodison.

5723~~~
He's been a monster this season. Absolutely immense. I've always felt we'd be brilliant with a big man for years and years.

Why the hell he didn't play more forward last season, especially when RvP had clearly had enough of Moyes and had injuries, I don't know?

5724~~~
My motm. Love him already. He has done brilliantly well this season

5725~~~
Constant threat, I thought at first he struggled a little bit with Yaya's athletic ability but his fitness and Yaya's laziness turned the corner.

5726~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5727~~~
He goes home at night now, knowing he is a Manchester United player. Last season I'm sure he didn't feel that. He's got used to the stage and had the confidence beaten into him by LVG. Something Moyes couldn't do because he was scared himself.

5728~~~
There should be a name and shame thread on here. Lots of Fellaini doubters

5729~~~
My MOTM. What a beast he was today.

5730~~~
He is an amazing shit-stirrer for other teams to have to deal with. I would hate trying to defend him, he just clogs things up so well.

5731~~~
He looked almost emotional when he was celebrating with Young. You can tell this means so much for him, especially after what he went through.

Is he a starter? 100%. He adds something unique for us, dropping him would be stupid. He's working perfectly for us. So chuffed for him.

5732~~~
Yet another spectacular performance from the "lanky poodle". Tore City a new arsehole down that left corridor, great stuff

5733~~~
Spot on.

5734~~~
Yaya Toure will be having nightmares of Fellaini tonight.

5735~~~
Involved in three goals today which itself means a great perforance but his overal game bringin team into play is great, I wish he was little faster.. Despite him being awesome in the game I think he was little bit struggling in the beginning of the game as he was trying to mark Yaya but we lacked pressure upfront. It was important city backed off so we could attack more and he could get into further positions where he's dangerous..

5736~~~
His turnaround has been absolutely magnificent and he deserves credit for that. He was immense today after a cagey start and he has played a crucial role in our recent brilliant run (long may it continue). 

I do feel that certain posters are extremely smug and act in an almost passive aggressive manner about his turn in fortunes. There really is no need for that carry on. People doubted him, yes, and rightly so. The booing was out of order altogether but he looked far from a United player last season. I'm sure some of the criticism was OTT but the smugness is just as tedious.

5737~~~
What a turnaround. His determination and hard work have won hem this starting spot and I have nothing but respect for the way he can boss games around now. The fact that he was injured and the transfer fell through is a blessing in disguise.

5738~~~
I said it last season in the Zaha thread, I trust his judgement when it comes to footballing and mental qualities. He is a great at that. I feel that he is a DOF more than great coach.

5739~~~
I can't believe I still see people in this forum, when talking about transfers in the summer they mention ones to replace him? He's been brilliant this season; it's isn't hoofball any more when we go forward, but rather a far post option which you can tell has been practised so many times to get spot on, and it pretty much results in meeting Fellaini 9 times out of 10 and catch them off guard.

Add that to his dominance in the middle of the park in the air, and his involvement in the plays today, and you can't argue that he's one of our most important outfield player for him. So chuffed for him, and couldn't be happier to see the standing ovation. You could see him struggling to contain his happiness when he came off to that.

Oh, and the fans jeering in pre-season? Nice one

5740~~~
Got the better of Toure today, who appeared to be marking him naturally because they're of a similar height. Although he didn't do a very good job of marking him at all which was to our advantage.

5741~~~
You know what he is? A Manchester United player.

5742~~~
Will say what I said in the Young thread. Lots of respect for the way he's turned it around. Been very good this season for us. He must be an absolute nuisance to play against.

5743~~~
He is such a presence in that midfield now and in and around the box. Any team in the world would struggle to play against him at the moment in the form he's in. His control from long passes is exceptional, rarely loses it with the chest down. A real asset to the team.

5744~~~
It was a comment that many people had in his transfer forum thread - that we needed someone who could match Toure. Unfortunately it didn't happen last season, but today Fellaini dominated him. And it was fantastic to see.

If Moyes had come in at the beginning of the season and done it, absolutely. However as the season went on and things weren't working out I'm pretty sure there would have been more understanding of trying it out.

5745~~~
A year ago he was doing this

5746~~~
Even through my overly sceptical lenses he was great today. It's really nice to see that he (and LVG) almost cut out this stupid slow part of his game and concentrated on his strengths.

5747~~~
Too emotional was the main point. We have more gifted players but they will no play exactly how LVG wants them to play.

5748~~~
I swear his chest control is like some sort of cheat mode. He's pressing all the shoulder buttons at the same time or something.

5749~~~
That standing ovation tells you all need to know about Fellaini today.

5750~~~
That standing ovation should do him such a huge world of good, much like Mata got against Spurs. His linkup with Blind and Young is great.

Him and Young keeping out Falcao and Di Maria is quite something.

5751~~~
My MOTM today, he was key to pretty much every move we put together.

5752~~~
One or two careless passes but played very well overall. Last season we paid for his limitations, this season we're profiting for his strengths

5753~~~
Fellani's turnaround this year has been nothing short of exceptional. The shell of a person he was last year compared to the player he is now are unbelievable.

LvG has worked miracles with him.

5754~~~
His turnaround, unbelievable.

Can't remember another player turning it around so dramatically for us.

5755~~~
Its what I have been saying, that if absolutely nothing else, Fellaini is a unique player and thus poses a unique threat to the opponent. As things stand, you can bet your ass that every team we go up against feels that they need to have a plan to deal with Fellaini. That in itself is a big "win" for us, but the key is that Fellaini is simply a part of our arsenal, and gives us more options. 

I have posted probably a dozen times on various threads that it is the <i>threat</i> that Fellaini poses that makes the biggest difference - compare it to last season where teams were happy for us to swing in crosses, safe in the knowledge that they could defend crosses all day. Throw Fellaini in, and suddenly teams are no longer content to allow us to cross the ball - it is another thing they need to defend, and it creates options for us elsewhere.

5756~~~
Will cause trouble for anyone when he's playing like this. I've said it before, but what a fantastic turnaround from, a proper display of character. Him and Young are the biggest stories of our season in my book, the way they've turned their fortunes.

5757~~~
This lad was unplayable at Everton with lesser players around him. In this form, he's trouble for anyone he plays against.....

5758~~~
So again - Fellaini for captain anyone? Too soon? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5759~~~
His turnaround really has been remarkable... Used to be one of my least favourite players but wow has he proven everyone wrong. Nobody can handle him on this form.

5760~~~
He found so much space today it was crazy. When the ball comes to him in the air it almost turns into slow-mo whilst he brings it down on his chest.

5761~~~
From last season:

I can't believe I spent time trying to convince this guy that Fellaini was better than the random blokes he plays football with.

It's amazing how much bull people spread, just to think not that long ago I was trying to convince posters on here that it's too soon to call for the manager to be sacked! I think it's best to ignore people when they say stupid things.

5762~~~
I still just can't watch him and enjoy him, however I see what he brings and given the results you have to appreciate it. Generally though it's not particularly pleasing to watch.

The funny thing is, between him Blind and Young we're not doing anything revolutionary or exceptional. Teams are just not even setting up to attempt to defend against it. I'm not saying it wouldn't work anyway, but it's so blatant! Unless they're preparing for Di Maria or something, I simply don't understand it. We always had Carrick up his arse, although he always got the better of Michael, but at least attempt to stop his aerial ability.

5763~~~
Oh go feck yourself, I've come back into this thread weeks ago and praised Fellaini and stated his form is proving doubters like myself very wrong already, not doing this again.

For what it's worth, I still believe I know people more technically gifted than him anyway, and yes, I do have their numbers if you want to ring them and have a random discussion about it too.

5764~~~
OMG! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5765~~~
Yaya Toure and Demichelis had so much trouble dealing with Fellaini. Fellaini did a great job in handling the pressure that both offered, and Fellaini's strength and composure on the ball created the spaces that Young, Blind, and Mata exploited very well. His presence on the pitch causes so much disruption to the opposition, and since he's no mug on the ball, teams can't just stand back and let him have the ball.

To think that this was a player who many (including I) thought that wouldn't suit van Gaal's system and style...

5766~~~
Simply unplayable.

5767~~~
And you think a player's ability should be judged only on his technique? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

No wonder your judgement was so off!

5768~~~
Felli was immense today. City really had no answer to him when we needed to use the aerial ball to relieve pressure. Plus, when he got it down he used it intelligently and brought our other midfielders into the game. Really strong performance. A world away from his awol showing against City 13 months ago.

5769~~~
I lost faith in him last year, for the first time in a long time (eg I was gutted when Anderson left, and I want Nani and Hernandez back if wages are affordable) but I'm incredibly glad to have been so wrong. He's unplayable at his best. And the fact that he sacrificed wages to play for us makes me love him even more.

5770~~~
There's no more words to really say at this stage, he's still doing what he does and it's fecking great. What a signing he's turned out to be.

5771~~~
No, it should be judged on height and nuisance factor. I could have this discussion all over again, but it would need to be some other time.

This whole 'he is unplayable ' thing is all good. Fellaini can be unplayable. Hazard can be unplayable. The difference between them is blindingly obvious - and Hazard is considered to have 'more ability ' than Fellaini for those same very obvious reasons. Well done to Fellaini for making himself a very useful part of our set up, despite not being blessed with great footballing ability *.

If Shaqueille O'Neil was half decent at football, I imagine he would be very difficult to cope with, used in the right set up too. I am pretty sure you are aware, as a follower of football, why someone would consider Fellaini to not have great footballing ability, and are likely just seeking a  argument based on pedantry.

*footballing ability as generally considered by most neutral observers of the game.

5772~~~
He used to be unplayable for Everton as well. I remember the season opener against Everton when we last won the title and he terrified us , dominated and scored the winner. Glad he is doing it for us now. 
Beast.

5773~~~
Can Hazard control the ball with his chest like Fellaini? Can Hazard head the ball like Fellaini? Can Hazard defend like Fellaini?

Point is this: Fellaini is very skillful in certain areas and not only a physical threat. Having that chest control and heading ability is "being blessed with great footballing ability". Or is that only stepovers?

5774~~~
Let's not be silly now. This football lark didn't start with us two on red cafe.  Is Iniesta more skillful than Fellaini? Was Zidane? Or does it simply depend what skills we are talking about?

5775~~~
this

5776~~~
Just enjoy having the unplayable big guy on our team. He destroyed us when we played against us and now opposition fans will be dreading him like we did. He's a beast and he still hasn't hit top form that he showed at Everton yet.

5777~~~
I have no proof of what I am going to state but we would be a better with team Rakitic, Pogba, Verratti or Modric playing instead of Fellaini. We are making a good use of his qualities but against teams who are better than City, Liverpool or Tottenham, Arsenal for example, we need more control and Fellaini doesn't help us much for that. When the opposition know how to keep and use the ball, we struggle severely.

5778~~~
How has he only got a 6.3 season rating? There must be some serious agenda voting going on for it to be so low. He's arguably been our best player.

5779~~~
Maybe you think all of those players are better than Fellaini which they might be. My point was just regarding Fellaini; he isn't just some physical presence.

5780~~~
This guy is an absolute weapon to have in the team. Won 9 aerial duels, used the ball well and ran non-stop. Toure just couldn't cope with the workrate.

5781~~~
The ratings haven't been great, Mata's also 6.3, Rooney 6.2, the best is De Gea on 6.8.

5782~~~
Everyone is fairly low, there's no agenda. We had a very slow start and we were all pretty critical.

5783~~~
Yes, he isn't a physical presence, that's why I'm sure that the players mentioned could be better for us, because we would lose the physical abilities but we would gain drastically in the technical department.

5784~~~
I think I remember that post! Plenty others like it as well to be fair.

5785~~~
In fairness there are only 2-3 teams in the world comfortably better than the likes of City and Arsenal, if Fellaini is more than useful vs 97% of our opposition.. i'd take that?

5786~~~
He's a fantastic outlet for De Gea. Wins just about every aerial duel and can probably chest a grenade under control.

5787~~~
Arsenal are better than City, in my opinion. And there is 10 teams who I think are better than City, IMO again.

5788~~~
You will be facing those teams every year in the champions league though so it would be nice to have a complete CM who can compete with them. However we do need to keep Fellaini now considering he manages to dominate so many sides and is a very unique player. We have plenty of room for those two midfield spots anyway as we only have Herrera and Fellaini for them anyway I think?

5789~~~
Interesting that you'd bring up Shaq. If you compare Shaq's ball handling ability to someone like Kyrie Irving or Stephen Curry, there'd be no competition, but I dont think there are many that would question Shaq's ability to play basketball.

5790~~~
I have a chuckle every time I read that we still need to bring in someone next season to replace Fellaini if we want to "reach the next level".  

The guy is proving not only that he belongs here, but that he is a force that opponents simply cannot deal with.  He lets the little creative guys like Young, Mata and Herrera do their work.

5791~~~
Think its pretty clear LvG will buy a midfielder this summer, hes already said as much a couple months back, but I really dont get this talk of "useful vs some but against so many others he wont be" because the likes of City have gone head to head with Chelsea this season and looked comfortably their equal both games for example.
The only teams miles ahead of everyone in the pack is Barca, Bayern & Real.

Now considering those 3 teams, and the fact we've been in the CL almost 20 years running (prior Moyes), how many times have we actually met those 3?.... Real 2x since 2003-2014, Barca 3x 2000-2014 etc, my point being.. those type of clubs are very few and far between, and secondly.. they're not games you're even certain to matched at all in a season.

5792~~~
Does the man's peerless chest control not count as technique?!

I just think that these days if you reach the Champions League final you are going to run into Bayern, Madrid, Barcelona and PSG somewhere along the line. Would be very lucky to avoid them. City got absolutely outclassed by Barca in both games and Chelsea were far behind PSG in technical terms.

Also when you say how little we've met some great midfields in 20 years you need to remember that we've met other great midfields like AC Milan back in the day and got knocked out by lesser teams quite a few times. I'm not sure on how many times we've actually reached the Semi's.

5794~~~
Tiki-taka mitigates his weaknesses on the ball. It allows him to play the easy pass, whereas in the past he'd be a passenger if he didn't try to be a bit more creative. The fact he's so strong on the ball makes him a huge asset in a system where you receive the ball so often in tight spaces.

I thought Toure had the beating of Fellaini when the two came together. Luckily for us, Toure couldn't be arsed today.

5795~~~
We have to bring someone numerically, therefore we should aim for better than Herrera and better than Fellaini. When the new players are there, they will have to fight for the places, obviously.

2014 - Bayern (Quarter)
2013 - Madrid (Last 16)
2011 - Barcelona (Final)
2010 - Bayern (Quarter)
2009 - Barcelona (Final)
2007 - Milan (Semi)

Those are the only ones I remember watching as I only started watching United in 2003 or 2004.

5797~~~
We've also not run into those type of teams in the past and been knocked out vs the likes of Monaco, Porto, Bayer Leverkusen, without playing the elite sides.
We're basically saying, we're in need of a much better midfielder due to potentially coming up against.. on average 0-1 team a season, are we not?
So I stand by my claim, even going on the fact he may not be good enough vs the cream of world football.. (A claim, not yet fact.. mind) Fellaini should, and proving he is useful for 97% of games we play in an average season?

5798~~~
I was trying to show that when you get into the latter stages of the champions league you usually run into one of the true superpowers of European football and that we should build a midfield that will be able to handle them and help us become a proper strong team that will go deep into the champions league every year with a view of winning it. 

Yes I know we haven't always ran into those teams and have been knocked out against the likes of Porto etc but I hope that isn't the extent of our ambition. I have nothing against Fellaini staying here and being a vital member of the squad but I think united should aim to become a member of the 'cream of world football' and sign players in that bracket too. The Pogba's, Koke's and Herrera's (I think he is going to be very good).

5799~~~
Yea, I get you, If we can get players that could potentially take us to that next bracket then we should go for them, for what its worth I do believe LvG will buy a midfielder this summer, but I'm just really rather sick of coming on here, even in a time where Fellaini has proven himself not only as a capeable United player in his own right, and lately vs our rivals to whom at this point last year we were being spanked to 0-3, 0-3 at OT, he's been immense, and yet we're  still stuck in the mindset of talking about replacing the guy?

Just think its a bit of a farce really, lets give him some credit at some point? Sir Alex knocked out the likes of the Milan team you're talking about by utilising Ji-sung Park, you know its possible to win Premier League crowns & CL titles without 11 world superstars.

5800~~~
I find it amusing, but also really quite embarrassing that even now, there are <i>still</i> people who feel the need to temper any sort of praise with phrases like "despite his limitations" or "going through a good patch" or other such nonsense.

They try to praise him, but just cant quite manage to hide some of the vitriol still. It must be a pretty hard time to be a Fellaini-hater.

5801~~~
One of the first names on the team sheet as it stands. Really looking forward to seeing how teams cope with him in the Champion's League next season. He's just a quality football player with some quite unique attributes.

5802~~~
Yeah I don't understand people who want him sold after this season. He's been magnificent against Liverpool away in our biggest game of the season...and now he's helped us finally beat Man City! Helped save our season pretty much and that deserves some loyalty from United and the fans.

5803~~~
YES.  Thank you.  There is simply no need for any more qualifying statements when talking about Fellaini's contributions.  He has been a huge part of a relatively successful season and we should continue to build around him and others, not as replacements but as complements.

5804~~~
His chest control is just amazing. Any angle, any power, any distance - he just caresses it down like it's nothing. Delighted for him to get the standing ovation, well deserved. From being jeered in a pre-season game to this is a remarkable turnaround. His character can never be questioned. 

I think LvG will buy another midfielder and that Fellaini will have to fight really hard for his place (which he is capable of doing), but with CL and the league there is no doubt that he will be an important player for us in some capacity. He's so difficult to defend against and is vital for us at set-pieces.

5805~~~
I think the choice would be between Herrera, Carrick and the new midfielder really. In his current form it'd be stupid to not consider him one of the first names on the team sheet. No one has an answer for him, the center backs can't step up and risk leaving spaces behind like when DiMichelis stepped up and Mata slipped in for the goal. The full backs can't handle him if he pops up on the far post. He's the trump card at this moment.

5806~~~
If we buy another midfielder, it will be for Carrick as he is 33. And we going to be in Europe next season unless we have a big collapse. So we will need a bigger squad.

5807~~~
I don't think we'll sign a player to replace X or Y or Z. If we're playing in the CL we'll need more than 3 or 4 good midfielders. *Touch wood* if any of Herrera or Fellaini gets injured now, i foresee a significant drop in our levels, and we can't afford that.  On top of that, an extra midfielder with different attributes will give us options if we need to change our tactics. 

Whatever the case, Fellaini fully deserves his place, and I'm sure he'll be a key player for us (as will Herrera), even if we sign a new midfielder.

5808~~~
It is. The "technique" criticism is just rubbish.

5809~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/1zW9ENS.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/1zW9ENS.gif"/> 

absolutely bossed it.  well done.

5810~~~
Nah...

Fellaini would be perfect in a game against one of the big boys. As good as our passing game currently is, both Barcelona and Bayern Munich are much better. So if we can't beat them at their own game, we'd have to beat them at our own. That would mean utilising our unique weapons. Fellaini is one of, if not the, best player in the world at what he does. He'll be our ace in the hole in the CL next year.

5811~~~
Yup.

Just like how Park was our trump card in closing down opponents and exploiting the spaces they leave, Fellaini can be the one to attract opponents towards him and try to physically battle him whilst spaces open up elsewhere for others to exploit. He's definitely a key player for us, and in no way can we dispose of such a key weapon in our arsenal.

Fellaini at his best can potentially be a difference-maker in matches against top-level opposition.

5812~~~
I agree. He is nowhere near the Scholes/Iniesta type of player when it comes to technique, but he brings something completely different to the table. Hie mere presence down that left corridor, creates loads of space for Young/Blind and thus also causes all kinds of trouble for the opposing team. Then you have to take into account his presence in the air. Not since Vidic in his prime, have we had a player who can dominate the aerial space as much as him, both in defense and offense. 

That being said, his all round play has also been really good of late. Keeps it nice and tidy and very rarely loses the ball. All in all, he used to be a real menace at Everton, and he has also turned into a menace for us. 

Really happy for him after all that shit he had to endure the first season.

5813~~~
I disagree. Does not matter if it's Barcelona or Doncaster Rovers, Fellaini in his current form will cause trouble for any opposing team. His aerial strength and chest control makes him an ideal target for long balls. Also when he get's to operate in that room between the Fullback and the CB's he creates a massive unbalance in the opponent defense. No fullback in the world (that i know of) can compete with him in the air, so that means either the right CB or a big strong midfielder has to fall back to deal with him. This creates loads of space for our other players and it also means they can't press to high since it leaves them vulnerable on the counter

5814~~~
Yeah Empire, it's really obvious, you're the new Nostradamus!

5815~~~
The guy's a big game player all right, always has been. So happy for him after that game vs Valencia when he got booed. Great season for him.

5816~~~
Having him is like cheat mode with keeping possession. Someone finally manages to press us back well enough and there's an easy ball out to him on his chest and we keep possession. The rest of the time we manage to break the press pretty well anyway.

5817~~~
Will hold my hand up. I never thought he was a good buy and always maintained that he would be sold sooner rather than later. How he has made me and many others eat humble pie. I still think he can be clumsy with his passing but he offers so much that we don't have to worry about it yet. He is our out ball and always seems to pop up with important goals in big matches. Long may it continue <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5818~~~
No many teams have a target man/midfielder. It's a unique problem. It also means we can only play one striker but if we improve the quality of our service, he could get into double figures. You read people saying, it's not pleasant watching but I disagree. When something works, it's pleasant. Thanks to Fellaini and team, us supporters were largely comfortable and at 3-1 could actually relaxed somewhat.

What we saw earlier was not pleasant. The side ways passing and negativity. The inability to create anything and the obvious fear in the team. These things are not pleasant and you can only admire supporters who go through that season after season. Fellaini is a great option to have but he's only doing what some of us knew he would do and I'm sorry but some of our recent performances have been far from unpleasant.

5819~~~
Just thought i'd share this.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/12/18/277E269000000578-3035938-Old_Trafford_roars_with_Marouane_Fellaini_after_the_influential_-a-48_1428859444652.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/12/18/277E269000000578-3035938-Old_Trafford_roars_with_Marouane_Fellaini_after_the_influential_-a-48_1428859444652.jpg"/>

5820~~~
The most unorthodox #10 I've seen but it works so brilliantly.

Watching him come off to a standing ovation was amazing.

I'm going to grow an afro as a sign of my man love for the guy.

5821~~~
Especially when they look at who he is knocking down balls too, players like Mata, Herrera, Di Maria, Rooney and Young are terrifying in their own right. Having a brute like him surrounded by such class is like playing on cheat code.

5822~~~
He looks like a totally different player. Last season 9 times out of 10 he couldn't even do the basics; this season he is using all of his strengths, whilst all of his weaknesses are nearly irrelevant in this system. He really is being utilised in his perfect position: in front of a midfield anchor but behind a striker, whilst given the freedom to target the oppositions' weaknesses.

He really does look like a United player now and should be a key member of our squad going forward. I really don't buy into this "to reach the next level we need a more technical player", we're playing the best Football we've played in the best part of 5 years and comfortably beating teams who were tipped to stop our "lucky run" in its tracks; with Fellaini as a key part of it, keeping the likes of Di Maria out of the team.

5823~~~
Tell me what I said there that suggested Fellaini was worse than the random blokes Rozay plays football with?

So you quoting me seems to suggest you are disappointed that I wanted De Rossi, Thiago Alcantara and Strootman over Fellaini!! Do you not see how crazy this is? Fellaini has had a good season <i>because of this manager</i> but I don't think he should be our most advanced central midfielder next season, tell me why you think this is the wrong opinion? But you won't because you can't.

Your brain eh, this human species, so much to study!

And Nostradamus is a fake so that doesn't even make sense unless you actually think he predicted the fall of the twin towers amongst other things, which knowing you, you probably do.

BTW are you still fantasising about knocking me down a peg or two? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'm sorry I don't know why I found that funny but I did. Like in your mind you've built me up to be a somebody and you're the man that goes around teaching lessons to these somebodies! I'm a poster on redcafe expressing his opinion, it's kind of the point of these forums, if you don't like people expressing their opinions here then well that's your problem man.

5824~~~
Most posters said he wasn't United quality and they were right, especially with his performances. Even now I doubt there is anybody who wants him to be first choice because we want to be the best in Europe and he isn't good enough for that and as our squad strengthens there will be no need for what he offers, I don't think Bayern or Barcelona need him for example.

But to suggest he is a league two level footballer like Rozay did or that he isn't as good as random blokes he plays football with is ridiculous. Let's not fool ourselves, Fellaini has performed because this manager is an excellent tactician and knows how to get a player to perform, that is done by maximising his strengths and minimising his weaknesses within the tactics and using other players to help accomplish this.* The manager makes it his responsibility to build a balanced team that will win matches with good tactics and for many of the players it is a case of simply perform your role and it will come together. But even then he is still good enough for the premiership!

* I thought immediately when Fellaini scored that has been practiced. Clichy was a weak link and it is no coincidence Fellaini targeted him, Young knew in advance that Fellaini would be at the back post jumping with Clichy.

This is obvious to any manager but whether that manager calls meetings to go over many different scenarios that will occur in a game is another question. That's just one, there are many things that happened yesterday that were planned by the staff and the players simply had to do as they were told. The match was half won when the game plan had been devised, the attention to detail Louis van Gaal puts in is fantastic, he will analyse how the opposition start the game with the kick off to see if there is anything to exploit.

5825~~~
That's mainly due to the fact that he isn't a #10, at least not in our set up.

5826~~~
#10/Secondary striker, whatever you want to call it. The fact is, he's the player behind our #9.

5827~~~
It's all well and good going through your past posts and quoting yourself to look smart, but when you come out with rubbish like "I don't know what LVG sees in Felliaini" then you don't really get to go through other posts and pat yourself on the back for being right. For someone who likes to dig through other peoples posts you sure don't like it when people do it to you!

5828~~~
He's really turning opinion mine included. De Gea's ability to pick him out is phenomenal too. But he's getting better in other aspects too now when the ball is on the ground and his awareness of positions to take up. 

Playing brilliantly. Reminds me of Everton against us, when he's just so hard to play against. 

Another great game, really helped by Blind and Young too who work so well with him.

5829~~~
Absolute monster at the moment. I really liked him - or should I say worried about facing him - for Everton, but it never really looked like it would work for us. He was easily out thought and out passed last season, he was a complete liability. Slow to react, laborious on the ball and absolutely zero technical finesse.

He is doing a pretty specific job linking LB and LW and it has worked really well in the last few matches. I am just worried that this form is fleeting, but who knows - it's hard to tell if he has just got back to where he was at Everton, or if he has in fact progressed in his overall game under LvG. 

Interested to see if he has the overall quality to his game to play in an LvG side that isn't skewed so much down that left flank.

5830~~~
If you are indirectly referring to me, I had no desire to slate Fellaini. Once again, I was called out by the obsessive <a class="username" data-user="81972, @Empire" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81972/">@Empire</a> who wanted to reference posts I made about a year ago, and then AGAIN call for them to be clarified, not for the first time.

I can concede that he has made himself a very effective and important part of the team. However, if I am being called to reverse comments of his limited ability, I still stand by my observations. His role in our team is one that not many could replicate. Andy Carroll is probably one of the few players who could allow us to use the same tactics. He's not a particularly talented player either, unless again, people want to now start on semantics with the 'what is talent?' nonsense.

Ultimately, this all stems from an annoying trait of the caf where some fans like to create a scenario in which they feel that some are more entitled than  others to enjoy a good performance/result than others. I have my views on Fellaini, those views don't lead to me wanting him sold or dropped or anything, so just let me get on with it.

5831~~~
He is a #8 for us, if he was a #10 or second striker, he would be a shit one.

5832~~~
I don't want to brag, but I said he'd come good, hail Cina.

5833~~~
I think we've been watching different games. He is definitely not a #8. He's an (unorthodox) #10.

But, tbh, I don't really see the point in arguing about this.

5834~~~
He plays in the same position as Herrera, obviously not on his shoulders like, but the same position mirrored. I don't believe we are playing right now with a 10, but I think LvG has instructed Herrera and Fellaini to offer support when the opportunity presents itself. An unorthodox 10 is probably right to describe his role, and that goes for Herrera too IMO.

5835~~~
Herrera is playing deeper than Fellaini with the ball and without the ball.

Yea - agreed. But when we build from the back, Herrera is a lot deeper than Fellaini. When the ball is out wide, Fellaini is on the shoulder of the defender. 

He is just an unorthodox #10, but it works so well for us.

5836~~~
Great photo.

5837~~~
When it's all clicking there is nothing you can do to stop him. Put the fastest player in the world, the hardest player in the world and he'll just swat them aside because he's so freaking big and strong. Just palms off the opponents, brings the ball down and boom Young or Blind free down the left.

5838~~~
So you think Fellaini is just height and nuisance? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The hate even after these performances!!

Footballing ability is the ability to play Football and Fellaini seems to be good at that, certainly better than the random blokes you play with anyway.

5839~~~
Anyone who is playing professional football in the Premier League has technique and footballing ability that far, far outweighs 99% of random blokes you play with/against... that's why they're professional footballers. 

I'm sure the majority of people who have played football against an ex-professional will tell you how absurdly good their touch/technique was.

5840~~~
Exactly, Smalling and Valencia have a better technique than each and everyone of us, and Fellaini is better.

5841~~~
You can't be older than 16. 'Hate'. Such a drama queen. 'Footballing ability is footballing ability'. You have seemingly invented an algorithm by where every great to have ever played the game can be considered better than Fellaini. Well, perhaps except Ruud Gullit, who was probably better than Fellaini than even the things Fellaini is good at. Iniesta though? Hazard? Zidane? Well I guess it depends on how you want to look at it hey.

5842~~~
Not at all. It is ridiculous to suggest that anyone who is not a PL footballer could not have a better touch than Andy Carroll. There are probably tons of them on Youtube, let alone the best of the players that I have played with in my life.

People do, and don't make it pro for various reasons. I've heard a player who was at least 10x more gifted than Fellaini (John Barnes) say that he played with better players than him who didn't go pro.

Rav'el Morrison is another example. Any heights he does not hit as a pro footballer would not be down to the fact that Fellaini or fecking Carroll are more talented than him.

5843~~~
The difference being that Carroll or Fellaini are technically sound AND can play football, the freestylers and other foquinha can't.

5844~~~
Yeah people who can do tricks or keep a ball on their head aren't that impressive at all. Fellaini and Caroll are obviously better than them,

5845~~~
No one is saying they're unimpressive, just that as a whole Carroll and Fellaini can play better. There's a lot more to professional football than just skill.

5846~~~
It was always stupidity to write him off based on the sample of last season. It is not a coincidence that many of our newer players are starting to find their stride the first time since Fergie left that we've seen any consistency in how we field our team.

5847~~~
1) Technique isn't just first touch (which is why I said touch/technique).
2) Ravel Morrison isn't the best example - because he actually is a professional footballer
3) There are of course people who don't make it professional for one reason or another, be it drive/determination/commitment, but you'll often find that those that fall by the wayside when they're young would then struggle to compete with a Premier League footballer because they have not played at that high level, thus cannot cope with it's speed/power as they haven't furthered their abilities to that level.
4) Never take anything John Barnes say's seriously

5848~~~
No, the main difference is that they can play football. I'm not saying the freestylers would be better players at all. I'm saying they are more technically sound, to use your expression, and are examples of random blokes who have a better touch.

The point is, Fellaini and Carroll are not pro footballers over these guys because they are more gifted. That is obviously not true. Credit to Fellaini and Carroll for making it, but to blanket say that by default, they are more gifted is unlikely to be true, is all.

Again, I have no issue with Fellaini, and had no intention to have a go at him. I have been asked, again, to clarify my views on Fellaini's technical ability. If you watch him, even now, you will see a Manchester United attacking midfielder who is generally not confident to attempt any pass other than to the person 5 yards from him, or to attempt a shot where other attacking midfielders for top teams, like Oscar, to use a random example, would.

Many times Fellaini picks the ball up in a dangerous area and I can seea pass on that is a bit more challenging than the usual that may put us through on goal, or an opening for a shot, and he would turn back, and pass to the person next to him. An Oscar or a Cesc have the ability hurt you in such circumstances - Fellaini's abilities are more suited to pulling on to a much smaller full-back and hurting you aerially. Fair play to him, and fair play to us for finding a way that that particular strength is useful to the team.

Where do you draw the line then? Is it fair to say that Fellaini is one of the best players in the world? How about one of the greatest midfielders ever? Sure, most of the midfielders that most people who know anything about football would say are/were better than him have obvious qualities over Fellaini. But then the same can be said vice versa.

Using this new, not universally accepted way of rating the skill level of footballers, many would struggle to justify why Iniesta or Zidane are better than Fellani.

5849~~~
Yours was one of those I was referring to yes, although not the only one.

The bottom line is that you dont start games for Manchester United in midfield, if you dont have technical ability. Im not talking about chest control (although it is a valid point) but his actual ability, with the ball at his feet. The view that he is oh-so-limited technically is just an outdated stereotype formed by the caf last season (amongst other things). If you watch how he played for Everton, and how he plays now, it is plain to see that actually he is technically sound. Is he Paul Scholes? Of course not, but the "limited technique" labels are equally as wide of the mark.

There have been plenty of examples of Fellaini showing excellent composure, skill and vision on the ball, I am not going to list them. Earlier this season when Fellaini came into the team, the wise men of redcafe deemed that we were playing route one football. I was at my wits end to try to explain how actually, we were not, but for some people they seem to watch a game (or not, perhaps) and just see what they want to see. I think it is a similar case with you here, Rozay, if you really think that Fellaini is "not particularly talented".

5850~~~
He will cause top teams in the CL problems especially with the state of defending across Europe. A lot of ball playing defenders, but not many will like what he brings to the table. Not many in the world like him with what hes currently doing right now.

5851~~~
You've basically made the point that Fellaini isn't as good at passing as Oscar, Cesc, and isn't as good as Iniesta, or Zidane... which literally no one would argue with. 

Fellaini's playing to his strength in our team, there's no need for him to be smashing 30/40 yard passes around the pitch because a) that's not his strength and b) that's not what we need him to do. I'm pretty certain if you plonked Fellaini in a League Two team, he would be the bloke playing the best passes on the pitch, because his footballing ability would be far, far greater than those around him.

5852~~~
Am I the only one who thought he
A guy I know played football with Steve Staunton at his first club in Ireland (Dundalk) and said that his touch and technique was bang average. Would have been several players in the team far better on the ball than him. However, his work-rate and desire was unbelievable and that's what set him apart on the pitch. So I do kind of agree that not all top flight footballers necessarily have better technique than park players. With Fellaini, specifically, though I would say he's actually quite good on the ball. His touch is fairly consistent and weight and consistency of pass is also one of his strengths. Both of which would be better than 99% of amateur players.

He's also got no obvious weaker foot. Another element of his "technique" that makes him a very effective player and sets him apart from most footballers, amateur <b>and</b> professional

5853~~~
He won't because top teams will let him control the ball, and then they will press him, he is fine in England because coaches think that physical dominance is the be-all end-all. Just look at Ibrahimovic, he is better than Fellaini at everything Fellaini is great at, but Ibrahimovic isn't a problem in CL.

5854~~~
Remains to be seen.  I dont see Ibrahimovic and Fellaini as comparable at all especially the way both are used and deployed.

5855~~~
He's obviously doing excellently and I'm delighted for him, but I didn't think the long ball outlet to him would be such a dominant weapon as it is currently proving. Teams simply aren't able to cope with that ball out to him on the inside left. It's proving to be a brilliant outlet in big games in particular where starting attacks by keeping it in the floor isn't easy.

5856~~~
Aren't Dundalk a professional/semi-professional football club though? So I mean, already everyone playing there would be better than your majority of Sunday league footballers... I imagine your mate himself would have been pretty handy!

5857~~~
He's torn apart 3 teams that employ a high pressing, technical approach in the last few weeks. I'd argue he struggles <i>more</i> when we play physical teams.

5858~~~
I know that technique isn't just first touch, I wasn't sure I said it was, sorry if that was implied. In United-focused discussions about Fellaini, it is also very much about chest-control.

I think Ravel is a fair example, because he ultimately didn't make it at United, and generally finds himself playing at a lower level of football than Felli, including spending much of last season in the Championship. This is an example of a player who is not less gifted than Fellaini.

As for point 3, that is probably right in most cases I would agree. I don't think that means that those who play in the PL are by default all technically superior. Chris Smalling would struggle in a PL midfield, but he has some qualities that mean, in the right conditions, he can be very good - those conditions being at centre-half. Likewise, Fellaini has also shown to struggle in the actual 'midfield' due to his technical deficiencies not allowing him to compete at such level of play.  However, his strengths, if used correctly, have shown to make him threatening further forward.

Wayne Rooney is far more talented than Inzaghi was. Both were top level strikers. The fact that Rooney is far more talented means that he can also play in midfield in a decent level. Despite the fact that he was a 'professional footballer', and a very effective one at that - Inzaghi  was probably not talented enough to play midfield at a level much higher than League 2.

5859~~~
Fair points - I do think your underplaying Fellaini's not so obvious strengths though.

5860~~~
Only one of these is actually good, and Arsenal managed him alright at the exception of 20mn.

5861~~~
Nah. When he's in the mood the guy is literally unplayable no matter what team.

5862~~~
It is. The most striking thing is their decision making, though. They just do the right things all the time without neccesarily looking extraordinary.

Still don't believe I'm any worse than Andy Carroll who is, in all honesty, the only notable player in PL's history whom I don't feel inferior to.

5863~~~
Fellaini's best matches for us this season have arguably been against the big sides. He is, and always has been a big game player. City tried to stick Toure on him and look what happened.

You almost sound like Fellaini is your fat girlfriend and you are embarrassed to take him out into the CL for fear that the other boys [teams] will laugh at you.

5864~~~
I still remember his 5 minute cameo when he came on for Liverpool against Chelsea at The Bridge a few years ago. The clip is knocking around on Youtube. There is nothing that will convince me that you could not find a non-professional who is able ot handle the ball better than that.

5865~~~
Lucky me, three different times you addressed me since my last post only a few hours ago!

So now in order to use the word 'hate' one must be younger than 16? Haters gonna hate!

And this post doesn't even make sense, I suggested Fellaini is better than those random blokes you play football with and better than league 2 level but now you are suggesting I said Fellaini is better than Iniesta, Hazard and Zidane…

Let's clear things up for you, make them a little more simple:

Fellaini is better at football than League 2 level and also he is better than those random blokes you play football with.

Fellaini is not better at football than Iniesta, Hazard and Zidane.

Now in your reply make more sense.

Andy Carroll couldn't do what Fellaini does in midfield, Louis van Gaal has stated he offers the balance needed with Carrick and Herrera in there. He does a lot more than 'height and nuisance' as you put it just a few posts back.

'bitching', Are you a 16 year old girl? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Have your irony back!

5866~~~
That works for every good player, Fellaini isn't peculiar. When Young is in the mood, he is unplayable, when Valencia is in the mood he is unplayable.

You are all overrating Fellaini, he is applying perfectly his scripted role (which is a great quality, players like that are extremely valuable like Park was), but he isn't alone Young, Blind, Mata, Carrick and Herrera, are doing great too.
Some of them are even better than Fellaini, I feel that we have been so unfair with Fellaini that some posters are going overboard in the other way.

5867~~~
They're in the Irish top flight. Which isn't saying much! My mate would have looked different class in a Sunday league side but never played for Dundalk's first team. So basically, yes, I agree with you.

5868~~~
And you sound like my fat girlfriend who thinks that I'm a mix between Brad Pitt(for the body) and Stephen Hawking(for the brain).

5869~~~
Go away Empire.

5870~~~
I've seen that. The look on Glen Johnson's face after another Carroll's bit of action<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. There was also a lengthy compilation of his performance for Geordies at OT (his last one for them against us). 

It contained a vast amount of some brutal acts of miscontrol and some sorry attempts at balance while turning with the ball. I initially thought it was made by our fans ridiculing him or something before I learned it was seen as a fabulous target man's performance by Newcastle fans who released it as an apparent 'textbook' game from him. Well, it was in a way.

5871~~~
He will not. Be prepared to be quoted for the next few months. He's coming after you!

5872~~~
People saying Fellaini's only attributes stem from physicality are harsh to say the least. He's got good technique for starters when he has the confidence. His controlled finish against Tottenham with his weaker foot was perfect. He also has an eye for goal and is mentally strong actually, again - when confident. He grasped the tactics as well and as Van Gaal said does what he's told and lets others perform magic.

5873~~~
Hang on I'm trying to make myself look smart? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I honestly don't care what posters on a forum think of me, I don't even care what those who I know think of me! Why would I come onto a forum and try to 'look smart', I mean what would I possibly get out of it?

I'm sorry but it is my opinion that uneducated people trying to survive in the developing world can be and probably are more intelligent than those with 'degrees', their intelligence expresses itself in a different way that's all. I don't consider myself smart, there is no such thing. It's a perception some people have, they think they are smart, I don't think they are.

Furthermore in response to Rozay's posts, I don't think I was right regarding Fellaini. I was a critic of his but despite Rozay and I both criticising his performances we disagreed over his ability, I maintained he was good enough for the premiership but he felt his level was more suited to league 2.

You can dig through my posts, that's fine, I also haven't said I don't like it so not sure where you've made that up from. I just found it funny you missed the point completely! And Fellaini has done enough to show he is good enough for the premiership even when he is moved on from United.

Knocked me down another peg eh? You and your love of missing the point! Last season Rozay states Fellaini performed poor and he knows random blokes he has played football with who are better, empire replies he has performed poor but is good enough for the premiership, you quote a post where empire states he'd rather have signed strootman, thiago or de rossi thinking it has relevance.

The purpose of these forums is to have a bit of fun and discuss football, that's all we are doing. Why else spend your time on it? Certainly not to 'look smart' I hope.

5874~~~
Haha. Not only that, we gain 30 yards, beat the midfield press and the opposition has Mata running at their goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5875~~~
The idea that Fellaini is 'not PL standard' technically or anything like that needs to die now. He clearly is up to it. He manages just fine when the ball is at his feet. Obviously he isn't perfect but he's more than adequate for the EPL, and would be fine in Europe I think.

5876~~~
I dont think I sound like that at all, but your statement does at least show some consistency to your delusion <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5877~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What delusion ? And I was joking.

5878~~~
How strong is he? Is there a single player in the premiershit that would actually outmuscle him? Are there anyone in the league that would beat him in the air?

I believe that he is the strongest player in the league, and that no one would beat him in the air. Not only is he 758cm tall but his jumping is crazy too.

I wonder if Vidic in his prime would've beaten him in the air?

5879~~~
His compatriot Big Ben would give him a run for his money, and regularly beats centre-halves aerially as opposed to pulling on to full-backs. Fellaini is a monster though, and confidence is definitely playing a part.  I remember last season there were games, I think Bayern at Old Trafford was an example, where he won nothing. Think it might have been Alaba out-jumping him all night.

5880~~~
The milan team we beat with park was nothing short of mediocre.

5881~~~
Are you actually mental?

5882~~~
The actual seperating factor when it comes to touch / technique between professionals isn't really the touch or technique in and of itself, but rather the speed with which the professional operates.

Sure, you could find tricksters and talented players with great touch / technique, but as anyone who's played football and moved at some point moved to a higher level at some point will attest to, the differentiating factor is the speed of thought and handling the ball.

And as such, it's pretty pointless discussing whether or not someone may or may not have "better" touchnique (see what I did there?) than Fellaini, because unless they've practiced at a very high level they would be completely lost no matter how silky their touch is.

5883~~~
Does this mean we should consider signing Gestede? He's a better Fellaini than the man himself, so why not?

5884~~~
Look obviously I don't think that Fellaini can perform in every single game and we've seen that already this season. Sometimes he just goes missing. But he may actually surprise you even against the best teams. It all depends on whether his teammates can get the ball to him. Personally, I and many other people on the caf believe that he can be a menace to even the best teams in the world in this form. Your preference for more technically gifted players is just that. A preference. What I like about this team right now is that we have a variety of weapons and teams just don't know how to cope with our team as a whole. Fellaini is a very important weapon to have even against the best teams.

5885~~~
You don't half come out with some barmy player assessments. If you're joking then I apologise in advance.

5886~~~
Thing is, when he came into the team early on in the season, he was arguably our MOTM against Chelsea and City, and that was when operating in a deeper role with more of a defensive job to do. He is absolutely a big game player, so I am surprised at people saying that against the big teams he wont cut it - the CL games are the exact ones where I would be starting him!

5887~~~
I won't be surprised by Fellaini, I actually trust him, I already said that his style wasn't my favorite but I rate him as a player.

Now he is a weapon, not an <i>important</i> weapon, he has been good for us this season but he hasn't been better(or worse) than half of his teammates. What I don't appreciate at the moment is how some of us are ridiculously singling him out as if his two other midfield teammates weren't as good as him (if not better; but that's subjective) and as if Young wasn't as good as him.

5888~~~
The bolded bit is pretty much exactly how I feel about Mata and Herrera.

5889~~~
Did you see Gestede vs livepool?

5890~~~
If we had most other managers at the helm I would be tempted to agree with this but I'm not sure this will be the case with Van Gaal and his desired end game.

Ferguson accepted that his team were never going to go to the Nou Camp and control possession of the ball. He would play the likes of Park to cause all kinds of nuisance against Pirlo at Milan. It didn't matter much to us, but we were usually the side that conformed to the identity of some of the bigger sides in Europe, particularly when the quality of the squad was on the wane.

I think Van Gaal is different. He'll want to go to Barcelona and Madrid and play his game. And I think he'll want the best players available to do that. Already, we're going to go to Stamford Bridge next weekend and it's likely we'll have the majority of the ball.

Fellaini is a fantastic option to have, and we're talking a little down the line here, but I don't think he will be a regular if and when Van Gaal gets the squad the way he wants it. I think he will want a better player on the deck. He'll be a great option nonetheless, however, which I can't stress enough.

5891~~~
I didn't, I've only seen the odd highlight of him. I just find it hard to believe that he's better than Fellaini at being Fellaini. One plays for Manchester United and Belgium and makes a difference in the Manchester derby and the other does not.

5892~~~
And I agree with you then, only Carrick and De Gea are undroppable or Irreplaceable at the moment.

5893~~~
Typical twiggy.

5894~~~
Then you should've, it was Fellaini 101. Made the pool defenders look painfully average in the air. 

The thing is Fellaini is relatively new to this target man stuff, he's originally a midfielder and we bought him to be just that. Sadly he didn't cut the grade there and we're now using his other qualities. You can see him at times when we're attacking that he isn't completely sure of where he's supposed to be or doing. 

Gestede is just as big and just as strong, but he's a more natural attacker than Fellaini. Has better movement and plays a better final ball. 

If he can put on a great performance vs pool for blackburn, then why couldn't he be a better player than fellaini?

5895~~~
Gestede is a striker who barely gets a regular game at championship Blackburn - comparing him to Fellaini (who plays in MIDFIELD for us!) is pointless on a whole variety of levels.

Fellaini did actually play a bit further forward yesterday than has been doing, but he is not a proper target man at all

5896~~~
What an odd post.

5897~~~
Ay, that's just bollocks.

5898~~~

5899~~~
It's been said but we are a fickle lot. He's gone from zero to hero but you just know the vultures will start circling again should he play a couple of bad games. Make hay whilst the suns shining Felli cause they'll be many who have got the 'I said he was crap' card ready to be played.

5900~~~
You could already sense it in the match thread yesterday after he lost possession a couple of times at the start of the game..

5901~~~
Fellaini is playing the exact same role he played in his 1st and last season for us.

5902~~~
Feel like the coaches have worked on him cutting down the elbows. The one against Demichelis was clearly accidental but in general he is using his arms to cleanly muscle people off the ball and isn't getting as many fouls called against him.

5903~~~
Don't understand the criticisms about his technique, he's quite proficient technically. Is he Hazard, no, but then again Hazard's technique level is there with Messi.

Fellaini falls into the unratable category because his skill set is unorthodox but he can provide an aspect to the game that no else can at level Fellaini has. 

Certainly he's limited in certain aspects but it's not like he's an idiot savant.

5904~~~

5905~~~
Baobob!

5906~~~
So happy for him, imagine how he felt getting a lot of the blame for last seasons failures. Now he's in with a shout of being our player of the season. He got his head down, worked hard and never folded. Now that's a sign of a true professional, and I can't see nobody laughing at him now.

5907~~~
From that preseason game when some bellends cheered him ironically and he scored a goal to this moment.

5908~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9804717/manchester-united-captain-wayne-rooney-praises-resurgent-marouane-fellaini" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...ne-rooney-praises-resurgent-marouane-fellaini</a>

Rooney praising Fellaini.

5909~~~
Bruno Mars would catch a grenade for you, but Marouane Fellaini could take it 
down on his chest and control it...

Saw this on Twitter earlier and made me chucke....probs an old joke but still makes me laugh.

5910~~~
Rooney's comments are interesting.

Usually teams who get forced to hit it long have to aim for a striker, who will be competing with two tall, strong central defenders to win the ball. So there's a big chance of conceding possession.

Thanks to Fellaini we can dink it forward to someone who will win almost every header and/or use his exceptional chest control to bring it under. Competing for the ball with midfielders, rather than defenders. That allows us to start our posession game again, only in a much less dangerous area of the pitch.

It's not something you see often. A weird blend of tiki taka and route one football. Very effective, though.

5911~~~
I rated him when he was at Everton. Still have the memories when he dominated our midfield and in the end was a reason we lost 1:0 against Everton. Then when the transfer came i jumped on the CAF train saying that we overpayed for him. It was kinda stupid spending 27m for him when he had a 23m buyout clause just a month before. And the fact that he didn't played a lot last season didn't helped so i, as many others, just wanted that we ship him out last summer.

I can't believe how big mistake that would be. When he is playing in this kind of form he is easily worth more than what we did payed for him. He is fast becoming one of my favorite players. A player who give everything for the team. It looks like that he is very nice guy too and that he really loves this club. I knwo we need at least one signing in midfield area this summer but i will be kinda sad if this would be at his or Herrera expense.

Hope he can do it again at the Bridge. I just hope from now on, when his form will dropp a little, that United fans will remember how good can he be and there will be no questions about his future at Manchester anymore.

5912~~~
Seen you post this a couple of times. Did you create this thread? No, so pipe down, peasant.

5913~~~
pft, t'was in a previous thread, long before his performances ever begin.

Heil ... err, I mean .. Hail Cina

This is literally just stuff that has popped up on my dashboard. A lot of it seems to be pretty lazy journalism, but it seems that in the last week the media have suddenly decided that Fellaini is the man in the spotlight, and that in itself I find quite interesting.

5915~~~
If only there was an award for the most ridiculous post on the forum...

5916~~~
There is the "most ridiculous posts of the week" thread (or something similar) in the general forum I believe. To be honest I would be surprised if the post you quoted hadnt already made it into there.

5917~~~
Just rewatched the City game. His performance against Yaya was amazing.

5918~~~
Was this a joke?

Edit - His turnaround is quite amazing. Just read some of the earlier pages of this thread and ol' Fellaini was getting so much abuse after that Swansea defeat.

5919~~~
Really chuffed to see that he has come through and proven himself. As many here have said. He simply adds another dimension to our game and gives us options. Long may it continue.

5920~~~
What did I just read?

5921~~~
I still enjoy reading the phrase "his exceptional chest". Makes me chuckle.

5922~~~
Jose knew how to handle him. You'll see that tactic again. We did it to him at Everton.

5923~~~
He's done well recently but he was an absolute passenger today. Second half was really poor.

5924~~~
Had a quiet game today. He will be back to his best against Everton I'm sure.

5925~~~
This. Not a chance he should have finished the match. Should have been pulled at the 60 minute mark (you can understand why Falcao was kept on with our injuries). Should have been AdM for Fellaini, with Mata going central.

5926~~~
Outplayed by zouma and matic today.

5927~~~
Louis van gaal should have countered, the counter tactics by Mourinho. But, it is understandable that a player of Fellaini aerial proficiency will always be a treat when on the pitch.

5928~~~
I'm probably his biggest fan on here - defended him all throughout last season. But.. I have to say, he was outplayed today. Don't think it's a big issue. We're still a recovering team and we'll have off days/players will have off games. In the long run I still believe he's essential to us.

5929~~~
I really can't.

5930~~~
They did a job on him

He still had some decent moments

5931~~~
Just shows how good he's been recently when the opponent sacrifices his team's ability to play the ball by putting a defender in midfield to counter his thread.

5932~~~
He had a quiet game absolutely, but that is because Mourinho set up his entire team around countering him [Fellaini].

We dominated the entire game, and make no mistake that a big part of that was due to Mourinho's negative tactics - like putting Zouma at CM.

Yes, this nullified a lot of Fellaini's game but it
a) Also nullified Chelsea's ability to retain possession and actually play football.
b) [Should have] created space for our other players. Our left side was once again where all of our most promising moves came from - can anyone seriously say that this was just a coincidence? 

To me it was obvious that Fellaini was occupying several Chelsea players, which freed up space for Young and Shaw to attack down the left.

5933~~~
They were all poor today. Chelsea were well organized. We had the ball. Couldnt do much with it.
Young was ineffective. Mata was ineffective. Ander made a few bad errors.

5934~~~
It seems RvP wasn't fit enough for even a 10 minute spell.

So for the sake of "balance", Rooney needed to stay in midfield.

Any idea where Wilson is? Injured?

5935~~~
Think Wilson was back in either reserves or u21s recently so he's probably gaining fitness. To be fair I'd put just anything up front, maybe even move Fellaini to #9 instead of keeping Falcao for so long.

As for Fellaini, as everybody has said so far, quiet game, still managed to make one or two chances (cross to Falcao in the box is the first one that comes to my mind), makes me wonder though why LVG didn't re-think everything when it was obvious since day one that Zouma will play and man-mark Fellaini, throw Matić on top and it's pretty much it.

5936~~~
Ferguson done it himself having Jones man mark him from midfield.

5937~~~
They muscled him out of the game and he doesn't really have the guile to counter that.

5938~~~
Zouma had his number all game. Don't quite know how he finished that game

5939~~~
I thought he was okay despite Zouma being put on him. He still had a couple of decent turns and a pullback or two. I think for the most part the extra attention just meant he wasnt going to get many shots away

5940~~~
Very poor performance. Just a bit more proof he shouldn't be a sure starter next season but a specialised squad option.

5941~~~
Same goes for Mata, ADM, Young and Rooney then as well I guess?

5942~~~
Can't lay too much blame on Fellaini he created two dynamic chances in the box. He was being shadowed around the field by Zouma.

Put a lot more on other players for failing to take advantage of the space

5943~~~
If Rooney is going to be used in central midfield like that, yes. Mata is similarly as toothless without Ander in proximity, and I assume Di Maria was chucked in to further your point, as he barely saw the ball in the 15th minutes he got.

5944~~~
To be honest given the line up Mourinho went with we should have countered that by playing Fellaini in the defensive midfield with Herrera further forward and possibly Di Maria in midfield with Rooney up front. May have  been a good time to have changed the system given how Fergie himself worked out how to nullify the Fellaini up front threat and it was always obvious Mourinho would start Zouma.

5945~~~
So we're fecked and need to buy new 4 attacking players who are of better quality than those mentioned above?

5946~~~
He's not going to come up against Zouma and Matic every game.

5947~~~
Mourinho got it right by sticking Zouma on him all game. Didn't he do the same in another game? May have been Spurs in the League Cup final.

Nothing went right for him, Chelsea just had all our attacking outlets closed down effectively.

5948~~~
If we are going to use Rooney in <b>central midfield</b> yes. An #8 is already on our agenda, as is another winger, who will rotate with Mata. Why four? I already touched on Di Maria and he will be key next season.

5949~~~
Zouma was on him 24/7 and by doing that he left so much space,space used by our CB,think if we had Carrick or Blind,we would exploit that space way better.

5950~~~
He set up good chances for Rooney and Falcao, and made some good clearances from their set pieces. But a below average game overall.

Rooney and Herrera should have made better use of the space he created. Mata too. Most of the time, we just elected to go for a shot from 25+ yards out.

5951~~~
I mention di Maria because I have no certainty that he'll be a key player next season, as it stands he can't really displace Young from the XI. Other than that, fair enough, can't see us spunking so much cash because if we're about to get players who are certainly of better quality than Mata, Rooney (even if we're talking about CM here), Fellaini and ADM(?) it will cost us feckloads of money.

5952~~~
He was ineffective, they did a good job on him.

5953~~~
Chelsea's tactics left us with a lot of space in midfield.  We just didn't have the midfielders available to take advantage of it.  If we had Carrick/Blind and Herrera isolated against Matic/Fabregas it could have been a much different game.  He had a decent enough game despite all of the attention he received.

5954~~~
I can't fathom why we didn't try finding him more often?

5955~~~
Maybe we could have switched him with Herrera for a bit. Herrera's energy could have split the defence up to allow Falcao and Fellaini/Rooney to take up spaces. We didn't really need a holding player as Chelsea were taking the game down to their tempo in possession.

5956~~~
I agree - Rooney and Herrera found themselves quite a bit of space in the middle, and likewise Young and Shaw got into some good positions on the left. Basically space opened up all around Fellaini, and only a fool would think that he had no part in that.

5957~~~
Agreed. Fellaini struggled a little for the first 10 minutes or so, and there was a period around the 80th minute where his head seemed to drop and he struggled for a while, but for the rest of the match he was creating significant space for everyone else in there. Even though he wasn't able to dominate in the air like he normally does, he played a good part in passing and movement and allowing us to keep such good control of the midfield.

Was it a great match by him? Of course not. But it certainly wasn't a bad match either.

5958~~~
Because Zouma. Chelsea were happy to let him try drift to the channels where he wasn't ever going to hurt them.

They set up to counter the Fellaini threat.

5959~~~
PhaseOfPlay has been saying for a long time that rival teams should man-mark Fellaini.

I think it was quite a bad performance from him today, but no harm on that. You can't always be Fellainho.

5960~~~
Was outplayed and out danced all day, you could say he was out Zumbad

5961~~~
Seemed like Zouma had permission to foul him at will.

I always think that if the opposition is playing such close attention to one of our players that they need to alter their tactics substantially to counter that player, it is already job done. As in, Fellaini didnt have a great game but I am not going to blame him when Chelsea set up to counter him specifically - it meant that other players around him should have been able to utilise the extra space etc, which they did not (or if they did, we as a team did not capitalise on it).

5963~~~
It would've made sense to switch the midfield around after a while -- Herrera-Mata was not longer there since Herrera was the DM and Fellaini had Zouma + Ivanovic. Putting him against Azpilicueta + Matic/Zouma would've been interesting.

5964~~~
I am not blaming him though. Just that I am saying that he wasn't good today (or was poor today), especially compared with some of his latest performances when he has been excellent.

5965~~~
Its fair enough, I just wouldnt have really expected much else today from Fellaini, given that Mourinho set out specifically to nullify him. Only the very best players in the world are going to be able to deliver in such circumstances.

5966~~~
Yeah I had hoped LVG might switch things a bit, give Rooney a run at Zouma and get Fellaini on the right against Azpi/Matic as you said.

5967~~~
Zouma stuck to him like glue - it was the kind of man marking job usually reserved for the likes of Messi and Ronaldo, which is a compliment in itself.

This is one of the reasons that Shaw got so much joy down that side though - you cant give so much attention to one player without leaving spaces elsewhere.

5968~~~
Should've had him off by half time. As the team dominating the ball, we need all our players to contribute to the offence, with the tactics set up by chelsea to counter his impact, he was hurting our play more than anything.

5969~~~
Perhaps, but I imagine if we had taken off Fellaini, Mourinho may have just rearranged accordingly. The better option would have been getting Falcao off, getting Rooney up front and put someone else into midfield (maybe Mata), let Fellaini act as DM if needed - its not like there was much defending to do in the second half.

5970~~~
Then chelsea would back themselves to pressure high up with the knowledge that 2 players in our back 3 are average on the ball. Get fellaini off, put Di Maria in midfield and let him penetrate that chelsea midfield. Reckon we'd have had more success doing that especially because Zouma would've then been a liability as he's not likely to stop someone as fleet footed as di maria in an open area. 

Keeping the ball that well without someone who can breach the midfield line is pretty pointless. Neither Rooney or Hererra have that sort of game so we, for large parts of the game were going backwards and sideways. Ball retention without purpose.

5971~~~
It's because they got used to playing with other people, for example maybe blind makes the sort of runs (which shaw doesn't) that can free up young to be more effective. Mata probably relies on carrick a lot. It's the trio of carrick herrera and mata. Carrick was such a big miss. Also don't know what januzaj was doing.

5972~~~
Di Maria's main weapon at the moment is pace. Pace is meaningless against a team surrendering 70% possession and happy to sit back in their own half for the entire game (especially after they scored).

5973~~~
He's actually still managed to set up two clear-cut chances (Rooney and Falcao), both in the box and without looking into stats I imagine that's more than any other of our offensive players today has done.

5974~~~
Its control of the ball at pace with extreme agility and footwork. He doesn't really use his pace and ability to go beyond the defence so he's effective even when sitting back, that's the main reason why he was the motm in last years CL final. Even today he managed to find a way to get through chelsea and end up in the box.

5975~~~
maybe he wasn't so effective but how about Mourinho planned to man-mark him with Zouma to avoid danger coming from him, that is why they didn't put another creative midfielder in and why they struggle, we destroyed them in possession and overall game despite unfortunate result.. so I guess his contribution was there, created one big chance for Falcao and one another chesting down the ball... also one good defensive header that all is not good enough but he was sacrificed soother player had space to play.. if we dominate games like this with opponents preparing only for Fellaini than I am confident he should start, because we could smash almost anyone, Chelsea got lucky and were as organized as it gets, not many teams could do that to win it eventually 1:0.

For me still definite starter and van Gaal also mentioned he likes to play players to play their former clubs..

5976~~~
Not his best game but he had it tough today with Matic/Zouma patrolling him. He wasn't poor though. Just not as effective as he has been lately. Same can be said about Mata who had Azpi rushing him all the time.

5977~~~
Unfortunately, for the most part this season his control has been poor, and he seems to simply be wanting to do a Jack Wilshere of just charging blindly into whichever opponent is in front of him and hoping he will come out the other side.

As <a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a> said, despite Zouma's attentions all game and Chelsea setting out to nullify him, Fellaini did still manage to create a great chance for Falcao, and the one for Rooney as well. He also made plenty of defensive headers and clearances - people today are undervaluing how important his height was when <i>defending</i> against a very tall Chelsea side.

5978~~~
Him being nullified wouldnt have been a problem if we had our actual starting line up imo. He was obviously being targeted by Zouma which means he could take an extra player out of Chelseas defence. But with a few of our players missing, we couldnt take full advantage on the other side (Mata/Herrera/Valencia was broken up) and thus couldnt exploit with Carrick to cover. Its a shame because hes going to have special treatment against him but at the same time, that allows space for others when we can take advantage (which we didnt fully today). Would have been interesting had we had all our players fit.

Did well defensively though.

5979~~~
I was thinking, with the injuries we had, and with everyone expecting Zouma to start in midfield... would it have been an idea to start Fellaini up front? Hindsight is a wonderful thing and all, but the big man up top would have completely nullified Zouma in midfield - as he would then have had to perform like an actual midfielder, which would have seen him fall down.

5980~~~
This. The attention Chelsea paid to him created spaces elsewhere for us which helped shaw and co.

Shame we couldn't get our delivery right a number of times. He himself had some nice chances to put a ball in. Needs to work on that. Can't always be the target.

5981~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what? What are you basing this on? One match?

Anyway, I thought he was below average. Basically the same as everyone else though. We were pretty blunted in attack all around. He had a couple of okay moments and I can see why he wasn't taken off. Without him our aerial presence is basically non-existent except for Smalling.

5982~~~
We seemed to have abandoned our use of Fellaini's physical attributes yesterday, perhaps as a way to outfox Mourinho's intent to neutralize him. Hope to see a few more long balls played to him against Everton.

5983~~~
No, based on watching him play for the last few years.

5984~~~
Id have liked to see a bit more of aerial balls from Young and Mata to Fellaini in these types of games. Fellaini can bring it down in dangerous areas for other players.

5985~~~

5986~~~
We must have been watching different games then.

5987~~~
I doubt it, he's a big physical force that bullies teams, big asset to have, but when that is cancelled out by two bullies then he's neutered because he doesn't have the skill, pace, passing invention or technique to counter that. I don't see why this is an issue, horses for courses.

5988~~~
Regardless of those chances, he did us more harm than good. We couldn't put enough pressure on that defence which would've caused them to wilt. We've seen throughout the season that this chelsea isn't as good defensively as some of Mou's teams in the past. We basically took a man out of our attack by having him on the field. We needed everyone involved and when we had the ball in controlled possession, he was irrelevant.

5989~~~
Just read that story <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5990~~~
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

Fellaini is obviously such a liability that Mourinho felt the need to sabotage his <i>own</i> side by playing Zouma in midfield specifically to counter him.

<i>"We took a man out of our attack"</i> even though in the post you quoted, I pointed out the Fellaini created two of our best chances.

<i>"More harm than good"</i> when Chelsea had adapted their tactics solely to deal with Fellaini. Take Fellaini out of the team and Chelsea/Mourinho's tactics change, and you are looking at a completely different game. You are just completely ignoring the context of the situation.

5991~~~
Yes, you're looking at a totally different game, one that I think we would be more likely to win than the one we engaged in. I'd back a hererra, di maria, and rooney midfield vs a combination of oscar, cesc and matic anyday. (Assuming he'd have zouma out of there once we made the change). 

The rooney chance he created was barely a chance. That leaves the Falcao one. I don't think him creating those chances makes up for how much he hurt our attacking play. We created very little throughout the match. We couldn't penetrate their midfield. Our major threat came from shaw which was quite sporadic. Basically job well done by jose's men.

5992~~~
Well, LVG evidently disagrees with your analysis. 
You say yourself that we created very little, yet we have listed two good chances that Fellaini created - how many did the other attackers make? 
This hasnt even touched on the defensive work he did against a very tall Chelsea team. Without Fellaini there, Chelsea would have been far superior to us in set piece situations.

Fellaini didnt have a great game, because Mourinho had specifically set out to counter him, and it worked. I agree that LVG should have changed the system, maybe drop Fellaini to DM or even push him up alongside Falcao - make Zouma unsure and uncomfortable. Either way though, some of the stuff you are coming out with here is just plain wrong, im afraid.

5993~~~
They created nothing cause our attacking play was poor for most of the game. Our midfield couldn't get its job done, which left our attackers with little to work with. He created one good chance. How many clearances did he make in set piece situations? What LVG thinks is irrelevant since what he though took us to a loss.  

So you agree that tactical changes would have been warranted but without your precious Fellaini being taken out, I'm I getting that right? He's of no use to us at the DM position as he's pretty average on the ball which means they could've then pressed and competed for the ball in midfield with some success. 

If we moved Fellaini to the DM, then all Zouma would've done is hold his position. Why not take him out and put di maria in thus making him even more uncomfortable trying to cope with a direct dribbling threat in midfield?

5994~~~
This is going round in circles. I already explained why I dont think it was a good idea to take off Fellaini;
1) He provides a defensive presence on set pieces against a very tall and powerful Chelsea side.
2) If we take him off, Mourinho can simply haul of Zouma and get them to actually start playing football again.

Your logic is flawed. If we moved Fellaini to DM and Zouma held position, then Herrera and Rooney would have had a field day running at Zouma through the middle. Taking Fellaini off on the other hand, not only weakens us at set pieces but allows Mourinho to simply revert to his/Chelsea's normal tactics - which in case you didnt notice, have won them the league.

5995~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5996~~~
1) So you think us being able to defend set pieces is more important than us winning the open play? 

2) Exactly, I'd back us to win against them if they try to play football instead of what they did. 

Your logic is flawed, rooney and Hererra don't have a great vertical game so regardless of who's there they aren't all that likely to go past him. Fellaini on the ball is a liability, so moving him to dm could've also caused chelsea to start pressing the ball know 2 of the central back 3 is average on the ball. These normal tactics of theirs led them to an embarrassing exit in the CL to PSG, its not foolproof. This current prem season has been poor, the teams they've competed against have had magic issues.

5997~~~
Point 1) The two are not mutually exclusive.
Point 2) You may back us to slug it out with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, but that doesnt make it so.

Your statements are getting more and more desperate - we are now at the level of "Fellaini on the ball is a liability", which is obvious nonsense. Perhaps its time to just accept that you really dont like Fellaini, and leave it at that.

5998~~~
Mourinho was Di Maria's manager and probably knows better than anybody how to shut him down, furthermore Di Maria himself has looked poor and sloppy in midfield. The fact that Rooney is not creative or smart enough to play the Carrick role has been established for years. The game was lost because of a defensive error and we weren't as good as we have been because Carrick wasn't playing balls in between the lines to Herrera/Mata/Fellaini. 

As others have said take Fellaini out and put Di Maria in and you'll probably see Willian tearing up the Shaw all game.

5999~~~
1. They are, as playing fellaini takes one ball playing option out of our team. 
2. Guess I believe too much in our team. 

He is, we all know he's limited technically, that should be obvious to anyone that's watched him play. Has nothing to do with me not liking him or whatever.

6000~~~
Yes exactly. He's been one of our top 3 players this season, but we need to replace him(In the starting 11) with a better technical midfielder for next season. He will still start and play plenty of games next season too no doubt.

6001~~~
Think LVG might think about taking him off, he's a red card waiting to happen. 

The refs given everything against him and has given him nothing.

6002~~~
They are playing him like a fiddle and the ref is buying into it, I think LvG might need to think about taking him off before he gets sent off.

6003~~~
Been poor, wondered how he would cope once teams started to target him again and based on the Chelsea game and today it's not looking good. He has to come off at half time, he will be sent off without a shadow of a doubt and that really will be game over.

6004~~~
What I don't get is, why for the second goal is he stood close to the near post yet we have Valencia marking Stones.

6005~~~
Playing poorly, lucky not to get sent off. I really hate it when players grab the ball just because they think they should have a free kick. Fellaini does it all the time, to do it when you're on a yellow is moronic. Needs to be subbed.

6006~~~
He is being fouled constantly and has had all decisions given against him. LVG should replace him because with the ref in this mood Fellaini won't be able to contribute in any way.

6007~~~
They frustrated him from kick off, and he took the bait. If we take him off and we become weaker on set-pieces, and no one on the bench has any sign of form, but if we leave him on he's a walking red card offering very little going forward. Damned with him, damned without him.

6008~~~
Our worst player in last two games, he is incredibly slow today at everything. He could also end up being sent off if they continue to buly him. Also, I don't think he complements Rooney at all, they are definitely far from great pair, we are missing pace there.

6009~~~
Not sure I would go that far...
He has fouled people yes, but I don't think he should have been sent off at all.

6010~~~
We are too dependable on him performing. Teams just attack him and the ref wont give him anything most times. Thats why he shouldnt be used every game, so many balls we give away because of that alone.

6011~~~
Handling the ball while the opponents are on the counter?

6012~~~
Pretty useless when he's not bullying opposition players or winning battles aerially, good player to have in the squad but clearly limited.

6013~~~
Unfortunate to be booked given that Barkley dived for it, but his first one was very rash and cynical, so you can't give him too much sympathy.

Still, he's getting nothing today. A few times he has fairly out-muscled his opposite number but been penalised.

6014~~~
Delighted he's gone off, it's not worth the risk. Smalling has to dominate the set-pieces in his absence now.

6015~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6016~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6017~~~
He was playing far too much like a man with something to prove against his former club. Had he stayed on, considering how this game has gone, I would say he would have seen red. He annoyed me today. He was playing like a complete idiot.

6018~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> All those games where Fellaini was great for us must have been torture for you. Happy times now tough, eh?

6019~~~
We looked a lot worse without him

6020~~~
It was an unfortunate game for him. The ref decided to not give him anything and he ended up getting booked after a dive from Barkley. After that he disappeared, probably so he wouldn't get sent off.

6021~~~
yeah, the 1st half was certainly a hell of a lot better. But it's clear the whole system falls apart without Carrick..

6022~~~
A lot of people jumped the gun labelling him one of our most important players and lauding him as a good signing, he has been much better but with that comes more attention from the opposition and he hasn't coped well with that in the two games where it has happened.

He has played well lately but we need to be aiming much higher and if he is playing week in week out we aren't going to win trophies same goes for the likes of young and Valencia.

6023~~~
Should have just kept him on tbh, and risked him getting a red.

6024~~~
They wound him up. They do it to Rooney all the time. I wouldn't say he froze but right call to change it.

6025~~~
No, they didn't. I praise him when he plays well*, I criticise him when he is playing poorly. It's just that he has become one of redcafe's precious darlings that you can't say he has been bad even when van Gaal hauls him off at half time. People like you are those who made people stop posting in this thread at all because you accuse someone of hating him as soon as somene says bad word about him.

*just two games ago:

6026~~~
No, it's just you who's talking utter shite if you think that he was our worst player in two games, there's nothing else I can say sadly.

6027~~~
That second half was a joke. Hopeless without him. At least we get it to him quick and we get the ball up the pitch better.

6028~~~
Poor as he was first half, I thin we missed him when he went off.

I can see why he was subbed, I imagine he'd have got himself sent off.

6029~~~
Didn't notice it to be honest. However everyone does that, referees do not book you for it.

Anyway, thought we were worse without him. He would have been handy getting on the end of a few of Di Maria's crosses.

6030~~~
Claiming he was our worst player in the last 2 games shows how much respect your judgement deserves...

6031~~~
Who was, in your opinion?

6032~~~
well, normally bringing on a striker would be a proactive move. But with Falcao this bad surely the risk of going to 10 with Fellaini would have been worth it? Going to 10 couldn't have been much worse.

6033~~~
Maybe Valencia for being at blatant fault for two goals? Even if you measure it in first half, he's at fault for second goal, shocking marking. How was Fellaini worse than, say, Herrera, Mata or Rooney for that matter? We've been fecking shit all over the pitch.

6034~~~
We were worse after he came off. Even when Fellaini ishaving a bad game, the threat that he provides gives us another dimension in our attack.

Also, if teams deliberately target him and try to send him off, the ref shouldn't be buying it so wholeheartedly.

At the moment, playing against Man United is a case of;
1. Mark Fellaini out of the game.
2. ???
3. Profit

Is it really Fellaini's fault if we are so over reliant on him that when opponents shut him down, we the rest of our players look clueless?

6035~~~
He's caught a case of Crouch-itis, where the ref will always call a foul against him because he's tall and therefore it must be his fault.

6036~~~
Well, certainly it can't be a new realisation for VG. Surely they should be working on their tactics on the basis that Fellaini will be targeted as a key player? It was all the talk in the leadup to the Chelsea game. Maybe get Fellaini to roam into different parts of the pitch, cause their targeting to work against them?

6037~~~
He shouldn't have been taken off. His attempt at a finish was woeful but he was getting into good attacking positions and causing problems. The imposter we replaced him with more or less killed the game altogether.

6038~~~
I agree - but I would attribute the blame to LVG for this scenario, not Fellaini.

6039~~~
I think he was a bit too wound up to put in a good performance and that showed in some of his challenges. He doesn't have a constant fight with gravity like his replacement though, and should not have been replaced for him.

6040~~~
But that's what I'm doing here. It's up to LVG to plan for Fellaini being targeted. It can't have been a surprise to him.

6041~~~
Good call taking him off before he was sent off as that seemed to be their plan.

6042~~~
Fair enough then, my original post was aimed that those complaining about Fellaini and saying he was one of our worst players in the last couple of games, due to the opposition specifically singling him out and man marking him.

6043~~~
Was it a good call, considering we brought on Falcao so we played with 10 anyway, and ended up missing Fellaini?

6044~~~
The occasion clearly got the better of him.

6045~~~
Taking him off was bringing on Falcao wasn't. I'd rather an unfit RVP play.

6046~~~
If he can't deal with being marked then he will rightly be dropped simple as that, teams re going to try and rough him up and compete physically but he has to good enough to still affect the game if he wants to stay in the side and so far he has failed. He was a liability today because he lost his head and had to be subbed off, whether we were worse or not is irrelevant because it's his own fault he got taken off.

Also he was replaced by falcao who was a waste of time so I don't think the key to us getting worse was fellaini, it's clear the player we really miss is carrick.

6047~~~
I think next game maybe, we should put him on the right. Let him move around a bit. Rather than sticking to the left.

6048~~~
At least he is not suspended for our next game now.

6049~~~
Also he looked like getting sent off against Liverpool at home, when he was on a booking. But came out making good tackles in the second half. 

I think we should have kept him on.

6050~~~
I agree that we missed Carrick today.

At the end of the day, teams will often identify the oppositions main threat and seek to nullify that threat, which is what Chelsea and Everton have both done with Fellaini.

It's all very well saying "Fellaini should deal with it" but to me the far bigger issue with that is that our team doesn't seem to have other threats. That has shown as we haven't scored a goal in the last two games, where a Fellaini was basically taken out of the game by opposition tactics.

To say that it is Fellaini's fault that the team is so reliant on him, is just lazy and skips over the underlying problems.

To see Fellaini getting similar ratings to Falcao and Blind for today's game is laughable, in my opinion, although practically nobody had a 'good' game.

It is also laughable to say that Fellaini 'lost his head'. Ridiculous statement. Everton were clearly targeting him and trying to wind him up, and the ref bought it hook line and sinker. It was probably the correct decision to take him off, but not because Fellaini was charging about making rash tackles, but because Everton players would deliberately try to get him sent off for nothing 'fouls' (and Marriner would inevitably oblige).

6051~~~
I said last 2 games, not just today's. Herrera was absolutely terrific against Chelsea, many people were delighted how he played last game, and today he's been one of our better players, I have no idea what are you talking about. Mata was decent over these two games, he was much better against Chelsea than Fellaini. Rooney has been bit better but fair enough, he did nothing special. I agree that Valencia was worse over last two games though, and that's about it, so definitely nothing laughable with suggesting that he was our worst player over last two games when you have case just for one defender being worse than him and one forward being on par with him.

6052~~~
People would be delighted if Herrera took a shit on a football pitch and started sliding on it. Mata was a lot better against Chelsea because he's had the room to roam around as Fellaini was man marked by Zouma the whole game and had to deal with Ivanovic, that's the whole thing about him, even when he's - probably according to you playing shit - he's still often locked out by somebody and there's more space on the pitch for others to exploit. When things go our way, the space is exploited, when they don't, matches end up like today's but for some reason it's Fellaini that's receiving the stick.

Oh yea, and it's laughable when you're suggesting that he was <b>the worst</b> player on the pitch just to admit two posts later that he actually wasn't.

6053~~~
He did lose his head, after being booked when the ref didn't give him a foul he tried to grab the ball on the floor, that would have seen him sent off right there, he couldn't deal with zouma, he couldn't deal with Everton players harassing him. That's going to happen more and if it nullifies his threat there is no point him being on the pitch, the jury is still out on him as a utd player and will be until he can overcome these kind of problems.

He was getting sent off if he stayed on today, anyone can see that, I also don't see how the team are reliant on him after just a few good games, carrick is far more important to the team than fellaini and it's not just because teams have stopped fellaini we have been beaten. Young was never going to maintain his form and teams have adapted to playing against us after our sudden improvement.

6054~~~
This.

6055~~~
That was 5 mins in and he settled into the game. 

Everton were playing to get him sent off from the first minute.

6056~~~
He didn't lose his head. He had one fairly standard foul against I think Coleman, and then got booked because the ref bought a fairly pathetic dive from Barkley.
After that (and the ref failing to recognise some obvious fouls against him) he looked to play safe and didn't really go in for any tackles.
Those aren't the actions of a player who has 'lost his head'. 

I actually agreed with you that he was likely to end up getting sent off, but if he got sent off, it would likely be from another Barkleyesque overreaction to a nothing tackle, not because he was charging about putting in two footed tackles.

Carrick is obviously an important player but he doesnt do much in the attacking third. We have failed to score in the last two games and I don't see how Carrick would change that.

I can't really be bothered arguing this anymore, suffice to say that if you are truly so convinced that Fellaini isn't actually that important, then please explain to me why both Everton and Chelsea - when playing at home - both saw fit to specifically nullify Fellaini rather than any other players. And why as a result of that, we failed to score in both games.

6057~~~
We're so reliant on him it's frightening. 

Our great run came when he was bossing it. In the last 2 games our opposition have set up to nullify him and not only have we lost both but we've looked completely toothless.

6058~~~
Was really lucky not to get sent off by the way. Tried to grab the ball after he thought he was fouled when already on a yellow.

6059~~~
Well if he is so good and so important how can he be stopped so easily? If someone is a threat and you can stop that easily it's stupid not to, teams have also dealt with mata and young last couple of games, it's something all three have to dealing with.

He wasn't putting I two footed tackles but he was complaining and struggling to cope with Everton looking to get him sent off, that will encourage more teams to do the same, he may well have got sent off for doing nothing but he would have been just as likely to leave his foot in or swing an elbow.

Carrick gets the ball forward quickly and has range of passing that opens up the attacking third and encourages runners, blind doesn't so I think it's really strange to claim he wouldn't have changes anything.

If fellaini is going to be a key player going forward, which I don't think he will be, he will have to deal much better with how teams have played against him in the last stop games.

6060~~~
Don't know, we could ask Jones when he was marking Ronaldo/Bale out of the game.

6061~~~
Look I'm not being critical just stating a fact, if he cant be effective when teams make plans for him he will get dropped and he has been too easy to shut out, that might change going forward but there is a big difference between being a key player in a handful of games and being a key player regularly. So far fellaini is the former and we will see if that changes or not.

6062~~~
The ref offered him absolutely no protection from Evertons tactics, which didn't help proceedings, and Fellaini's disciplinary record with us has generally been very good - as <a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a>  said there have been other times when he has been booked early and still finished the game by being very well disciplined.

Carrick doesn't offer much in the final third is what I said, and I stand by that. Carrick is a very important player for us, perhaps our most important this year, and whilst we missed him today, I do not think he would change the fact that we failed to score (unless you want to argue that playing him instead of Rooney in midfield vs Chelsea would have allowed us to play Rooney up front etc...).

In my opinion the best way to counter the opponents nullification of Fellaini, comes from LVG tweaking the tactics, which we have seen that he is very reluctant to do. Against Chelsea I thought we should have perhaps moved Fellaini either forward or backwards, change things around as Zouma. It has been one failing of LVG recently that he is not prepared to make changes if our tactics are not working.

Fellaini IS a key player for us at the moment, like it or not (most go for 'not' I wager). The problem for me, ironically, is the lack of a plan b (ironically because this was often one of the accusations thrown at Fellaini himself). Opponents know that if they can nullify Fellaini, we don't really seem to be able to create much, and this has shown in the last two games.

6063~~~
This was a point I was going to make - in the World Cup, Mohammed Besic marked Messi out of the game when they played. Does this mean that Messi should have been dropped or upped his game?

We have used the same tactics used with Jones and Park on occasion. If a team sets out with a deliberate plan to stop a specific player, then it will usually succeed. To say what <a class="username" data-user="87150, @Roboc7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87150/">@Roboc7</a> is saying that Fellaini simply needs to be better at not being nullified, is a bit daft.

6064~~~
Jury is still out on him, he could easily be left out of the side after his last two performances, I won't regard him as a key player until he performs consistently over a longer period, personally don't think he is capable of staying in the team long term but if he is then I won't have a problem.

I don't think there is any point dropping him deeper because he gets worse the further back he goes and the manager won't want to keep changing team round just because fellaini can't cope with being marked, mY e LVG should do more but same goes for fellaini.

I still think it's ridiculous to say we wouldnt have scored if carrick played in both games, he clearly has a positive effect on the team and that can't be dismissed.

6065~~~
It's actually pretty tough for me to make out what his point really is. Fellaini despite being marked out of the game against Chelsea was still doing good job, not as good as against say City or Tottenham but he still wasn't anywhere near bad and he was playing with Zouma on his back.

And I don't really get the 'being a key player regularly' thing really, what does it mean? We've got enough players with quality for one to be the key man in a certain match if the other one's failing, you won't have Mata being a key player every match, won't have Herrera, Young, Rooney, di Maria being one, but there will be games when one of them will pick things up and win the game nearly on his own. In last two matches we just lacked the player.

6066~~~
Daft, seriously? What's dafter is just accepting fellaini can't have a positive impact because the opposition plan to deal with him, if that's the case then why play him and that is exactly what LVG will think.

6067~~~
This is true enough. My argument is simply that if the opponent dedicates a player or two to nullifying one of ours, then it opens up space that the other players *should* be able to exploit.

6068~~~
He still can have an impact - he is one of our biggest assets on set pieces both offensively and defensively, and his very presence forces the opposition to change the way they defend. We saw today that after Fellaini went off, Everton were happy to just defend the centre of the pitch and let us cross the ball, because we had no proper aerial threat.

I think you are way, way off the mark with "what LVG thinks" by the way. If I were LVG I would be asking questions of Mata, Young and Herrera as to why they don't seem to be able to create anything or have a positive impact despite NOT being given special attention by the opposition. If they could, then it would change the dynamics of the match because it would no longer be a case of "nullify Fellaini = nullify United".

6069~~~
As soon as he gets nullified that's a problem and it's not as simple as saying it opens up space for others, if it takes two or three it would but it hasn't taken that many. In recent weeks he has been important because he has bullied players and teams just haven't coped, so inevitably every team we face will do what Chelsea and Everton did because he hasn't had an answer.

If he doesn't deal with that he will be dropped and will be used as a plan B again which teams won't be as prepared for, that's not a criticism it's just a fact, the team isn't going to be rearranged to suit him.

6070~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so hilarious, and so true.

Completely agree with your post too.

6071~~~
There will be questions over those players as well but I think you grossly over estimate the importance of fellaini, LVG found a way to use him, teams have stopped it, if fellaini doesn't change that he won't play. LVG will be thinking of players who offer different threats if fellaini can't respond, he is not going to just keep picking fellaini, I think that is pretty obvious.

6072~~~
He has done extremely well this season, would love for him to stay, i just have this feeling that cashing in on him would be the right thing to do this summer, he deserves to be a starter and if we cant provide that role for him next season then we should seriously flirt with the option of letting him go for a huge amount.

6073~~~
You are so convinced that LVG is going to drop Fellaini, but your confidence is misplaced I fear.

Again if I was LVG, and teams are setting out to nullify one of my players, then I am probably thinking that that player is obviously doing something right to warrant that sort of attention from the opposition.

So OK, the last two games Fellaini has been successfully nullified by the opponent. Are you not concerned that in the meantime, the likes of Herrera, Mata, Young and Rooney have failed to do anything in the meantime? Is that Fellaini's fault as well?

The reason that nullifying Fellaini has been so effective is due to the lack of threats from our other players. If we had someone else consistently playing well and creating chances, it would make the opposition think twice about singling out Fellaini as the main threat that needs to be contained. As it is, that is not the case, because we have failed to score in two games where Fellaini has been nullified.

So sure, going forwards other teams will have seen how well this has worked and probably replicate the tactics that Chelsea and Everton have used: nullify Fellaini and United can't create anything. That isn't a problem with Fellaini, that is a problem with the other players who are failing to produce anything.

I did really like <a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a> 's analogy of the cafs love affair with Herrera though, and agree completely and would also maybe even extend it to Mata.

6074~~~
Yes I am convinced because it will happen if he performs as he has done the last two games you are too blinkered to think otherwise it's just a fact. LVG will be considering dropping one or two from mata, young and fellaini for the next game based on their last two performances, Rooney and Herrera as well possibly but there aren't many alternatives to those two.

It's true there is a lack of threat from other players but the lack of threat from fellaini also affects them so you need to apply your argument to him as well,  those three playing behind the striker have been too easy to stop. Full backs have stopped mata and young too easily, fellaini has been shut out too easily, time will tell now if they can overcome it but with the resources available in the summer others will come in if they can't respond.

The fault lies with all of them because they have to play well over a long period of time not four games, Chelsea are top because they have players who perform for longer than just a few games, I would be surprised if all three of young, mata and fellaini start the next game.

It's a big problem for fellaini because if a simple plan stops him the manager will try someone else there who the opposition might not stop, he won't be as accepting as you.

6075~~~
Ok then Rafa.

6076~~~
Only real criticism i have is he needs to be hitting the target with his chance at 1-0. Thats a game changer right there. Game would have gone the way of us vs City then imo.

6077~~~
MaFa was too emotionally jacked up for this game.  I don't begrudge LvG starting him, but a talk with him at halftime might have worked.  After all, we were going to be reduced to crossing all the time as the game wore on.

6078~~~
Fellaini has been brilliant for us........didn't really get into the game, probably because the Everton players know him so well.

6079~~~
Valid point, I agree.

6080~~~
Yea, it was a very bad miss imo. Could've as well squared it to Mata who was getting into position.

6081~~~
Dont blame him for not passing. Pretty much one on one with the keeper. in fact he sent Howard the wrong way, he just got under it (leaned back) when he didnt need to. He rushed it (maybe because the defender was closing down on him). Its a shame as I didnt think overall we were as bad in the first half as many have said. Two defensive mistakes aside.

6082~~~
When you think about it objectively you will know I'm right, it's pretty obvious after all.

6083~~~
Yup, no use arguing with fachts. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

6084~~~
Maybe your right and LVG will be thinking it's the fault of every other player fellaini was less effective and it's impossible to expect him to do anything if one player is tasked to stop him. But seems much more sensible fellaini will be expected to do more and will be dropped if he can't just like young, mata and maybe some others.

6085~~~
Personally I find it more sensible to replace the players failing to create when the opponent ISNT singling them out for special attention, than the one who is failing to create whilst being specifically marked and countered by the opposition.

6086~~~
One of SAFs golden rules used to be to "play the game and not the occasion. Fellaini definitely let the occasion get to him today.

Despite that though, I could only despair when I saw Falcao warming up. However little Fellaini was contributing, it was always going to be more than anything Falcao could muster up.

6087~~~
Fellaini is one of those failing to create, mata and young have been nullified as well, teams are paying closer attention to them. Let's be honest Everton didn't play someone to mark him they just didn't allow him to bully them. All three will quite rightly be under scrutiny now in terms of starting the next game.

6088~~~
Even if we subscribe to your belief, the fact remains that Fellaini adds another dimension to our attack, provides a threat on set pieces, and is an excellent defensive asset when defending set pieces.

For these reasons, he provides a threat and a contribution that our other attacking players do not, and therefore would be the last player (out of the attackers in question) that I think should be replaced.

6089~~~
What it shows is while Fellaini is kept quiet the others are not doing their jobs either. Mata against Chelsea and Everton was pretty crap to be honest, Young too wasn't that effective but he had 2 on 1 situations quite often. I feel the movement from the wings is too predictable at the minute, they both stay wide and don't move off the flank, they should be coming inside and making runs through the channels every now and again, let the fullbacks push up higher and be the width when required.

6090~~~
Yeah, that has been pretty much the point I have been trying to make.

6091~~~
He feel completely into Everton's trap today. Which is a bit ridiculous as Pineaar basically came out this morning and told the whole world that they were going to try and get him sent off. And he still feel for it.

6092~~~
Yep. While the long ball to Fellaini had been working well and then allowing us to build up the pitch quickly, when that option isn't available we just lack idea's massively.

At present we remind myself of Arsenal from a few years back, when they lacked any real flair and relied upon RVP.

6093~~~
The ref fell for it more like. Apart from the 1 dodgy kick on Mccarthy they just proceeded to basically fall over whenever Fellaini went near somebody. The crowd shouted and screamed and Marriner basically bent over backwards to try and get him in trouble, it was pathetic really.

6094~~~
He really didn't help himself though.

6095~~~
True but then he was only giving what he was getting. Everton were going in hard and trying to push him around, but because of his size it doesn't seem like that. As soon as he gave anything back they fell over and cried like babies. No wonder LVG took him off as he wouldn't have lasted whether he did anything or not.

6096~~~
I still cant quite get on board with this argument. It seems like I was watching a different game, because again - I didnt see a frustrated, angry Fellaini stomping about looking like he was about to put his elbow through someones forehead. I saw a lot of sneaky tactics from Everton (such as Barkley's dive which got Fellaini booked) and exaggerated reactions from nothing-tackles.

Basically I dont agree with these comments that Fellaini "took the bait" or "fell for it" - he made one standard foul against Coleman, then the ref bought a pretty blatant dive from Barkley (this was virtually identical to Herrera vs Chelsea, and Fabregas today). After that, Fellaini was always on thin ice and with the ref giving every single marginal foul or 50/50 to Everton, yes he was in danger, and Van Gaal probably did the right thing in taking him off. But I attribute it to Marriner, and not Fellaini - the ref fell for every trick Everton played, and undoubtedly would have sent Fellaini off as soon as he committed any other foul (undoubtedly accompanied by a lot of emphatic gesturing from Everton).

Thank god that someone else saw it this way.


Certainly in the match day thread, everyone was happy to criticise Marriner - and rightly so - it seems like a bit of rewriting history now when people go back and say that Fellaini had "lost his head" and similar comments.

6097~~~
Has anyone else noticed this in other matches as well? Its been annoying me lately and today Marriner just went crazy with it. Fellaini can literally do nothing and somehow give away foul. Any aerial challenge the opposition can just fall on the ground and it will be a foul because it is Fellaini. Its a joke, you are allowed to tussle for a ball in the air, just because Fellaini is stronger than his opponent doesn't make it a foul. When the ref starts acting an eejit like today he is basically taking Fellaini out of the match. What is he supposed to do when he is being called for doing nothing? Did every one of our corners end up with a free kick out?

6098~~~
Why do people keep saying he was man marked today? From what I saw he wasn't marked entire time no more than our any other player, most of our players run into block of Everton players every time they had to attack in final third, same happened with Fellaini, only he is less comfortable in tighter spaces and slower on the ball than the likes of Mata and Herrera so it was more obvious. He was only marked tighter than other players when we played long balls to him.

So you agree that he was shit but you are explaining the excuse for him being shit? The part about Herrera is just ridiculous and explains your bias.

Worst, or second worst, not really big difference.

6099~~~
I think it is a big difference, because I bet you didn't go into the thread of whoever was worst and criticise them. If you did, ignore this post. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

6100~~~
1. No, I don't think he was shit, that's the thing, no idea where you've got that idea from though. I've said that probably according to you he was shit, which he was not. I've said that even when he's man marked he's still giving options to other players. When he's nullified like he was against Chelsea, it's in other player's duties to try to exploit the space that has opened up. 

As for my 'Herrera bias' there's hardly any. I think I've got more MOTMs for Herrera than I have for Fellaini this season but what I've said perfectly reflects attitude of some people towards him, he can't do anything wrong in some eyes, even when he's having an average/shit game (just like everybody else) people will still praise him for nothing (or try to advocate his dive against Chelsea for some reason). 

2. There actually is. Time to make up your mind.

6101~~~
My concern with Fellaini is that teams will be better suited to play against him next year. I'm not saying they will all go out and buy someone that can do a job on him, but they will be better prepared to neutralize the threat I think.

As useful as it has been the last 10 games or so, I really do hope that we phase him out of the first team next year.

6102~~~
I didn't, I gave up on Valencia long time ago. It's not even interesting to crticisize him anymore. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Now you are talking about Herrera's dive, in a thread where people were justifying Fellaini's 124 fouls in one half.

I didn't really count defenders when I said it, so my bad for not explaining it.

6103~~~
No, I'm actually explaining what my analogy about Herrera meant as you've accused me of being biased, I can't believe it's that hard to understand. And he's had 4 fouls, one of which was Barkley's dive after which he got the yellow. Two fouls were 'what' fouls in the box during corners which were even commented as 'what the feck is the ref doing' during the matchday.

6104~~~
He got "found out" I think. Unless he can not adapt and find new ways, it will be very difficult for him

6105~~~
Well he has been coping perfectly fine since his time at Everton? And he has been playing largely a similar role as he did for them.

6106~~~
This. its not that he was found out at everton and just stopped playing well there...

6107~~~
When he's not even winning headers he really is a pointless footballer. Caught offside because he was ball watching so many times as well. Obviously not his fault that LVG thought it was a good idea to play him as a lone striker with RVP and Rooney on the pitch though.

6108~~~
Why did we just not play him down the left? We didn't try it once.

6109~~~
Can't blame him really. LVG set him up top to win headers and he did his job.

6110~~~
Was better in the second half when moved to a pure target role.

6111~~~
The only way this sodding side can create anything is hitting it into him in the box or aimless long range efforts.

6112~~~
Would have left in midfield and done something crazy like play rvp and Rooney as a front two

6113~~~
Even when he played in midfield today, I can't fecking understand why would you move him to the right side when the trio of him, Blind and Young looked pretty good when they played together and their link-up play is simply better due to fact that they've played that setup before.

6114~~~
You can't blame him for offering nothing to the attacking build up whatsoever? His first half performance was just as bad, if not worse, than anything we seen from him last season.

6115~~~
I almost feel sorry for him, for want of a better phrase, as when the rest of the team are as bad as that he stands out like a sore thumb. He should be a distraction tactic, freeing up space for other players in attacking spaces by drawing their biggest centre half out of position for them to exploit. Making him Plan A when half the side is being played out of position and the main man upfront hasn't played in months achieves absolutely nothing.

6116~~~
He was poor. Did a nice turn to get off the defender for the possible penalty but was easy to mark as he was an out and out forward there rather than getting into pockets of space like we've usually seen. Felt he was off the pace and should have been taken off.

6117~~~
Terrible idea to play him up top, he just got in the way and was constantly offside.

6118~~~
Was left stranded today.

6119~~~
What I dont understand is why we had Fellaini in their box for most of the first half, but didnt actually try to cross the ball. The amount of times Valencia and Mata just cut in and played the ball back inside to Herrera rather than swinging in a cross, it was like watching Barcelona (the bad parts).

He was better in the second half playing as a striker, and gave their CBs something to worry about.

Even so, because of the presence he offers on set pieces (attacking and defending), I think he is a very hard player to sub off. You take him off and then when you are chasing the game in the last 10 minutes you regret it because you want someone who can get on the end of long balls. Or on corners etc.

6120~~~
Played the ball well plenty of times but when you're playing RVP and Rooney in withdrawn midfield roles who does LVG want to get on the end of them?

6121~~~
That's one of the problems in starting him, it becomes extremely difficult to take him off no matter how ineffective he has been.

6122~~~
Yup. Its a tricky one, but I can see why he normally finishes games.

6123~~~
Seems to have gone off the boil, should try Rooney in his position if RVP plays uptop again next game.

6124~~~
Whats the point of him in these kind of games? He offers nothing at all.

6125~~~
How many of our shots did he actually blocked/fecked up by being offside this season? I reckon it will be a huge amount, I remember some, certainly more than he scored.

6126~~~
Reverted to type.

Hopefully, he doesn't have a long term future here.

6127~~~
His best form came about playing on the left supported by Young and Blind. I'm not sure why LvG changed that tactic. I do agree he should not be a starter or long term solution. I'm not sure what roles best suits his qualities. The coaches also seem to be confused with assigning him with different roles over the last 2 seasons.

I hope United consider selling him this summer whilst his stock is high.

6128~~~
He was doing well on the left until LVG started tinkering again.

6129~~~
His position yesterday, to the right in a more orthodox central midfield spot, suggests to me that Van Gaal tried to change it up after Fellaini got found out at Chelsea and Everton.

Thing is, he's barely average as a central midfield player. His continued inclusion against WBA smacked of conservatism - why not go for a dribbler in the AdM or Januzaj mould?

It was clear as day that WBA would be physically up to the task of dealing with aerial balls and that they'd sit in waiting for us to break them down. With that context, not sure how Fellaini was deemed to be a good pick.

As you say, he's done enough this season to justify a decent fee from someone wishing to buy him. He's not right for us - never has been.

6130~~~
Big mistake putting him striker. The CBs found it easy to pick him up then because he was right on top of them. He started on the right, but I don't know why we didn't try him on the left yesterday.

6131~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what nonsense.

Not sure why he was moved up front, RvP was at least looking semi-dangerous in that first half. Anyway, he was basically the same as everyone else on the pitch. The whole team was average.

6132~~~
It's not nonsense. He's not and never has been the sort of player we should be looking to. He's good enough in a certain type of system to have an impact, but it's not what we should be aspiring to in the long run.

6133~~~
Yet he looked good enough when we were playing Spurs, Liverpool and City off the park? That system seemed to work just fine for everyone. He's certainly contributed more than Di Maria, yet people constantly plead for him to start. It's just strange that Fellaini is the whipping boy after a bad performance. It's fine though, a lot of people knew that it would happen after his form dropped the slightest bit.

6134~~~
Not sure why you're bringing Di Maria into this. He's rightly been sat on the bench and you won't find me arguing with that.

Fellaini did very well in the matches you mentioned, when we set up with very specific tactics that played to his strengths. As soon as teams have cottoned on to him (Chelsea and Everton) or when Van Gaal has moved him into a more orthodox central midfield position, his effectiveness has plummeted.

He's a useful player to have around, but as we look to develop, I would hope he's phased out of contention.

6135~~~
That's why I mentioned Di Maria, because you were saying he should be starting.

I don't think two matches is enough to say teams have cottoned on to him. We played fine against Chelsea anyway, even with him being quiet. There was no need for van Gaal to shift him around so radically I don't think.

6136~~~
Thought he did well as striker. We could play the ball in to his feet and he shielded it effectively. Turned the CBs a couple of times and allowed us to advance our position into their box. Sure the CBs could "pick him up", but they couldnt do anything about it.

6137~~~
My concern with Fellaini remaining at the club is that LvG always reverts to just lumping the ball up to him when we are chasing a game and, by large, that hasn't been too successful.
I'm not his biggest fan and he doesn't seem to offer anything than being a target man and a fairly poor one at that.
Can't see any other top class manager keeping him if he came in but LvG seems to love him.

6138~~~
I think he will be relegated to situational squad player next year once we buy a top midfielder and attacker. He will come in handy in various situations that require a more physical/aerial approach against different opponents.

6139~~~
Regardless of his performances prior to the game yesterday, this guy is miles away from the team technically. Yes we can lump it up to him in desperate situations but he showed in the first half if we're expecting him to play intricate football then he's not up to it. 

As for putting him up front, I found it quite worrying. Surely leaving Van Persie up top and bringing on more creativity behind him in the form of Januzaj or Di Maria would have been a better option, if only aesthetically.

6140~~~
Fellaini will always be useful in certain games so id rather we keep him. He is a very good squad player and a great option to bring off the bench when our plan A isn't working. We didn't really need his physicality yesterday though.

6141~~~
In fairness, what I said was that we should have started a player in the Di Maria or Januzaj <i>mould </i>- i.e. a dribbler.

Generally speaking, Di Maria can have no complaints about being on the bench.

6142~~~
But what I dont understand is that we have better players for his position yet he's still picked. He can play a specific role in a specific set up but only in selected games. Once he's taking care of by an opposite player, he doesnt find another way and stops contributing

6143~~~
I honestly believe the people who think he will just be a squad player next year may be in for a shock. He is arguably one of the first names on LVG's teamsheet.

6144~~~
I don't really remember, has he ever had a good game for us when he played no.10 or as a striker?

6145~~~
We better be prepared for shithouse football for the majority of the season then

6146~~~
By the same logic, Di Maria can purchase a warm blanket and some cocoa because he is going to spend the winter on the bench.

6147~~~
More the point, we had better be prepared for shithouse posts in the Fellaini threads.

6148~~~
We've played good football with Fellaini in the team so this is bollocks.

The blame lies squarely on our tactics and by extension on Van Gaal. Why do we revert to hoofball whenever we're under pressure to score a goal? We did that against Swansea as well. Played well for most of the game until they scored and then inexplicably resorted to playing hoofball. I can understand reverting to it with a couple of minutes to go as a last resort

6149~~~
If we get a half decent offer for him in the summer he has to go. He just looks awkward playing in midfield.

Imagine going into the Champions League with him starting regularly.

6150~~~
We played good football against teams who seek to actually attack and play positively, which is about 5 sides in the league. The rest are content to sit deep where we need creativity and players with technique in tight areas to thrive. The propensity for hoof is innate when Fellaini is in the side. That's why he must be a reactive squad/sub option or sold.

6151~~~
Then we better prepare ourselves for long term mediocrity.

6152~~~
Who was good for us against Chelsea and Everton? As far as I know, everyone's effectiveness was 'plummeted', not just Fellaini's. I mean, where was Herrera, Mata, Rooney, etc?

6153~~~
No, no, it was all Fellaini. Get with the program Walters.

6154~~~
Of course, ye. Silly me.

6155~~~
Precious.

6156~~~
I'm going to quote this post again after he scores a huge game-winning goal in a knockout game of the CL next season <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

6157~~~
#spacegoat

6158~~~
Feel free. If we play any of the better sides in the Champions League he won't even get a kick of the ball.

Look at how he played vs Bayern.

6159~~~
You do remember that he was our MotM when we played Chelsea in the first half of the season? And generally his best performances have all been in the big games this year?

6160~~~
In these last 2 days of CL, I've failed to see where would Fellaini fit in any of those teams.

6161~~~
Needs dropping for Palace, only bring him on if we get desperate...... sick of the sight of him tbh.

6162~~~
Come off it man. Look at the Juve v Madrid, and Bayern v Barca games.

He'd be so out of place it's unreal. We used to be a top 4/6 side in Europe under Ferguson, and now we are so far behind its unreal. That's the level we should be aiming to be at.

6163~~~
He wouldn't. But then again, not many of our players would.

Far too much mediocrity at the club.

6164~~~
Exactly. Peoples standards have dropped significantly.

We went from being one of the top sides in Europe, with some of the best players, to regularly playing Ashley Young, Fellaini, Smalling, Blind etc.

People are ok with this as well. Completely mind boggling. If we were to play Barca or Bayern in the CL next year, they'd take 6 off of us.

6165~~~
Yep and it's enough to make you cry.

Barca & co are all playing this beautiful football going for the biggest prize there is, and we are left fretting about how we can beat Crystal Palace on Saturday just to get into the pre qualifiers for the dam thing!

6166~~~
Yep people are far too happy with mediocrity at the moment. The over the top praise of Ashley Young in recent weeks demonstrates that. There's no reason for us to be so far off the pace of the powerhouses of Europe, even allowing for transition and rebuilding. Not denying Ashley Young has done a pretty good job turning things around, but try and imagine him as a starter in that Barca team tonight, linking up with Messi and Suarez and Neymar and it's hard to keep a straight face. Same goes for a few others, not just to be picking on Ashley.

6167~~~
Our transfer record, post Ronaldo, is absolutely horrendous.

6168~~~
This. All four are currently better teams than us. It's not just Fellaini who won't be in the team if we get back to that level.

6169~~~
Ironically enough, I think Bayern could have done with a good outball like Fellaini tonight. Barca's high press pinned them back and they were forced to punt the ball upfield time and time again, instantly forfeiting possession.
You can talk about Bayern but they lost 3-0 and it should have been more, given how many chances Barca fluffed in the opening 15 minutes.

As I said, Fellaini is very much a big game player, and not every single player can be a Lionel Messi. Even the mighty Barcelona have seen the need to invest in a little bit of physicality with the likes of Rakitic and Suarez, and they are one of the greatest club sides of all time with one of the best individual players of all time. We can aim at that level all we like, but you and others need to face the fact that it simply may not happen - we had the class of '92, Barca had the class of.... '05 or whenever it was. Would I like for the footballing gods to bless us with another team like that? Sure, but in the meantime it is a ridiculous attitude to think we can simply buy that level of success over the course of a muppet summer or two.

As others have stated, very few of our players would make the Barca first eleven, and personally I think that sort of side is primarily the product of years of careful development - which our current team has not had - than simply trying to fill the team with superstars (see Di Maria and Falcao).

Pep may not want to have a Fellaini in his team, but I bet Mourinho would.

6170~~~
Overall he has had a good season and if we get a bid of around £15mill or more we should move him on.

6171~~~
Had a great season and has got us into the top 4 contention with his performances, can still be a very useful squad player but for what we paid for him that isn't good enough. He has been sussed out in the last couple of games and LVG needs to realise this.

6172~~~
I agree. If you look at Fellaini's stats, he has 6 goals and only 2 assists. That's just not good enough for an attacking player and he wouldnt get into any other top team in Europe

6173~~~
Won't be sad to see him leave. I can't see him getting much game time next season after our transfer business is concluded, but then I said this last season. He's had a good season, but I still don't think he's what we need going forward.

6174~~~
shows exactly his value as an impact sub

6175~~~
I love him.

The guy's awesome.

6176~~~
Absolutely shite but a vital goal

6177~~~
his passing is terrible

6178~~~
Pretty much. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6179~~~
Just awful again.

6180~~~
He had a mare today, a tap in shouldn't deflect from that.

6181~~~
Shit all game then gets the winner. Vital goal.

6182~~~
Much better in the second half today. I still can't think of many top teams that carry a lump with zero technical ability, just to beat full backs to headers now and again though. Needs to be on the bench next season for me.

6183~~~
Yeah. Not his best game, but a vital goal. 

Was annoyed he didn't put Young through at the end.

6184~~~
just like Ashley Young, he's despised by many on here, but he's been a big asset for us.

6185~~~
Not a good game, but scored the winning goal which has to count for something, and as usual was a big asset on defending/attacking set pieces.

6186~~~
This guy has won us some important games this season with his headers.

6187~~~
The clear weak link among our forwards in this kind of game, or at least when we are not using him as an out ball, but my word he has come up with some crucial goals for us this season.

6188~~~
Thought he worked hard and was the physical precense we needed to pull out the win. Good to see him get the match winner too. With our strikers looking absolutely useless he got us the goal that puts us one foot back into Europe.

6189~~~
He's had decent enough games, just like Young. But it doesn't change the fact, he isn't good enough to be a first teamer next season. He has his purposes and a role in the side, but someone so technically limited and route one shouldn't be a key player for us.

6190~~~
I maintain that until our 'creative' players (ie Herrera, Mata and Di Maria) can actually start producing the goods on a regular basis, it is silly to complain about Fellaini's various limitations, as for me he is doing more than the aforementioned players.

6191~~~
should be our forth striker or target man. We lack a lot of pace in the midfield, but there's goals in him. His goals have helped the club big time this season with various players struggling.

6192~~~
Needed that so badly, he'll definitely be of use next season.

6193~~~
He had good performances in midfield earlier this season, but at the moment I would agree - to be honest I think Fellaini offers more up front than any of our other strikers, on current form.

6194~~~
He got the winner but that was a terrible performance. Just as bad as anything he did last season.

6195~~~
He's most likely won us top 4 with his goals.

6196~~~
Deserves credit for getting a crucial winner but if we really want to advance as a team he needs to be a plan b option off the bench rather than a starter. His overall play for the most part is below what a United first choice midfielder <b>should</b> bring to the table. If he was a bench option he could still play an important role when we are chasing a goal and more balls are being floated in towards the end of games, rather than that being our go to tactic from the first minute.

6197~~~
What has that got to do with what I said? 

Fellaini's contribution this season has been very good, nobody will dispute that.

6198~~~
Might have got a us a winner but I think we should be using him as plan b and bringing him on if were losing.

6199~~~
I agree, vital goal but overall he was poor and our midfield is crying out for an athlete in his role.

6200~~~
Don't agree with this, Young is much better. Fellaini is a limited player who struggles when marked.

6201~~~
Got the goal and fair play to the lad. Wasn't at his best today and in truth, ever since Jose derailed him he's not been as effective. H ewas probably the one most likely to get dropped from the midfield lineup and hopefully that goal will get him back into beast mode just in time over Arsenal's fragility.

6202~~~
Gets a round 0 for his perfomance today. Yes.i know he scored a.goal.

6203~~~
his goals saved him from being slated here, he was terrble today and is worse every game, he needs functional team around him and we are currently very low on confidence all of a sudden. It's weird.. Hopefully we are lining up POgba or someone who will solve our confidence isssues..

6204~~~
Big goal that today. I think he will be more of a squad player next season but very useful to have around in that capacity.

6205~~~
He should be nothing more than an impact sub from next season.

6206~~~
Maybe he wont be in first XI next season but he will have his role for us in certain situations. Even tho maybe he can improve his general play so you never know.

6207~~~
We all know that simply isnt true.

6208~~~
Presumably you also gave Rooney, Valencia, Evans, Blind, Herrera, Mata and Falcao 0s as well?

6209~~~
Nope. 
Why?

6210~~~
Very poor today. Why he doesn't jump for headers is something i'l never understand. Really grates me. 

Got the all important goal though. As I've said all along, even during his good run, he should always be a plan B. I fully expect Van Gaal to move herrera or mata to the no 10 slot once we get a proper CM

6211~~~
Because I think it is fair to say that Fellaini provided more today than the players I named.

6212~~~
so you don't think he was awful or that people would have reacted with indulgence?

6213~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> Is Fellaini like your dad or something?  Your love for him is downright Mad Winger-esque.

6214~~~
Give the guy a break for gods sake people, he's just won us the match! He performed a damn sight better than some out there today.

6215~~~
He is not a great aerial fighter for his size and his hair sometimes seems to act as a sponge when heading. But he has still helped us a bit this season. But despite what has happened this season he is not the type of a player you will need if you intend to be challenging for champions league victory. Neither are Jones, Evans, or Valencia. We need at least 2 top class defenders, and some extra bite in midfield(a hard man, who is also a top box to box guy) And we could also use a top notch striker. Rooney cannot control the ball too well when it comes to him, but can still pull out a surprise or 2. Falcao has had bad luck, and van Persie is nearing his end. Wilson we have not really seen enough of. Cavani would be interesting. All of this is just my opinion.

6216~~~
You said his goals stopped him being slated. That isnt true, because he has always been slated this season, even when he was our most important player.

6217~~~
Yes he done well to get the goal but for his size he is pretty crap in the air. He is 90% elbows, he needs to become 90% head then he would be super.

6218~~~
Like Mata this guy can at least contribute goals when he is playing crap. It would be nice if some of our other players did same. Our strikers, for example.

I'd be shocked (and disappointed) if he's still in the starting eleven next year but he's certainly been a massive asset for us this season. Yet he would have almost inevitably received massively disproportionate criticism if he hadn't scored.

6219~~~
That's pathetic IMO 

He wasn't great, but improved in the 2nd half. Also a few important clearances that you probably never noticed

6220~~~
His performance was woeful 1st half for me, second half, when Palace stopped paying as much attention to him, seemed to help him get his passing together at least.
If he hadn't scored, as others have mentioned he would be taking some serious flak.

6221~~~
Agree, he was no worse than anyone else.

6222~~~
he was praised after some good performances this season and rightly so, so that is not true from you but why do we talk about this?<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

he was shit today and we shouldn't make him automatic starter next season although I was excited with some of his performances..

6223~~~
Performance wasn't that good (most of the team was bad to be fair) but he certainly has a knack for scoring important goals.

6224~~~
As others have said, he wasnt really much worse than anyone else. He was sloppy in possession compared to others, but made a lot more defensive headers and clearances. Pretty much balances itself out, and he scored the winning goal.

6225~~~
This... 

after a poor 1st half, I actually thought Fellaini had some good moments in the 2nd half... plus the goal (which will secure us 4th).

and if in your extremely questionable Match ratings you gave Fellaini get a 0, then Falcao should have been a minus 5... not only does he offer NOTHING up front, but he was a defensive liability in the 2nd half.

6226~~~
He got another important goal for us today again, one that has probably secured CL football. Still yet again the same brigade of crying cnuts are out, doesn't matter what he does. There are fans that don't believe he's good enough for Man United, always will be. He's a big part of why we are 4th at the moment and only a fool could argue otherwise. Yeah it wasn't his best game today but he was there when it mattered. Fellaini has been treated embarrassingly bad by a lot of United fans, especially in here. Time to give him some credit. He got us going again after the Arsenal defeat and will be at the very least a good squad player next year.

6227~~~

6228~~~
Absolute turd since the match against Manchester City

Scored another important goal though.

Shouldn't be anywhere near our starting lineup next season, unless it's him lining up for another team.

6229~~~
Important goal, but he was gash today. He's not at the level we should be aspiring to.

6230~~~
Has been poor of late, even today but he got us the winning goal. Thanks fellaini.

6231~~~
He couldn't make a 3 yard pass.. but I'm not blaming him today, I was disappointed though but he lacked support which he desperately needs.. and the pitch was awful. He scored a winner I'm happy for him for that..

6232~~~
Terrible 1st half. Decent 2nd half.

He's got good mentality and when we were under the cosh for most of the second half he got in with a battle with the Palace players.

6233~~~
How important was that goal...

6234~~~
Is it just me or has his discipline improved as the season went on too?

6235~~~

6236~~~
In before the "its Walrus!" comments.

6237~~~
Yet people seem to recycle the elbows line continuously.

6238~~~
He scored an important goal, he actually timed his run to perfection to do it. He's not going to be technically brilliant, he won't wow the world, but he's one of the players in our squad that actually have a bit of fire in them, after the rebuilding, he won't be a starter but he will surely be a solid weapon off the bench.

6239~~~
Poor 1st half but got himself in the mix during the 2nd and won us the game.  Could probably being doing more in the buildup offensively.

6240~~~
One of my fav players at United now!

6241~~~
Vital goal. I'll leave it at that.

6242~~~
Question is, can he adapt his game when he gets man marked like he has been for the last few games. Big goal today.

6243~~~
He just needed one decent cross to win it in the end despite the random performance. Is he good for United ? Sometimes he really is... Sometimes you need a cnut in opponent's box to get a win like that.

He's definitely topic for a long discussion.

6244~~~
He was one of our worst performers and that was markedly visible. You often make some good points regarding Fellaini and his role in the side but it's all a little one-eyed today. He was genuinely woeful in the first half. He picked it up in the second and his defensive work and goal deserve credit, but on the deck he was nowhere near as good as he can be.

6245~~~
Another dualistic performance from him - he showed why he deserves to be picked and, at the same time, he showed why he shouldn't be in the starting XI next season if we want to progress.

6246~~~
Basically this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6247~~~
Maybe my previous post erred on the glass-half-full side, but I have said several times today that Fellaini had a poor first half. My point has been essentially what you said - that even when he is having a bad game, he can be mostly relied on to defend corners and set pieces effectively, and to provide a threat from our own. This by itself isnt enough to justify a place in the team, and I agree that he was not as good as he has shown he can be, on the ball.

Once he is on the pitch though it becomes a bit of an issue to take him off, because he is the sort of player you want if you are chasing a game in the last 15 minutes.

6248~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6249~~~
Was poor in the first half. His passing in particular was a lot below the level he is capable of. Although it's not like he is the only one that has given the ball away in dangerous areas. Smalling did it as well. Herrera also did it two or three times against Chelsea. In Fellaini's defence he worked back really hard to win the ball back after he sold Shaw short too. Thought he was better in the second half. Scored some vital goals this season, and looks probably our most potent scoring threat (which our strikers should be embarrassed by).

6250~~~
A shame i couldn't give him a kiss today <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6251~~~
I thought that his passing was horribly sloppy in first half and like most of our players he couldn't find himself place on the pitch, it's actually worrying what has happened to our team over the course of last 3-4 games, nobody was making himself available, everybody was shying from the ball, etc.

But yea, for all the sloppy passing he's done in the first half and for all the people that have moaned to take him off (for who, Pereira?) he actually got us 3 points there, good lad.

6252~~~
Many people are still slagging him off. But he's got a ton of heart and is scoring vital goals – when we play to his strengths.

Keep as an impact/squad player.

6253~~~
I thought he was diabolically bad yesterday, but it seems harsh to single him out when the whole team looked like they'd been on a booze up an hour before kick off

6254~~~
Wasn't his greatest game yesterday, but once again he showed how important he is by popping up with the match winning goal. 

As I've said to others, next season we should continue to use Mara, along with someone else in the 10 position - ideally someone who drives with the ball. I mean, there was a few moments when Fellaini found good space in between the lines, where he could drive at the defence, but he's just not that type of player, which is understandable.

6255~~~
If we start him it seems that he is almost guaranteed to finish the game regardless of how he's playing, because he is our plan B when things aren't going our way. We need more fluency in his advanced position, he should not be in our first eleven if we want to progress even further.

6256~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6257~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Fair enough assessment. Our entire team bar young and De gea were poor. At least fellaini scores important goals even when playing badly

6258~~~
people talking about dualism are just ungrateful. They're like those people that get a blow job but are still not happy cause it's from their mother ..

Was a vital goal. In the 78th minute. Don't care if it was a tap in, easy to miss under pressure. Think how you would be feeling right now if he missed and we drew or perhaps went on to lose. Fellaini spared you ungrateful motherfokers.

6259~~~
What I'm worried about is him in the Champions League. He might get away with all his elbowing and shoving in the Premier League but in Europe it's likely that he's going to be picking up some red cards.

6260~~~
He only got sent off once last year in the cl and i think it was from a sliding challenge.

6261~~~
That was an awful decision too. He got called for fouls that he didn't even make.

6262~~~
He's won us a ton of points this season and yet people still just want to see the XI without him. Obviously we'd be more fluid but the man is a match winner. Maybe if mata/valencia ever put in a decent cross he'd be a match winner more often, he seems to only ever score then young holds the ball up long enough for fellaini to get from right next to young to the far post. I'd kill for a serious right winger

6263~~~
Just want to mention today's goal as a good example of what I mean when I have been saying that he chnges the way teams have to defend against us.

6264~~~
Incredible how he keeps playing every game for full 90 minutes.

6265~~~
Agreed. He's been very poor for large portions of matches for a while now.

6266~~~
Doesn't do enough, just increases the burden on the rest of our midfield

6267~~~
We carry him through matches in the hope his awkwardness will create something for us. It's worked at times but I don't think it's enough. He's a target man and little else.

6268~~~
He was miserable, again.

For some odd reason, people seem to think his performances against Spurs, Liverpool and Man City means he's been very good this season...

6269~~~
He is one of the least dynamic footballers I've ever seen in the top flight. Sure he is a nuisance with his size but he is a plan B footballer for any club with serious aspirations. I can really see his worth when crosses are coming in towards the back post because he never makes runs near post and his sharpness on the deck in and around the box when the ball is pinging around is next to useless.

With a top class replacement in his position it will make a huge difference.

6270~~~
Dragged defenders out of position for the goal

6271~~~
Yeah. He gets a lot of praise for his aerial ability but for me that isn't enough to warrant a place in a United starting 11.

He's absolutely pants with the ball at his feet which should be the no.1 criteria.

6272~~~
If Fellaini is still in our starting XI come August, we fecked up our transfers this offseason.

6273~~~
But that's really all he can offer. Being a 'nuisance'. It's not enough.

6274~~~
Yeah but surely any player can run across a defence to distract them ? There must be a player out there who can drag a defence out of position but also make more impact elsewhere ?

6275~~~
Ok, thought he had a pretty good game today easily a 7/10 for me

6276~~~
Average game but its such a dilemma whether to persist on using him. On one hand he is great to have as a route one target. He can take pressure off the back and help us keep possession just by booting the ball up to him.

On the other hand he adds nothing to our passing/creativity/pace. Yes he draws defenders to him on setpieces and forays into the box but we just play at a very pedestrian pace at times when he is on the pitch.

6277~~~
Not 'any player' can do it. More attention is clearly given to Fellaini. He continuously frees up space for our other players due to opposing managers having special plans for him. Agree that his overall game was not good enough today.

6278~~~
He takes too long getting the ball out of his feet when we are trying to move it fast on the counter and overall just doesn't have nearly enough on the ball for a player operating in the #10 role. He was ok today but just like Blind I don't see us challenging for things if he is a long term starter.

6279~~~
Not a fan of having a midfielder high up the pitch with no creativity. He should be a plan B really.

6280~~~
I think some people are being harsh on his performance today. He played a big part in the goal today, when that ball came in all the Arsenal defenders immediately went towards him, that's how much of a threat he can be.

6281~~~
He's a player that's really handy to have in your team or squad when it comes to the Premier League as his physical presence suits it down to the ground but when it comes to Europe and particularly against the big guns and with the refs he'll have to be left at home.

6282~~~
He has done really well this season but I don't think he is good enough to take us to the next level. Put someone like Pogba in that midfield next to Herrera and it would be up there with the best. There is a place for Fellaini in the squad but if we want to be challenging for the titles next season we will need someone better as the first choice partner to Herrera

6283~~~
It was the sort of performances that are OK, but also make you realize just how much better we could be if instead of him we had a player who could bring the same physical presence but also add real pace, technique, ability to turn quickly, passing ability.... Any of those would be a great upgrade.

6284~~~
Ultimately I dont think he will win around a lot of the fans here regardless of what he does. When he was having his best spell this season he at least shut people up, but that seems to be about the best he can hope for.

6285~~~
I think the simple solution is to just buy a striker who can do what he does - offer an option to "beat the press", hold the ball up high up the pitch, offer an aerial threat in the box and press the opposition defence. It's very clear that what he offers is something this team needs, but there's no reason it needs to come from a midfielder. 

Someone like Harry Kane can do all of the above and more.

6286~~~
Fellaini gets a disproportionate amount of flack. Herrara and Blind's weaknesses usually get overlooked on here.

6287~~~
Nothing but admiration for his attitude this season and I can now actually see his qualities as a footballer.

However, I still find it hard to get excited about our attacking style whilst he is in the team. Not totally down to him but he is a big part of our predictability when going forward.

The fact he is more effective than anyone else we have in the position he plays is a worry and another discussion altogether.

6288~~~
If we start next season with this guy as plan A I'm going to give up on all of humanity. Disgusting.

6289~~~
Even if he's a plan B I will be pissed, I want us to win games late on like we used to under Fergie, putting teams under siege until some cracks start to open, not play long balls to this guy ahead.

He has shown people he isn't useless like they were calling him last season, but £15million or higher for him would be brilliant business by us(Not including the purchase)

6290~~~
Basically came in here to say that myself.

He's incredibly effective when we're using his physicality to bully defenders and bring the ball down for runners etc, but in the second half it was like playing with 10 men in attack (well 9 with Falcao/RVP). He's just so painfully average on the ball, playing at speed. He couldn't organise a counter attack to save his life.

He's earned his place in the squad, but if we go into the opening day of next season with him as first choice, I think I'll probably have some sort of nervous breakdown.

6291~~~
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x2auwx7?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

6292~~~
You can bet your arse that if Herrera or Mata had played that pass, we wouldnt hear the end of it.

6293~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Are you serious? I could have easily played that pass, it was nothing special.

6294~~~
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

Fair play, that was a good pass, but its not something he has in his locker as a regular asset. His passing and vision is just very very limited, and seriously hinders us when we're not specifically able to play though him and use his physical assets, like in the second half today.

Its not an attack on Fellaini btw, its just the way it is. Mata isn't a particularly good dribbler for example, just pointing out doesn't mean I think he's shit. Just that we need more from a player in his position, in certain games. He's basically a pretty limited player, but one who can be used to incredible effect at times. But he shouldn't be plan A, B and C.

6295~~~
Let us see you perform that pass in front of 60.000 in attendance with an United kit on. Yes it perhaps looks like a walk in the park pass but reality is not always how one is perceiving it.

6296~~~
I normally ignore these sorts of posts, but go on then, I'll bite;

It was an excellent pass, the weight on it was perfect, and Fellaini did well to delay playing it first time, so he could play it more centrally, inside the player closing him down.

Regardless, the statement was that he "couldnt organise a counter attack to save his life". The clip is obviously an example of him starting a counter attack which resulted in a great goal. Continuing to try to debate this really just shows your bias.


<a class="username" data-user="33606, @adexkola" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/33606/">@adexkola</a> sums it up pretty well at the top of this page - Fellaini gets a disproportionate amount of flak, and it has been painfully obvious this season that the haters were just waiting in the wings for any opportunity to complain about him.

6297~~~
I'm not biased, I like Fellaini and I'm happy for him. However he simply isn't Manchester United quality.

6298~~~
I just think it was funny pointing out that one of our 2 counter goals this season had Fellaini involved <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6299~~~
I would say it is a pretty clear indication of bias when you claim that you say things like;

6300~~~
Jeez, that pass was nothing special at all, most people could have played that ffs.

Go look at Fabregas pass to Costa against Arsenal, now that was a special pass, watch that see the difference.

6301~~~
I thought he was pretty solid so I was surprised to see the criticism, but then I remembered it is Fellaini. He was a huge figure in our goal, the defenders were drawn too him. So the Caf's love child would not have even scored if it weren't for him. He also won the ball back well a few times.

6302~~~
He's been very good this season, but i think we should cash in while his stock is high if offers come in. he has the quality to play a role at united, it just annoys me that that role is lumping the ball up to him and having him elbow people out of the way. It gives the manager an excuse to play route one football when i think we would all prefer a more progressive style, something fellaini will never fit into.

6303~~~
Here we go again with this tiresome bullshit.

Player x is not Manchester United quality. I bet he was United quality in matches he's performed in, right? The undispellable shit that you can't really argue against or for because it carries no real substance, people can't hit him with 'can't play in big games' anymore and he wasn't sent off once this season so the 'red card waiting to happen' twaddle cannot be used as well, so we're back to basics, not Manchester United quality.

Sure both ADM and Falcao were trully Manchester United quality when we bought them, right?

6304~~~
Agree I thought Fellaini played well strange some posters comments.

6305~~~
Strange but nor surprising

It was a very solid performance. He passed it around quite well and was involved in a positive way in our attacks. As well as the normal holding up play and defensive shift and against a decent Arsenal side. He was also important in the final 20 mins when Arsenal were on top.

It will be bad news to many, But he isnt going anywhere will be very much part of the squad next season

6306~~~
Yeah I thought he did well too. Surprised to see I'm in.the minority here.

6307~~~
Had a good game. His passing was also good, rarely gave away possession, worked hard, won a few tackles and was good in the air as always. Him and Mata were constantly exchanging positions.

6308~~~
Getting praised for a twenty yard pass a half decent teenager down the park could make <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6309~~~
he did ok. better second season which wouldn't be hard to accomplish.

6310~~~
OK game by Fellaini, he's played better this season. 

I think that he'll be an important part of the squad next season and will get plenty of minutes. But at the end of the day there are better players out there and we'd benefit from an upgrade

6311~~~
Once again a good performance, but once again he doesn't create much.

6312~~~
He isn't United quality though. Spin it any way you want if it makes you feel better, but Fellaini is a very limited player.

6313~~~
Nail on head.


The cynic in me actually hopes he is a first choice starter next year, <i>just</i> to see the reactions of some people.

6314~~~
That's like saying, 'well Mata was good but once again he didn't win many headers.'

6315~~~
Thankfully enough it's not you but LVG who decides and given how many times Fellaini's played this season, yes, he indeed is 'United quality' (whatever that measurement is) and I'm rather calm about him being 'United quality' next season as well.

6316~~~
The difference being that I don't expect headers from a winger when I expect creativity from an advanced midfielder.

6317~~~
I thought he was okay, for the most part.  Kept play moving and won the headers.

I would be reluctant to sell him because he is very useful against teams that clutter the area, Stoke and West Ham being good examples.  I think he also has more to offer as an attacker but we certainly need to sign more quality over the summer.

6318~~~
But Fellaini isn't in the team to split defences with passes though. So if you expect that then you will be very disappointed every game.

6319~~~
Very good season. Stepped up. I think his overall game is very good and he deserves his place here.

6320~~~
That's why I think that he isn't a good influence in our midfield.

6321~~~
I can see that perspective. Although with Mata, Herrera, Di Maria/Young, Carrick, plus a good #9 I don't think creativity should be an issue. SO Fellaini should be able to fulfill the role that van Gaal wants him to

6322~~~
The creativity is an issue, in the top 4 we are the fourth team in term of creativity, we create a lot less chances than our rivals, we can't continue like that, and the deficiency is clearly on the wings and the center midfield.

6323~~~
I agree that creativity is an issue, but the fact remains that recently most of our chances have come from the left hand side, and it is Young and Fellaini who look most likely to provide something.

Mata and Herrera are meant to be the 'creative' ones but haven't really done that, as the stat in your post confirms.

6324~~~
Good season for Fellaini. Chuffed for him.

feck the haters.

6325~~~
I don't believe in the notion that one half is supposed to be the creative side, that's plain wrong and it will limit us strongly. 
Fellaini sees the opportunities but doesn't manage to deliver the final balls, that's on him and no one else. Our entire midfield need to improve but you have to admit that the most active side is also the most ineffective.

6326~~~
You are dodging the question - I haven't claimed that all the creativity should come from one side, but rather than currently, the majority of our threatening play is done down the left, with Young and Fellaini both typically involved, and yet these are the two that you and others seem to feel aren't pulling their weight.

At present, for all their aesthetically pleasing linkups, I struggle to think of chances and dangerous moves that they have created - they merely recycle possession around the box and play it backwards or sideways. Sometimes the ball gets to Valencia who swings in a cross from the right, but that is about it.

Regardless of what <i>you</i> want from a midfielder, Fellaini is clearly not in the team to be a playmaker. He is generally neat and tidy in possession, he wins the ball back regularly, can hold the ball up, dominates in the air and is a goal threat, as well as being an asset when attacking and defending set pieces. This is quite plainly his game, and judging by the fact that LVG has continued to pick him in the starting XI, it would seem that the manager values those qualities in that position, otherwise we might have seen Di Maria or Mata in that role.

6327~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a>  What was the question?

Our most 'threatening' duo registered 9 goals and 8 assists while the under performing spaniards registered 18 goals and 9 assists. I don't expect Fellaini to be a playmaker but I don't think that he pulls his weight offensively, I think that his contribution is meager and the same applies with Young. 
Now the right side of our midfield also needs to improve there is no doubt about it, we need more assists and more activity from them.

6328~~~
You are right that there wasnt a question in fact! It was supposed to be along the lines of "do you feel Herrera/Mata pull their weight in an attacking sense?" with the context of the rest of the post.

I have been avoiding talking just about goals and assists because that isnt the point of the discussion for me - it is about the amount of our attacking play that goes down each side and the amount of chances created, which are less readily available stats. 

For instance, Herrera scored our goal yesterday, but it was assisted by Young, and Fellaini's contribution of drawing the defenders to him and created space for Herrera is not attributed to any statistic - but it was (or should have been) plain to see for those watching the match that the goal probably wouldnt have happened if Fellaini wasn't there.

I think there is significant room for improvement on both flanks, and I think the team will be aided if we sign a top quality striker who is capable of getting on the end of chances. It is easy to forget that we have Di Maria waiting in the wings, and have just signed Memphis, so for me that is plenty of options for the wingers/CMs going into next season. As I argued repeatedly in my "<i>Great teams are built, not bought</i>" thread - I think that as the players grow more used to LVG's system and develop a greater understanding with each other, we will start to see more chances being created and further improvements to our all round play. Overall, I am quite optimistic and excited to see what next season brings, but I do think that Fellaini should, and will be a big part of that - he provides qualities and strengths that virtually no other player in the world does (in that position), let alone our squad. That alone makes him a very unique weapon, and I think that LVG - being the sort to enjoy tactics and strategy in general - probably likes having that sort of a unique player in his squad.

6329~~~
He is much better in the number ten role, nowhere good enough to play any deeper but it's weighing up his effectiveness against his limitations. You lose a lot playing him there but he has been very effective because we lack quality and being able to play longer balls and get goals from crosses makes up for the lack of creativity and pace elsewhere in the side.

If everything goes to plan next season I think he will be sat on the bench a lot and will be plan B again.

6330~~~
He caused Coquelin several issues when he had the ball, and whenever he moved to the left, Coquelin drifting towards him created quite a bit of space in the middle that Young could have frequently exploited, but every time, Young stayed out wide, and we had to recycle the ball back! Too often did I get annoyed at Young staying out wide so close to Fellaini when he could have cut in and caused Arsenal even more problems.

However, as we saw against Everton, Chelsea, and West Brom, he is quite limited when going forward, and if Young isn't creating chances from the left, then our left side basically becomes ineffective. With Mata cutting in frequently and Valencia not being dangerous as our main wide player, we rely heavily on our left side to stretch opponents and provide crosses, and with Fellaini not being that effective at creating chances, much of that burden goes onto Young.

At this stage, Fellaini is quite useful to disrupt the opposition and free up our creative players, but when our main creators aren't at their game, then Fellaini doesn't have enough in him to contribute to our attacks as seen several times this season.

6331~~~
Sell him at the first sight of an offer.

6332~~~
Sell him at the first sight of an offer.

6333~~~
That's two sights.

6334~~~
Shit player who's performed as well as he can for a big club. If we're to challenge on all fronts next season we need better. Stick him on the bench as a plan B player or sell

6335~~~
and when he performed as well as he could he was more than good enough?

6336~~~
I have given up trying to argue with such great logic as "shit player".

6337~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What an idiot

6338~~~
Ridiculous. The side of his game thats just bizarre

6339~~~
Shocking tackle. For a nothing match!

6340~~~
I hope that the last we see of him in a United shirt. Idiot.

6341~~~
Can't wait to read the meltdown in here, people calling for his head, same ones probably praising him a month or so back.

6342~~~
fecking hell fellaini! That was brutal

6343~~~
Yeah shit season from him, get rid.

6344~~~
That's the trouble with Fellaini. He's always seem to play on a tight rope between doing well and get dismissed

6345~~~
Just so reckless. Idiotic, really, simply has to pull out.

6346~~~
Fecking halfwit.

6347~~~
What an idiot.

6348~~~
That was so dumb. Now going to miss 3 matches next season ffs

6349~~~
He will miss the first 3 games of next season now

Not that thats a bad thing ...

6350~~~
Cowards tackle, no complaints at all.

6351~~~
Very silly. Hopefully lvg punishes him correctly

6352~~~
Get the popcorn ready mate.

6353~~~
It's not funny though. He's an embarassment to the club. Can't play football at even a competent level and behaves like a twattish child for no reason at all

6354~~~
Correct and a big part of winning the games against the top teams. The doubters will be out now the seasons over. Anyone for Ashley Young too....?

Stupid late tackle though

6355~~~
Why would you risk a red card like that in a game with zero value. Especially now that its going to compromise our start for next season. completely stupid

6356~~~
Terrible challenge, luckily for us that side of him has come in a nothing game and won't cost us.

6357~~~
Does he have previous with McShane? That looked premeditated. Either way, he's a dick for that type of behaviour.

6358~~~
Nice to see the brainless thug in him return.

6359~~~
He has done a job this season. Manchester United shouldn't need a player like him in the future.

6360~~~
Yeah, it's not as if he won us a bunch of points, this season...

Hopefully, the FA permanently ban him and take away all the goals he's scored, this season.

6361~~~
Really idiotic from him, especially given that he'll miss first three games of the next season and we'll probably get a midfielder in, thus he won't be able to even pick a fight with whoever will be there to displace him.

This thread will turn into shambles though.

6362~~~
Now we have to plan for the start of the season without him. That's a good thing, a step towards more fluent attacking build-up.
He's done well this season but we need a different player in his position to evolve.

6363~~~
Correct. Some 'fans' eh.....

6364~~~
I'm a Fellaini  fan but that was beyond stupid. It gives a chance to bed in a new midfielder early next season though. He will have to fight for his place again, which is good.

6365~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You're a clown.

6366~~~
He should have done that to Hernandez rather than McShane. Would have been a little more justified.

6367~~~
I hate this place sometimes. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6368~~~
Some hilarious comments in here already. It was a bad and stupid tackle, but you can see plenty of people on here were itching for a moment like this to tear into him.

6369~~~
He could have easily turned Mcshane into the next Varys.

6370~~~
I agree, feck that guy.

6371~~~
If we end up getting Stoke Away in the first three he will be a massive lose.

6372~~~
Horrendous. Needs to cut this side of the game out, he's a dirty player and the refs in Europe won't stand for it.

6373~~~
Stupid tackle but those who're calling him a thug are over the top - dunno how you lot were able to support the club when Cantona and Keane were about.

I don't think it was malicious, just clumsy and late. He shouldn't be taking such stick off the fans when he's been vital to us making top 4 this season.

6374~~~
Grow up mate

6375~~~
He got a red. Big fecking deal.
Smalling getting a stupid red against City was far worse. That game meant much more.

6376~~~
Not sure they would have been around at that time, and if they were then they were clearly turning a blind eye towards anything they did.

6377~~~
Agree. This place has a level of stupidity sometimes.....

6378~~~
Agree with this. Decent season, although also slightly overhyped, but he shouldn't start going forward.

6379~~~
Regardless of what he's contributed ... it was still obviously accidental.

6380~~~
People put up with Eric and Keane because they were good.

6381~~~
I hope I never get to see him play for the team ever again. He's done well this season, much better than last season but he's a player who makes my eyes bleed when he plays football. Such an awful and clumsy player to watch.

6382~~~
What?

I was being sarcastic.

6383~~~
This is how I feel too. He just isn't a Man Utd player in any way. So weird that we have to put up with him.

6384~~~
Why are there so many incidents where he's reckless in his tackles and flailing of arms? 

The dude's got more in his locker than some will admit, and he's been very handy for us at times this season, but why oh fecking why does he go in like that in that situation? Clumsy or malicious, either way it really makes me ambivalent about him.

6385~~~
To the haters - without Fellaini we wouldn't be in the top 4 this season.

6386~~~
It honestly has nothing to do with his ability because I belive he's a good player in the right setup and team but I just can't take it anymore. He looks like a clown with his hair, with his arms thrown around.

6387~~~
As opposed to the incredible football we've played without him? When was the last time your eyes weren't bleeding, whilst watching us play? 

I'd probably recommend you see a doctor, as extensive bleeding from the eyes is quite serious.

6388~~~
Yet, we should completely get rid as he has no future here.

6389~~~
Yeah, take that, haters!

6390~~~
You misunderstood me totally, I'm not criticizing his contribution nor his ability. Just the ugly way he plays football, I'm talking about style and individual POV.

6391~~~
Hes been put together wrong. The only thing he has any control over is his chest. If he can't control his arms and legs I'm not sure how he's supposed to control a football. 

He's had a much improved season as have 2-3 other players and they deserve credit for that, but he just isn't good enough in any role that doesn't involve him being a glorified battering ram.

6392~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6393~~~
He'll never be a favourite of most I guess. Prone to doing stupid things like this, plus he looks so ungainly and clumsy with the ball.

6394~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6395~~~
He's a fecking thug and always has been. Worry for us next season when if he's starting games for us again.

6396~~~
This will get ugly. 

Stupid tackle though. Idiotic and unnecessary. Should be punished appropriately and will miss the start of next season. Unfortunately it will probably take away from what has been a good season by him.

6397~~~
You mean when he was playing good football instead of studding people?

6398~~~
Is that Fellaini suspended for the first three games next season?

6399~~~
If Fellaini missing three games next season 'compromises' our start, it's safe to say we'll have had a shocking transfer window.

6400~~~
Calm down. First red of the season. Was a mistimed tackle. Like some of you lot couldn't wait for him to get a red that you could come in here and starting chatting shite.

6401~~~
Shocking news out of the Premier League today as Marouane Fellaini has apparently become the first player ever to be sent off for being a thug. Over to our eager reporter from Redcafe.net Mr D Queen

6402~~~
How did they know it was coming? Thats the part you need to think about

6403~~~
That's the thing, we've been absolutely ugly, from week one. The game against Hull epitomises our entire season. 

We don't need 11 brilliantly technical footballers to be a great team. Look at Mascherano for Barcelona; hardly the prettiest footballer (football wise) yet integral to their success.

6404~~~
The only tackle was being stepped on

6405~~~
Don't care. He shouldn't be starting games for us anyway.

6406~~~
It looked pretty malicious to me, he and McShane had words with each other like a minute before (about Fellaini's elbows I think).

6407~~~
Mascherano is a centreback. Them not being fantastic technically isn't that big of a deal. It's different for players where Fellaini plays

6408~~~
Mascherano is still a technically sound player, very physical but so much more intelligent than Fellaini with his decisions. He makes fouls when he has to, Fellaini makes them needlessly over and over again. Besides you're taking what I said way to the other extreme, never talked about the team's style and having 11 brilliantly technical players. Fellaini is an ugly player to watch, no matter how good he can be is what I'm saying, nothing more, nothing less.

6409~~~
McShane lives until we find a cock merchant.

6410~~~
We beat City, Tottenham and Liverpool with Fellaini playing as a midfielder. He was an absolute nuisance and almost impossible to handle, yet he's clumsy and not good enough for United? This place is incredibly bi-polar.

I can just imagine what the Young thread would like if he plays bad for a few games, next season; or the di Maria thread, if he's able to start on fire.

6411~~~
Disgraceful from him, but the comments in the match thread were just pathetic.

6412~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> They'd never believe it came from a full-grown man if they don't see it attached to him?

6413~~~
You dont compare a #10 to a CB and then claim not all players need to be technically gifted.

6414~~~
Deserves a decent ban for that, disgraceful.

6415~~~
I never even said he wasn't good enough for United? I'm happy with his contribution but I can see why people think he's terrible to watch and wouldn't mind a higher calibre of player in that position. 

Anyway I wouldn't say he's impossible to handle as he can be taken out of a game when people stick a big defender on him

6416~~~
He's a fecking eejit sometimes

6417~~~
Those comments condemning him for a disgraceful challenge?

I'll tell you what's really pathetic in that thread...people who can't see beyond their own fan based prejudices and actually end up defending the cnut.

6418~~~
You certainly didn't post that opinion whilst thinking of replacing Fellaini with Cattermole, Crouch or N'Zonzi, did you?

Fellaini has hardly been fouling game in game out, that's just an exaggerated stereotype.

Like I said in a post above, he's a great player to have and has been one of the most important in our late resurgence in finishing fourth.

6419~~~
Coveniently forgets Liverpool.and City wins

6420~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6421~~~
Feck off

6422~~~
No, the comments wanting him sold this summer.

6423~~~
Strange thing for him to do in a nothing game that wasn't being played with any aggro.

6424~~~
Like I also said, his contribution has been good this season, I just hate watching him play. Hopefully we'll replace him with a much better player (doesn't mean I want him sold, just on the bench most of the time).

6425~~~
It was a stupid challenge, but the overreaction in the match day thread was silly. That's why we have a match day thread, I guess.

6426~~~
If you read through this thread and the match thread you can easily spot the tiny brains on here. You just know they have been waiting for a few months now for Fellaini to feck up.

6427~~~
Can't really call McShane a midget though.

6428~~~
Barcelona's recent success has been built upon having players capable of being able to keep the ball, pass the ball and retain the ball, to maximum effect. Mascherano, although not technically bad (but how can a professional footballer playing at the highest level be technically bad?), isn't the best, yet he's maximised his other attributes and been as important as any other Barcelona player.

6429~~~
A. He is a good option B to have. Nowhere near a "great player to have" category.

B. If we want to start looking beyond a fourth place finish, we need to replace the likes of Fellaini with someone better. I am absolutely sure there are better players, who are gettable, out there in a #10 position who will improve us many fold.

6430~~~
No theres just a load of posters on here who have never forgiven Fellaini.for not being Thiago

6431~~~
This is one of the above mentioned posters

6432~~~
If you hate watching him play, then you truly don't understand his impact and what he brings to a team.

I, too, hope we bring in another midfielder, or two, but we'll need Fellaini, again, next season. 

He's an under-appreciated player who allows others to play, with some degree of freedom.

6433~~~
Yes and one of the main reasons is he is a very intelligent player who has been able to adapt his game to play a CB role although he has been a midfielder for most of his career.

Second and more importantly, Barca have been this dominant again because of Messi, Suarez and Neymar. And Fellaini plays a rol closer to them than Mascherano.

6434~~~
Any gif of the tackle ?

6435~~~
I didn't realize that to want a better player for your team to improve means you are not able to forgive a player for not being one of the best young playera out there. By that logic, I should be mad at Herrera as well for not being Fabregas. 
But I guess common sense and you don't go hand in hand.

6436~~~
This seems pretty sensible.

Thiago hasn't exactly set the world on fire, tbf. I don't care to speculate about the motivations of other posters, but Fellaini just seems like an easy target of frustration.

6437~~~
Obviously when wanting someone a bit better to watch technically you wouldn't replace Fellaini with any of those 3. Wanting a more technical number 10 doesn't mean you need all 11 players to be fantastic on the ball.

6438~~~
You still misunderstand me, I keep saying he's a good player. He's had a good impact and very important one in some big matches this season. I make a clear separation between his contribution and his style of play. I never said he was shit when he clearly wasn't.

6439~~~
I can't say I really disagree too much with <a class="username" data-user="68828, @NK86" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/68828/">@NK86</a> there Ramshock. I'm not generally one of those agenda posters, and I was actually happy when we signed Fellaini - but I actually thought it was as a DM/CM at the time.

Soon after it was clear that he wasn't suitable for those positions, as neither his agility or passing game could excel in that position. And since then it's also become clear that his best position is "in the hole" almost - & I must admit, I think if you're trying to compete at the very top of the league and champions league, you need better.

That might be slight bias on my part (because of my preconceived notion of a #10's supposes skillset and Fellaini isn't exactly easy on the eye), but I think Fellaini promotes and excels in only a certain kind of way - using the high ball up to him. As we've seen this season, it can be very effective, but as soon as we were figured out and he was man marked, he and the entire team struggled as he doesn't bring a lot else to the table.

But yeah, our struggles coincided with Carrick being out, so there might be more to it then Fellaini, and as I said, his been possibly in our top 5 performers this season, so credit there. I just don't think he should be a plan "A" player. But that's just my opinion and I'm sure there are tons who disagree.

6440~~~
What I'm, essentially, saying is that you don't have to be technically outstanding to play for a top team. Fellaini may not be able to play anything like a Messi, or Neymar or Suarez, but he brings something else to the table, something just as important as any other player in our team. 

His physical presence was vital in our wins against our rivals for a top 4 place and will more as important next year when we're challenging for more.

6441~~~
Then what on earth is the problem?

6442~~~
It was a stupid tackle that deserves a 3-5 game ban, and I detest the style of play he brings to our team but I obviously see his use and we'll obviously keep him for the coming season.

6443~~~

That tackle was disgusting, I'm not a Fellaini basher, but it really was sickeningly cynical, I'm unsure how anyone playing for nothing and 20mins away from his holdiay could do something like that, at least Rooney's kick out was a sudden 3 second rush of blood.

6445~~~

6446~~~
Moron, you have a good season and begin to show Manchester United's supporters what you can do and then you go and do that in the final game of the season? Stupid.

6447~~~
There is no pb, just simply saying I hate watching Fellaini play football for us or in general. Fairly simply no ?

6448~~~
He said that he didn't like watching Fellaini play (long balls I would guess)...I mean its not that complicated.

6449~~~
Fellaini will be here next season because LVG knows something you dont

6450~~~
He won't be banned for the Champions League qualifiers <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

6451~~~
Simple is very apt indeed

6452~~~
Again, I am not saying he has not been decent or needs to be sold to the mines. What I am merely pointing out is that the role he plays for us is that of a #10 more often than not and we if we need to improve our style of play, we need to look beyond Fellaini and his ability to hold up the ball as an option A in that position. He is a very good option to have when we are chasing games and can be used as a battering ram against certain opposition, but his skill set is so limited that I personally feel we are becoming too long ball for my liking when we start with him in that crucial creative role of a true #10.

6453~~~
Fellaini plays long balls?

6454~~~
Look no further than our Captain. One of the worst first touches, if not, the worst for a United player; yet he's still going.

6455~~~
Life is simple.

6456~~~
Please point me out to where I have asked him to be sold or insinuated that he won't be here next season?

6457~~~
LVG says Fellaini tackle on McShane was 'stupid'. "He will be in the tribune at the start of next season, like he was this one."

Simon Stone

6458~~~
Wasnt addressing just you

6459~~~
Rooney can be a nightmare to watch too. The only pb who ranges from world class to pub player in a matter of days when it comes to first touch.

6460~~~
Just because someone wants a higher quality of players doesn't mean they are asking for Fellaini to be sold. He even said that he thinks he's a good plan b

6461~~~
No it doesn't make much sense at all.

He's a good player, has had a good season, contributed well in terms of goals and a top four finish... But I hate watching him play for United.

I ask why? Because "I hate watching him play in general".

6462~~~
I don't really care how people play in games like this if there's nothing to play for, but just don't get yourself sent off and miss the start of next season. Incredibly stupid on his part but he'll be nothing more then a squad player next year I'd guess.

6463~~~
Really? This is just silly...surely you must have known how I meant we play long balls to him a lot and go for lots of aimless crossing into the box which can be frustrating to watch when it doesn't work.

6464~~~
I didn't just say that did I ? He's a poor player technically speaking/pretty average on the ball.

6465~~~
I agree to some extent. Ideally, I'd like a Gundogan, or Vidal, or Pogba. However, I, truly, think Fellaini could be very effective for us, next season, in a similar role. His skill set is not limited; Like I said, it's extremely difficult to be a professional footballer playing for Manchester United with a limited skill set, in this day and age.

6466~~~
But they don't cross the ball to no one. They play all this pretty football with no end product and are lauded by the fans who slaughter Young, Fellaini and Valencia for wasting possession. 
Personally I would rather have a player trying to make an impact rather than one who just passes it around the edge of the box without looking to create a chance.

6467~~~
"just simply saying I hate watching Fellaini play football for us or in general".

6468~~~
And when he scores winners? Besides he can play with ball at feet too

6469~~~
I also said this before.

6470~~~
Van Gaal is still using players he inherited and probably doesn't want and has done a good job at using Fellaini, so he contributes in a positive way.

I don't like watching him but he's been decent this season - ultimately I don't think Van Gaal will use him as much next year after getting in more players that he wants, so in a reduced role as a squad player, fair enough.

Idiotic today though.

6471~~~
When you take the place of a player who is supposed to bring creativity, you have to be technically outstanding otherwise you take all the team down with you.

6472~~~
Absolute bollix. This is a guy who reguarly chests the ball down and turns on a dime in one flowing move. If Zlatan did that you would wank yourself silly

6473~~~
Ok if you can't contemplate that there could be better midfielders than Fellaini then fair enough. I would much rather have Gundogan or Pogba paired with Herrera as I believe that they are far superior with the ball at their feet.

6474~~~
Who said there wasnt better midfielders? Im saying Fellaini doesnt deserve the scrutiny he gets. How many winners has he gotten for us?

6475~~~
He's dirty. Not just today. We need an upgrade on him starting in midfield that is for sure.

6476~~~
He may be actually the best chest controller in the world.

6477~~~
He totally deserves the scrutiny he gets, Fellaini has deficiencies in term of technique and particularly agility that we can't afford in attacking midfield.

6478~~~
Why do folks constantly feel the need to be sarcy (not aimed at you FWIW) or drag other players through the mud in a Fellaini specific discussion thread ? Can't we stop with the digs (again not you) and discuss his merits in a civil manner from an isolated perspective ? And are we really, seriously going to compare someone of Rooney's caliber with him ? Most of the supporters are well aware of the fact that we a still short of quality in multiple positions, but that underlying factor shouldn't be used as a validation for Fellaini.

The point you made about technically inferior players succeeding at the highest level of the sport in deeply flawed, especially when it comes to players operating in or around the final third. If you still stand by the statement, name the front 6 players from Bayern or Juventus or Madrid or Barcelona who are similar to him in terms of technical quality. It's a shame that there's been a steady regression of expectations in the last 18 months or so. People are losing sight of where we need to be. United has to be at the level of those clubs, that's where we've historically been - we had Scholes and Keane patrolling the center of the pitch and Ole as a supersub - none of them were giants or overly physical, but got the job done in an exciting, positive fashion. That should never be forgotten, but now some are content with Fellaini ? The need for having a physical element in becoming increasingly hyperbolic, it shouldn't override basic footballing technique, awareness and quality; things that dude is well short on.

Anyway, the season is over, we don't have a lot of financial constraints, and can look forward to the transfer window to address the squad, especially the hybrid #10/ #8 position he currently occupies (among others just to be clear). IMO a proper, technically proficient box-to-box will be priority for Van Gaal.

6479~~~
Joking aside that is technical ability

6480~~~
Couldnt disagree more

6481~~~
You are disagreeing with what ?

6482~~~
Another great post

6483~~~
Fellaini adds bite to the side. We looked toothless without him. Clearly he was sent on to add that element today and then went and did a Gerrard.

There are players in the world who could do that job better than he does. But without him we'd be finishing 6th or 7th. Respect to The Lampshade for a good season's work.

6484~~~
Maybe not a limited skillset but we have had some players who are average in a number of positions and have been used as back ups to the real star players many times. I see Fellaini as one of these types. Who will fill in for a better player in some situations but don't want him to be a certain starter for us next season.

Also, the main problem is Fellaini is generally not playing the role which Pogba or Vidal play. He has played mostly in the hole and that is where he has been most useful. I would want a player who can actually contribute more in the role which Fellaini plays. It's all good that he can hold up the ball and is generally a nuisance for the opposition in their penalty box but I would rather a player in that role to be able to play the killer pass and actually contribute more to our play.

6485~~~
He has been better for us than I expected this season, but we need a proper 6 and Fellaini can be a bit player when required.

6486~~~
You - "No theres just a load of posters on here who have never forgiven Fellaini.for not being Thiago"

B. If we want to start looking beyond a fourth place finish, we need to replace the likes of Fellaini with someone better. I am absolutely sure there are better players, who are gettable, out there in a #10 position who will improve us many fold.

You -"This is one of the above mentioned posters"

When you said this it made me think that you think that is wrong for someone to think we can go get someone better than Fellaini if we plan on competing for the league and champions league. Like why would you think that post is something against Fellaini and not about how we could further improve the first team? Vidal, Gundogan, Verratti, Pogba etc are all a level above Fellaini imo and should be players that we should pair with Herrera to make a team that can compete well in Europe. 

I just don't see Fellaini as an intelligent technical player who will compete with Kroos, Modric, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Thiago, Schwiensteigher, Iniesta, Vidal, Verrati, Pogba etc that well. He's good for playing the long ball to him (where he can control it fantastically well on his chest) and relieving pressure but I'm skeptical about that tactic in Europe. If Van Gaal is going to build a possession side then Fellaini really sticks out like a sore thumb in a midfield with Herrera and Carrick.

6487~~~
Tbf, we can get bite and tenacity without compromising on technical and creative qualities - in the near future that is.

It has been a decent season from him individually and all credit to him for turning it around. However, we do need an upgrade in that position and he will still be a decent option B and a squad player next season though.

6488~~~
There's a common misconception that those who defend a player like Fellaini are content with him as a nailed on starter for the future.

I'm on the side of the wall who not only recognise his contribution this season, but can also see that he's not a technically deficient player. Is he good enough to start against the likes of Arsenal, City and Chelsea? Yes, he is. Is he good enough to start against Bayern, Barcelona and Real? Well, we may find out next season. Fellaini is a player who's physical presence causes opposition teams to play out of their comfort zone. Just look at the mighty Chelsea and their approach, a few weeks back. Of all the players to target, Mourinho chose Fellaini and had Zouma marking him. One of the best managers in the world, managing the best team in England, had a player man marking Marouane Fellaini whilst we had Rooney, Herrera, Mata, Young, Falcao, di Maria also on the pitch (at one time or another). Surely, it wasn't because he's isn't technically gifted.

Imagine the threat he could pose in the CL, if that's anything to go by. Teams would have to limit themselves just to stop a giraffe/mop/human incapable of playing football, right?

6489~~~
Looking at the posts it is maybe good to precise that for me Fellaini isn't technically deficient when compared to most football players, he is only technically deficient when you put him in the context of our future ambitions.

6490~~~
No, it's because of his physical presence. As mentioned his chesting ability could count as a techincal ability, but with his feet he is not consistent enough to play in attack in my opinion.

6491~~~
Well considering our previous 3 games had us just long balling it to Fellaini who would just knock it down for whoever was around it was no surprise Mourinho stuck a defender on him. Totally took away any impact he had on the game as well. Pretty sure West Brom did the same. He wasnt man marked for his technical ability either...its because he's massive and that chest of his. 

I just don't seen Fellaini being some sort of major threat against the big european teams because it worked against Liverpool, Spurs and City.

6492~~~
Has he got two left feet, or something?

6493~~~
Do you consider him to be a creative passer? A decent dribbler? I mean just compare him to Herrera

6494~~~
No, he has his moment with a nice pass or a flick, but in general his touch and dribbling is below what's expected of an attacker for United (Valencia doesn't count).

6495~~~
If you're looking for a source of bias against Fellaini, it's much more likely to be the fact that people see him as symbolic of the Moyes disaster. 

Personally, I don't think Fellaini should be at our club.

6496~~~
Does it matter what you're being man marked for? The fact that he was chosen ahead of our entire team illustrates the problems he poses.

We never beat City, Spurs and L'pool by playing long balls, though?

6497~~~
Because nobody can pass the ball to Mata then receive it back from Mata then pass it back to Mata (rinse and repeat) as often as Herrera can.

6498~~~
Erm... if we bought Fellaini for his dribbling skills, I'm afraid Moyes is more stupid than we first thought. 

I can continue arguing with you and the others who aren't very fond of him, however, we all know none of us are going to change our minds. 

I'll throw a cliche at you - lets agree to disagree?

6499~~~
Why we bought him doesn't matter. What matters is what his current abilities are, and in what position he can be useful next season. I wouldn't be against having him in a backup role getting 15 games next season. He offers a decent plan B, nothing more.

6500~~~
Was responding to "Surely, it wasn't because he's isn't technically gifted." in your other post. 

I'm sure we hit quite a few long balls against Liverpool where Fellaini got the better of Emre Can quite a lot. We did the same to Tottenham and their RB got subbed off I think and Fellaini man marked in the second half. Liverpool couldn't even press us because we could always get the ball to Fellaini and he would manage to keep it excellently.

6501~~~
You buy a player for a reason, not for fun.

Second part, I sort of agree with. More than 15 games, me thinks.

6502~~~
We fired the guy who bought him after less than a year.

6503~~~
He fooled me - I thought his game had matured past this sort of thing. Thug life 4 eva.

6504~~~
And the same guy decided to play him in DM, after having already seen that his best position was as an attacker.

6505~~~
Fellaini played more often in DM than AM and he performed well for Everton, his skill set from a technical point of view is also more suited for that role.

6506~~~
He played mostly in attack the two seasons before we signed him if my memory serves me right. For a DM his techincal ability is good, but he lacks in so many other areas like pace, positioning, agility and tackling so it makes little sense to play him there.

6507~~~
it was a rash disgusting challange, but don't think that should change anyone opinion of fellaini one way or another.

mine is he is a great player when you play very direct football using him as a battering Ram, he is one of the best i can remember seeing at playing that style of football.

however i don't want to see united play that way, so i don't want to see fellaini as intergral part of the first team, as a plan B fine, but nothing more! where united we should be aiming higher then either hit up to fellaini directly and hope for a knock down or knock it to wingers and let them wip it into him..... 

I realize its that style of football that has got us in t the champions league, but really with all our attacking talent is that honestly the best we can come up with, i want and expect more from united, and i dont think we will get it with fellaini as regular starter.... it is to easy for us just to go route one!

6508~~~
Honestly I think he should be no more than a squad player next season. He played a huge part in our "success" this year with his major contributions coming in our 6 win run, culminating in the victory at the dippers. Admittedly he is great at helping us keep the ball when its booted up the pitch. However, he is just not good enough a footballer to ever win us the trophies we should be aiming for.

Today just highlighted the stupidity and indiscipline in our squad further. We've just had far too many of these silly red cards this year.

6509~~~
Fair enough then. Given Fellaini's + performances this season (relative to 2013/ 2014), I'm not fundamentally opposed to him being a squad chess-piece either. Just don't want him to be a regular member of the starting XI, or our immediate route 1 plan B is all. Personally speaking, (just like <a class="username" data-user="26211, @kouroux" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26211/">@kouroux</a>) some of the criticism stems from a preference for free flowing, attractive football rather than a ponderous, ungainly, aerial bombardment kind of approach. Because I've seen what some gifted former United midfielders could do, I will likely never find his style palatable. It's like replacing Ferdinand with someone like Mangala, if that makes any sense.

As for the displays vs Chelsea, City and the like - there is a sense of it being a cum hoc ergo propter hoc type of argument. We cannot definitively state that he will perform well vs those teams on a consistent basis through the coming season on the basis of a limited sample size. A lot of Liverpool's weaker players performed well individually or as a collective vs some of the bigger teams last season, but eventually got found out in the longer run. And that might await us if we persist with limited footballers, because sooner or later teams will adapt their tactics accordingly.

And IMO he will pose a negligible threat in Europe - having a wardrode in the side is not a genius, hitherto unforeseen tactic that will befuddle the opposition. Papa Boupa Diop excelled vs United at times on the domestic front, but play him regularly in the European Cup and he wouldn't have fared well once the immediate shock factor subsided. Fellaini's frailties will get magnified on the biggest stage vs intelligent players like Lahm, Vidal or Modric. And managers like Guardioa or Ancelotti are extremely shrewd, who will definitely conspire to nullify his primary aerial/ chesting threat while keeping the ball on the ground, which in turn reduces most of his effectiveness.

6510~~~
You see the assessment that you did about him in the DM position, we are doing the same but in the attacking midfield position, his lack of quickness, creativity, agility are huge problems for an attacking midfielder.

6511~~~
Yep, I agree. Which is why I only want him as a backup option if LvG sees him fit as that.

6512~~~
That match was a clarification of his role and future here as he pretty much just made way for better signings to step in and take his place from very beginning of the next season.

He still may be useful in some complicated tactical situations... from time to time.

6513~~~
Fellaini has done pretty well this season but hopefully we'll start the first three games next season firing on all cylinders, thus meaning he's more of a Plan B option, a role I think he could do effectively.

6514~~~
If he's on the list of players that are to be sold will his ban be enforced in other European leagues?

6515~~~
He has had some decent performances this season in a relative low key / rather average competition. However I don't want him anywhere near a starting place in the CL. He will be off before we even realise we are in the CL, can't see him being anything but a complete liability in Europe.

As far as I am concerned I would still sell him for around 12-15 mil.

6516~~~
Nerve. Touched.

6517~~~
Clumsy and nasty challenges are part of his game, he has got away with it a number of times since he signed but rightly he was sent off today. 

He improved from last year and can offer something to the squad but something is wrong if we can't find better players to start more regularly going forward.

6518~~~
I didn't realise Father Jack was on the cafe.

6519~~~
One

6520~~~
He could have gotten multiple reds this season. This is part of his game.

6521~~~
Was an important part of our team to get into the top 4. Next season our aim should be winning the PL title and getting as far as possible in the CL. Don't think he should be even close to being a starter for a club like United with that ambitions.

For all the important goals he scored, he slows our game down tremendously. Also I don't think that lumping the ball forward to him is the way I want to see us play next year. He is a useful tool but not exactly reinventing things.

6522~~~
All in all he's proven to have had a solid campaign and really turned around the hate and mockery he was getting. He'll definitely have a role in the squad next season, he's a great weapon to have.

Fair play, Fella.

6523~~~
I was out all day today so didnt see the game - think I will need to catch MotD tonight. Very disappointing to hear about the red card, his first of the season after he has mostly been pretty well disciplined. The reaction on here is about as expected to Fellaini getting sent off - I cant/wont comment any further until I have seen the incident.

6524~~~
Valdes gave good idea what to expect if he is our keeper next season, world class shot stopping, good distribution, error prone and dodgy on crosses. 

Other than that it was incredibly dull, we are the worst example of possession football, too much sideways passing, too slow and not enough players who can either up the tempo through their passing, turn of pace, skill etc. That's only going to change by bringing in new players and big decisions need to be made quickly.

Fellaini's tackle was awful, it's sort of thing he does too often, it's often borderline and he gets benefit of the doubt but ref had no option today.

6525~~~
Again not seen todays match so not disputing it, but I think it is ridiculous to suggest that Fellaini gets the benefit of the doubt with referees - every game he normally gets unfairly penalised at least a couple of times purely because of his tall/awkward frame.

6526~~~
Half a dozen decent games. Still insist he is not a player United should be planning their footballing philosophy going forward.

6/10

6527~~~
He gets penalised unfairly for small fouls but there are numerous times he has gotten away with things where he could have been sent off, it's just part of his game, it's stupid to argue otherwise.

6528~~~
Surprised he doesn't get sent off a lot more often. Really needs to cut out his nasty streak.

6529~~~
he's scored 6.1 on the CAF and I've also gave him 6.1 so you are not far off the general consensus on the site about his performance this season. I do think he's been a massive player for us in the big games that everybody has been raving about this season, the Spurs, Liverpool and City run.

6530~~~
He has 6.6 from me - although I have missed a few games including today that would have probably brought that down a notch, and also I am apparently a generous scorer as I am higher than the caf average on most players.

6531~~~
So am I. The only other player that I match the average is Falcao everybody else I'm above the average on.

6532~~~
Personally think he has been used by Van Gaal as a last resort, largely due to both Di Maria and Herrera for the early part constantly giving the ball away. I can't see him being first choice next season at all. He certainly would be a massive hindrance in Europe as well.

6533~~~
What an idiot, you can't defend that. Now banned for the first 3 matches of next season and a black mark in the manager's thinking over the summer. Stupid after the good season he has had.

6534~~~
Indeed.

It really is and it is by far the one he's best at

6535~~~
If we get a half decent offer for him, we should sell him this summer. He should never be a key member of our starting 11 if we want to push on and win the league and compete in Europe again. Sell him whilst his value is at it's highest.

6536~~~
Our new Park Ji Sung? Obviously different players but you get the idea. For the record i was a big fan of Park. He was instrumental for us in many important moments.

6537~~~
I was a big fan of Park too and the difference is that, we are adapting our game to Fellaini something that we never did with Park.

6538~~~
He's earnt a squad place at the least - he's proven himself capable enough of slotting into the system we've been playing, he offers a tactical alternative and he's performed well. I understand people not wanting him in the first XI for stylistic reasons, or if they don't think he's good enough as a starter, but why would you purposefully want to weaken the squad and limit our tactical options, especially after this season where we won vital points because of those tactical options?

6539~~~
I like him and I think he's a good squad player but the best thing about today was that he was sent off and will therefore miss our first three games next season.

6540~~~
Not versatile enough to be labelled as the new Park imo. As harsh as it sounds, I'd rather have Park to be honest.

6541~~~
I think he may get sold.

His suspension will mean we have to get our signings done early and as I've said for much of the season while Fellaini is a good player, and when he's confident a real dominating force, but we'll try and get in midfielders who share some of his qualities - not to the level of Fellaini who can a beast but to an acceptable degree, and who covers his weaknesses (Vidal, Schweinsteiger, Verrati, Schneiderlin). He'll be part of the squad but if an offer came in I reckon we'll cash in. Like Kagawa who it seemed to definitely have a role, but would have to try and force his way in, and then Dortmund came knocking and he was sent packing.

6542~~~
That red card really pissed me off. It was the action of a complete shit-head. No two ways about it. I've given him the benefit of the doubt with all those flailing elbows but have lost whatever belief I had in him being clumsy, rather than malicious. Which is annoying. I don't like having complete shit-heads on the team.

6543~~~
This!

6544~~~
100% agree.

6545~~~
Not harsh at all.  Park was an intelligent player who gave his all for the team.  We were actually winning things with him.

6546~~~
Park was a far better player than Fellaini. He looked a good player against the likes of Barcelona etc.

Put Fellaini in against Barcelona and he'd get embarrassed. He's a target man, who should never of ended up at United and is a bad fit.

If say Spurs offered us £15m, would anyone on here say no?

6547~~~
Idiotic from him today.

Over the season, I think he has proven his worth as an alternative, or a plan B, when things aren't working out. However, it appears Van Gaal sees him as a player who can be used in a number of systems - not just as an alternative. I think he is too limited to be considered a regular first-team Manchester United midfielder, if the team has genuine aspirations of winning the title.

6548~~~
He's a bit of a daft lump who has a role to play in a direct system, when your desperate to score. The people saying we would have missed top 4 without him are right, but I'd be disappointed if he was a key player for us next season. He's painful to watch at times.

6549~~~
£25 million offer comes in. Do we sell him?

6550~~~
I would take it.
I'd be happy to let him go for that. Mainly because I fear Van Gaal will use him too much next season, to the detriment of our development as a football team and title challengers.

6551~~~
For that much, definitely. He should be a squad player for next season, so getting that much for him would be a good deal for us.

6552~~~
I'm sure most would. Seriously though, can't see teams offering more than 15m for him - probably the likes of Everton/West Ham etc. Realistically, can't see any top team that would be interested in him. 

In saying that, I wouldn't mind him here as a decent squad player but he is hardly indispensable is he.

6553~~~
Pass and move eh? Who needs those?

6554~~~
My thoughts put into wordage in a much better way. He's filth, and just given people more ammunition to have a go at him when he'd had a reasonably good season.

So so stupid, and hopefully we start next season in much better fashion than 14/15 making the need for a target-man a complete no-no.

In an ideal world he just stops existing in my world, like that Real Sociedad manager from Scotland.

6555~~~
I have never been the biggest Fellaini fan but he is a solid plan B and we have a lot of games next season.

He should not be starting for us, but there is a possibility he could come in handy  for a few games next season.

6556~~~
£15m, and I would say take it and run.

6557~~~
Why on earth do we need him as a plan b? We never had to play long balls to a target man to win games under Ferguson so why does everyone think we need a plan b to do it now?

6558~~~
Fair point, I was vehemently against both him and Moyes but this season he has contributed towards our 4th place finish. If we get a good enough offer and 2 cm's in then by all means sell him.

6559~~~
Because we don't have Ferguson with us who was a football god anymore?

6560~~~
in a shot , but I doubt we would get even close the that £10-15m fir me , we overpaid for him.

6561~~~
I think we should keep him as an option but he needs to change and not be so clumsy with his tackles or throwing his arms around. Its only if he cannot change that, then I'd get rid. This season he's shown that he can be a good enough attacking threat that teams will plan around him and that gives space to other players. However he definitely hasnt been as good as his final season at Everton so in theory theres more to come from him. I just think we need a different first option that we can rotate with Fellaini so that we dont have to rely on him for every big game

6562~~~
Never wanted him, hated it when he had his (short lived) purple patch, pleased that he showed what a thug he is, if we have to rely on him as plan A, B or even C then we are in trouble, I hope to see the back of him this summer.

6563~~~
I think he was terrible ladt season.  this season he was decent and had about 4-5 good games (that April when everything seemed to cliked into places).  

If the right offera comes we should sell. But keeping him as battering ram is also a decent idea.

6564~~~
I'm beginning to have doubts about him now and I was a big admirer of his up until probably yesterday. I think that those bully boy and being a pure donkey towards the opposition tactics have finally caught up with now. 

Opposition players and the officials too are well wide to him and he'll become a pure liability for us altogether next season as he's capable of doing anything at any time. He'll end up costing us if he does deserve to get carded for a challenge, and he'll end up costing for possibly getting carded for a challenge he doesn't deserve to be carded for. In short I wouldn't be disappointed if he was moved on this summer.

6565~~~
Exactly. Like I said, the obvious malice of that challenge on McShane removes any doubt that he's just a bit clumsy and never means to hurt anyone. Which is something that will have been as apparent to PL referees as it was to us and makes him a liability from here on in. All very disappointing really because he'd had a good season. In fact, the end to this season has been a massive disappointment all round.

6566~~~
LVG's style of total football isn't greatly suited to the PL as many teams happily sit back. Without Fellaini this season we would have finished lower.

6567~~~
The only good thing is this happened in a completely meaningless game for us, and hopefully lvg comes down heavily on him as a result. Then again, it's nothing new. He constantly plays on the edge of recklessness and I can see it being a problem every now and then unless he's seriously told to get himself sorted.

6568~~~
Total football is suited to all leagues, but like everything you need to master it. And it is players like Fellaini who will prevent us from mastering this style.

6569~~~
Seriously. He has his uses when we actually use him properly AND the opposition don't have a plan to deal with it, but that's been a rarety, and as a footballer he's absolutely terrible. He can't control the ball, his first touch is ALWAYS back towards his own goal. He can't seem to do anything without fouling someone, and he has a repeated habbit of acting like a bellend in the middle of a game for no provoked reason at all. Like yesterday...what was that? He needed to prove he was a hard man by stamping on someone half his size while they were on the floor? Great stuff. Certainly not embarassing or pathetic at all.

We had that spell where we resorted to England/Andy Carroll tactics which was borderline humiliating. Another spell where we kept standing him at the far post and aiming crosses to him from about 60 yards away. We've tried using him as a midfielder. We've had games where we'd punt the ball up to him, and the opposition wouldn't challenge him, and then his control would be so bad the ball would end up back with the person who punted it to him nearly every time. We've had games where he's been up front while strikers have been stuck in midfield waiting for his non existent hold up play to take effect.

People just see him score a few headed goals and ignore the massive problems he gives us in most games. He just isn't very good at actually playing football. In fact he's shockingly bad at it. He makes Smalling look like Carrick.

6570~~~
Fair enough. I can't see him being more than a squad player next season as we really should start play proper football

6571~~~
when ever you play a forwrad player who is 6' 4'' you will always find the team playing ball
I have no problem with pass and move as a way of creating space so we can create chances. If we were up there with goals scored and attempts on target then I would say it was working. 

We have had more possession than any other team in the league this year while only scoring 62 goals and creating less chances than QPR. We're turning into a caricature of Arsenal with the way we hold on to the ball while creating little end product.

6572~~~
I concur with Noodle - Fellaini is an absolute fecking abomination of a footballer.

6573~~~
Spot on. We've struggled to crack open teams which remain deep and organised and Fellaini has proved to be a decent alternative, when we've struggled to create chances in these games. If our play wasn't so turgid and if our play actually had the incisiveness and some players with pace and creativity, I really can't see how Fellaini will fit into the team then. Tbh, most acknowledge Fellaini as just a decent and more importantly, a short-term back-up option. Whilst he is a decent alternative option to have, part of me feels he is hampering the team's development in LVG's possession game-play, as resorting to Fellaini hoof ball tactics seems the easy way out when we are struggling to break down teams.

That might sound a bit too harsh on Fellaini, as he isn't just a pure hoofball merchant and has actually played some decent football on the deck. It just isn't good enough or at the required level for a United attacking midfielder, I'm afraid.

6574~~~
Thats it lads, let it all out. Must have been a difficult season for some, having to keep their mouths shut. I get the distinct impression that folk were just waited with bated breath for him to get sent off (for the first time for United in the PL, by the way) so that they could get the knives out.

Just to be clear - I am not defending his red card yesterday, it was a stupid challenge and he deserved to go - the reaction on here however, whilst not unexpected, is pathetic. Wouldnt surprise me if these were the same people booing him in preseason against Valencia.

6575~~~
Not me. Quite the opposite. I've been delighted with the turnaround in his career this season, having previously been in a tiny minority that thought he might eventually come good. 

I'm not feeling vindicated or pleased at all. I'm just very disappointed. I think it's a shame we have a player in our team capable of such a cowardly and malicious act. It's depressing tbh.

6576~~~
He's had previous altercations well worthy of red cards. Let's not just brush all that under the carpet and brand him a saint because his head lead to 5 or 6 goals.

6577~~~
Oh come on, it was just a sh*t challenge. Looked like he was just late into the tackle, and went in with his studs, as quite a few players do.

All this malice nonsense and all these insults are uncalled for. It's odd that no-one in the Rooney thread spoke much about his needless kick at Brady. It was reckless, stupid and he should have been sent off for it, as he was against West Ham. Guess, heads turn when players differ.

6578~~~
What he did yesterday is just part of his game, I was amazed to hear he has only been sent off 3 times the premier league, have seen numerous occasions where he has been lucky not to be sent off in his time here and at Everton. This season showed what I always thought that he is a number ten and shouldn't be near the team in any other position.

He has played his part but if we want to progress next season then he can't be a starter next season,same goes for young and blind whether or not we can do that we will have to wait and see because who knows what our squad will look like by the time the transfer window shuts.

Fair play to him for recovering from the shambles of last season and in comparison this was a great season but for the fee we paid and for what we should expect from a united number ten he was nothing special this season which in  all fairness applies to a lot of players.

6579~~~
What a disgusting ridiculous tackle on McShane.

6580~~~
Not even close.

Completely different situation, Rooney's looked bad at first but replay showed that there was nothing in it, Brady completely overreacted with the fall. I don't think he deserved even yellow for that, the ref did right.

6581~~~
Why would people want one of our own players to act like a cowardly thug and get himself sent off? He's had a good season for us. It's a pity he's such a fecking scumbag

6582~~~
What is Rooney trying to kick? It was a cheeky swipe at Brady; his right foot was no where near the ball.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://streamable.com/2bg9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://streamable.com/2bg9</a>

6583~~~
They're vaguely comparable in that they were both stupid and pointless. In terms of malice they're absolutely worlds apart. As you can see from the reaction of Brady and the Hull players to Rooney, which couldn't be more different to the reaction after Fellaini went in on McShane. There's a good reason that one incident ended in a smile and a handshake and one didn't.

6584~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://play.offsided.com/keeper-736a9451d4bd465082ea53fe92ce2748.webm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://play.offsided.com/keeper-736a9451d4bd465082ea53fe92ce2748.webm</a>

How on earth is that malicious? It's just an absurdly crap challenge and he was rightfully sent off.

Earlier on in the season, Rooney aggressively kicked out at Downing and was sent off. Yesterday, his kick wasn't as aggressive, however, it was stupid, intended and he should have been sent off.

Edit: This is an example of a malicious stamp:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6zwDGzLPUNo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

6585~~~
This was my reaction - it was a shit challenge, it was stupid and he deserved to go. We have seen shit challenges like that before, and we will do again, but because it is Fellaini the reaction is 10x worse than it would be for any other player.

<b>Regarding the "He gets away with red card challenges frequently" type arguments;</b>
Sorry, but I just dont buy it. When you are as tall as Fellaini and jumping for a ball, there is always going to be a chance that your arm hits someone. You cant expect a player to jump for the ball whilst keeping their arms down at their sides. He does more or less the same thing as any other player, but apparently should be penalised because he is taller than most other players. I am actually pleased that the refs havent bought half of the pathetic overreactions from other players, when they go crumpling to the ground whenever they come within about 10 yards of Fellaini. We have seen multiple times this season, concerted efforts by other teams to get him sent off, and it hasnt worked - including a couple of times where he had an early booking and had to maintain his discipline for the rest of the match, whilst be targeted by opposing players.

Basically, I think that Fellaini gets treated like a Liverpool player on here. He never gets the benefit of the doubt (from fans), any sort of 50/50 situation, for some reason people want to actively side <i>against</i> him, whereas normally in those situations you would expect our fans to support our players, and opposition fans to support their players. The 'spitting' incident at the start of the season was a typical example - it wasnt even a 50/50, but some people were so desperate to find something to use against Fellaini that they actively try to make something out of nothing - <i>for our own player</i>.

Fellaini has been one of our better outfield players this season, and for a decent amount of time was arguably our best. His best performances have often been in the big games, and he has scored several important goals for us over the year. I question the objectivity of those calling for his head, and frankly think they should take a long look at themselves before calling themselves Manchester United fans.




<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> as you said yourself - the difference is the reaction, not from the players though, but from the fans. I can guarantee that if the players were swapped and it was Fellaini who did what Rooney did and vice versa, the reaction from the fans would still be far worse against Fellaini.


As I have - repeatedly - said, it was a bad tackle and he deserved to be red carded, fine.

Calling the player scum, a thug, a shit-head, an abomination, filth (these are just from the last couple of pages in this thread) is however a completely abnormal reaction which shows the underlying agenda (sorry to have to use the term) against Fellaini that several people on here have.

6586~~~
It was stupid but it wasn't hard at all, he barely touched him.

6587~~~
Perhaps wishful thinking, but I'm hoping he was just a stop-gap this season. I doubt he will be anywhere near the first eleven next season, and we won't start playing better - both in style, and as a team- until Fellaini is no longer a regular. I don't mind him, but he's not even close to good enough if we hope to be challenging for the top prizes again.

6588~~~
Sorry, what? Fellaini's stamp wasn't malicious? Have you played football? If someone did that to you would you accept there was no malice in the challenge? Of course you bloody wouldn't. It was inexcusable. Anyone who tries to excuse what he did is obviously completely incapable of being objective.

6589~~~
Let's be honest, he's got away with a lot of fouls this season, but this incident just puts him back on the referees' radars. Don't be surprised if one of 'those' elbows gets him sent off next season.

6590~~~
Fellaini meant to leave his foot where he did there on McShane yesterday, no two ways about that.

He might be a bit of a donkey when it comes to some challenges but he doesn't strike me as being as innocent as he looks after challenges all the time, there's a bit of badness going on in that head of is as well and that came out there in him yesterday.

Either way like I said earlier whether he'll be right or wrong in the future he's after making a name for himself and he'll be a cute opposition managers dream target in the future. Opposition players will be dropping like flies around him at the least little touch because no more than Young and his diving that time, the seeds of doubt have been sown over time now.

6591~~~
He has got to go. We're back in the CL and are planing a raid on the league next season, we can't afford to have hod carriers in our team.

6592~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> At anyone who thinks his stamp wasn't malicious. His actions have been derided by everyone. He has some serious crazed fans in here that are incapable of any kind of objectivity.

6593~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6594~~~
Edit: overreaction. Also to appease the mock offended 

Also him out of the side could only help United improve long term in my opinion.

6595~~~
He does get away with a lot he treads a line between awkwardness and nastiness, it's part of what makes him an effective player, at times opponents try to exploit it but he could and should have seen red a lot more than just three times since he came to england. 

Any player would have been criticised for doing what he did it was dangerous and deliberate it's the type of challenge  players should get even longer bans for, it shouldn't mean we get rid of him but he isn't a good enough player to  make allowances for if he continues making tackles like that, he is no Keane or cantona after all. Luckily that game meant nothing but he will have to try and cut that out, especially in the champions league where I think refs will really clamp down on him, probably unfairly at times but when he is swinging elbows round they will be a lot less lenient.

6596~~~
Some of that might be valid if it wasn't drowning in hysterical hyperbole. He isn't a classy player and he isn't going to win any awards for his technique but he has been a very useful player for us this season. He's had a very decent season and pulled us out of the fire quite a few times. 
His tackling, hold up play and physical presence were vital and instrumental in our most successful run, which also coincided with our best performances style wise.

6597~~~
So, as long as it's not hard, it's ok?

6598~~~
I think the whole Fellainis Flailing Elbows thing is exaggerated myself, and that a lot of that reputation has come from a combination of opponents targeting him/going down easily/height difference/general clumsiness. Not saying he is completely innocent but rather that it is very much overstated. He has shown very good discipline a number of times this season, including when opponents were quite obviously targeting him to try to get him sent off.

Again, I am not defending his tackle yesterday, my point is simply that the reaction goes far beyond justified criticism - calling one of our own players filth or scum is unacceptable for me regardless of which player it is - and you would not see that sort of thing if it were another player who did what Fellaini did yesterday.

6599~~~
Rooney should have been in trouble but he half pulled out. That counts just as much as the aggressive behaviour in the first place. Fellaini didnt pull out, he followed through with a stamp. And anyone who suggests its not malicious cannot be serious, as there isnt another way to purposefully stamp on someone like he clearly did.

6600~~~
Some of the reaction is over the top but there will always be a minority who do that, Rooney would get similar treatment from some people as well, some have even tried comparing the two incidents yesterday which is ridiculous but shows knives are out for Rooney as well.

I really don't think it is over stated I think he is probably the biggest offender in the league in terms of flailing elbows, some of it is due to his height/build and some of it is deliberate and more malicious. Naturally opponents will try to exploit it I don't think any of them have succeeded in getting him sent off though. There are numerous times where he has gotten away with it though so I really do think he gets the benefit of the doubt more often than not.

6601~~~
Well that would be because it's - thankfully - incredibly rare to see one of our squad cynically injure an opponent like that. If we had more examples to work from you'd have a better idea if your perceived bias is genuine or not. We'd also have a squad full of arseholes. Swings and roundabouts.

6602~~~
That's a bit extreme mate.

6603~~~
Maybe you're right. I just thought it was a disgusting tackle, and he's got a habit of trying to hurt players. 

Maybe it is an overreaction, probably brought on by seeing the way the guys leg opened up

6604~~~
FWIW, I won't necessarily hold the red card against Fellaini. Football is a very intense contact sport, and until we can diagram a player's exact thought process it's essentially subjective analysis - with the lines between determined competitiveness to full blown wanker often blurred in a flash point of madness. Some of my favorite players - including the likes of Keane, Gentile, Gattuso exuded a lot of aggression, and weren't exactly saints from a gamesmanship/ moral standpoint, so it's a bit disingenuous to hold Fellaini to a high standard. 

That said, a minor backlash is kind of understandable given the clumsy nature of the 'wiener stamp,' and dead rubber nature of the game, with not a lot at stake. It just seemed avoidable and a bit unnecessary from the viewer's perspective, and he could potentially stand to injure a fellow professional if the incident was indeed careless or malicious. Having a prior record of snide behavior doesn't exactly help his case; and also a lot of people would've cut him more slack if he evidenced greater quality. Because he isn't a player of the highest caliber (like the Keane and others mentioned above), it's often harder overlook the alleged nastiness, and stuff like this will only detract from his performances, and attract more negative attention - like with De Jong or Medel.

6605~~~
I take your point, but we have definitely had players with questionable traits in the past such as Keane and Cantona (not that I am comparing Fellaini to them in ability or importance of course). Would they get called filth? Probably not, they are instead club legends. Even Paul Scholes had a bit of a nasty side - his bad tackles became something of a running joke though, rather than being used as an attack on his character. To me that basically says that the fans dont mind a player being a dick, if they are a good enough player. So where do you draw the line? How good does a player need to be, for it to be acceptable for them to have a nasty streak? Fellaini has arguably been one of our better outfield players this season, but clearly not enough so that fans will forgive what he did yesterday - for me the key distinguishing factor is that Fellaini is a player that a lot of fans never wanted, still dont want, and therefore are eager to use any given opportunity to have a go at him.

Again I refer to the spitting incident earlier this season (against Chelsea I think) where Fellaini was seen shouting at the floored opponent, accusing him of diving. In my mind there was never any sort of case for it being a deliberate spit, but we had<i> our own fans</i> trying to create slow-mo gifs and still images to use against him. It is this active character assassination that I really have a problem with - just like when Fellaini was booed <i>by our own fans</i> in preseason (which for me is the most embarrassing and shameful thing I have ever witnessed as a United fan). These sorts of actions give the clear impression that a significant portion of the fanbase have basically had it in for Fellaini from day one, and look for any excuse to berate him.

6606~~~
I really think you need some perspective if you are that outraged by a bit of booing of a player who had only ever performed poorly, ryan giggs has been booed off in the past, it has and will happen to much better and much less deserving players than fellaini.

And to be honest it might not be fair to give more leeway to the likes of Keane and scholes but life isn't fair and it's not really hard to accept why more allowances would be made for world class players who drove the club to trophy after trophy in comparison to someone who has been pretty ordinary over a two year spell, not won a thing and will never be world class.

6607~~~
Bit in bold is probably true. In answer to your final question, about a hundred times better than Fellaini!

Anyway, from my own perspective, I'm usually inclined to defend the bloke. I think he got unfair stick, has shown real mental strength to turns things round and has been instrumental in getting us into the top four. So I'm not looking for excuses to have a go at him. It was just a <i>really</i> nasty challenge. So nasty that it's something you hardly ever see. Right up there with the likes of Costa and Suarez stamping on people, only even more dangerous. The outrage is completely justified IMO.

6608~~~
It was a horrible challenge. Made me lose some respect for him. He looked regretful as he left the pitch. Hopefully he apologised afterwards.

6609~~~
People have been booed off after poor performances, that is entirely different to booing a player every time they touch the ball, as soon as they have been brought on, in their first appearance of the [Pre]season. 

"Life isnt fair" - is that really the justification now?

Sorry to say but I find your entire post pretty ridiculous. You are basically saying Fellaini deserved to be booed because he had a bad season last season (like every other fecking player at the club apart from Januzaj and De Gea), and that its ok to have double standards because life isnt fair.


For me there is a line between criticising the tackle and the performance - which is perfectly justified - and calling the player filth, or scum, or doing as <a class="username" data-user="51593, @Snake Plissken" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51593/">@Snake Plissken</a> did and wishing injury on him. It would be 'not-cool' to direct that sort of thing at an opposition player, let alone one of ours.

I didnt see the match in realtime, so am going by the replays etc that I have seen of the tackle, which is why I am hesitant to say anything there - but based on what I have seen I think you are exaggerating a little. It was a bad tackle, he deserved to be sent off, thats about the extent of it for me.

6610~~~
No I am not saying he deserved it but it is what happens in football but to still be referring to it now and labelling it a as the most shameful thing you have ever seen is dramatic and ridiculous, that was the point I was making, he isn't the first and won't be the last to be booed so I don't really see the big deal. It's counter productive but it happens, if he was still being booed now you might have a point but you need to let it go to be honest.

He isn't a victim just someone who divides opinion because we overpaid for him and he doesn't fit the typical image or style of player we are accustomed to. He will never be universally loved because he isn't that good, it doesn't mean he can't play a part of be effective.

And yes life isn't fair, a great player will get more leeway than someone like fellaini because that's the way the world works. Liverpool stood by Suarez despite him being a racist who went round biting people, if borini did the same they would have torn up his contract. It's not fair but like I said life isn't fair, hence why scholes and Keane won't be criticised as much as fellaini.

6611~~~
Fair enough. I agree with the fact that we've looked like a terrible imitation of Arsenal. But I don't think Herrera and Mata are the problems here. We need better attacking fullbacks who can exploit wide area when Mata and Herrera (for example) overload the middle areas while linking up with the striker.

6612~~~
You are talking about a division of opinions, I am talking about 'fans' abusing and wishing injury on our own players. These are very different things. Nobody is forcing anybody to instantly become a Fellaini fan, but to just show a baseline level of respect to someone who has fought their way into the starting XI, been one of our better outfield performers, and shown a fantastic mental attitude and determination this season. I stand by what I said (about him being booed against Valencia) - it was pathetic and embarrassing and I am not alone in that opinion, especially since he was our best player in that game once he was brought on, and scored the winning goal.

6613~~~
Well like I said you need some perspective and you are too subjective in your views regarding fellaini which is evident when you call my post ridiculous when your are referring to that incident as the most shameful thing you have seen at old Trafford. I can't imagine there are many who would share your view to that extreme because it's pretty ridiculous. What happened to fellaini was unsavoury and needless but there it is water under the bridge now and all the people ironically cheering him would have changed their tune once he scored.

I agree he deserves some respect and shouldn't be subjected to the levels of abuse he receives but a minority will always have those kind of views and a number of players at the club are subjected to the same kind of abuse. Well done to him for coming back from last season and for a player of his ability I think he has a good season, same goes for Ashley young but in terms or where we want to be be they are both still average and neither will probably ever justify the money spent on them in terms of fees or wages.

6614~~~
Would sell for £20m.

6615~~~
You deserve a permanent ban for a post like that. It's an absolute disgrace to these forums if you get away with that unchallenged by the mods/admins.

6616~~~
Gimme a break. He's a dirty dirty player. It might have been an overreaction to seeing another bit of thuggery from him, but crying for another poster to be perma banned? You're pathetic

6617~~~
Excellent season from him, tarnished a little by a moment of madness on Sunday. Think he may still be fighting to keep his place next season, regardless of his improvement.

6618~~~
I dunno about malicious in the truest definition of the word.  I think he realised he was getting there too late and went through with it to try and avoid being embarrassed by his terrible misjudgement of the timing. Oh dear, I was committed to it, kinda thing.

Terrible tackle, stonewall red card.

He gets away with a fair amount of stuff, a bit more than what he is sometimes harshly penalised for.  

Done well this season and we might not be top 4 without him, which is a depressing thought.

Fair's fair, but I can't stand him playing for Utd, doesn't seem right.

6619~~~
<a class="username" data-user="51593, @Snake Plissken" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51593/">@Snake Plissken</a> what exactly is wrong with you?

<a class="username" data-user="87150, @Roboc7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87150/">@Roboc7</a> I dont think there is much point in continuing this. I think it is pathetic and embarrassing behaviour for our 'fans' to boo one of our own players every time they touch the ball. Even more when there isnt actually any justification other than "we dont like this player and think he is shit." If Liverpool fans were doing it then there would be a multi page thread on here dedicated to laughing at them and calling them pathetic - and rightly so. I am not really sure why you are trying to defend it.

6620~~~
Simple, I only just got around to seeing the challenge, and my initial reaction, though an over-reaction, was it that he deserves a taste of his own medicine. Crying crocodile tears begging for me to be banned for that is just ridiculous.

6621~~~
There isn't any point because you are twisting what I am saying, I am not defending it, I said it was wrong, just pointing out you are blowing it out or proportion in terms of how bad it was and it is pointless to be still talking about it. Claiming it was most shameful thing you've seen at old Trafford is dramatic and over the top.

6622~~~
Actively hoping a United player gets crippled shouldn't be a bannable offence. Definitely one of the most tasteless and stupid things posted on here over the years though.

6623~~~
Christ, take a minute and settle down.

6624~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> is clearly Fellaini. He gets so emotional about anything Fellaini related that it has to be the only explanation.

6625~~~
The thing that still puzzles me is why he did it, no matter how some try to defend it there was clear intent to hurt McShane, yet it wasn't a heated game with anything on the line for us or any prior bad blood.

6626~~~
If you think that my claim is so dramatic and over the top, then please enlighten me on what you think is a worse/more embarrassing/shameful etc thing that you have witnessed.

6627~~~
To be honest I think if you read the last couple of pages of this thread, there have been plenty of more 'emotional' posts than mine.

6628~~~
You take one or two extreme posts and act like the whole world hates the guy. I mean just chill out. Yes 'some' fans booed him? So what? It happens. Football clubs have some shit fans, that's life.

6629~~~
Already have, giggs being booed on more than one occasion. Plenty more has happened as well, world doesn't revolve around fellaini, better and worse player than him have and will be booed.

6630~~~
There was a minor kerfuffle when they were challenging for the ball about 30 seconds before the challenge, think Fellaini was annoyed about that.

6631~~~
That happens in nearly every game with him though, opposition players are always getting into it with him over his elbow first style and he gets penalized a lot for phantom fouls which must irritate him, he doesn't usually react like that.

6632~~~
Not all fans are the do gooder, must adore the ground their players walk upon, regardless of how they are performing week in week out type.

Some will let a player know if he isn't performing to the level expected of him, they are contributing towards his wages after all so although it mightn't look to good it is understandable enough.

And in fairness it's not like fans will boo one of their own players for absolutely nothing either.

I often booed a player albeit in a different sport myself, it was actually an amateur sport too. He was acting the prick both on and off the pitch. Funnily enough once the supporters got on his back he copped himself on!

6633~~~
Are you starting to see the irony of borderline hysterical overreactions now?

6634~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> yeah, I'm the one who needs to settle down. Some weirdo, most likely sat with his flaccid pens in his hand, angry at the world because it won't go hard, is furiously mashing his keyboard, in a fit of misdirected rage, wishing one of his own players to be crippled and I'm the one who needs to settle down?
 The fact that it's not only tolerated but defended, makes it all the more surreal.

This place really brings the warped saddos out in force.

<a class="username" data-user="52575, @Robbie Boy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/52575/">@Robbie Boy</a> I simply think it is out of order to be calling one of our players filth, scum, or wishing injury on them. Personally, I dont see how that has become such a radical, emotion, 'out there' opinion. Its the sort of thing I expect to see on RAWK, not Redcafe, and am surprised at how many people here are defending these sorts of post.

Again, the difference is that the player had just come on for his first appearance of the [pre]season. It wasnt a case of "isnt performing to the level expected of him" because the circumstances were different - it was simply a player that the fans didnt want at the club for whatever reason, being brought on by the manager for a game in preseason, and getting booed every time he touched the ball.


<a class="username" data-user="60684, @The Don" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/60684/">@The Don</a>

I know exactly what you mean. I am finding myself constantly having to defend an opinion which I feel should just be common sense. This thread is like a warphole to RAWK at times it seems.

6636~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a>. Who is defending any posts? Yes, wishing injury your own player or booing them is bad form, but it's life. You are merely taking a very very small sample of our fans and trying to make your case. I've seen some of your posts on Fellaini and you have no objectivity when it comes to the man. You act like everyone is out to get him. Look at the average ratings on here and you will see that Fellaini is par for the course in that respect. Most agree that he has played an important role this season but you clearly rate him way higher than the majority. I just don't understand why you're so heavily invested in one player and seem genuinely upset that a small section of fans booed him.

6637~~~
I doubt that I do rate Fellaini higher than most on here, and nor do I think that I lack objectivity - I have said several times he deserved to be sent off, and I have also said plenty of times over the course of the season in this and the matchday threads, when he has played poorly. I have said innumerable times that I simply dislike the double standards applied to Fellaini compared with other players in the squad, and that he gets a vastly disproportionate amount of criticism compared with others.
I am not "genuinely upset" about the booing that happened against Valencia - I used that situation as an example for some of my other points, but <a class="username" data-user="87150, @Roboc7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87150/">@Roboc7</a> and others started to defend it, which led to this discussion.

Contrary to popular belief, I didnt at the start of the season just draw a name from a hat and decide that Fellaini was going to be my agenda for the year - I was annoyed at the level of unwarranted abuse and criticism he got from the fans over the summer and early season, so I defended him, and that remains largely unchanged.

6638~~~
That's all well and good but I've seen you defend poor performances from him and try to blame others when he has played poor. That, to me, is a clear leak of objectivity. I'm still baffled at how and why you are so heavily invested in him. He was largely poor last season and the whole Moyes era left a very sour taste. Unfortunately Fellaini became the poster boy for that era. He was probably slated to an OTT extent by some, but I still don't understand why that bothers you. Evans gets lambasted constantly, do you defend him at every given chance? Carrick was derided at times during his career with us, yet he has always been an extremely valuable player. These things happen, football fans are fickle and anger will often be directed at one player, it probably isn't right but it's life. You seem to have a massive dislike for Falcao afterall and have used Welbeck to have digs at him.

You do rate him far higher than most. The consnsousnis is that he played an important role this season but he shouldn't be an automatic starter next; I very much doubt you agree with that.

6639~~~
Theres far worse things on the Internet. I think you're just being sensitive. Like the poster has already said, he knows its an overreaction and he doesn't genuinely wish someone would cripple a player. I'm sure you've never said anything that you would later retract as it offended some.

6640~~~
I agree when someone labels a few boos and ironic cheers as the most shameful and embarrassing incident they have ever witnessed as a utd fan it points to a lack of objectivity. Better and more experienced players have experienced worse than that.

6641~~~
Have some respect for Snake Plisken, he's the hero of the Third World War for Christ's sake.

6642~~~
No need for the running around waving imaginary cards.

6643~~~
Not quite. I have defended him when people have been citing Fellaini as the reason that our <i>team</i> plays badly - not the same thing by a long shot. Eg when we went 3 games without scoring, Fellaini was of course copping a fair bit of flak, whilst other attacking players (notably Mata and Herrera) were largely exempt from any real criticism, despite arguably contributing less. This is consistent with what I said previously about disproportionate criticism.

I agree with what you say regarding Moyes, and Fellaini becoming the poster boy for that era. Fellaini was not the signing we needed that summer, everyone knew that - including me - we wanted Kroos, Thiago or Fabregas, and we got Fellaini, and overpaid for him at that. This was Moyes' fault however, not Fellaini's. Most fans wanted and expected Fellaini to be gone last summer, LVG showed some faith in him and he has had a decent season, all things considered - it is worth remember that, that had the fans had their way, we may well have ended up finishing 7th again. LVG was perhaps the one person whose vision was not clouded by the previous season, he came into the club and everyone had a clean slate, and Fellaini has shown his worth. Also, I dont think he should be an automatic starter next season, but he should be in and around the first XI and depending on how he and the other players perform, may or may not be a regular starter. I dont think that that is the 'consensus' however, as plenty here have voiced their opinion that they want him gone this summer. I had hoped to reopen the poll I created in another thread after the season was finished, to gauge the consensus/opinion, but I dont think the mods want to.

The Falcao discussion isnt really relevant to this thread, but for what its worth, I have been impressed by Falcao's professionalism this season, and he seems like a top bloke. It didnt work out for him with us, I wish him well for the future (this is not the same as booing him or calling him filth).

6644~~~
A horrendous tackle and completely needless given the circumstances of the match. It could come back to haunt him next season as he'll now have a three match ban and someone could come in and take his spot.

6645~~~
I don't give a flying feck if there is or isn't. This isn't 4chan, it's RedCafe, one of the most respected football sites on the internet. These posts are visible to the public. The general quality of the football forums are bad enough, with all the negativity, moaning and groaning about everything under the sun. Now we've stooped to the level of Bluemoon and RAWK, with trash posts like this.

Overreaction? I tell you what, there's a massive difference between overreacting in real life an doing it on a discussion forum. IRL, it's an instant reaction, this clown, however, had to think about what he was going to write, probably a couple of times, yet still chose to post it anyway.
If it was a bad joke, or an ironic post that didn't hit the mark, fair enough, it happens, but to actually think about one of your own players being crippled, (yes, crippled. As in loss of the use of his limbs and therefore loss of career, loss of earnings and life and quality of life as he knows it, all gone) to actually think about it, decide it would be a good thing to happen, then share those thoughts with thousands of people on a football forum, especially one as popular as this...wow. Its too far for me. Way too far.
I mean this isn't some young nerd on reddit/4chan/9gag etc. posting for shock value and attention, he was sharing his own thoughts on a football player. Christ alive.

I honestly think he should apologise to each and every person who had the misfortune to read it.

I mentioned a permaban, for bringing the football forums into disrepute but tbh, a stern warning about never repeating such behaviour would be better. Everyone deserves a second chance but only after they've wrung out for their indiscretions.

6646~~~
the scouser got banned for it...and rightly so.

having said that...Fellani was very stupid to do what he did and deserves the ban he will get.

6647~~~
If he's a consistent starter for United next season, I would expect Guardiola to be replacing LVG in the summer.  He's not a player United should build the team around or work to accommodate.  He's a useful plan B or squad player, but he's not what United need to be about.  United will not win the league with him as a regular starter.

6648~~~
he is a versatile player..a top option to have.

I dont see a problem if he plays the majority of games.

6649~~~
I'm not so sure. He isn't the problem. Losing Carrick was the problem. We played some of our best football in years, with Fellaini in the team. The Spurs, Liverpool and City matches, were the best I've seen Man Utd play in years. Certainly it's the most dominant, in terms of possession I've ever seen us against big rivals. Fellaini was instrumental in that. 
As long as Carrick, or a suitable replacement is in the team, I see no reason not to continue with that formation and personnel. 
Don't forget, LVG doesn't pick players based on reputation or level of ability, but how well the fit his philosophy and follow his instructions.

Now, could we find a player better than Fellaini to fill his role? Most likely but he's done very well and there is no reason why he couldn't be a starter in a championship winning team.

6650~~~
Yes because of their overall contributions to the club. And they're not the same type of tackler, yes both made crunching tackles but Scholes' tackles were not on the levels of severity as Keane's. And that's not to say that the bad tackles they've made are pardoned, only outweighed by their positive contributions. Now that may not be right, but that's the way it is. The difference between Fellaini and the players you mentioned is they performed for more than 4 or 5 games in a row at a time. 

This sums up your fanaticism. In your mind there was never any sort of case, but yet you still have a problem with people trying to look at a questionable incident. Spitting is a deplorable thing to do, and whether he did it or not (I can't even remember it happening) I have no problem with people, regardless of the club they support, seriously looking at it to find a verdict.

I do agree with you that the booing is terrible, although maybe I don't feel quite as strongly about it as you do.

6651~~~
I dont have anything against having him in the squad,he gives us other options,also even if opposition focus on how to stop him (take Chelsea game),we can learn how to use that situation as advantage for our other players to take,for example Zouma in that game left tones of space in front due him being glued to Afroman. I dont think he will be in 1st XI always next season but we will see i guess.

6652~~~
This seems a bit contradictory - you dont remember the incident but are calling me a fanatic based on a comment about it (the incident). Could it not be that the reason you dont remember it was because it was such a clear cut 'no case to answer' type of thing, and very little was made of it in the media? But if ole' Walrus says the same, then it is deemed fanaticism and me being so blinkered that I refuse to accept any opinion that contradicts my own.

Regarding Keane and Scholes, you say yourself that the bad tackles they have made are pardoned due to their positive contributions. That is fine, but it proves (if it needed proving) that the fans opinions of a player (with regard to how good they are, and how much they like them) will have an impact on their reaction to said player doing something stupid. If it sounds obvious then thats because it is. Apply this a bit further and it isnt really a stretch to then say that at the other end of the scale, if you have a player that a lot of the fans have had a historic dislike for, since day one, then this too will have an impact on how they react if that player does something stupid.

The short and simple version is what I said before, and is really all I have been trying to say over the last two pages - that Fellaini receives a disproportionate amount of criticism and abuse from the fans compared with other players. But apparently saying that makes me some sort of religious afro-fanatic.

6653~~~
your right that hes a versatile player but that is were the problem is, he'll be used for that versatility always regardless of other options.

6654~~~
People who keep saying he has been lucky and 'gotten away' with potential cards and stuff this season need to realise how often he (unfairly) got cards and fouls given against him purely because of his size. It more than evens out I would say. I hope he continues to start matches/performs next season just to continue to burn away at some of the posters in here.

6655~~~
anything over 15m and i pull the trigger. i dont want his skillset giving any ideas to the manager.

6656~~~
Spot on in my opinion. Carrick's injury was the key to our abysmal three losses in a row in my opinion, with him I'm confident we would have finished second or at least third.

6657~~~
You are putting far too much into this.

6658~~~
WOW this thread went out of control very quick.
I think wanting any player not just a United player crippled is appalling . We are not RAWK or Bluemoon. 
But I see Snake Plissken has admitted it was an over reaction.

6659~~~
His tackling is more often than not miss timed and his hold up play is generally very poor because his ball control is one of the worst I've ever seen from a United player. When the ball is played up to him, he invariably ends up chasing back up the pitch after his own first touch. If Fellaini has the ball, or if the ball is passed to him, and you see a team mate make a good run or take up a good position, you naturally expect Fellaini not to be able to find them. In fact you expect him not to even try to. He will ignore them and go backwards, or he'll control the ball off for a throw in on the opposite side of the pitch. This is not the sign of a good or effective player. 

He was useful for a bit when he played him in an advanced role on the left, just inside Young, because opposition teams didn't seem to know what to do about it and their fullback would end up trying to mark him and Young at the same time....but it worked for like, three games, and then teams just started putting an extra man over there and letting us hoof the ball to him. As soon as he stopped being left in an acre of space for half of each game he went back to being oafish and ineffective.

He's also useful at heading in crosses, which is a good thing, but I don't consider that a few headed goals a season offsets the many negatives he brings to the team. Maybe if he got 30 goals a year doing this, instead of, you know, about 4, but he doesn't. Instead you have things like that run of games where we stopped playing football entirely in order to punt crosses at him when he was stood too wide to do anything with them anyway. Or the many games where he's been the least useful player on the pitch and offered nothing. Or the countless times in every game where one of our attacks is stifled because Fellaini doesn't know how to play a forward pass. Or the lingering threat that he might do something incredibly thick and get sent off (in fairness, this seems to apply to about half our team). 

The hoof ball tactics work as a variation where there's something about them to catch the opposition out, but you can't actualy play Fellaini up front because he isn't good enough, and you can't play him in midfield because he isn't good enough there either. So he ends up being given some special role where he just sort of stands there challenging for headers, as if he were a tree. I'd rather we just put a footballer in the team personally. We're not a pub side.

I'm probably being a bit harsh but I've given him 2 years and I've not seen anything to suggest he should be a United player...he becomes a United player if we drop our standards enough to allow him to be, basically.

6660~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> in my opinion you are exaggerating his weaknesses and undervaluing his strengths there. Not going to type up a long drawn out post because it has all been said before, but;

For example, where you say that he is "good at heading in crosses", I would say that he adds a whole new angle to our attack, and that we have seen plenty of times in the past that without any genuine aerial threat, teams are happy to just show us down the flanks and defend the central areas, and we cannot break it down regardless of how many crosses we put in. Furthermore, his aerial strength has been a major asset for us on defending set pieces and corners.

You are saying we stopped playing football in order to punt crosses at him - but this is simply not true, and I suspect you probably know that as well and are just saying it for dramatic effect.

You say that there has been several games where he has been the least useful player on the pitch and offered nothing - but I dont think that is true either, as like I said, even when he isnt directly involved, he is an asset on defending set pieces and his aerial presence forces opponents to defend wide areas, which creates space for other players. If anything, I generally apportion more of the blame on those other players, who have <i>not</i> had opponents specifically man marking them, have <i>not</i> had the opposition pretty much setting out to stop them, and have still failed to produce anything (I am primarily referring to the three games without scoring).

Your description of his "special role" is also pretty biased as well, as it was this "special role" which was crucial to our success in most of our best periods this season. Where you seem to think it is a problem for us to have a unique player, I see it as a benefit to have that in the squad, and that it gives the manager options that other teams do not have.

His ball control, there isnt much I can really say here except that if Fellaini's ball control is the worst you have ever seen, I would question how many players you have actually seen. If you are interested, skip back through this thread and you will see absolutely loads of comments by posters who are/were pleasantly surprised by his technical ability on the ball.

Basically you are just being massively biased - you say yourself that you are probably being "a bit harsh" and I think the reality is that it is a lot more than "a bit".

Didn't realise McShane was hurt that bad.

6662~~~
He's a Peter Crouch, Niall Quinn, Tony Cascarino clone.........He's every mid-table managers wet dream......he doesn't really have a position apart from attacking set pieces and crosses and he is the best in the business at that.....defenders hate playing against him as they get lumps kicked out of them when they face him........Fellaini is probably the reason that Moyes got the Utd gig as Fellaini won Everton so many points for so many years from crosses and set pieces that he was practically a one man team there which possibly made Moyes out to look a lot better than he was....Fellaini is a wonderful option for us to come off the bench for the last 10 minutes if we need to go route one but he should never be more than a last 10 minute player at a club like Utd...I think we'll snap the hands off anyone willing to pay 15 million for him but Van Gaal might see him as a super sub for next season

6663~~~
That's weird. Did he get stitched up when he was still on the pitch? Surely not. They'd have to give it a good clean first. So why's he still wearing socks/shorts in that photo?

Nasty gash though. Brave bloke to finish the game with a hole that big in his thigh.

6664~~~
I feel bad for really wanting him to leave the club, he's been good this season and has scored some vital goals but I agree with a lot of other posters in this thread that we need to move on and if we want to dominate European football again I don't see him as part of the plans unless he is used in a plan B bit part role. Barcelona passing us off the park, throw him on and lump it..see how they deal with that.

Should have stuck with that.  Fecking Mad Walrus.

Yeah, looks like he was stitched up on the pitch and he suffered a nasty head injury too. Even though it was an extremely important match, it was extremely courageous of him to stay on, with a cut on the head and a huge gash on his legs.

They used staples?! Christ. You normally only use them in scalp wounds. He's gonna have a doozy of a scar.

Good stuff, and it's hard to disagree with majority of it.

I am bit lazy to check, I might do it tomorrow, but it would be interesting to see Fellaini's passing, the percentage of his forward passes, passes longer than 2 meters, those graphics that show his all passes on the pitch and stuff like that. I bet it's easily the worst in the team. Probably the least impressive from any player out of top4 teams. Or top 10. I think someone like Cleverley is Xavi esque in comparision with him when it comes to ceative passing.

6670~~~
Fellaini should just go. It's become the hipster thing to rate him, and claim he's under rated. No other top European side would entertain the idea of having a player like him in the squad.

Seriously, name one top European side Fellaini would get a game for? That's the level we aspire to be at.

6671~~~
I don't think he's god's gift but this is over the top. We had worse players in the squad when we won our last 2 UCLs. Hell Barcelona had Seydou Keita in the squad both times they schooled us in the UCL, he even played against us in the final in 2009. Not a bad player by any means but in terms of talent and impact he was no better than Fellaini. A well over the hill Guðjohnsen was also in the squad that night and played 34 games for Barcelona that season (scoring 4 goals). Fellaini's contribution this season has far outweighed that, he's comfortably good enough and useful enough to warrant a squad place. That's all the vast majority of the people defending him are saying, very few, if any, are claiming that he's the quality of player who'll win us UCLs as a starter.

6672~~~
Chelsea.

Stupid post.

6673~~~
There is no reason why he can't improve on his weaknesses this off season, and come back with a bigger chip on his shoulder. 

I've read the last few pages of this thread. Jesus, every goal he scored must have been twisting the dagger even more in the hearts of his detractors.

6674~~~
The fact that several teams felt the need to change their entire system to deal with Fellaini shows that he is nowhere near as ineffective as you make out - you dont bother doing that for players who cant control the ball or pass. It is no coincidence that Young played his best football towards the end of the season - he directly benefited from teams putting a man on Fellaini as it gave him a lot more space and opportunity to go 1 vs 1 against the fullback.

When we played our best football of the whole season, Fellaini was integral to it and that wasnt any form of hoof ball either.

6676~~~
I'd ignored this thread for a while because it seemed most people had finally realised that Fellaini was an important member of the squad, but reading the past few pages it seems a lot of the same bullshit myths about Fellaini that I thought were forgotten are coming back again.

Ye he made a ridiculous challenge on Sunday and deserves some stick for that, but he's had a very good season and been one of our more consistent performers scoring and making some vital goals along the way. He'll be here next season, and to those who arent happy about that - tough shit!

6677~~~
He get's sent off in a dead rubber game and should be sold and is now crap? Where were all of you during his run of form, and when he scored the goal that got us into the champions league?

6678~~~
Don't get the motive behind some of the posts. Instead of promoting actual debate, you get posts like - "dagger even more in the hearts of his detractors.", "I hope he stays and does well just to piss off the haters' etc.

Forums are supposed to promote the culture of exchanging opinions right ? To be fair - this applies to both sides of the argument (seemingly pro or anti) - but since I can only speak for myself, there is no innuendo against certain players for the most part. But one does get the impression that a lot of times, genuine criticism is often dismissed without realizing that we're United fans too, and support the club's best interest in our own way. Supporting the club doesn't just extend to aligning with certain players, being antagonistic or calling the detractors bullshit myth merchants and the like, and giving self-congratulatory pats, mostly because they don't admire a couple of the players in our squad.

For those arguing that we had sucky players in the past. Is that what we should be aiming for ideally ? Players who are almost as bad as some of our worst players when we won the European Cups. Isn't squad building about continual improvement year in and year out ? Also working on his weaknesses in the off-season ? His technical shortcoming are incredibly deep rooted, and for a player like that, you will have to essentially strip him down to the basics, overhaul his playing style and rewire him completely to transform him into a more cultured version of himself. Let's be honest, he is who he is (some prefer it, some don't - to each his/ her own), and it ain't gonna change. You can reprogram a youth team player or even someone fresh to first team football, and even that takes substantial effort from both the player and coach's end. But you just can't do that with a grown ass man of almost 28, who is supposed to be at his peak in terms of performances and is set in his ways.

The argument that he won't fit into most top European clubs isn't just a qualitative one, but has more to do with a stylistic match. The fact remains that no Top 5 European club launches balls to their #10/ midfield player, or have a player in that position who's similar to him in terms of playing style and qualities. Most of them are inventive, with great passing range, and can control the momentum of matches. You could put Herrera in Madrid or Bayern or Barcelona's team for Isco or Schweinsteiger or Rakitic, and he won't look out of place in the slightest. Could one honestly say that about our favorite Belgian ? And that technical, progressive football approach is the template we should be looking at, instead of forcing ill-suited players into a 4-3-3 possession based system whose effectiveness nosedives when the aerial supply is cut off. For those who argue that Van Gaal knows better and the critics of Fellaini are mentalists who can't chat sense, let's also bear in mind that a lot of the manager's decisions have been strange, to put it mildly.

Also, some of the points to validate his continued presence are really ill-informed. In terms of talent and impact, Keita was no better than Fellaini ? Is this real life ? He was several notches above Fellaini from a technical and footballing standpoint, which made him suited to a possession based system. This is someone who was one of the the best players in the 1999 U-20 World Cup which had the likes of Ronaldinho, Xavi, Cambiasso, and was rated the best talent in Africa. Was one of the best defensive midfielders around in the mid 2000s, had almost 50 European appearances before signing for Barcelona, was one of the best midfielders in La Liga for a Sevilla team that beat Madrid twice, including 6-3 in the Supercopa, beat Arsenal in the Champions League, were reigning Copa and UEFA Cup winners. And he was easily their best player behind a certain Dani Alves.

By the time it got round to 2011, or even 2009, he was nowhere near the player you describe. He was a good, solid squad player in a team which was filled with players who were amongst the best in the world in their positions. Keita did his job and stepped in as very capable back-up when he was needed (which sometimes was quite a lot because of the number of substitute performances he made and injuries to other players) but it's revisionism to claim that he was a great or decisive player at Barca, despite his earlier achievements. He was a cog in a machine in a role a lot of players could have played. Which isn't necessarily a criticism, it's just in stark contrast to what Fellaini's done for us this season which is put in performances and scored goals that have won us points we sorely needed - that's what I mean by 'impact'. Saying he was more talented was going too far, but his specific skillset has been more vital for us in getting fourth this season then Keita's specific skillset ever was for Barca. He's worth keeping as a squad player because he's been one of our key players this season, and because players with his attributes are rare. That is, unless we're going to spend £25m - £30m on someone else to sit on the bench in his place on top of however much we end up spending on a midfielder to slot into the first team.

6680~~~
Fellaini is very good in both penalty areas, but anywhere else he is pretty useless unless he is fouling the opposition player. Don't want him as a starter next season. I am struggling to think of another top team he would get into, home or abroad.

6681~~~
Eh ? He was every bit as good as advertised. People have tendency to constantly undermine the likes of him or Abidal or Mascherano, when they could've started for most of the other European elite. Consistently playing 40+ matches for arguably the best team in the modern era as the primary midfield backup to Iniesta and Xavi and Busquets is no joke, and it certainly doesn't warrant anything resembling a talent/ ability based comparison to Fellaini, like you did in the previous post. And I quote - "Not a bad player by any means but <span style="text-decoration: underline">in terms of talent and impact he was no better than Fellaini</span>".

6682~~~
I think he'd have played the same role for any of the big European clubs that he did for Barca - a good, well-rounded squad player who was never quite good enough to be a fixture in the starting XI when everyone else was fit. That's not to say I'd not have taken him in a second at United at that time given the state of our midfield depth. On your second point, obviously it's no joke to be back-up to those players, but at the same time it's a far easier job playing alongside Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta et al than it is playing with lesser team-mates. The 'he played for Barca' factor goes both ways, Touré looked like a great defensive midfielder at Barcelona but without those players around him he was a complete liability in that role for City. Keita was a jack-of-all-trades sort of midfielder, his value came more in his ability to play multiple midfield roles to a good level and keeping the machine working rather than actually making a difference in and of himself. It's obviously important to have those kind of players in your squad, but if all your back-up players are just worse versions of your starting XI, what do you do when Plan A's not working? That's where Fellaini's value lies, as well as being (in my opinion) decent midfield back-up.

As for the talent comment, I took that back in the post you partially quoted. If you wanna keep banging a drum about it, go ahead.

6683~~~
Not one great team has ever had to rely on long balls to target men as a plan b. The great teams of the last 2 decades Barca 09-12, United 06-09, Bayern 12-13, Arsenal 2004, AC Milan 03-07, Chelsea 04-08 all mixed it up when their plan a wasn't working, not a single team needed a guy with Fellaini's values.

Using Fellaini as a plan b is just as ridiculous as starting him imo. So unnecessary, especially when the other team just put's a Kurt Zouma on him and renders him absolutely useless.

6684~~~
Come now, same role for other teams and just a squad player ? Keita would have started for the likes of Real Madrid, Arsenal and Bayern Munich for a lot of his Barcelona time-frame, if you care to look up their squads.

That is not a universally applicable observation. Conversely, it is easier to stand to stand out in a weaker team in relative terms, than alongside Xavi or Iniesta, where a player of inferior quality will immediately stick out like a sore thumb. eg. Kaladze alongside Maldini and Nesta, or Illramendi alongside Modric and Alonso.

Keita and Fellaini aren't comparable at all from that perspective. It's like saying Fellaini is our new Solskjaer or Park Ji Sung. You could use Keita and Solkskjaer or Park and they would seamlessly fit into whatever tactical setup you want because of their rounded games. Every time Fellaini is on the field, we have to make unnecessary adjustments to accommodate him, lose a lot of intricate creativity in the final third, and we have to mask his deficiencies.

He is a classic tweener stuck between positions - on the positive side, he has some odd qualities, but is not a good enough #10, not a good enough attacking midfielder, and not a good enough defensive midfielder (Van Gaal stuck Ander there with injuries to Carrck and Blind) for a club of United's stature. For all the 6 goals he's scored, he doesn't have a great influence on the game overall, can't control the direction of play, isn't very clinical. Why does aerial bombardment and sticking a wardrobe up front have to be be the regular contingency Plan B ? Did Fergie use hoof tactics upfront with a limited giant ? Do some of the other elite teams around use that tactic ? It's a bog standard approach to playing football, something we ridiculed other clubs for, and now it's being lapped up and sugarcoated as viable Plan B.

Quoting a post once is equated with banging the drum now ? You made a laughable assessment of Keita, and even after 'taking that back', continue to undermine his quality by stating his performances were inflated by the presence of Xavi and Busquets and Iniesta, and we would be a backup for teams not named Barcelona, when that was clearly not the case. But ok, if you want to underrate a far superior player, just to make a case for Fellaini, then fine by me.

6685~~~
That's not what we do when Fellaini's on the field though. He's a target for back-post crosses, great at defending and attacking set pieces and a handy out-ball for when we we're being pressed. Regardless, the bolded is something Pep's Barca and Del Bosque's Spain did a fair bit when their possession wasn't paying off and they needed a win. Pique would just stand around in the box and they'd chuck high balls towards him. Not that it really worked, because Pique wasn't even that good in the air, but they still did it when they felt they needed to. Both teams were rightly criticised at the time for not having the versatility to change tack. On the other examples - that Chelsea team never had any problem with booting it forward in the hopes that Drogba would muscle his defender out of the way, Bayern switched being possession and counter-attacking football almost constantly and were good enough at both not to need any other plans. If the rest of our team were as good as that Bayern team I'd sell Fellaini in a second. Unfortunately we're not and we might need him as we have this season. Like I said above, I don't want him starting particularly, I just don't see the point of throwing away a tactical option and spending money on a new squad player when we've already got one who's done very well for us this season.

As for your last point, if we bring on Fellaini and the other team man-marks him then he's done half of his job - being a physical presence and creating space for other players to work in. He did that against Chelsea and it wasn't his fault no-one made the most of it.

<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> - just briefly on the third bit you quoted. That's exactly the point I'm making. You need versatile back-up, but you also need people you can bring on to bring a different dimension, whatever else Keita was, he wasn't that. I'd disagree that we've changed our play style to incorporate Fellaini, we've put in more back-post crosses but frankly you'd be daft not to with him in the team because it works. As many people pointed out months ago, our style of play with and without Fellaini in the team has basically been the same, it's just less effective when he's not playing.

Our best football and the best run of results we've seen this season was all played with him in the team. The left-side partnership he made with Blind/Shaw and Young crafted many of our best moves during that winning streak and overshadowed Herrera and Mata's partnership with Valencia on the right. He can clearly play football, even if he's not as graceful on the ball as the likes of Mata or Herrera. It's a game of opinions, but somewhere between him completely nullifying Cesc Fabregas/assisting the equaliser against Chelsea, scoring his 2nd league goal to get the 3 points against Stoke and scoring his 7th goal of the season to win us 3 points against Palace, he convinced me he had something to offer. And again, I'm not even one of the people (if there are any) that particularly wants to see him start next season.

6686~~~
When we got to the final both times none of our regular midfield options were as poor technically as Fellaini. Gudjohnson was streets ahead of Fellaini at passing the ball and playing the way Barca did. And Keita was great, he would of been a starter for most other sides in Europe.

Chelsea? Ahead of who? Mourinho wouldn't have someone that poor on the ball regularly start. He could maybe take Mikels place on the bench, but no danger is he a regular starter.

Stupid post.

6687~~~
I think you are being a bit one sided in your first two paragraphs here Invictus - as you say, this applies (or should apply) to both sides of the argument. I have been trying to engage in reasoned and objective discussion on here for months with very little success. I am just as tired of repeating the same old arguments as everyone else probably is of reading them - but nobody seems willing or able to respond in any objective sense.
All I tend to see is <i>"Fellaini is a donkey, he is the most technically limited player to ever set foot on a football pitch and cant do anything but elbow people and head in crosses."</i> This is obviously not factually correct or objective in any way. I have never dismissed or complained about what I see as <i>genuine</i> criticism. Perhaps your comments in that paragraph are not aimed at me particularly, but nonetheless I feel the exact same way about the anti-Fellaini crowd.

I have laid out my arguments time and time again in this thread, and I invite you (or anyone else) to respond to them. Rather than dig up an old post, I will summise them here;

<ul>
<li>Fellaini offers a unique option for us which other players in his role do not. This in itself is a valuable asset that a shrewd manager can take advantage of, tactically.</li>
<li>Fellaini is a constant threat on attacking <i>and defending</i> set pieces, moreso than almost any other outfield player.</li>
<li>And this is an important one - having Fellaini on the pitch forces opponents to change the way they defend. We saw last year that teams were happy to simply show us down the flanks and defend the central areas, in the knowledge that we could swing in crosses all day long and they would clear them. Having a genuine aerial threat changes this, and our best performances this season have been examples of this. Opponents were forced to defend the wide areas, which created space in other areas of the pitch for our other attacking players to exploit. In our best games we attacked both from wide areas and central ones, and Fellaini's role was integral in this.</li>
<li>Fellaini's technical ability and passing is average, and not half as bad as some on here are making out. We have seen over the course of the season several key passes and involvement from Fellaini in linkup play. I find the criticisms of his passing to be odd because a) he isnt in the team to be our playmaker, and b) he tends to play in a very advanced role high up the pitch, so of course he will have more backwards passes.</li>
<li>Fellaini has shown fantastic mental strength and attitude to play his way into the first XI this season after nearly being sold and being booed by our own fans in preseason. We need strong characters like this in the team, we have seen what can happen to mentally fragile players in the PL.</li>
<li>Related to the previous point, Fellaini never hides on the pitch. Even if he or the team is playing poorly, he will still show for the ball and contribute to the game when we have seen other players simply go missing altogether.</li>
<li>Final point on mentality, Fellaini is a big-game player. He was our MotM in the first game against Chelsea (and this was in the DM role that his critics claim he cannot play, marking Fabregas off the pitch), and one of the best against City and Arsenal in the first half of the season to name but a few. Fellaini's best games have normally come against the big clubs (based on this, I find it strange that people assume that he would be useless in the CL.)</li>
<li>Fellaini is a good target for long balls which helps us to retain possession in situations where we need to play it long. It also gives us a backup plan if we are chasing the game, to play it long to Fellaini.</li>
<li>Fellaini has been one of our better outfield players this season and has been the player that opponents (such as Chelsea) have marked out and specifically set out to counter. Our best form in the first half of the season coincided almost perfectly with Fellaini's run in the team, and he has been integral in most of our best performances.</li>
<li>Fellaini receives a disproportionate amount of criticism and abuse relative to his performances and other players.</li>
</ul>
As I said, this is just a summary of some of things I have been saying for months in this thread. I may have missed some things, but the above should be sufficient for now.

I am not going to debate the Fellaini/Keita comparison that has developed, because I see it as a bit pointless. Not least because Fellaini is a pretty unique player in what he offers, and hence making valid comparisons to other players in any sort of detail can be quite tricky. Also I didnt watch enough of Keita at Barcelona to really have an informed opinion.

Thank you for taking the time to construct a reasoned post.

6688~~~
He's so dangerous with crosses and set pieces that he is a good option to have come off the bench for the last 10 minutes of a game. We paid 15 million too much for him and we didn't need him but such was the dross we had in our forward line this year that he actually was an integral part of our team this year....I can't see him being in the team next season but he'd be very useful in away games to Stoke and West Brom next season when you need a nut-job or two to stand up to their physicality

6689~~~
The "dagger in the heart" comment was aimed at those who are actually upset that Fellaini managed to turn his fortunes around at the club. For that I make no apologies; I expect United fans to get behind the club and support the players who wear the shirt. Of course we all want the club to improve the squad but when that criteria is applied arbitrarily to certain scapegoats (cf Fellaini, Young) then the hypocrisy shines through.

We should be aiming for a world class team. A world class team doesn't necessarily mean we have world class players at every position within our starting 11. I know for a fact that the top teams of Europe today and yesteryear don't fulfill that criteria. He had a good season, better than most of our players, so "technical weaknesses" aside, I don't see a reason why he won't be included in preliminary discussions regarding where we plan to be in 5 years. If he can't make the necessary adjustments, someone else will take his place. But he has earned the right, more than most players we have, to fight for a spot in our long term plans.

And players have reinvented themselves throughout history. Scholes and Giggs managed to do it for us. Xavi burst into prominence at 28. No I'm not suggesting... FFS. I'm just saying, saying he is set in his ways is not a given. I expect LVG to sit down with him and say, "Fellaini, you had a good season. Here is how you can improve. Are you up to it?" Let's see if he steps up. Why wouldn't I want that to happen? 

Meh, feck stylistics. We had one of our best spells of football with Fellaini in the team, being very prominent. There's no question about his ability to aid the sexiness of the team when played properly.

Also, you overrate Herrara if you think he can slot into Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, or Barcelona without being noticed (for bad). He has not displayed enough for us to indicate he can function in the best midfields of the world. Carrick was the better midfielder this season, and if I made that comment now or 5 years ago (when Carrick was the better player) I would be laughed out of the room. 

You overrate Keita also. A lot of players have shined in U-20 World Cups. He was not one of the best defensive midfielders in the mid 2000s when Makelele, Redondo et al were still playing, he was in the lower tier at the very most. The Madrid team that Sevilla beat was that era's version of Arsenal; unable to make it past the group stage in Europe. I dispute that he was the best player behind Alves, Kanoute was excellent for that side as well. I think he was a very good player at Sevilla who was able to fill in gaps in Barcelona's team. 

Fellaini, contrary to some posts to this thread, is not an obstacle standing between us and free flowing football. That assumption is ridiculous. And if we're that adamant on pruning the squad for quality purposes, based on the fact that players won't get into other top squads in Europe, then pray tell, how many players do we have that'll get into the top squads in Europe? Let's see... on current form, DDG... ok I'm struggling. Luckily great teams aren't built that way. And they're definitely not built by targeting top performers from the last season based on aesthetic criteria!

6690~~~
Please don't exaggerate what I said. Did I say we need world class players at every position ? Also contrary to popular wisdom - as things stands, there has been a talent accumulation war that's been raging on for a few years now at the highest level of the sport, and there's been a sea change at that level of of European football in the past 5 years or so, with a lot of the older impressions becoming outdated. If you look at teams that have consistently contended for the European title every single year (not flash in the pan teams like Dortmund, Atletico, Juventus that didn't sustain a level of success), and have reached the semi-finals or beyond 4-5 times in the last half decade, they are absolutely stacked with top notch quality throughout the starting XI, or have an attack so outrageously brilliant that they can win even with sub-world class backlines. 

As these teams have progressed, at full strength, one would be hard pressed to find a lot of players who aren't either world class, or potentially world class, or just a notch below world class. There are only so many basic players a top echelon team carries these days. eg. In Bayern Munich's ideal starting XI (not factoring in injuries), how many above average players (ones similar in terms of quality to Fellaini) can you actually name ? That is the kind of competition we're facing if the club has genuine aspirations for challenging regularly, and maybe winning another European Cup in the near future. Our historical European rivals are widening the talent gap every year, so being of the mindset that simply being better than some of our under-performing players is good enough for a player, or that we owe him something is essentially a romantic notion that will hinder the club from fulfilling its potential.

And bollocks to the Scholes/ Giggs comparison honestly. These are two of the most extreme examples anyone could every bring up as a United supporter, almost bordering on offensive status. These were two of the most intelligent, technically gifted, decorated players, consistently world class players to grace the club. And even they didn't overhaul their games. The technique was always there, just needed tweaking as they adjusted to a new position. Another one in Xavi. He didn't burst onto the scene at 28. He had been borderline elite since age 23, and definitely world class since age 25. Again extreme examples, one of the greatest players ever. Fellaini stepping up is still not good enough, because he's just not that great potentially, the raw material just isn't there and the weaknesses are too glaring.

No, you don't feck the stylistics. Visual appeal is a big deal for people who watch the sport as a form of recreation. There are definite questions about his ability to aid the sexiness. Put a half decent physical marker on him, and the man can't contribute enough to the game from an offensive/ creative standpoint, even though he plays in a pseudo #10 position. 

And no, Herrera is not being overrated here. He has displayed enough in his career with Zaragoza and Athletic Club, and with the Spanish U teams to form that opinion. This is someone who was one of the best attacking midfielders in La Liga last season, and showed brilliants quality while playing alongside Thiago and Javi and Mata at the international level. He would fit seamlessly into any of those clubs. Barcelona were even interested in signing him back in 2013 : <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.insidespanishfootball.com/58016/barcelona-eyeing-athletic-bilbaos-ander-herrera/" target="_blank">http://www.insidespanishfootball.com/58016/barcelona-eyeing-athletic-bilbaos-ander-herrera/</a>

Definitely not overrating Keita, he was among the best talents at his position. As for Redondo, he declined after leaving Real in 2000 and played like 10 matches for Milan before retiring. The mid 2000s was definitely not his era. Playing 40+ games every season for the best club team of the modern era wasn't filling the gaps, he was an integral part of the first 12-13 including immediate subs and relief. Honestly, can even the most disillusioned Fellaini supporter say that he would've been targeted by Pep's Guardiola or brought on as a viable sub for Busquets or Xavi on a more than regular basis ? And that Madrid team was still full of quality, won the Liga, and beat Barcelona 5-1 on aggregate in the league.

As for the rest, I'll just say this - substandard quality is still substandard quality in the grand scheme of things, even if there's yet more substandard quality around it. Just because we have other scrubs doesn't mean he's a good enough player for United. And yeah, luckily great teams are built by retaining average plonkers and pushing the idea of them being viable starters... Have we learnt nothing from the squad's decline in the past few seasons where only Fergie's presence was holding the team tearing itself apart at the teams and filled to the brim with players who wouldn't have made into some of our great teams of the past.

6691~~~
Let's accept we got rinsed and cut our loses. The guy can't play, it really is that simple. Unless if we have ambitions of playing long balls to him and that's useless too as he doesn't have attackers instincts. Just get rid.

6692~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> I'm on my phone so I can't give a detailed reply, but I've seen enough disparities between Football Manager lineups and summer transfers on here over the years to know that muppet overhauls are a pipe dream. I'll be shocked if Fellaini is a target given his past season, unless stupid money is offered for him and he wants to leave.

6693~~~
Your tagline should say <i>"Oppressive White Male"</i>

6694~~~
Fair enough.

And you're most probably right. Overhauling the team in one summer might not be realistic, or advisable. We might be better served having a more organic transition, and churning the squad players at a slower rate. And for what it's worth, IMO some of us will just have to agree to disagree, purely because of the cyclical nature of most arguments in the thread - a consensus might well be impossible. Ultimately, it's just down to subjective opinions, and individual preferences for what United's ambitions, or playing style should be like in the short-medium-long term. There might actually be no right or wrong perspective here. I mean, what do I know ? He might well be important to our potential success next season with some late winners. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Tagging the same to <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> who's been defensing him in whirlwind style™.

6695~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> I would be interested to hear your thoughts on the points I set out in my previous post, regarding what Fellaini brings to the team etc. Your argument seems to revolve around very rigid concepts of what a player of a particular position must do, what their strengths and weaknesses are etc, whereas I on the other hand think that at the very least, Fellaini should be kept in the squad because he provides unique options and threats which will not typically be available to other teams.

I agree that there is no common consensus - and there have been plenty of objective anti-Fellaini posts in here which I do not reply to because they at least represent reasoned and objective criticism. The thing that irks me is effectively the same as what you described in your post last night (I think) - which is when objectivity goes out of the window and people portray extremely biased, exaggerated opinions as though they are fact.

6696~~~
What's to argue? 

Fellaini is a useful change of pace who is not good enough to be a starter for a team at the highest level of European football.

6697~~~
I agree with this.

I've gone from wanting rid of him to thinking that he's a decent backup and a good plan B if we need something a little different. If we want to be winning the title or the Champions League though we aren't going to be successful with Fellaini starting every week.

6698~~~
This.

Fellaini is (and always has been) good enough to be a squad player here. No more, no less.

His style of play also lends itself to that role as he doesn't fit with what we might want to see from our Plan A but is different (and effective) enough to be a worthwhile Plan B.

Buying new midfielders and moving Fellaini into a squad role is very obviously the smart and fair thing to do at this point, as it probably was ever since we signed him. Weird that the debate is still going on really...

6699~~~
I'd rather just see Mata or Di Maria central more, but it seems like Van Gaal wants to play 4-5-1 and win the league by beating everyone 1-0 with 70% possession, so Fellaini should be a good backup for Herrera and the new CM we need to sign this summer.

6700~~~
Just as an aside of a question.  If his best (only) position is AM #10 getting forward to hang about on the back post or for long diagonals out of defence/deep MF. Why isn't he a centre forward?  (think I do know the answer to this, tbh)

Which reminds me, that in the poll, I forgot to nominate his cameo up top, supported by leading English League strikers of their generation, RVP & Rooney, as weirdest moment of the season.

6701~~~
Ok.

Personally, not a big fan of super-unique options just for the sake of variety. And even if one values uniqueness, he is mostly unique in terms or his height and ability to accurately chest the ball as a late sub, I think we can agree to that to a certain extent. My main problem with that is the level of effectiveness he provides. If we want someone who can be the weapon-X when we are chasing games, can't we aim for someone who's more clinical in effect ? Someone like say Llorente who's a cultured attacker used to playing with his backs to the wall and consistently scoring goals ? Wouldn't that be a more appropriate aerial Plan B ?

Can't really disagree with this. That said, should be place a lot of importance on midfielders being a big factor on set pieces. It's a very small fraction of what we should prioritize in footballers from an overall skill perspective, not a big part of their appeal.

I do think this particular element is being overrated, because synchronized movement is way more effective if terms of opening up spaces or channels. If it was such a big advantage or a genius tactic, why aren't other teams putting 6'4" dudes upfront and pumping balls long ? Why didn't Jan Koller play for an elite sides consistently ? Why didn't Carew ? People are becoming fixated on having a a big player upfront aspect, and overlooking a lot of his flaws as a consequence.

Therein lies the problem, a big reason why we didn't always create a lot of clear cut scoring opportunities this season. Your team's presumptive attacking midfielder who plays in an advanced position is supposed to be the architect of the team's creative play, he has to be a play-maker due to the nature of the position he plays in within the edge of the final 3rd. And that's almost universal in terms of application - let's look at some of the attacking midfielders from the present and past. The likes of of Gotze for Dortmund, Kaka for Milan, Rui Costa for Fiorentina, Riquelme for Villarreal - all provided massive creative impetus in terms of their excellent passing range, vision and movement. Honestly, which big European team has an attacking midfielder/ #10 who's similar to Fellaini in terms of his skillset where aerial dominance overrides play-making potential ? Why should we be smartarses bucking a tried and tested trend that is there for a reason.

Can't disagree. He has shown good resilience and application this season.

Fair dos. He has done well in some of the bigger games this season. Though I do think his role in said games is being overstated. MOTM status typically signifies a player who was gamebreaking in terms of importance and critical in terms of his overall influence of the game. IMO De Gea was our MOTM vs Chelsea, vs Arsenal too because of the volume of class saves he made, vs Arsenal there were multiple similar leveled performances by Rooney and Di Maria and Fellaini. Again the likes of De Gea and Van Persie vs Liverpool. Yet you won't find people claiming Van Persie was a big game player this year despite scoring vs crucial goals both against Chelsea and Liverpool. In some of the other important games - he was a non factor vs Chelsea taken off vs Everton. It was kind of a mixed bag in parts and not consistent dominance.

As for Europe, people are slightly justified in being a pessimistic. The caliber of players he could potentially face next season is frightening, notches above what he faced this season. Since we can't make an educated prognostication of how he'll fare in the Champions League, we have to take some guidance from some of his past displays vs elite type opponents. Which immediately brings up images of Bayern Munich at Old Trafford in 2013/ 2014 where Lahm just out-thought, outplayed and even out muscled him. It's kind of natural to be wary.

Long balls are an insignificant part of the game from an overall perspective IMO. How often does one hear praise for #9s that are at the end of the keeper's long-balls ? Any number of tall players could do that.

Faint praise. He was marked out because our tactics became reliant on punting the ball up to him. It's like marking Peter Crouch or Andy Carroll because they're a menace in the air, and then allocating a disproportionate amount of praise their way, while overlooking a lot of their weaknesses in confined space or when pressed, where they look ponderous and out of ideas.

A lot of people (myself included) don't like his playing style, and at times that factors into the criticism. We want a Scholes or Keane or Carrick or even a Hargreaves. We want to watch midfielders that can capture the imagination, dazzle with their passing and set the rhythm for the game. That is why folks have taken to Herrera, because he offers the hope of developing into at least a watered down version of Scholes if not anything else. He's pleasing on the eye, and that matters a lot. Folks were praising Zidane and Iniesta even when they had mediocre games. Because even when they played at an average standard, it was visually captivating.

That is why folks till want someone like a Gundogan or Vidal or Schweinsteiger, players who have evidenced the ability to take over games vs the likes of Real Madrid on the grandest stage. What Fellaini offers in a large part is a Stoke type approach, which has unfortunately been implemented at United. Fairly on unfairly, this does color people's opinion. Is the criticism objective ? A lot of times, yes. Is it unfairly blown of proportion because of the way he plays ? Again, a lot of times, yes. As for the abuse part, it shouldn't be condoned in football or in real life. There's always a more respectful way of getting your point across. He is a human being after all, and whistling doesn't solve anything.

I think that's pretty much the opposite of true though. Manchester United have traditionally and right up until very recently, been more effective as a wide play/crossing team than any other top side in England, arguably Europe. To say it's a dimension that's been missing from our game until Fellaini turned up is silly. Unless you base the entire theory on a single home game against Fulham, which happened after we signed Fellaini.

The idea Fellaini makes us a better attacking threat is also contradictory to the fact we've been less of an attacking threat this season (and to an extent last) than any other recent season I can remember. We've lost or dropped points to teams who haven't even been trying to win, largely BECAUSE we've deployed Fellaini tactics. Swansea, West Brom, West Ham. Do you care to explain how this fits in with this theory?

I haven't noticed our defending at set pieces being particularly impressive this season. In fact it's often been awful. 

We have done this in several games. VERY blatantly against Swansea. I mean to the point it was embarassing...and so much so against West Ham that the opposition manager felt the need to take the piss out of it after the game.  

Now we're back to the argument people used to use to defend Kagawa or Mata when they played poorly, that it is somehow everyone else in the team's fault. As soon as you get on to thinking that way you should have another think about it first, because it will rarely be the case.

Those three games without scoring, Fellaini was awful in. In fact in one of them he was so bad he actually did get hooked off at half time. He wasn't the only poor performer, but he very definitely wasn't doing anything to suggest he was some kind of linchpin who other players let down. In fact that's utterly ridiculous. He got played clean through on goal in one of those games and punted the ball a mile over the bar. That was about his most meaningful contribution.

Was it though? I thought it was Carrick that was crucial to our success? Then Herrera? It just seems to be whoever the argument happens to suit now.

He played well in the Spurs and Liverpool games, but it was partly because we surprised them by playing him so advanced, and for some reason they didn't bother doing anything about it for half the game. Two, maybe three good games, but in which the whole team played well, and where in actual fact we weren't reliant on Fellaini or anyone else indvidually because we were attacking effectively down either side of the pitch and controlling the game from midfield. 

It proved he can play in a United team that plays well. It certainly didn't prove he's essential to the team playing well. What also then happened is teams just put an extra man over his side to cover for us having the extra man there, and he's yet to prove he can play well when this happens. To presume it would be ok to play him there regularly atm, is to also presume that every single team we play will inexplicably be too thick to do this. 

The special role I talk of is the role he plays. His role is literally to just sort of mingle about in an area challenging for the ball. That's it. Moyes tried him in midfield, but he wasn't good enough. Van Gaal has tried him as a front man or playing with a front man, and again, he wasn't up to it. As a squad player, or wild card, if we're happy using him in that way, fine. It can throw the opposition off occasionally for sure. 

Put him in that role every week though, and, as youve seen, after a maximum of two or three games, teams account for it and then it ends up being more of a problem for us than it is for them. This is the sort of thing England would do, and then you get loads of gimps putting the same sort of arguments forward for Andy Carroll as are being used here. "but he's a menace", "but he defends corners", etc.


His ball control is extremely poor. I'm not sure what you would base an argument against this on. I mean he controls the ball noticably better with his chest than he does with his foot. That is not a good thing.



I can't think of any regular first teamers from our last two CL winning squads who were as limited as Fellaini? Can you imagine Fellaini starting ahead of anyone in the 2008 CL final? I mean who? Tevez? Scholes? What do you think would have happened if we'd done this?

The whole idea brings home my point quite nicely, tbh.

Also, comparing that Barcelona team to this United one, that's just a no from the get go. We're world's away from that. You might as well say Jonathan Walters could have played for Barcelona based on his contributions for Stoke.

I think that's part of the problem here. You lot are talking about United this season as if what you've seen was good enough. It was barely good enough for 4th place, in a very poor PL season.

I don't think he was integral to our best football of the season. How was he integral? Because he played in a position?

I can tell you what he was integral to though...our worst football of the season.

6703~~~
Although <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> is being very harsh in the way he is depicting his point, I actually agree with him.
Fellaini has done a decent job this season, but he has not been anything special at all and should most certainly not be in the starting 11 next season.
Apart from our get it to Fellaini in the box tactic (which has at times been effective and at times been ineffective) how/what else has he been able to contribute to our play?


You have to give him credit, he has been a menace at times this season and he has bounced back well from being booed/heckled by his own fans (which was out of order)
for that fact, and for the fact he can be a good option off the bench to switch things up then he'll make a good squad player, but if we want to win the league than that is the most he should ever be.

6704~~~
He wants to be here, his attitude is good and he scored his share of goals in a season where we weren't very creative. United have never been a team who have big muppet names in every position, we've always had players who aren't the best but give their best and want to play. I don't see why we need to get rid of him personally, and I don't think LVG is going to get rid of him either.

His temperament on the field was, by and large, good this season but he definitely let himself down on Saturday. Very disappointed he was so reckless.

6705~~~
This debate has turned into two sets of people, one of whom are saying '<i>Fellaini's a decent player and a good option to have and he has a future here as a squad member'</i> and one of whom are saying <i>'Fellaini's dreadful and it's ridiculous that you think he's good enough to be a starter' </i>despite the fact that, to my knowledge, no-one in this thread has suggested that Fellaini is good enough to be a starter in a side contending for the UCL. Many of the people who are defending him have specifically spelled that out. The thing that makes this thread so frustrating to post in is that people can quote a post which states <i>'...very few, if any, are claiming that he's the quality of player who'll win us UCLs as a starter.'</i> with <i>'Can you imagine Fellaini starting ahead of anyone in the 2008 CL final?'. </i>You're either willfully misreading posts or you're so blinded by your distaste for Fellaini that you can't process the things you're replying to.

It's also nothing to do with lowering standards - most of us are saying that Fellaini shouldn't be such a key player for us going forwards and that his role should be reduced to back-up or a Plan B as we buy a better player to play in the first team. I'm yet to see how that is in anyway contentious.

6706~~~
I would think that if we get the right players this summer he won't be getting such a prominent role next season. He was just a quick fix for our lack of balance in midfield and we shall fix that with a defensive midfield signing in the summer to let our little Spanish players go further up front without worrying as much about their defensive duties.

6707~~~
This is quite true.

It'd be one thing if someone thought Fellaini should be starting next season as a first choice player but in reality nearly everyone already accepts that he should be no more than a squad player. Not sure what people are arguing about given there's no real pressing reason not to have him on the bench next season.

6708~~~
I would use him as a centre forward next season, only in games where we are desperate for a goal and need to play the percentages a bit more. At times this season we have looked at our most dangerous with Fellaini as a target man. The problem is I don't think we can rely on this long term to win a title/european cup. Ideally we would bring in somebody with all of Fellaini's attributes but more ability (Benteke?)

Certainly don't see him being a regular starter in midfield, particularly after Hull gives LvG the perfect excuse to leave him out next season when competition will hopefully be fierce

6709~~~
I hope we keep him, not much point in selling really. He's definitely a good squad option as he proved on plenty of occasions this season. He shouldn't be an automatic first choice once our summer business is concluded, but nevertheless, he's definitely a useful player to have around. I guess he will always be a player that divides opinions based on what he is as a player.

6710~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a>
I think you are being overly harsh and biased to be honest, and agree with <a class="username" data-user="63291, @jeff_goldblum" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/63291/">@jeff_goldblum</a> 's post that you (and others) appear to be shifting the goalposts.

I am probably Fellaini's most outspoken supporter on here, and I have not claimed that he should be a key player or automatic starter next season. What I have said, and continue to play is the he is a great option to have in the squad. He has shown that if he plays well he can be one of the first names on the team sheet on merit, and if he is not playing well then we should have other players who can play that role and potential be first choice as well. I believe in picking players on form, not on having a set of designated "starters" and a set of designated "bench warmers".

You are also taking my statements and exaggerating them. Its effectively reductio ad absurdum. At no point have I said that it is everyone elses fault that Fellaini isnt playing well. What I have said is that other teams realised that if they stop Fellaini, they stop the <i>team, </i>because other players have not proven capable of stepping up and performing well, and that if Fellaini is specifically being man marked then it should create space for other players to exploit, but that we have not seen them do that either.

Effectively your entire argument consists of taking any positive contribution from Fellaini and attributing it to luck/circumstance/<i>other external factor</i>, but any sort of negative contribution you are exaggerating and pinning on him personally.





<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a>
Thank you for the reply. There are a few things that I think we can simply agree to disagree on - for instance the value (or not) of uniqueness. I do think that in this aspect though, Fellaini is not directly comparable to a 'tall striker' - so your suggestion that we could replace him with someone like Llorente is not accurate I feel. Fellaini doesnt (or very rarely at least) play as a striker, he plays as - for lack of a better definition - an advanced box to box midfielder. It is not a clearly defined role because he is a fairly physically unique player to play in that position - I see that as a good thing, you do not, fine. My impression of LVG is that he enjoys tweaking (as demonstrated by some of his World Cup matches) and probably enjoys having a unique weapon at his disposal, from a tactical point of view.

The answer is similar here - that other teams probably didnt have a player who provided that option <i>whilst</i> being able to contribute to the required level in other areas of play. Of course, many of his critics are arguing that Fellaini doesn't, and can't contribute at the level we strive for, but I think he has done enough this season during our better performances to disprove that theory. You only need to go back to about page 50 in this thread to see the dozens of posts lauding the fact that it turned out that he can actually play with the ball below waist level.

Once teams started specifically setting out to counter him, his performance level dropped. I have already said that I do think that this was the opportunity for other players in the side to step up, but for arguments sake lets imagine we play Barcelona - who exactly are they going to stick 'on' Fellaini to nullify him? The common argument I see is that Fellaini would have a nightmare against a team like Barca because he wouldnt be able to defend against them, but put the boot on the other foot for a moment and question how Barca would be able to play against Fellaini? If we assume that we arent going to be outplaying Barcelona on a purely technical basis anytime soon, that is a situation where a more direct style of play with an effective outlet would likely be a big advantage.
Again, it is just an option to have in the squad.


Effectively we are just talking about expectation and rigidity of a particular position here. You are saying that a teams #10 should be the technical playmaker, but when was this rule ever written? Football formations and tactics have evolved constantly over the years and will continue to do so. If anything, we have already seen something of a decline of the 'true' #10, in favour of more hard working players who contribute more defensively. This coincidentally is also why I dont think LVG likes Mata as a #10, but that is a different debate.

Ignoring the fact that we havent actually played with a #10 this season, but rather with two advanced CMs (Fellaini and Herrera) in effectively a 4-1-4-1 system, Fellaini offers the defensive contribution from an advanced role which is very useful for pressing high up the pitch and winning the ball back. <b>If</b> he was playing as our sole, dedicated #10 then I would be inclined to see his technical limitations as a bigger problem, but he hasn't been, and thus he and Herrera have generally complemented each other pretty well in this regard - Herrera has been the creative one, Fellaini has been the physical one. Both have played effectively advanced box-to-box roles and both have contributed defensively (I would argue that Fellaini's defensive contribution is higher than Herrera's due to his added aerial ability).

Personally, I enjoy seeing new formations, systems and other things that buck the trend, and this is probably a factor in why I think we would be mad to sell Fellaini unless a really good offer came in. For me, he should be competing with other midfielders such as Herrera, Di Maria and probably one other, for the two advanced CM roles in the team (assuming we continue using the same system - which isnt guaranteed of course) - not an automatic starter, but I would say the same for the other players, and that they can compete fairly for the spots.


My final point is more general, and is basically what I said in my "Great Teams are Built, not Bought" thread from a week or two ago;
Our team has changed a lot over the last two years. Another poster made a thread analysing this, and only something like 4 of the players from two years ago managed more than 20 games for us this season.

Over the course of this season, we saw definite improvements in our overall style of play - it seemed more organised, more deliberate and basically as though there was a plan. We obviously werent/arent the finished article yet, but the foundations appeared to be there. 

I think it is fair to say that as the players learn and understand LVGs system, as well as each other's games, that our level of synergy and overall play will improve as a result. I fully expect <i>every</i> player from this season to have the capability to play better if given time to work with the rest of the existing squad, and a team understanding develops.

Going back to Fellaini, I feel this is important when we are discussing scope for improvement, because he is one of those who I think can and will improve a lot under LVG if he is given a chance to (and I think LVG will give him that chance).

6711~~~
Why should we keep a player who cost close to £30million in a minor squad player capacity? Either play him or sell him. Obviously I would rather sell him, we can probably get upwards of £15million for him now.

If LVG is not going to start him next season then he should sell him, and I hope we are not planning on repeating this long balls bollocks we have seen all season ever again.

6712~~~
I was probably Fellaini's biggest critic previously. I had nothing good to say about him at all. I despised him as a player at Everton, and was particularly incensed that we bought him. Everything that happened over the course of last season only exacerbated that.

I'm reasonably comfortable with him now though. Seeing his name on the team sheet no longer fills me with rage. He's been a positive for us this season and I'm glad we've had him.

His niggly fouling is irksome at times and on occasion he can get a bit casual. He might not be in most United fans' dream teams, and I wouldn't be surprised if he was a less prominent presence next season but but I definitely think he's a good option to have in the squad and he probably deserves his place in the team more than most.

6713~~~
Great, so everyone's in agreement.  Fellaini isn't good enough to be in our starting XI, but might be useful to keep around for the squad.  Now can someone spell this out to you-know-who?

6714~~~
LVG found a formula that worked and secured CL football, but that formula was found out pretty quickly so i'd hope next season the approach evolves slightly because using Fellaini's height might win a few games but it isn't going to win the league.

6715~~~
Great Post <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> People tend to ignore the utility of a player like Fellaini or Young while salivating for talented players who aren't fitting well enough into a given system.

There is a reason why LvG is choosing these players week in and week out. If they were half as useless as their haters make them out to be, they'd not even make the bench.

If we get better players in the system and they start performing as a unit, then sure, keep these players off the team or even the bench, but if they seem to be the best choices to fit into a system or to counter an oppositions strengths, then a keen manager will put them on. And I think we have seen this season, how shrewd usage of these so-called "lesser talented" players can sometimes lift the performance of other players on the pitch just because they are performing their role to a tee.

6716~~~
Ive heard you say the same for at least 2 other players this season, standard noodle negative hyperbole!

I assume that everyone will agree that our best football this season was the March/April run with big performances against Spurs/Scouse/City - Fellaini was integral to each one of those wins, not just in my opinion either, the great minds of the Caf collectively voted him in our top3 performers in those games.

Anyway Im intrigued to know when exactly this noodlehate of the afroman began because I specifically remember you being quite supportive of him earlier in the season and saying he was taking too much stick.

6717~~~
I dont think you actually understand what a squad player is - there wont be many players who start every game for us next season.


Well done on being perfectly reasonable - rare to see on here nowadays!

6718~~~
I wonder how he will do in the CL next season.. he was decent/good in the Premier League this season but i am afraid European referees will send him off before half time. His playing style looks just so clumsy at times (also a bit dirty sometimes) and those elbows of him could become a huge problem in the CL.

He already got a red card in the CL during 'the Moyes Era' right?

6719~~~
He was sent off vs Real Sociedad, yes.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaYrwNFRjq8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Ironically enough, its a pretty similar thing to what Rooney did against Hull - which supports the argument of different refereeing standards in the PL/Europe.

6720~~~
He will need to be more restrained in Europe, but then he does play regularly for Belgium and featured at the WC so that level of refereeing is not new to him.

6721~~~
Marouane Fellaini is a great professional, he also does exactly what van Gaal tells him to do. This will get him in van Gaal's good book for sure. I don't even think he wants to sell him, he's a unique player who fits van Gaal's plan B perfectly. At previous clubs he used a tall player as battering ram and way to mix it up. In the PL Fellaini's height and physicality are great aswell, he's currently the only player with Rooney who offers this in midfield. Since van Gaal said he underestimated the physicality of the league I think Fellaini is a great solution.

A good squad player to have, he will get his fair share of games still. LvG doesn't like those fouls though, hope he can improve on that. The accidents because he's big I can accept, intentional hard fouls I do not like.

6722~~~
The money we spent on him is irrelevant at this stage, it's burned. All that matters is his value to the team relative to what we would bring in by selling him.

Assuming we'd get 15m for him, I don't see the point in selling. We'd have a hard time replacing him with a better player for that price and even if we could that new player would still need time to settle. Sideways move when we have other priorities to deal with first.

6723~~~
Agree with all of that.

6724~~~
Replacing him with a better player is easy considering there is so many options out there and who said we need to replace him with only £15million?, also not every player takes time to settle, Guys like Torres, Aguero, Costa, Sanchez, Matic all started ripping this league up straight away.

6725~~~
Well you also have people overstating his importance to the team claiming our best form in the first half of the season coincided with him being in the team and he was integral to our best performances this season, and as far as I remember neither ia true. Carrick in center midfield and us over loading our left flank was what actually caught oppositions off guard. And Fellaini's main role in that was to control the long ball from DDG and give it to Young/Blind. Yes he did get a couple of good goals but his overall performance gets blown out of proportion to somehow credit him with being one of the main causes for our improvements in those few games.

6726~~~
We've got some very talented youngsters who are in need of playing time and having him about will only take that away from them. Sell him, and don't replace with anyone.

6727~~~
If we sell him and don't replace him we become weaker as a squad. As hard as it is to hear, he is a better player than Pereira, Pearson etc at this point in time.

6728~~~
We don't use him in their positions, and haven't done so since Moyes' time here. Januzaj is the one that should be playing and I'd rather he plays than him. No need to be short-sighted here, it might make us weaker right now but it will secure our future.

6729~~~
Well Fellaini has easily out-performed Januzaj in that position anyway, so I would not just be starting him because he is young. We were pretty poor again in the league this season, I don't think we have time to make sacrifices for long-term gain.

6730~~~
His pretty unique skillset makes him a valuable member of the squad. Keep the lump I say but he should not be a starter.

6731~~~
No one is saying it was all down to him and they were undoubtedly great team performances that won those games, but I just dont see how anyone can deny that he was integral to those big wins in late March/early April. Why would Jose decide to change his entire set up to man mark him if he wasnt? 

As you note, he scored vital goals and contributed to the build up of other chances in that triangle on the left - but in fact the part of his game that continually gets understated is the defensive work he does for the team. The idea that he is just a target man or pseudo no10 is completely wrong - he contributes to both the attacking and defensive side of the team.

Not that I am trying to say he is a world class player or even that he should start every week, but to deny he played a vital role this season in getting us back to the CL is wrong.
There are several who dont want to give him credit for anything he did this season and have stuck to the same opinion that they had last summer ("hes shite", "get rid" etc) which, when you consider the vast difference in his performance level from last year to this, is simply ridiculous.

6732~~~
Januzaj hasn't played in that position for us. We have to have him getting games cause he's young and talented. He should be the squad player that people are convinced fellaini should be next season. We're gonna invest, so we should be better next season.

6733~~~
I always maintained he had some decent performances this season but the role he generally plays for us is far high up the pitch and I really don't like to see us employing him as our main option going ahead, not that you have implied such.
As far as Jose's point is concerned, yes he was marked and yet we kept bombarding it forward to him. That trick just stopped working and the bench was not smart enough to realize or change it. This is what happens when we use that tactic and it gets found out (which it would have anyway seeing that it is nothing but a big hoof forward to a big guy). That is why my concern that using him as a plan A does have some merits but there are a lot of negatives which outweigh the positives. Not to mention that SAF also used players to mark Andy Carroll. That does not make him a very good player, just simply points out that he is a big brute who needs to be handled.

6734~~~
Thats not the same thing at all - it is absolutely standard to have a defender marking the opposition striker, every team does it in every match. This was a specific one off tactical move that Chelsea made by putting an extra defender in midfield just to nullify the threat of Fellaini (to a lesser degree other teams then copied that when they saw it was a success) - SAF employed man markers in midfield very rarely and it was to deal with some of greatest talents in the world (e.g. Jones on Ronaldo, Park on Pirlo).

You are right that we need to have other options and should not be so reliant on that. But, as Ive mentioned already, when teams are forced to adapt their game like that, it inevitably leaves spaces elsewhere. Specifically in that Chelsea game I remember Shaw having a lot of joy down the left flank, this is all a result of Chelsea changing their standard line up.

6735~~~
Chelsea changing their shape to deal with Fellaini was probably less about how good he was and more about how one dimensional we were without him. The fact that he was that integral to our play reflects badly on us more than it reflects well on Fellaini (and I don't say that to have a go at the guy).

6736~~~
It is a bit of both TBF and I do get the point that it is not good for us to be so reliant on him. Although dont forget that Carrick was also missing that day, which meant that Herrera (our most creative alternative) was forced into a defensive role. Still we did have chances and the actual disappointment that day was that the likes of Rooney, Mata and Young didnt manage to create more with all the play we had.

6737~~~
Keep him for another season but don't rely on him and don't start him regularly, is my opinion.  Sell him next summer when the team/tactics are in better shape.

6738~~~
Limited but effective sums up fellaini, he offers some thing different and unique wherever you play him but you also lose a lot in any position he plays. For a team that plays percentages he will be a good player and I think that is why he worked well  at times this season.

if he gets the right opponent he can be unplayable, it's easy to hit long balls to him and his ability in the air and chest control mean if he has the measure of his man and gets the ball in the right areas he can cause havoc. Conversely if someone matches him physically he is nothing like as effective and toward the end of the season when teams did that he struggled.

He isn't going to improve much from what we saw this season, he should only play in an advanced role and he gets in the team because we lack physicality and aren't really that good. If that changes over the summer I think his role will be drastically reduced and he will be a plan b and backup which is the best he can hope for at a team at the very top. It's stupid we paid so much for him and that we signed him at able really but there are uses for him and it's not his or LVG's fault moyes signed him.

6739~~~
There is nothing unique in his skillset.

Edit: Fellaini and Raul Garcia are both poor men's Tim Cahill.

6740~~~
I am going by Fellaini's contribution this season (and to a lesser extent last), which has involved him starting a high number of games and often being used as a central point to our tactics. I've gone to the effort (both previously and below in my point to Rood) of pointing out some examples of games where this has happened for you and others, since some people seem to have re-invented history again in claiming otherwise.

I don't really see the point in getting into theoretical scenarios that haven't actually happened yet...like Fellaini being a "squad member"...partly because what does this mean exactly? That he'll never start a game? That we'll use him completely differently from a tactical point of view? If so, how? How does it make a difference to whether a player is good enough if they spend 5 games a season in the team not being good enough, as opposed to 25, for example? I mean when would you use him to make him effective, and in what type of role?

I'm not judging him as a key match winning player either. I'm judging hm on whether I think he's good enough to play for a team who's ultimate ambition is to be the best in the world. "He's good enough to play for them, as long as it's not very much" isn't really a particularly compelling argument to me. You could argue Kevin Nolan is good enough to be in the United squad providing he doesn't play at all, but what would be the point?

I guess what you're basically saying is he's a good option to have if we want to change it up in a game and bring someone on to win headers and be tall and stuff. I mean, ok, but this is what we did in games this season, and it didn't usually go down very well, or help very much at all. 

Also consider that I'm arguing against points like "Fellaini was integral to our best football of the season"...you can't have it both ways. I think he's contributed at times, and he's had some good performances. Overall I've watched him play for us for two seasons now and seen two things a) he isn't a good enough footballer for where we want to be, and b) when he's in the team our tactics tend to change, and too often to our detriment. particularly when we're losing. 

You don't like the CL final argument, even though it was you who bought our CL winning sides up, but ok, lets change it to suit what you are saying. I can't think of a player in either the 99 or 08 United squads, who made a meaningful contribution during the season, who was as limited as Fellaini. Name such a player.

I see also that someone has accused me of being "biased" now. Biased towards what exactly? Short people? You think you have to contend with people changing your argument (I apologise if that's the impression I gave), but at least you don't have to contend with people who invent an impossible agenda for you to have, then claim that you have it. This is a bizarre thread tbh.

Really, I claimed two other players were integral to our worst football of the season? Who were they? It seems a bizarre thing for me to have said three seperate times, seeing as I only said it the one time because it was something you said that I turned around.

Yes those were our best performances, but Fellaini wasn't "integral" to them. Not anymore than Mata was, or Young, or Herrera, or Rooney, or Carrick. Those were three good team performances. 

On the flip side you have the games we played poorly in, where our tactics descended to hoofing the ball to Fellaini. It's hard to argue that Fellaini isn't  somewhat integral to a game plan of "hoof the ball to Fellaini"...there was even that one game against Swansea, where we were actually playing well, and then turned shite as a direct result of starting to hoof the ball to Fellaini.

I don't actually hate him I just think, for exactly the reason above, that he isn't  good enough to be here. I recall defending him, but that was much earlier in the season...before he came on against West Brom away I believe? And that's because he WAS getting loads of unfair stick. He was being slagged off and blamed for things purely because David Moyes signed him. He got booed and sarcastically cheered by his own fans for feck sake. 

I was prepared to give him this season to prove himself. I think though, what he's proven this seson is that in order to be useful for us, we have to become a poor team, and that too often, when things aren't going right, having him on the pitch seems to encourage us to become exactly that..

6741~~~
Maybe we can loan him to Real Madrid? FSW wanted him for Napoli after all. Fellaini and FSW would be a dream duo for <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> and Co. to experience.

6742~~~
I don't think you can ignore we tried to get rid of him to Napoli, but that didn't happen, lvg rejuvenated his confidence and utilised him well to the team's advantage which is good management but you would like to think we could get the right players in to play a more expansive game.  He may have done enough to keep himself around as an option however, a plan b in certain games, but I do not want to see him as a first choice next season.

6743~~~
Thats just bollocks! Do you think we were a poor team against City/Spurs/Liverpool? 

Just to make it clear, I think all this talk comparing past and present CL winning teams is pretty irrelevant to the discussion about Fellaini but, since you asked the question, our '99 CL winning team had Butt and Blomqvist in it, 2 pretty average squad players who still played important roles for the team when called on. In fact I would say Fellaini has a lot more to offer than either of them (ye not exactly the same position I know). 

Now I do get your point about the hoofball and I am no fan of the long balls either, but I think you (and others) are exagerating how much we actually did that and the idea that Fellaini is only useful for that is simply not true. Fair enough there were points mid-season when we set up like that and Fellaini played further upfront but it was just a means to an end at the time and I very much doubt we will see that much next season because our game has already progressed from there. Late in a game if we are losing then I am ok with it but for me Fellaini is best in midfield where he contributes both to attack and defence, I dont want to see the long balls looking for knock downs because quite frankly we arent very good at that as a team anyway.

And I stand by the 'integral' comments - yes they were good team performances but his contribution stood out at the time for me and it seems many other agreed. In voting for MOTM on here, although he was not the top choice in any specific game (he was at other points in the season), he is the only one appearing in the top 3 for each of those big wins. Shows a consistency of high level performance in the big games, a criticism levelled against him last season was that he had a few good performances against weaker teams but struggled in big games - well he blew that out the water this season.
and as I asked above, Why would Jose decide to change his entire set up just to man mark him if he was not integral to those wins?

6744~~~
Last time I checked, we don't have a Tim Cahill in our squad. Fellaini offers us something completely different. Just imagine, CL final vs Barcelona, 1 goal down, 1 minute to go. Struggling to break them down with our possession play. Throw Fellaini on, get the ball out wide, cross to the far post on to that afro. Like to see who ever's defending try and out-jump Fellaini! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

So to sum up the above fantasy piece; he will prove to be a useful member of the squad over the course of a 50+ game season. No need to get rid.

6745~~~
If he is to stay, I hope he'll have limited playing time as a result of the team having much better players and playing much better in general. There is a limit to the progress we will make or we aspire to make if Fellaini regularly starts for the team.

6746~~~
Twist the knife a bit further, why don't you? <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

6747~~~
We either bring a quality defensive midfielder and sell him or we don't sell him at all. I don't rate the guy but we do need his physicality in midfield.

6748~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://e0.365dm.com/15/05/16-9/20/paul-mcshane-hull-injury-marouane-fellaini_3309228.jpg?20150529080659" src="http://e0.365dm.com/15/05/16-9/20/paul-mcshane-hull-injury-marouane-fellaini_3309228.jpg?20150529080659"/>

6749~~~
We don't need his physicality though. There's other ways of getting stuck in and annoying the crap out of the opposition than just tearing around the place swinging wild elbows and pulling lads down like he mainly does. I know he gets wrongly done for it sometimes but that's not good enough either.

6750~~~
We do need it. Fellaini is doing what Scholes (do you remember those tackles who were more likely to maim a player rather than win the ball?), Keane and Ince used to do. It would be nice having 11 talented boy scouts in the team but you will never win anything with them. If you don't believe it just ask Arsenal fans.

However, yes we can find a better players to do that job than Fellaini. Schneiderlin, Bender Vidal and Javi Martinez for example. If we bring 1-2 players like them (1 first teamer and 1 cover) than we can allow Fellaini to go.

6751~~~
Ask them what? Would they like to have Fellaini or a Fellaini type midfielder on their team?

I reckon they'd say <i>''no thanks, we'll stay plodding along the way we are''.
</i>
We need a good solid, physical, midfielder that'll get suck in but has a bit more going on in his head than what Fellaini has.

6752~~~
That's not my point isn't it? We may be able to win the league with kids but we'll definitely won't be able to win the league with 11 boy scouts irrespective of how talented they are. No wonder why Arsene seem interested in Vidal. Arsenal hasn't been a powerhouse ever since a certain Patrice Viera (another cnut) left their team.

If Fellaini leaves than we need a hard man in midfield whose not afraid getting his shirt dirty and why not, do the nasty stuff once in a while. SAF's teams always had this sort of players (Robson, Ince, Keane, Butt, Phil Nev, Fletcher, Scholes etc). As you can see there's a big gap between lets say Keane and Fellaini in terms of talent and we can replace Fellaini with someone whose more talent. However players with that attitude are needed. I assure you we wont be winning the EPL with Herrera-Blind-Gundogan in CM.

6753~~~
Exactly. And there are plenty of good, quality teams who dont have a player like him and do very well

6754~~~
I already said that I thought we played well in those games, and explained why, in my last post? 4 or 5 good performances in a 40+ game season doesn't prove you're a good team, anymore than 4 or 5 good performances in a 40+ game season proves you're a good player.

Nicky Butt was a pretty good player and proved as much for a number of years on the trot. I would kind of agree about Blomqvist, except that he only played for us for half the time Fellaini has and made only 25 appearances! What exactly does that prove?

You say our game has already progressed, but the last game in which having Fellaini on the pitch proved to be detrimental to us, was in fact against Hull last Sunday. The game before was against Arsenal a week earlier when he was completely incapable of not giving the ball away and a large amount of our attacks broke down through him. The game before that was West Brom where we had Fellaini up front failing to get hold of the ball, with Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao all in midfield behind him (why?). Before that Everton a week earlier where he had to be taken off at half time. These are all games that have taken place SINCE the ones you named in which we played well. It seems to happen in more games than it doesn't.

Even giving you the benefit and saying he was one of our top three performers in those three games. Three games over two years isn't enough for me. It wouldn't be enough if he was average/irrelevant in other games, but the problem is when he's not effective, he's often worse than average/irrelevant.

I just don't see the point in keeping him around. If pretty much everyone agrees he shoouldn't be starting games if we're where we want to be next season, and no one likes when we bring him on or move him up top to hoof the ball to him, what exactly would his role be? To come on and get sent off every so often?

6755~~~
You tell me - you asked the question! Your point was about average/limited players who played for us in CL finals, I actually thought it was a pointless question but answered it anyway as those 2 immediately came to mind! 


Ye he was fecking stupid at Hull but it was a meaningless dead rubber so I couldnt give a shit TBH. Accusations of giving the ball away are not true - just look at the stats, 85%PA in that game which is the same as Mata and not far off Blind (87%) and Herrera (89%). LvG does not stand for players who give the ball away, its pretty much the most important thing to him, so Fellaini would not be starting if he did that as much as you suggest.

I focused on those 3 games but In fact he has had several other very good performances and even been MOTM on other occasions (Im sure you remember him coming on at WBA and literally changing the game). I just focused on those 3 as an example of how well we can play with Fellaini in the team and this was not against weak teams either which is why it is even more important. It clearly disproves the idea that for us to function well as a team with Fellaini that we have to play poor football (your words!).

I hadnt looked in this thread for a whole and was actually quite surprised to see a few saying he should be sold etc. But looking over at the rating for the season thread, it seems the vast majority recognise he had a good year as well.


Not everyone agrees with that at all - I expect him to start several games next season as LvG obviously likes what he has to offer. If you say you think someone is a squad player, it doesnt mean you dont think they should start ANY games, it just means you dont expect them to start EVERY game - thats a vital difference. 
Next season being back in Europe, having more squad options will be especially important. Regardless of who we bring in, I expect him to start some games when we need what he offers.

6756~~~
Don't mind if he is kept in the squad, but there is no way he should be starter next season.

6757~~~
We need him in our starting XI.

At least 70% of our attack is making 500 passes to lead to somebody putting in a cross. We don't play through the middle and when we do the ball ends out wide for a cross anyway. If we're just going to put crosses in, I'd rather Fellaini be in the team. I don't think we play this way because we have Fellaini. We did the same thing against Hull without Fellaini, but we were less willing to put in crosses and instead of crossing we just passed it amongst ourselves. If we change our style of play and not put so much emphasis on getting the ball out wide for a cross, then we wouldn't need Fellaini. But if we continue doing what we have this season, then he is a necessity for our team.

6758~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> "Fellaini" and "necessity" should never be used in the same sentence.  Not for Manchester United.

6759~~~
I agree wholeheartedly, but with how we play and our emphasis on crossing Fellaini is the best option. My muppet signing for Fellaini's spot is Vidal or Pogba, but they're not going to get on the end of crosses like Fellaini will.

Like I said we either change our philosophy in attack to include something beyond crossing, long balls over the top and long shots from Blind and Rojo or stick with Fellaini who is the best option to play this style of football.

6760~~~

6761~~~
We don't need his physicality in midfield. We used to win titles with carrick and giggs in there. Hererra is no shrinking violet either. We're also going to sign a DM in the summer.

6762~~~
Id much rather prefer him upfront if i had to choose. Him making challenges outside our box just scares the hell out of me.

6763~~~
Carrick is one of a kind. His positioning is world class and there's very few players out there like him. Giggs wasn't first teamer as a CM. 

I agree, if we get someone like Schneiderlin than we wont need Fellaini, at least as first teamer. Until then we have to play him

6764~~~
I don't agree, Schneiderlin won't affect whether Fellaini plays up front or not. It's a dominant striker, who is also aerially good, that is going to move him from that position.

6765~~~
I think he's an asset for the big games. His performances against City, Liverpool, Spurs etc prove that and he will be a handful in the CL. Teams will struggle against him as they have no prior experience of facing him, it was the same with Crouch in Europe and International games. Our style of football changes when he plays but if it means we get the points in the big games then I am happy to go with that style. 

He's actually a decent footballer, but his mind or speed of movement on the ball is a major weakness in his game. He rarely does anything 1 touch unless it's with his head or chest and he can get caught in position too easily. His passing while not being expansive is decent enough but he can play some dangerous sloppy passes.

I would like us to bring in a replacement for him and use him effectively from the bench or starting in the big games where he can be an asset. Most of the big teams we face we are not going to pass of the park or beat them playing their game so it's not a problem having a plan B if it's effective. Against the small team, he's not really needed, we should be able to pass these teams of the park and cut them open easily enough.

6766~~~
Please no. Not in defensive midfield. Ever.

6767~~~
if you watch the video, he doesnt say anything about defensive midfield whatsoever - in fact the quotes in that article bear little resemblence to what he actually says!

All he says is that he considers he has mostly been playing in midfield apart from the 2/3 times he played upfront - which is exactly right IMO.

6768~~~
I don't mind him in the DM role. Against Liverpool at OT he won the ball back an absurd amount of times. However the issue is if he isn't fully switched on in that position then he becomes a liability because he fouls or is late to track runs. I think his hybrid AM/FWD role is his best one.

6769~~~
he did have some decent performances last season as a DM, but I much prefer him in the roaming midfield role where can contribute to the defensive side but still has license to get forward and cause trouble in the box

6770~~~
I wish he would wait a bit to get in the box though. He always seems to run in early which means we lose a man in midfield when we are trying to build up.

I'm not sure if there is a tactical reason for this but with his height and power surely running in late would give him an added advantage for winning the ball.

6771~~~
Fellaini isn't a good DM, he is good at pressing forward but when he plays deep he leaves a lot of space behind him because of his tendencies to run after the ball carrier, unless he improves his positioning and his patience, he will be a liability. He also makes to much foul.

6772~~~
I think it must be planned with the general aim of pulling defenders towards him to create space for others. 
The goal that Herrera scored the other day at the back post, he is totally unmarked because the opposition are too focused on covering Fellaini.

6773~~~
It's weird that de Gea gets all the 'wouldn't have made top 4 without him' talk, yet Fellaini and Young, who won us crucial points and were both vital to us winning games against direct rivals are never talked about in the same way...

I think Fellaini's been outstanding this season, as important as anyone else in the team.

6774~~~
That makes sense but I wish we would take advantage of that space more often if that is the plan! Especially if it means Herrera scoring more of his lovely goals from the edge of the box into the side netting.

6775~~~
Yup, got that vital winning goal at Palace as well.

6776~~~
I agree with this. I dont think he currently has the discipline to play "the Carrick role" although he showed he can do a job there against Chelsea and City early in the season. That was more a manmarking/harassing sort of role than one of screening the back four however.

I think Fellaini operates best as effectively an advanced box to box midfielder.


I know what you mean, although I get the feeling that this is more a tactical instruction from LVG than Fellaini's own decision. Generally we want Fellaini in the box as soon as a cross comes on, and if it is coming in from Young on the left, he needs to run across to the back post, which does take several seconds.

6777~~~
I am pretty sure he is doing this under instruction as its always the same movement and a pattern. He always heads to the back post position.

6778~~~
This.

6779~~~
What role/position does he play for Belgium?

6780~~~
I think you are right, Van Gaal has said how Fellaini always follows his instructions very well. Still...

6781~~~
The screamer he scored against WBA was really important too.

6782~~~
Basically what he played at the end of the season for us I think. Maybe more of a box-to-box midfielder for them though.

6783~~~
I dont know how but i think he should be in the first team next season.

6784~~~
He might not be the flashy midfield player we want but his effectiveness in the team is hard to deny at this point. He could be valuable in the majority of games, don't expect him to leave any time soon.

6785~~~
I think his positional awareness is horrible. People claimed, in the 2013/14 season, that he was lazy, but he just looked like a guy who never knew where to stand when we didn't have the ball. So he he just jogged. he ball watches too, and generally doesn't use his one asset for the role (his size) to great use.

He's also not a particularly smart, zippy passer. I like him, but I still think he's best in roles that require less thinking. So where he is is fine.

6786~~~
Sell. Please.

6787~~~
Don't sell, please.

6788~~~
Just scored against France!

6789~~~
Feck off. You beat me to it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6790~~~

6791~~~
How is he not offside?!

6792~~~
Yeah, seemed offside. Unless the ball came from a defender, but still...assistant never held up his flag.

6793~~~
I know! Nice finish mind.

6794~~~
He's offside but who cares it counted.

Hopefully it increases his value for a summer sale.

6795~~~
It bounced off the ballsack of Witsel and both Fellaini and the other Belguim lad were offside, but he took the goal calmly.

6796~~~
Have that.

6797~~~
scored again

6798~~~
Messi shitting it for the POTY now.

6799~~~
Vintage Fellaini!

6800~~~
Goal machine! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

6801~~~
Think it'd be silly to get rid of such a unique player, who often causes the opposition a lot of problems. Not saying we should always start him next season, but I think he'll be an important player to have in the squad.

6802~~~
Pretty much part of the main group of players who made it possible for us to qualify for the cl this year. Can't believe so many keep dissing him and want him out at the first opportunity given.

6803~~~
He doesn't help himself. Due to his stupidity he will lose the first 3 games of next season.

6804~~~
Well said, someone actually talking sense in the Fellaini thread for once.

6805~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6806~~~
What position is he playing?

6807~~~
I wonder if he'll get the treatment ADM did against the mighty Bolivia <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

6808~~~
Exactly. As a "Plan B" he's great option. One of the very best. Not sure I want him starting games as part of "Plan A" but I'd be loathe to move him on, providing he's willing to muck in as a squad player (and doesn't seem like a prima donna type)

6809~~~
Same goes for Young as well. Most would probably want Fellaini and Young to be squad players only next season, despite being two of our best performers in the 2nd half of the season.

6810~~~
I am fine with people wanting them as squad players who can be used when required provided we have better performing players available. We need depth with a variety of options. What's idiotic is plain hatred and desperation to let go of players who made significant contribution in the recent past. Young has won me over as well to a large extent in the past season and i have no problems with him staying. Fellaini on the other hand have been extremely effective in key matches throughout the season.

6811~~~
Box to box.

6812~~~
I love fellaini

Won't stop shutting people up

6813~~~
Because most want us to be serious title and CL challengers again in the coming years. And as well as both players did last season, we wont get close to being amongst Europe's best again with Young and Fellaini and first XI regulars. Same goes for the likes of Valencia, Jones and Blind. It might sound harsh, but its true.

Both players have earned their place in the squad, and in Young's case, a new contract. But neither are good enough to be regular starters for a team that will win the league/CL.

6814~~~
What a weapon in disposal we have in Fellaini, will be very useful next season.

6815~~~
Sounds like he had a great game. Happy for him.

6816~~~
I liked him as a squad player and an alternate weapon.

6817~~~
Can he play full time as a target striker? He's got the strength and holdup play, good short passing and good finishing with either foot. He also sticks to his tactical orders. With fast, technical and skillful players playing around him, it could work?

6818~~~
Like in a one-off game?

6819~~~
Best chest in the world tbf

6820~~~
I've seen better

6821~~~
He had a great game but for some its too hard to just say it. They either joke with him or write the inevitable 'we wont be a title and CL contender with him in a side' posts. 

Ridiculous.

6822~~~
It's been common for quite a long time to almost excuse his efforts. 

At this stage no one should be wanting to move this guy on, bringing others in to replace hin in the first 11 fine.  

On a personal level though it's brilliant a player who was throughly demoralised to have a good season for club and country. 

Still makes me sick all those fans who openly humiliated him at old Trafford jeering and booing

6823~~~
Literally rattled LVG will have him in the team next year....

6824~~~
That is the biggest one for me. I am so impressed by how he turned himself around in one season and won us important points. I hope we won't sell him, but to say he should be the first name on the teamsheet, nah. Depends on the opposition, fitness ect.

6825~~~
If he hadn't had scored that header we would not have limped into fourth the way we did. We owe him!

6826~~~
Could miss the Wales game with a groin injury. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/10/marouane-fellaini-belgium-injury-wales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/10/marouane-fellaini-belgium-injury-wales</a>

6827~~~
Is it fair to say that he's Belgium's most important player these days? I'm just looking at his international stats over the past few months and they've been really impressive to say the least.

6828~~~
I was thinking the same myself. Obviously Hazard is vastly more talented but he scores consistently for them and his presence seems to win more games.

6829~~~
Yup, watched Belgium's last two matches, they look so much weaker without him, not to mention that they started leaking goals against France in their friendly once he went off (not solely down to him naturally as Fekir and that other winger were good substitutions but still). Yesterday they've had good delivery from de Bruyne but nobody at the end of it really, Benteke was useless.

Think he's their top scorer in qualifiers as well at the moment.

6830~~~
Obviously we all want to have shneirdelin and gundogan in our midfield and benzema and firminho attack but fellaini is going to be a brilliant option to have as well.

6831~~~
Those calling for him to play permanently, where would you place him in your lineup considering we wphave bought Memphis and will probably buy another CM and CF...

I think if we were to play to his strengths, players like Memphis will help him big time, but in our setup, with 3 midfielder, two inside forwards and a target man/ lone striker, the only choice is for him to play the #9 and that's dropping Rooney and ignoring any signing we make.. If we are to play with 4-3-3, the middle of the midfield 3 will be Carrick's position with Di Maria and Herrera flanking him, Fellaini wouldn't provide enough defensive cover, make the runs etc to play any of these positions, nor will he play out wide due to lack of pace, meaning he has to compete with at least Rooney, Wilson and possibly a new #9

The only way he'd be near the first XI is if we play a lot lower physical opponents or if we change to 2 up front and use him how England used Heskey, he'd be a nice foil for someone like Firmino

6832~~~
If we want to use Fellaini to his strengths, we have to use him often (head, chest, crosses, long balls) or bring him on to change the game and then use this tactics. Otherwise, i dont see the use of Fellaini if we want technical, fast football. No hate, but it is like that. I know he brings balance and physical presence, but someone like Schneiderlin would do the same. I like him, but there is a massive conflict between the football style people want and Fellaini playing.

6833~~~
He is great to keep in the squad, its just when he is a starting 11 player every week, it is a problem

6834~~~
I meant on girls

6835~~~
he will contend for the exact same position he played and did well in this season, as one of the 2 midfielders in front of Carrick.

6836~~~
What do we make of his place in the squad now then, assuming Morgan Schneiderlin & Bastian Schweinsteiger are confirmed tomorrow?

I'd imagine the majority of games it'll be 3 from 4 of Bastian, Carrick, Morgan and Herrera. Blind will cover left back and the #6 position imo, with Fellaini being the 6th choice in midfield. 

Any chance he moves up to playing as a forward?

6837~~~
Please no. We want more muppet signings instead! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6838~~~
More chance he'll be on his way, although he could be handy still from the bench if he's happy with that.

6839~~~
Sooooooooo where is this lad going to play.... I think he may be sold, good option off the bench if he is happy with that

6840~~~
U21 are little bit short with strikers.....

6841~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6842~~~
Our lack of strikers may save him, but as a midfielder he's well down the pecking order on paper.

All of Herrera, Carrick and Schweinerlin are infinitely superior footballers.

6843~~~
Just saw something that Stoke are interested and he's open to a move. They would pay £15M but of course, it could be some weapon spreading rumours. Dunno for sure...

6844~~~
We'd be incredibly stupid to get rid of him if we can afford to have him on bench and he's alright with such role. He was giving headache to all sort of teams last season, this won't change in the upcoming season.

6845~~~
I'd take it and run.

Zero point keeping him as a 6th choice when Mata, AdM or Pereira could play there if needs be.

6846~~~
Thing is, we won't even have space for him on the bench 90% of the time.

6847~~~
Pretty sure we will given our injury record. Even if not, the bench should start with him and not with players who offer somewhat similiar playstyle to players who already are on the pitch.

6848~~~
Don't mind keeping him as situational Weapon-X, but at the same time would rather the likes of Wilson, Januzaj and Pereira on the bench as more immediate subs truth be told. They might not have similar levels of impact right away and can't match his physical ability, but their individual development is imperative for the future of the club. We can't afford to keep them on the back-burner much longer.

6849~~~
For me it depends on how LVG wants to line the midfield up, and I imagine that will vary game to game.

Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin are both defensive midfield options more than anything, so if we persist with the same system we used last season (1 holding, 2 advanced CMs) then I could still see Fellaini getting plenty of gametime.

The fact that we <i>have</i> signed both of the above however, implies that we are going to move to more of a 4-2-3-1 with two holding mids. In that case, I imagine Fellaini will compete with Herrera for more of a #10 role. Personally, I would prefer we stuck with the system we used last season as I think it got the best out of both Fellaini and Herrera in midfield. Still, assuming we do switch to 4-2-3-1 then I imagine LVG will simply go with who is in better form for the attacking midfield role.

There is a possibility of Fellaini being moved around a bit, either as a second striker when required or even as DM cover, but we are pretty well stocked on DMs now.

6850~~~
I think he's decent cover and a good option off the bench. In certain matches he could start, when opponents are weak at set pieces

6851~~~
Keep him, very useful squad player for us. The 15m wont be worth it, we dont need them

6852~~~
He's still get plenty of minutes. He's an injury to Ander and Morgan away from starting games regularly. Even then he's capable of playing well enough to keep one of them out of the team on merit. I'm not concerned.

That said, if we <i>were </i>to ever consider selling, we'd get a good fee for him now that is his stock has risen.

6853~~~
His our plan B. 

I wouldn't sell him as his performances near the end of last season were crucial.

6854~~~
No point in selling him unless we get a good offer.

It's good that we've strengthened to the point where he'll be no more than a plan b though.

6855~~~
He's currently our 2nd/3rd choice striker.

6856~~~
I do find it pretty sad, although not surprising, that so many are instantly wanting rid of him the second we buy a midfielder, despite him being one of our better outfield players last season.

6857~~~
We won't and shouldn't sell him. He was so important last season and offers something that a lot of big teams lack - A big fecker with a great chest(He's feet are pretty good as well)

6858~~~
no way would I sell him , he did well last season.
Granted he wont automatic starting 11, could be our super sub next season.

6859~~~
Hopefully he makes first team selection a difficult process for LVG.

6860~~~
Hopefully. To be honest I am not 100% sold on either Fellaini or Herrera as the #10 in an effective 4-2-3-1 (ie in front of two holding midfielders). I think both operated best as advanced #8's like we played last season. All I would ask (and what I fully expect) from LVG is to simply play players according to their form.

6861~~~
That red card is looking worse and worse in hindsight.

If thing click while he's out he'll really struggle to get back in. At least if he were available for selection he could have made a difficult choice for the manager.

6862~~~
He'll be handy in the League Cup.

6863~~~
Are you just pretending to read things you want to read? Lots of praise in here.

6864~~~
Fellaini will be smart to leave as he is not getting into our team at the moment, unless some of our signing turns out to be flop.

6865~~~
Who knows, he could step it up another gear with the likes of the Sch's on the pitch with him....

6866~~~
I appreciated everything he done last year but I honestly still dont like him.

6867~~~
This will be another great season for him if he stays. We can mix it up with playing him upfront sometimes or in midfield when we're a big short on players. Last season, he was brilliant and showed his quality. 

If he doesn't mind not being a starter, I'd definitely keep him. Really hope he gets to win a trophy with us!

6868~~~
Useful weapon to have in our team when things aren't working out. Offers a Plan B. Quite happy with that.

6869~~~
If we play with number 10 this season, he'll be competing with Mata. He's a perfect plan B to throw on.

6870~~~
I don't see where he fits in this team. I mean he's a decent option to bring off the bench but he's got 2 or 3 players ahead of him in every single position we could play him in. He's not as much a plan B as he is a plan C or D.

DM: Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Carrick, Blind
CM: Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Herrera, Di Maria
AM: Mata, Rooney, Herrera, Di Maria

6871~~~
One thing I can be sure of is between Fellaini, Sweinsteiger, and Schnerderlin ..... NO ONE is going to try out thugging us in the midfield. That last year when Jojo was just stepping on Herreras and Rooney's legs ..... those days are done. People like that will get their asses handed to them.

6872~~~
He'll probably be a striking option if we fail to buy a striker.

6873~~~
I would definitely like to keep him. Just  like young he helped us when we were down and saved us some valuable points. Offers a different dynamic that is hard to combat.

6874~~~
I have a feeling this is the most likely scenario.

6875~~~
A Rooney injury away from hitting 20 goals and 10 Red Cards in the league as of now.

6876~~~
We really need Felli in the squad. Great player to have on the bench.

6877~~~
If he is OK with it, I think he can be our new super-sub. Depending on the situation he can come on as a no.10 or even a striker ro cause havoc amongst defender to free our attacking players. Should not be sold.

6878~~~
Poor season ticket holders at the South Stand right behind the dugout.

6879~~~
Looks that way tbf

6880~~~
I would definitely keep him as a squad option unless a very good, highly unlikely, offer comes in. We paid a hell of a lot for him and there's no point taking a massive hit. It's also worth noting that he was very good last season when he played, for the best part anyway. That particular brand of football wasn't pretty at times but it got results and it's a good option to have.

6881~~~
Great plan B and can be a striker backup in case of injuries.

6882~~~
£15M added to the Muller fund, sounds good to me

6883~~~
Keep him. He's proven his worth and that he can handle whatever it is LVG's throwing at them. A great Plan B against many opponents and should even be a starter against certain others.

6884~~~
Don't think he will be sold, not this season anyway but he will fall down the pecking order. Last season LVG was just working with what he had but now he is building the team he wants and I don't think fellaini will be part of his starting eleven which isn't really surprising.

6885~~~
Think he will continue to surprise hope he stays well worth a place in the squad and a very good player regardless what anyone says preformed admirably last season.

6886~~~
To be fair, most of us said he wouldn't get many games last season and he surprised us all (also di maria did). 

I don't think he should be anywhere close to our starting 11, but i hope we keep him as a bench option.

6887~~~
I mean I'm not his biggest fan and didn't want us to sign him. But he was very useful last season and off the back of that, I would keep him around as a squad option. Anyone that says he wasn't effective last season is clearly agenda driven.

6888~~~
It will be interesting to see what happens to him now. Think we should definitely keep him though. He offers us something that no one else in the squad does. Was very good at coming off the bench and making a significant contribution last season too. He will still get some games, and will be good cover for when the inevitable injuries come.

6889~~~
Aye, I think he's a good (albeit extremely expensive) plan B to have, or maybe LvG might even use him upfront on the rare occassion?

But either way, having 6/7 midfielders (depending on where LvG sees Blind's future) for 3 spots with our schedule isn't too bad (Carrick, Herrera, Schmidfield, Fellaini, Pereira, Blind). Can't see Fellaini starting if that first 4 is fit and on form.

6890~~~
So, what now for Fellaini? Carrick, Bastian, Herrera, Morgan, Blind, Pereira and Mata competing for 3 positions.

I think Carrick, Herrera, Morgan, Bastian and Mata will get priority.

6891~~~
<i>If</i> (and its a big if) we dont sign another striker, I can see him being played further forward. I actually thought he and Rooney at times last season looked like they were developing a nice attacking partnership, and when Fellaini did get played as a striker he looked more threatening than RVP or Falcao (although that isnt saying much). His holdup play was obviously superb, but more unexpected was that some of his linkup play and movement in and around the box was actually pretty good.

I would quite like us to keep Hernandez (although that doesnt look too likely), and if we did then I think we would actually have a pretty well balanced set of forwards.

6892~~~
I would imagine Fellaini will play further forward where is is most effective. He will rotate with other midfielders too.

6893~~~
Presumably the Schneiderlin signing hadn't been announced when you wrote this?

6894~~~
Morgan. I mentioned him.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6895~~~
Neither Blind nor Mata will play through the middle so they are not in direct competition with Fellaini. Blind will be a LB ad Mata will play on the wings. Pereira is not good enough right now and will probably be loaned out.

5 CM's for 3 spots is good going.  Of the CM's left, Carrick and Schweiny have become injury prone. He'll get more than enough games over the course of the season. He's very effective at what he does whether people like it or not.

6896~~~
So you did! On first name terms with the newbies eh?

6897~~~
i won't surprise if fellaini will become our striker by the coming season

6898~~~
Schweinsteiger is not injury prone. He had 1 big injury which made him miss 18 games.

6899~~~
Be gutted if we sell him. With LVG confirming that 4 players (Bastian, Carrick, Blind and Schneiderlin) will compete for the holding position (6 and 8), then it means Herrera, hopefully Fellaini and Mata, who I expect will spend time on the wing, will compete for the 10 role. 

I mean, when you look at Herrera and Mata as 10's, they're pretty similar in play style, but we've got no one like Fellaini, and we all saw how much of a threat he was when playing there last season.

6900~~~
I think there's plenty of opportunity for fellaini. Despite his obvious downfalls, he has a unique set of assets which are useful. I think it was post match Wenger who basically said, he doesn't look much but tactically he is very troublesome to play against.

6901~~~
He won't be sold, there is a role for him, not as a starter but enough game time to keep him happy for a year or two I would imagine. If/when the team improves his role will reduce further and I see him leaving in a year or two if he wants to play more regularly.

6902~~~
If Fellaini is in form and still delivering he will still be first choice, but he's got alot of competition now. He will get less minutes probably next season, but can still be vital to the team.

Fellaini even as a sub would probably be higher in the pecking order than Hernandez for example. Van Gaal his plan A is to pass the opposition off the park, when at the end of last season we've seen van Gaal's plan B. Fellaini has unique strengths which are ideal for van Gaal's plan B: strong, good short passing, hold up play and especially headers to switch up the passing with long balls. Van Gaal used to send defenders to the box for this role, but now he's got a dedicated player for this. He will also be very handy for the games vs the Stokes of the league.

6903~~~
It would be pretty funny to see a fellaini, schmidfield.
We could out stoke stoke with them 3. 
He'll get games 

And as far as target men go - is there anyone better at it?
The only obvious alternative i can think of is drogba but hes well past his best. Bit of a stretch to call benzema a target man.
Its an under appreciated role anyway

6904~~~
Super sub or specialist role.

Excellent option for a pressing team. Liverpool were completely bamboozled with him as an outlet.

6905~~~
Stoke isn't like that anymore since Pulis left.

6906~~~
I know but the cliche is useful for making a point (not a very good point)

6907~~~
I can't see him making the bench next season when everyone is fit - unless he's considered 2nd choice centre forward (I hope not). For the few matches where he would be called upon I'd rather see Januzaj, Pereira and Wilson get some much needed game time.

Take a decent fee for him this summer or we'll be selling him on the cheap next summer.

People who insist on referring to his usefulness last season need to understand that the way we played last season was a necessity - LVG wanted balance, and we lacked quality to break teams down so we relied on Young crossing to Fellaini. We've added balance and quality this summer, and we're still going to spend more too. Absolutely no need for Fellaini or Young, neither will be here in 13 months time it's just a case of when they get sold.

6908~~~
I would say you are likely to be in for a surprise.

6909~~~
Fightin' talk!

6910~~~
the 4 you mentioned will, highly doubt mata will play CM over fellaini, if he was going to then surely he would have done last year

6911~~~
Fellaini as our striker. That would be pretty funny in a sad kind of way. 

If a good offer comes in for him then we should just sell him instead of entertaining all these mad ideas of turning him into our Andy Carroll

6912~~~
He gives us something different. I doubt he'll be sold, but I don't think he'll start as regularly as last season. He'll still get plenty of minutes.

6913~~~
Wonder why he didn't get to play? Maybe because of his 3 match ban?

Cant see him being sold. He will give us something different as a sub or surprise inclusion in the big games. Lets not forget how easily he can help us keep possession in those big away games.

6914~~~
If you look at passing, creativity, intelligence, ability everyone writes him off, me too to be fair. But he just brings something different to the team that no one does, our midfield is crowded tho.

6915~~~
we kinda missed him today but it was due to be short on fitness unlike club America..

he won't play that much I feel but good option to have

6916~~~
Didn't play today because of the three match ban. Saw it on Twitter somewhere.

6917~~~
If we are to play him as a striker we might as well buy Peter Crouch and do it the 'proper' way.

6918~~~
Do bans apply to friendlies too? Didn't know that. Could've used him to return some of the crap those Mexicans were giving us.

6919~~~
He's banned for 3 league games. Why would that impact him playing here?

6920~~~
Sorry, poor wording on my part. He wasn't banned. van Gaal said that because he is not available for the first three league games he has longer than others to prepare. So van Gaal didn't play him so he could get a look at the other players who are available for the first three matches.

6921~~~
I see, fair enough.

6922~~~
Fellaini, you beast
