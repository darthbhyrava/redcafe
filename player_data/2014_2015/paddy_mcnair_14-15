1~~~
Great début, could we see more of him throughout the season?

2~~~
Loved the bending back header clearance. Felt as good as seeing a goal!

3~~~

4~~~
Well fecking done lad! Saved us with that brilliant header!

Must have been such a hard debut for him, thrown right in there.

5~~~
Shaw, Blackett and this guy are the future of United.

6~~~
I think  he did better defensively than any Blackett performance so far tbh.

7~~~
That was a worldie.

8~~~
I'd prefer the experienced players like Jones would stay fit for more than a match at a time, but at least we know McNair can do well for us if we have to turn to him.

9~~~
He's been watching Hernandez

10~~~
It was almost like Vidic's goal against Bayern but the other way around.

11~~~
I think Blackett was made for the 3-5-2 formation while Paddy is a real centre back (or at least has become one)

12~~~
Considering how fragile our first-team CBs are, would be really hard not to.

13~~~
Yeah he actually looks like a proper defender. The clearance was top quality.

14~~~
Fine performance and that clearing header would've made any world class CB proud.

15~~~
Great debut. Both of the CBs who have been handed debut have shown good skills and good head. Really happy for him.

16~~~
Hats off to the lad for that clearance!

Great awareness of where the West Ham players were.

And he appeared not to injure himself, despite landing on the ground!

17~~~
Have the same opinion. Very positive performance from McNair. He certainly didn´t look like he´s just 19 years of age.

18~~~
Fantastic clearance.

Saved the win right there.

19~~~
Good on the ball, but his headers need more distance

20~~~
Good debut in tough circumstances.

21~~~
He handled a very difficult match very well, fair play to him. And he didn't get injured which is great.

22~~~
Well done to the lad. Played very well given the circumstances.

23~~~
Absolutely delighted for the kid, a very impressive debut. Take a bow, son, that clearance was absolutely phenomenal!

24~~~
It really was. It was like a defending version of that Borghetti header in the World Cup a few years back.

25~~~
That header was absolutely brilliant.

26~~~
Job done.

27~~~
Well done for a good performance and well done for not getting injured.

28~~~
Very impressive from McNair!

29~~~
Should he start our next game irrespective of who is fit?

30~~~
Looked a lot more assured in defence than Blackett has been IMO. That header basically won the game for us!

31~~~
I was very impressed by his composure today. You could hardly pick a more pressurised game to play in but he handled it well. West Ham resorted to long ball tactics and strength against us late on but he held firm. At least it's reassuring to know we have some really promising young central defenders who can step in if our other <i>young </i>defenders keep getting injured. His long term future may be here at the expense of them.

32~~~
Very true. Now let's just hope that the fans stay patient with him (and Blackett for that matter,) as he goes through the inevitable ebbs in form that are sure to happen to any young player. Handled correctly, and with proper development (and is there anybody better than LVG for that?) we could have two great young British talents on our hands.

33~~~
Well done to the lad. His debut couldn't have been harder with us playing with 10 men for 30 or so minutes and especially West Ham's physicality and height. He can be proud of his performance.

34~~~
I could just feel the identity flowing from that header! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

35~~~
Great game from young McNair today, especially in the last 20 odd minutes when West Ham really put the pressure on us. That Vidic-esque header near the end was fantastic. Great début for the lad.

36~~~
I wonder if Fergie would have thrown him into the deep end today?  Or go the conservative route and play Fletcher instead.

Great debut though, very composed and gave his best.

37~~~
Better composure than any our other defenders have shown so far. I'm so Glad with his performance. He took his chance brilliantly.

38~~~
I very much doubt Ferguson would have played him today.

39~~~
I think you're right, Fletch or Maybe Blind would have been at CB I reckon.

40~~~
he did well - the lad must have nerves of steel

41~~~
Saved us a goal with that amazing clearance. Up against those West Ham brutes he came through well.

42~~~
Good performance from the youngster i hope the senior players are taking notice.

43~~~
Wasnt really impressed with him on the ball, some terrible passes and long balls, but defensively he was sound and thats what matters.

44~~~
it s true that at times ge gave the ball away but that s understandable considering the occasion

45~~~
Glad Nolan didn't start, that thug would have taken any opportunity to break him.

46~~~
That header! Wow! Could watch that all night.

47~~~
Just goes to show, defenders can win matches to. Good habit to get into.

Blackett has been good, steady but doesn't seem enough. This type of stuff is what sepearates players.

48~~~
What a header.... A cool head when we needed it 

Our defense was immense those last 20 mins

49~~~
When did Paddy start playing at CB? I thought he was superb last year alongside Charni and he had a great debut today. The fact he is so new to the position is what gives me so much hope for his potential as he still has so much to learn. 

That header won us the game, fantastic. I think he was much more willing to get in and clear the danger than Blackett is.

50~~~
Confident from start to finish. Was an extremely tough end to his debut but he saved his best for the last <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

51~~~
Brilliant.

52~~~
I think he had a sterner test than Blackett has had so far.
I

53~~~
Let's not make random assumptions. I'm glad Van Gaal played him today, was impressed,  but why use it as a stick to beat a successful manager who isn't here any more?

54~~~
I thought he played really well and no worse than any of our other defenders this season (i don't really know if thats a good thing though).
He will of probably been very nervous as well, proven when he took the ball out of defence into midfield than blasted a straight forward pass to Rooney who was only about 10 feet away from him.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

55~~~
I don't think so, especially if Jones is available. Perhaps over Evans, for the simple fact that he seems to have lost all confidence this year.

56~~~
Positively surprised. Very calm on the ball, good distribution, and knew when to just clear the ball out.

And that backwards diving header... hell of a moment.

57~~~
And Fergie wouldn't let this CB situation happened, starting the season. He valued CB a lot more, only second to wingers.

58~~~
For a 19 year old on his debut in senior football, let alone United debut, he was brilliant. Calm, assured, looked way like he has an old head on young shoulders. That header, that was superb.

59~~~
Vidic would still be here as well if Fergie was here.

60~~~
I did him a disservice when I watched live, I thought there was some luck involved. That's even better than I thought.

61~~~
Fantastic header. Nervy at times, but considering the circumstances (debut, 10 men, low confidence at the back, new spine of the team), he can hold his head high.

62~~~
And maybe so would Evra. At one point in the past, we even let go Brown and O'Shea just because we no longer needed them, even as squad players. Crazy to think that those two would be our best defenders now (even at the age when they were both sold).

63~~~
Great debut from McNair tonight. That header was great and he wasn't really getting bullied off the ball, wasn't afraid to step up against his man. Great to see.

64~~~
You put a bit of trust and faith in young player,in return you get very good performance on his debut,always great to see things like that.

65~~~
As good as a winning goal that header, was a certain equaliser.

66~~~
I dread this place if he makes a mistake against Everton given the flip flop nature of most of the threads in here.

I liked his debut today, will be interesting to see what happens with him going forward especially once we start getting our injured players back.

67~~~
Good debút by him. Not easy to come into an already shaky and unsure defence and look at ease. Nerves could have easily got to him and nobody would have been able to blame him, but it was never an issue today.

68~~~
Since Milk Cup 2012 after Ioannou's injury.That means about two years ago

69~~~
I kept watching it, just like watching that Machaeda's goal.

70~~~
Could his name get anymore Irish?

71~~~
Impressed with him .Another player alongside Blackett that seems confident on the ball.

72~~~
I wonder if he wants to come play for the south. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

73~~~
Paddy O'McNair.

74~~~
Try "Ireland Guy"

75~~~
Who is going to start next week if the trio is still injured? McNair or Blackett?

76~~~
Hard to call, I assume van Gaal would like a right footed defender partnering Rojo though, so McNair would be my guess.

77~~~
Nobody has O' and Mc as it would defy the whole purpose of what they mean. Poor attempt son.

78~~~
Probably McNair because he is right footed and Shaw was good.

79~~~
Good question, but i'd go with Blackett who i think has better distribution playing the ball out from defence. He just shades it mind you

80~~~

81~~~
Good performances. Glad he did well as a system of our acedemy product.

82~~~
But then you will be playing three left footers.

83~~~
He's a converted midfielder with good technical ability, so I don't think we have to worry about his passing. If he can do the defensive stuff, he might have a first team future.

84~~~
I can see LvG going with McNair to have another right footed CB but if someone has better distribution i dont think you can ignore them because they are left footed.

Maybe McNairs distribution is better than i give him credit for but from what i've seen Blackett is better getting the ball forward to midfield

85~~~
McNair because he won't play 2 left footed CBs imo.

86~~~
He impressed me today. Held is own quite well at PL level.

87~~~
Better than Smalling already?

88~~~
Did well. Hopefully we will see more of him in the coming weeks.

89~~~
Look at that cross, that had goal and 2-2 written all over it, just got us two points this lad.

90~~~
McNair deserved to start next week. Same side as today except Mata in for Rooney<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

91~~~
That header looks better every time you look at it! We'd have gone on to lose if that went in

92~~~
No.

93~~~
It was brilliant. A very solid debut.

94~~~
Why? I don't recall single match in which Smalling was United's best defender. And today we have a game where McNair was this guy.

95~~~
This ''CB situation'' happened quite a lot when Fergie was around, our opening match in 12/13 when we had to play Carrick there and the game that made Pogba leave, come to mind. The issue is having three injury prone defenders on our CB roster, we need to get a couple of reliable defenders in.

96~~~
We had world class CBs that were injured, and we knew it was only a matter of time before we got them back. Now we depend on not (yet) world class CBs who are also injury prone. Big difference.

97~~~
Why?, Blackett has made mistakes and hasn't been crucified. His name isn't Rooney as well so that will be in his favor.

98~~~
Im very happy for the lad, that header showed me he has the ability. I hope he can continue to progress. Its also a bonus to see an Irish lad back in a United team.

99~~~
He definitely has.

100~~~
Blackett was called absolute shit after the last game. Some awful knee jerk stuff in his thread.

101~~~
Agree with that and I think that issue will be addressed in the next two windows though I don't understand why we didn't sort it out earlier.

102~~~
Rojo's purchase is the one I don't really understand. Although good times for the like of McNair and Blackett to shine, though.

103~~~
Seemed unfazed by the occasion, maybe that's why he was picked ahead of Thorpe, Van Gaal must have seen something.

104~~~
Keep your hands off him.

105~~~
Haven't seen the match yet so can't wait for MotD. That header looks world class. Outstanding considering he is only 19, it was on his debut, against West Ham, against a West Ham managed by Sam Allardyce, and with United down to 10 men for the last 35 minutes or so. I almost can't believe it. 

How did he look alongside Rojo?

106~~~
Like the better player out of the two. Was little shaky, but he can be dubbed third best Man Utd player today, behind Rafael and Herrera.

107~~~
The main thing is that he has a name of substance - Paddy McNair, defender extraordinaire.

108~~~
he had a good game today but let s not get overboard,this was his first game. I hope fans will not expect too much of him and then start slagging him at his first mistake.

109~~~
haha good one. It happens to most threads. One week  the guy is immense, etc, the next week hes a donkey. It happens a helluva lot here.

Saying that, McNair will end up making a mistake due to inexperience. Its how he bounces back from it that will define him.

110~~~
Defensively he was very sound, on the ball he was a bit haphazard, summed up perfectly when he drifted forward (looked like Rio) and he smashed a ball into no mans land. Still, a very positive performance, well worth the entrance fee.

111~~~
Almost sure that would've happened. It's amazing to think that a split brilliant moment from one player could decide the result.

112~~~
or
except Mata in for Rooney<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

113~~~
Agree, it's no bad thing.

114~~~
Or expect Mata in for Rooney<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

115~~~
Rooney was actually very good today until the incident.

116~~~
Never! My hands will pleasure him like yours never could.

117~~~
Bitch.

118~~~
His name sounds like alias Paul McGrath created under the spot. My name is Paul..err Paddy Mc..Nair.

119~~~
Yea, he really was, so what the feck ? 
Captain my hairy arse.
Shame.

120~~~
Rooney<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> isn't at the top level as a #10. Mata is far better in that role. 

I'm glad about it. Falcao and RvP are both better strikers than Rooney<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>, and Mata is a better 10.

It'll improve us.

121~~~
Really impressive debut for him. He never looked out of place. 

I was particularly impressed with his confidence going forward with the ball. Great to see. 

Look forward to seeing him more.

122~~~
What do Mata, Rooney and co. have with this thread. Surely people hating Rooney have some other place to moan. 

In  any case in the 1st he was very good it didnt seem it's his first game in the 1st team. I like the fact he was brave enough to go forward with the ball although his passes didnt go anywhere. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

123~~~
Well that would be silly, as you say it's his first game but I think it could go either way- maybe next week he is calmer and has trained, become more familiar with his teammates and does better than today, there is no way of knowing what the future holds. What if he makes a mistake ? Well the seniors are making them by the dozen!

124~~~
What's more impressive is that his CB partner doesn't speak a word of English so probably couldn't talk him through as much as a debutant would usually be. He looked good. Didn't seem fazed at all. Happy for him. I reckon he will continue until one of Evans/Smalling/Jones are available. 

What ever happened to the narrative that we had abandoned youth and adopted a galactico policy?

125~~~
The fact that me managed to play the full 90 minutes without getting injured makes him one of our best defenders.

126~~~
Can't verify the veracity of this quote but if so, that's LVG, RVP and Rafa all impressed by Paddy. Says a lot about the boy. Have we found our Badstuber? Perhaps Puyol?

127~~~
That header is the stuff of dreams. Well played lad.

128~~~
Badstuber ? I surely hope not.

129~~~
Reminiscent of Vidic v Bayern.

130~~~
Suddenly it feels like we indeed have a thing called defense.

Good work Paddy.

131~~~
Superb performance. Highlight reel header to boot too. Let's get the boy on the weights and keep him around first team training for the exposure. Defending against RVP, Falcao and Rooney every day will do wonders for his development too. Very promising stuff indeed.

132~~~
I liked the look of him. He was probably our 2nd best player after Rafael.

I was interested to see how several of those who watch him regularly were surprised he got his chance, particularly ahead of Thorpe who by all accounts has been significantly better in the last couple of years. Good on him for taking his chance, really hope he can make the most of it.

133~~~
I liked the way Roco and DDG gave him encouragement for his play and despite the language difficulties they appeared to be communicating.

134~~~
It was great to see all the older players encourage him, especially the new guys like Herrera and Rojo. I thought he did superbly well, he must be buzzing.

135~~~
He's a quality player in my opinion. He made all the waves when he broke into the Bayern team under Van Gaal and then went on to represent Germany. Sadly, injuries have played a huge role in his career so far. Still a good player.

136~~~
That header, that bloody header.

No matter what happens with this lads career, he will always remember that.

137~~~
Was forced to listen to the game on the radio today and absolute radio (the best of the 3 broadcasting stations) said he was brilliant today, would you guys say this is accurate? I'm about to watch match if the day but you can't really judge from highlights.

138~~~
He was very, very composed. He could even run with the ball into midfield. He was a wee bit nervy in the first half with a couple of misplaced long balls, but he made a game saving header when we were really under the cosh. That required serious technique and composure to pull off and he was applauded by LVG, RVP, Rafa and Ander after the game for his performance. A real gem from the reserves. The thing that pleased me the most was the Kevin Nolan offside goal. The lad kept his line perfectly. Intelligence and composure. By the way, won a fair few headers against West Ham's giants.

139~~~
Fantastic! Thank you! 

It's a good job we've lost our identity and don't give youth a chance anymore isn't it? Chuffed for the lad.

140~~~
Not all. Me and gooDevil have our fingers on the pulse. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

Sept 19

141~~~
It was a Vidic type header. Was happy for him and Thorpe even though he only got a minute. We've seen Blackett doing ok and now Paddy stepping up when we needed him too. It's early days but it reflects well on the youth

142~~~
Felt like some of the media had their knives sharpened earlier with the whole 'surprise' that he was picked ahead of Tom Thorpe thing, so I'm happy McNair did well today.

143~~~
I'd say Maldini.

144~~~
Under LVG the young players have to be ready to take their chances because they will surely come. If he has the balls to give a nineteen year old CB a debut, in a defense that spectacularly collapsed last week, in the midst of a poor start then he won't think twice about playing Thorpe in the holding role next week, Wilson in attack or Pearson in that diamond. They just need to be ready to stand up when called upon, repay the man for the faith and the rest will fall into place.

145~~~
Hate to blow my own horn (although I would if I could), but...

Motherf*cking April, bitch:

Not to mention the thread I started on him in 2012. A simpler time, when Nelson Mandela was ridiculously senile but still alive, people finished the Boston Marathon as bipeds and I could still beat the shit out of Justin Bieber.

146~~~
Next Evans?

147~~~
Lets not go overboard comparing him to legends of the game. Before the last few days the majority of us had never seen him play.

148~~~
So, the next object of hatred on here?

149~~~
Sweet Jesus, I know I shouldn't, but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

150~~~
Fair play to the kid, did well in a difficult game. And fair play to LvG for actually playing him and not re-calling Stam from retirement.
Also loved when half the team and especially Herrera encouraged him in the last few minutes.

151~~~
Please no!

152~~~
He's not a cert to start against Everton. Blackett will be back, so we'll see what LVG goes with.

153~~~
expecting Leicester to bid for Thorpe in next few months..

154~~~
Looks promising, has more composure than our seniors ffs

155~~~
He was very impressive today. A performance to be really proud of, I hope we see more of him in the future.

156~~~
Don't think so. It was a straight red.

157~~~
He obviously played on adrenaline today, but I'm glad for the lad. Hope this secures him a decent loan after Christmas.

158~~~
From May:
feck yeah! Paddy McNair hipsters.

159~~~
Very good performance and well done to him. I like the look of him but in saying that, in my opinion, it's back to the reserves when we have numbers again. I didn't see anything that suggested he could replace Evans, Smalling or Jones and nor should I at this stage. Again, he was great on debut but lets not get ahead ourselves, we need a little more than McNair at the moment.

Love the big two fingers from van Gaal playing these youngsters after apparently selling the clubs soul. Great to see.

160~~~
Paddy is our new hero but he reminds me of Paddy Crerand. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

161~~~
You do realise that not every red card is a 3 game suspension yes?

162~~~
Tell me when straight red cards have not been automatic 3 match suspensions...

163~~~
Jones out with muscle problem right? I believe he will not be fully fit to participate next match so maybe another chance for Paddy to prove himself. I said it before but he certainly looke better than Scott Wooton.

164~~~
When it's not violent conduct. So fairly often, to answer your question. Blackett is available next week - unless he gets injured, obviously.

165~~~
Hadn't even heard of him, before he was banded about as a potential starter before the game, I'm ashamed to say. Looked good though and some of his positional play was outstanding at times. Great clearing header too.

166~~~
Well in that case I stand corrected.

167~~~
Loads of reasons, handball preventing a goal, denying a goal scoring opportunity, basically anything that's not covered under:-
-Attempting to kick or strike another player
-Violent Conduct
-Serious Foul Play

Something learned on this Saturday night at least.

168~~~
Or the FAI could feck off and stop trying to steal youth players.

Anyway, hopefully he'll go on to have a great career with United and Northern Ireland!

169~~~
I'd be worried about starting him vs Lukaku and Everton tbh as well as he did. Same with Blackett though.

Smalling should be back, i guess if Jones isn't though.

170~~~
I would go With McNair. Blackett is to muck like Rojo and McNair is not as rash as Blackett and better in the air, compliment Rojo better.

I hope Jones will be back though. Jones and Rojo will surely give any attacker a hard time, they will feel meeting them after a match.

171~~~
You won't find anyone happier than me in regards to McNair playing and playing well but we need to calm our tits. When the other CB's are fit, they will go ahead of him and rightly so. Sure, keep him involved and if the others are not fit, throw him in again but it's always one extreme with a youth debutant, not up to it or a new star, nothing in between and in reality, it's always in between.

No issue throwing him up against Lukaku but if one of the others are fit, it's a no brainer.

172~~~
Spot on with that. Only disagree with the last line.

173~~~
Very impressed, hope he stay clear our of our defensive curse and really kick on this season.

174~~~
Well I wouldn't want to play him against Lukaku but if van Gaal rates him and wants to give him a chance, I like to see that kind of faith, that's what I don't have the issue with. In regards to the difference in quality, pace, power and experience, I definitely don't want to see it lol.

175~~~
Yeah I feel the same way. But Lukaku will bully all our defenders to be honest.

176~~~
True.

177~~~
So much hype only ever go to attacking players from our academy, I honestly had not heard of him or Blackett before this season and the two of them are absolute quality for their age.

178~~~
If todays game is anything to go by, McNair will destroy Lukaku. He was garbage today. Concrete feet, first touch of a trampoline. Hopefully he carries that form into next weekend, and hopefully Martinez continues to put Lukaku out wide. No idea what his thinking is there. He looks awful out there.

179~~~
He was wide to get the better of Moreno aerially and physically which he did on quite a few occasions tbf including the penalty incident and he did have chances which he missed.

If Mcnair and Rojo starts for us though can totally see him going back central and troubling him with his strength and pace. Mcnair isn't that quick either that if he gets beaten for strength he can recover. Will be a real big test if he plays for him as Everton have other threats too and are good going forwards. Can see it going horribly wrong if they turn up.

180~~~
"He played very well," the manager said of the defender in an interview with <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a>. "I could have imagined a performance like this before the match because he’s a very good player. Mostly, players like this have good debuts. I’m very pleased for him that we won, because he played very well and his goal-saving header in the second half was fantastic. He was also very good with the ball at his feet."

His team-mates were equally praiseworthy of McNair's efforts and he will reflect on an afternoon's work well done when sitting in front of <i>Match of the Day</i> this evening. "Paddy did great," enthused van Persie. "I know how hard it is to make your debut. I made mine in Holland for Feyenoord and he made his for Manchester United in front of 75,000 people, at home, in a difficult period. He did really well on the ball. His decision-making was great and defensively he stood up well. It was great for him."

Rafael, the other member of the new-look back four, described him as "one to watch" and felt his performance was "brilliant". "He played very well, he played some fantastic football and everyone is really pleased with him," revealed the Brazilian. "He should keep working hard because he has a big future."

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2014/Sep/paddy-mcnair-debut-performance-praised.aspx?pageNo=2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...cnair-debut-performance-praised.aspx?pageNo=2</a>

Some high praise there.

181~~~
Really? I thought it was a second yellow..dang.

182~~~
The one thing I really liked about McNair was his technical ability on the ball. He looked extremely confident with the ball and passed well. Definitely one to watch with Blackett.

183~~~
Really good debut. Obviously that header was brilliant. Pleased for him.

It's like the people here never learn, he's already the next Badstuber, really? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> You don't have to look farther than a month ago to see the praise being heaped on Blackett and look at him now. Same cycle again and you'd think people would finally realize to just calm their tits and not go overboard. Weirdos

Good debut by him, hope he continues to impress when given the chance, another youth player coming through is always nice to see.

185~~~
Have to say, and thin hat well and firmly on, Smalling and Evans should be embarrassed looking at him today. 

His first game, in a nervous team, beside a player who has never played CB for us before and can't speak English, with a keeper in dodgy form behind him...All factors considered I thought he done brilliantly.

186~~~
LvG already said he doesn't like two left footed CB's together so I take it McNair will start.

187~~~
Blackett and Evans were starting together.

188~~~
Anyway, that header was Vidic-esque. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

189~~~
Evans is right footed.

LvG also said he doesn't like two right footed CB's.

Watch the video, towards the end.

190~~~
Huh?! 

Thought he was gone for 3 games?

191~~~
Banned for one game as far as I know but doesn't matter, I expect McNair to start anyway.

192~~~
But it was a straight red.....

10 years ago, I could keep up with these rule changes. Can't now. And I'm only 25!! 

Game's gone mad

193~~~
Evans is decent with his left foot but is naturally right-footed.

194~~~
Red card for violent conduct - three games.
Red card for a professional foul like preventing a goalscoring opportunity - one game.

195~~~
Evans isn't left footed.

196~~~
No, you get a one game ban for a red. Blackett, as the last defender, hacked down a player going for goal hence the red. Rooney dangerously hacked down a player, hence the Red and a three match ban.

197~~~
Sound for the info. Appreciate it. 

Game's gone mad though

198~~~
Played really well. I liked how comfortable he looked on the ball. Interesting prospect, at least. It'll be tough for center backs to come straight into the team, but that performance will have made some teams in the lower end of the Prem and the Champo sit up and notice, and start looking at him as a potential loanee at some point this year.

199~~~
How was he for the reserves? He just came out of nowhere and put up a solid display for us. I hope we can see more of him.

200~~~
dunno if this was posted before

201~~~
I really don't think it matters. Blackett is above McNair in the pecking order. We play Everton next, a whole different threat. Rojo can play on the right and Blackett on the left for his distribution.

202~~~
He's been doing well. He's been solid and consistent as far as I've seen. Seems to have a decent all-round game. Has played well alongside Thorpe. Could've picked either to start imo.

203~~~
I agree that it shouldn't matter but for LvG it matters.

204~~~
Always thought he was left footed. :|

205~~~
Solid debut. Only negative thing I'd point out was that he sent a couple of hoofs or very badly timed long passes into nowhere. 
Maybe still part of the U21 game!?!
Otherwise very solid backup with potential.

206~~~
Its strange...naturally left footed players are rare anyway...Rio and Vidic were both right footed...never hampered whoever played LCB.

207~~~
Well, I'm going to join in on the McNair hipsterism - also from May:

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I'm not going to pretend I would have predicted that he'd be starting in the PL this season though. I'm very impressed. He must be buzzing, even he couldn't have expected this.

208~~~
I hate to say it but that was the best debut by a United homegrown defender I've seen since Wes Brown came on against Leeds.

The truly impressive thing was that appeared to be mentally ready for it. Huge crowd, Shaw making his debut, Rojo making his positional debut and the whole team tense as hell. He was obviously tiring towards the end but his concentration remained intact and that late clearance was magnificent.

Obviously he's got some growing up to do and there will be a fair few mistakes and misjudgements along the way, but that was a really good start.

209~~~
Smalling could be back. Maybe even Jones. 
Might be the last we see of McNair for a while for all we know. But there certainly seems a future for him here.

210~~~
Yeah he did well. Thought he looked weak when he was 1 on 1 against an opposition player. He looked panicky. His distribution was also erratic but if anything still better than the Rio casual hoofathon, or whatever it is Smalling does. Other than that, was an admirable effort.

The key thing is he looked composed and wasn't afraid to take responsibility on. We've played other young players this season who looked either incapable of or too afraid to try and do anything. He was allways  putting himself where the team needed him to be, with or without the ball, which sounds simple but actually takes some balls when making your unexpected debut in front of 75,000 people, for Manchester United.

It wasn't  just the header either. There were a few times in the second half where other players were caught out and his positioning bailed us out.

I wouldn't get carried away at all as you can't judge a player on one game, against West Ham, but he certainly didn't do himself any harm.

211~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/19lLFziQd6M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

212~~~
I think he looked very nervous early on, and whenever he was in possession of the ball.. Looked as if he didn't know what to do with it. But his defensive display against a very physical side, on his debut, was very, very good. And I'm sure that holding out against all that pressure and that wonderful defensive header will do his confidence wonders.

213~~~
Only moment he had me worried was when he got outpaced by E.Valencia at one point but that in itself is no shame. Needs to check those runs he kept making at times though. Maybe he's just trying too hard to impress, which he doesn't need to. With Blind/Herrera/Di Maria in front of him, he can keep it simple and pass it out. Stay calm and stay to defending. Do that and I can't ask any more of him. That was an impressive defensive display for a debut as it is.

214~~~
He defended properly and stayed on for 90 minutes, not an easy task for our other central defenders. Doesn't seem like a huge talent, but did his job and didn't look out of place.

215~~~
I was surprised that he was picked ahead of Thorpe but it looks like Van Gaal knew what he was doing. He can be proud of his debut - defended with maturity beyond his years. His distribution was a little unimaginative but he did his main job well.

216~~~
The way he drove out of defence -it is like he was an old school sweeper (passing accuracy a little wayward.. but put that down to nerves). I like LVG's mentality when it comes to young players. He quickly puts them under pressure and is curious to see if they have the qualities to make it here - if they are worth persisting with they will show something.. if not get rid. Endless loan culture is so annoying and just fills up the reserve ranks with rubbish. That said, if we didn't have such an injury crisis.. I doubt we'd see it happen to this degree, but the fact he chooses to trust youngsters rather than play experienced players out of position is refreshing.

217~~~
This deserves to be in here:

218~~~
Is Blackett back for Everton? Either way him or McNair will struggle with Lukaku because that big lump, just like Everton, always turns it on against us. Will LvG play two left sided CB's though?

219~~~
Impressive debut,it all look so natural to him.The instinct to block off the ball.had got great future ahead of him.

220~~~
Lukaku gave Vidic a terrible time at Old Trafford last year so this kid will have some test if he plays

221~~~
Yes, his suspension was only for one game. Out of the two, Blackett is more equipped to deal with the physicality of Lukaku. LVG is not a fan of two left footed CBs apparently. Shouldn't matter in these circumstances....and most teams play with two right footed CBs anyway so whats the difference?

222~~~
Whoever plays at centre back, him or Blackett, will need help from blind against lukaku. They will target us in this aspect.

223~~~
thats not just about awareness...but bravery too.

if he keeps his discipline and keeps listening and learning from van Gaal/Giggs and those around him, he will become a top footballer.

224~~~
I'd much rather see McNair start again than see Blackett reinstated.

225~~~
They aren't actually competing for the same spot. McNair is probably more likely to keep his place because Evans, Smalling and Jones are injured.

226~~~
I thought his peformance was better than any of of Blackett's despite the latter looking more stylish and languid. Purely from a peformance point of view he defended better and in much more testing circumstances.

227~~~
As good as McNair was I would play Blackett and Rojo next week.  Lukaku has always been a nightmare for us and it would be too much ATM to throw him into that kind of game.

228~~~
What's the prognosis on Smalling? McNair did okay yesterday but will be sexually abused by Lukaku.

229~~~
I was forgetting how much van Gaal likes to have opposite-footed CBs.

I certainly never would have played Blackett on the left if Smalling was available to play there, for example. Seems a bit too rigid of a rule.

In a back three I think it makes sense to have a left footer on the left side, he'll get pulled wide a lot and that will benefit him often.

But I don't recall Blackett benefiting from his left-footedness in his last game, nor Rojo in the his start at CB.

I'm not sure I'm prepared to consider the left-sided CB position as having Rojo and Blackett before everyone else because they are left-footed.

Can anyone comment on how strict van Gaal had been in this preference in the past?

230~~~
Isn't Blackett out for three games? Additional two, that is.

231~~~
This sounds like Evans vs. Drogba all over again... (no racism here)

232~~~
From the interview LvG gave he made it seem that if all the left footers are injured he'd rather play one from the reserves than play two right footers. Probably means we won't see much of Smalling/Jones/Evans playing together even when all fit.

233~~~
Just one game. Three games is for violent conduct.

234~~~
We don't have any left-foot CB in the Reserves so he'll be forced to play two right footers if that's the case unless he want to use CBJ from the U18s...

235~~~
Lukaku may be better but it also sounds like the unspeakable actions Sakho and Valencia were going to perform on Paddy.

236~~~
Only a 1 game suspension since it wasn't for violent conduct. Rooneys is 3.

237~~~
Could line up alongside Evans for club and country

238~~~
Hopefully! Evans probably has almost a decade as a footballer left in him, barring injuries (Yes I know it's Evans we are talking about <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>)

And I generally think Evans shouldn't be wrote off just yet as a United player.

239~~~
I thought he did well all things considered and that headed clearence was magnificent but he should be nowhere near starting for us once Smalling, Jones or even Evans become fit. The only reason he should perhaps start next game is if LVG doesn't fancy two left-footed CBs. Not saying he's not talented but he's got a long way to go.

240~~~
Let's hope he's not that crazy.

241~~~
I reckon he will get a call up for the Faroe Islands game.

242~~~
After one game? LOL

Blackett has played in two games where we kept clean sheets. Where was your praise then? If Everton and Lukaku, who are better than West Ham, rape the young McNair what are you going to say then?

243~~~
Since I know them both well my opinion is the same before this summer as it is right now, unsurprisingly. McNair is a much better CB than Blackett.

If you want to check I did nothing but warn people about how extremely raw Blackett is at CB. He's not ready, imo.

244~~~
Agree, much rather have Paddy than Blackett.

245~~~
What a brilliant debut performance!

But what a balls out decision by Louis to start the lad.  Had it gone tits up, Louis could have been facing some very harsh criticism here on the caf.

246~~~
Agreed. I see Blackett as the better in 3 man CB, but McNair in 2 CB system. If that even make sense. I think Blackett is better in linking up the defence and midfield, but not as pure CB as McNair. But those just based on both short cameo, though. Never seen them in Reserve or other levels.

247~~~
I am impressed by his defensive capabilities, especially with that header. 

However, I do noticed he is not as quick as Blackett. He seems to be lack of pace and strength but that can be improved when he is only 19.

248~~~
I think its clear LVG rates Blackett above the other youth CBs, playing five full games and all. Its a good thing we have some eye catching youngsters on the come up in that position. Three of our senior CBs are a waste of space.

249~~~
He had a good outing, but he'd really struggle against the speed and strength of Lukaku. Valencia of West Ham raped him for speed a few times and im surprised West Ham didn't press on that advantage more.

250~~~
Play both McNair and Blackett when he's back. Nothing that Smalling, Evans or Rojo has done to deserve a starting spot

251~~~
We should be careful not to jump the gun after just one good game (or even after one bad). Before our 25 minute capitulation against Leicester Blackett was playing very well. He has become a scapegoat now. I wonder what people will say about McNair if he doesn't repeat the West Ham performance. So much pressure.

252~~~
You don't think Rojo has started relatively well despite the circumstances he's been faced with? New to this league, playing alongside different players every game.

253~~~
Blackett and Rojo couldn't cope with Vardy.

254~~~
James Wilson might disagree with that <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

255~~~
They are both quicker than McNair, so there's no telling how he would've coped with Vardy. Blackett looked impressive against quality players in preseason so at least we know something about his ability to cope (more importantly LVG does).

256~~~
...

257~~~
Blackett has also looked terrible against average players. There is no saying how McNair will cope against a strong fast player, you are basing your assumption on nothing.

258~~~
Valencia did give him a run around when he was 1v1 with McNair which wasn't very reassuring.

259~~~
Based on nothing? I said he was raped for speed by Valencia of West Ham a couple of times during the game. Blackett has played twice when we had clean sheets against QPR and Burnley, I never saw much praise for him after those games except that he was up against 'average' players.

260~~~
Indeed, Im not saying he wont have a game on his hands just that Blackett and Rojo were both terrible when faced with the speed and strength of Vardy. McNair played very well and should keep his place IMO.

261~~~
Surely he's more suited to deal with Lukaku than Blackett? I haven't seen anything from Blackett that makes me think he could deal with Lukaku. Has anyone seen him win a header yet so far this season?

262~~~
He was pretty dominant in the air against Leicester before the meltdown. He's strong in the air. Did you even see him in preseason?

263~~~
So was Blackett and Rojo when playing against Vardy, that’s my point. Why are you ignoring that? A player who has pace was outpaced and outthought on a regular occurrence by an average player.
I’m not saying Blackett is a bad player, he isn’t. However McNair has done nothing wrong in my eyes to be dropped. As for the clean sheets, yep, however he was also part of the defence that conceded 4 goals within 30 minutes. His confidence will be low.

264~~~
Did you see Young or Fletcher in preseason?

265~~~
And let the hype begins. The same hype which linked Jones with Duncan Edwards, made Wallwork the new Steve Bruce and placed Smalling and Evans as imminent successors for Rio and Vidic.

Mcnair had a good debut but its only a small step of a long journey. Give the kid some space to grow

266~~~
Really?

He's stronger and quicker than McNair and for me much better equi[pped to deal with Lukaku. In any case if Martinez persists with Lukaku on the right Mcnair wouldn't have to deal with him.

Besides Blackett and McNair are not in competition with each other. LVG is not going to play both Blackett and Rojo.

267~~~
The difference here is we're talking about a young player breaking through. He put Jones, Smalling and especially Evans to shame in preseason with his assured displays. He's now ahead of Michael Keane in the pecking order, a player who was widely tipped to be the next youth defender to break into the first team.

268~~~
Jones anywhere near a return?

On topic - Very good debut, though I feel if West Ham were smarter, they'd have exploited their advantage much better.

They almost played into our hands, IMO.

I'd give the lad another chance (failing Jones being fit) as a reward.

269~~~
This. Some ridiculous reactions from his performance against West Ham.

270~~~
This is how we build up some players and set them up for a fall. McNair doesn't need over the top praise/press for a competent debut game....look what that did to players like Richardson, Cleverley, the 'next Roy Keane' Daron Gibson etc

271~~~
What a difference one game can do to people's opinions, it was a good appearance, but calm down, he has it all to prove.

272~~~
We've had plenty of young players breakthrough in pre-season, yet most end up going out on loan or being sold. Do you think Blackett would be starting ahead of Smalling, Jones or Evans if they were fit? Blackett like McNair are only playing due to injuries.
Blacketts confidence is going to be low, he was shocking against Leicester and couldn’t handle the aggressiveness or speed shown by Leicesters attacking players, it will be the same against Everton, why put him through that again so soon? McNair is going to be high on confidence therefore he is the more logical option, however I’m hoping Jones, Evans or Smalling are back, but that’s looking unlikely

As soon as we have all our CBs back both Blackett and McNair should be sent back to the reserves and gradually introduced to the team, both are far from ready for a regualr place in the team.

273~~~
Hyping players is one of the main reasons why Britain is failing to produce quality players. Allowing kids to grow in a protected environment without making them think that they have actually made it, is the secret of success. No wonder the best CM in England's history has been constantly placed in doubt since he was 13 years of age.

274~~~
If they keep on doing a good job then why bench them? Its not as if we have a Vidic, a Rio and a Stam in their prime waiting to take their place. 

There's a difference between sticking to a young player and hyping him beyond measure. As long as Mcnair and Blackett can produce the goods and they dont show signs of complacency then they shouldn't be benched. Let the others fight for a first team place.

275~~~
Those three players are totally unreliable and I would be elated if McNair and Blackett actually take their chances and exceed everyone's expectations. Blackett's confidence won't be low, he doesn't seem to be a kid with a weak mentality. If anything he'll be spending extra time in training to improve. There was an article about his work ethic and his humble background, I think you'll find it an interesting and very encouraging read.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2769068/How-training-days-turned-Tyler-Blackett-great-hope-Manchester-United.html?ito=social-facebook" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...pe-Manchester-United.html?ito=social-facebook</a>

I don't think they are far from ready, especially Blackett who has now got five games under his belt. I only see room for improvement. With the record of those unreliable CBs we might see a lot of Blackett, McNair and maybe even Keane when he comes back from loan in January, this season.

276~~~
Nope.Either send them on loan or keep them with the first team.People treating as if we have 40+ Reserves games every season.They're both not have much left to show in the U21s, as per the case for a lot of other players.

277~~~
Evans should be sold at the earliest opportunity IMO. It's been proved time and again he cannot be relied upon to stay fit over the course of a season. How many centre-backs do we need before one stays fit. Get rid and get someone else in, someone who can stay fit.

278~~~
Blackett has shown how putting too much pressure on such young shoulders can do more harm than good. For me the Leicester game was one step to far, the same will happen to McNair if we let it. Blacketts confidence must have hit rock bottom, he’s went from hero to zero for some fans when in truth he hasn’t actually been that great for us.

I can’t think of a time when the our defence has been as scrutinised as it is at the moment, every aspect of our defensive game is going under the microscope, that’s a hell of an ask for any seasoned professional let alone a player who has virtually no first team games under his belt. I’d much rather stick with experience and slowly introduce them to the team, for me Evans, Jones and Smalling are massively underrated in here. Obviously if all our four experienced CBs are playing shit or injured then we will have no choice but to rely on youth, but it’s not a place we want to be IMO

279~~~
Then sell Jones and Smalling as well. I agree that something has to change but you can't single out one player when all three are victums of the same curse.
Out of those three I would keep Jones, the only reason being he has more time on his side. However, on his day Evans is the best of the three IMO.

280~~~
I agree. 7 consecutive games in 2 years is a terrible return! Sell that chap sharpish and lets focus on other reliable players.

281~~~
Nothing to do with threating it like we have 40+ reserves games, who do you drop?

282~~~
I think Evans should go. He's failed to make the grade here. Even at his best Evans is still capable of having a moment or two of madness. I agree about Jones, he's still young and maybe can turn things around. He needs to change his style to avoid some of the injuries he gets.

283~~~
Your overrating of Blackett is becoming laughable, he's been ok, nothing more nothing less. He had a stinker against Leicester, the first real game where he has been truly tested. The same is happening to McNair and no doubt the opinion on him will change when he misplaces a pass or something.

His confidence will be low, it’s nothing to do with having a weak mentality, confidence issues happen to all players, no matter how good they are.

284~~~
My point is sending them back to Reserves is a pointless thing to do.Let them train and compete with those 3 or send them on loan if they couldn't get enough games.

285~~~
This is the Paddy McNair thread so I’m not going to get sucked into another Evans debate, however he has far from failed to make the grade. When fit <i>(and that’s the problem)</i> he has been a regular in the team so let’s not twist facts.

286~~~
Valencia would beat the vast majority of defenders in a sprint. McNair is not a slow player. Perhaps not as quick as Blackett but above average.

287~~~
This. Our best defender.

288~~~
Im not overrating him, on the other hand some people are scapegoating him and calling McNair the new Vidic after just one game. Confidence issues affect every player differently and how much they do depends on the individuals mentality IMO

289~~~
I'm not a default Blackett defender or anything, but that statement is nonsense. He got himself sent off chasing back as the last man, but he was head and shoulders above the rest of our back-four in the first half.

As for Evans, he shouldn't be sold due to being injury prone, he should be sold due to ultimately being not good enough. He would be the defensive equivalent of Welbeck perhaps. He isn't rubbish. He would still fetch a decent fee, but he is not up to 'the standard'. We don't need him, Jones and Smalling - we should ship one and get one top class defender.

290~~~
Yes, this is the McNair thread but i'll say this, Evans needs to be sold. None of you can tell me 7 consecutive games in 2 years is remotely close to a decent return. I don't care how good he can be, he's still a very erratic player and totally unreliable due to his rubbish fitness record. He's 27 in a few months and will only get in the way of developing other players with his stop start career. Ship him off to Newcastle United.

291~~~
This

292~~~
That's opinion, not fact. My opinion is that selling our best defender when our defence is in crisis is completely ridiculous. Saying he's very erratic simply isn't true when you look at his performances over the last few years, it's a statement seemingly based on a couple of performances where he clearly isn't match fit.

293~~~
Of course they will train with the First Team, however who would you drop when Evans, Smalling and Jones are fit. Who do you sacrifice on the subs bench? As I said in an earlier post, they should be introduced gradually and hopefully be more prepared when they are called upon. Obviously the same could happen in regardes to injuries and we have no choice but to play them, but given the choice, I’d rather not, not at this time anyway.

Saturdays Subs
Mata
Januzaj
Lindegaard
Fletcher
Valencia
Thorpe
Pereira

Current Injures
Smalling
Jones
Evans
Young
Fellaini
Carrick
Lingard

Then you have other youth players like James Wilson who will want a place on the team.

294~~~
Are you making things up again?

295~~~
Sorry but that’s just rubbish, he was terrible against Leicester, I take it you didn’t watch the game.

296~~~
Disagree with that. Evans may be a better footballer but a better defender...nah. Evans should be sold. Give Jones and Smalling the same amount of time as Evans to prove their fitness then after that, if they haven't, sell them. But for now, Evans should be the one to go. We cannot afford to have a central defender who cannot be relied upon and he's the most unreliable of the 3 at the moment in terms of form and injuries so, sorry to say, it's time to go Jonny.

297~~~
Evans when fit is a pretty good defender and all round player tbf though he's started this season poorly.

Not that many better than him around at CB that we can get tbf. But yeah he should be close to the chopping block because he cannot stay fit at all and is older and not versatile either. Him or Smalling for me as Jones is relatively less injury prone slightly, is younger, has more potential and more utility as well.

298~~~
Selling defenders should be the last thing on our mind. We had one first team CB available on the weekend. Selling a proven player for us doesn't help that situation.

299~~~
The only thing Evans has proven is that he cannot be relied upon to stay fit. He's made of glass and for a centre-half that is not acceptable. Selling him would make space for us to promote a defender who can be relied upon or buy a defender who can play 40-50 games a season.

300~~~
I did.

Not that I looked at it myself, but I would guess that if you looked back at the match day thread, it would be pretty much all thumbs up until a collective thumbs down after 70 - odd minutes. He was quite okay until he was bad.

301~~~
Id rather stick to defenders who can do the job to be honest. I am sick of hearing how this year will be Evans/Jones/Smalling/Ando/Cleverley year and how much potential these players have. If we could translate the amount of IFS, BUTS and ONCE in cents we would be able to afford to buy both Messi and Ronaldo by now

I can make a list of defenders who did the job at quite a young age. It didn't deter them one bit. The mistake would be to insist on them based on hype rather then on what they perform on the pitch. Our fans tend to sing how we won all our titles playing the Sir Matt Busby way. Well Sir Matt said that if you're good enough then you're old enough.

I am not saying that we should sell Jones/Evans/Smalling and stick to Mcnair and Blackett. What I am saying is that everyone should work hard to get a first team place. There shouldnt be automatic places for anyone in the team and if someone does well then he should be allowed to keep his place.

302~~~
Only just catching up after the weekend's game, but I have to say, I was so very impressed with Paddy. What a fantastic debut.

We were under the cosh for what felt like an age after going down to 10 men, but he kept his composure and had a really good game. Some fantastic headed clearances and he didn't look out of place. Showed some real grit and determination, and it was good to see the other players giving him a well-deserved pat on the back at full time.

On a related note, it's also great to see LvG giving these players a chance as opposed to playing others out of position.

303~~~
Imagine how much of a confidence boost it is for the rest of the young players.

304~~~
You are letting emotion get in the way of your thinking. What guarantee do you have that we can rely on a youngster promoted playing 40-50 games (and at the level needed)?

305~~~
How about we get a defender or 2 in before we talk about selling any? talk about wanting to shoot ourselves in the foot!

As for McNair, he's had 1 game. Back off judgement.

306~~~
When we are winning everyone is happy regardless of individual performances, Blackett did not play well against Leicester, and no one did a good job defensively. The worry is putting him back into the team after a few individual mistakes which have been highlighted and will obviously have a negative effect his confidence. If we have any one of Jones, Smalling or Evans back then they will be played, and if not, I'd imagine McNair will be given his second game of the season.

307~~~
Not at all and none whatsoever, it's a judgement call. You say that like Evans is of the level needed! I'd rather put my faith in a fit centre-back who is young rather than one who is 26, has a long history of injuries, cannot be relied upon to stay fit and also makes questionable decisions for a supposed experienced defender. If you count Blackett and McNair, there are currently 6 first team central defenders (regardless of their age) on our books - 3 of them are injured. How many do we need before a couple stay fit? 

Evans IMO should be sold to make room for the signing of similar age who can bully players, much like Vidic, and who won't get injured every time he goes in for a tackle. <a class="username" data-user="440, @golden_blunder" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/440/">@golden_blunder</a> Well yes, of course. I'm not proposing anything different.

308~~~
You said one of the young defenders can be relied on to play 40-50 games. I am saying what guarantee do you have to suggest that will happen?

309~~~
I said 'A' young defender, giving no specifics and I also said we have no guarantee, it's a judgement call, but there again what guarantee do we have any player stays fit? All there is are those that are injured and those who are not. Evans is injured and generally is a lot of the time and this has been the case for a number of seasons so it's nothing new is it.

310~~~
That's my point, no one is guaranteed to stay fit, so bringing in any player, yet alone a young player and say play 50 games at the heart of Manchester United's defence just doesn't sit with me.

I understand and accept the fitness issues with Evans but selling him fixes nothing.

311~~~
Well exactly what does keeping him accomplish? He's not reliable. I'd rather put my faith in someone who doesn't have a shite injury record, regardless of age.

312~~~
And if that person gets injured? If Evans returns before Jones or Smalling?

I know Evans splits opinion and his fitness is an issue but he is a good defender. And given our current situation he gives us experience and depth.

313~~~
There is no point using logic when it comes to Evans.
Anyway this thread is getting way off topic. Just watched the game again and McNair played far better than I originally gave him credit for, he’s not as slow as some on here would have you believe nor is he bad in the air, in fact the opposite is true. It was great to see Rojo continually congratulate and encourage him, very impressed with Rojos attitude so far.

314~~~
Seriously, you have them injured before they've been given the chance! I think Evans' record has clouded your sense of reality when it comes to defenders - they all aren't as injury prone as he is! He's also never proved himself to be a leader or a defender that can organise the other 3. Never. He's a good defender when he's with a leader such as Vidic or Rio, when fit and on form yes and he's a good footballer, I agree with you there. 

However, I don't know how many times I have to say it but he cannot be relied upon to stay fit. It defeats the object having a seemingly experienced defender who can't play because his injury record is seriously poor and it's not like it's just this season. He's not offering us depth when he's not available for a crucial period of the season and who knows how long it may be before he's available again. 

It's every season with him, he picks up injuries central defenders shouldn't pick up. He's made of chocolate!

315~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

316~~~
Young Paddy had a great debut. Rojo encouraged him throughout. THAT header was outstanding and saved the game for us. Confident on the ball. A great future I hope.

317~~~
Like most of the young lads he did very well, certainly looks a talented young man. The problem is that we are lacking experience and organisation at the back.

318~~~
that header was glorious. What a way to start a United career. 

Couldn't be happier than if one of our academy players Blackett, Thorpe or McNair would develop into a leader at our back over the next years.

Let' go for one experienced CB like Godin in January and let the young players battle it out. The future is bright!

319~~~
How tall is he?

320~~~
Couldn't find his height anywhere when I checked yesterday.

I'd guess 6'3".

321~~~
According to futhead, he's only 5'9. 
They must have that wrong. He's over 6'0 I'd have thought.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.futhead.com/15/career-mode/players/12059/paddy-mcnair/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.futhead.com/15/career-mode/players/12059/paddy-mcnair/</a>

322~~~
Playing next to Ekangamene does make you look taller. 

Best way to tell is to watch the players lining up to shake hands before the game and compare him to a known quantity.

323~~~
It also thinks he's a CAM(outdated...), so I wouldn't take it seriously.

324~~~
He's taller than 5'9" but not as tall as 6'3". Based on the u21s' squad photo I'd say he's just shy of 6'1".

325~~~
about the same, or maybe slightly shorter to Thorpe judging by this

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ByeCb6vIYAAN6fi.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ByeCb6vIYAAN6fi.jpg:large"/>

326~~~
Yeah, Thorpe is listed as 6'2, so I'd guess 6'1.

327~~~
Les Kershaw mentioned during Saturday's u18s game that we test how tall every youngster we bring into the academy will eventually end up. Apparently, it's a pretty exact science. When it comes to goalies we test their eventual arm length as well.

328~~~
Can any of you reserve nerds explain how he jumped ahead of Thorpe in the pecking order?

I haven't been following the ressies as closely as I used to but had assumed Thorpe would be far more likely to get the nod. Has Paddy been playing much better than him so far this season?

329~~~
I think there's a realtivly simple test that can be made to a child to show their eventual height. Measuring their hands or something?? Can't quite remember.

It'd feel a bit freakier if they are analyzing the young players DNA.

330~~~
It's the bones who give you a trustworthy answer. (i think)

331~~~
According to the post-match conference, LVG watched the last U21s game when Thorpe played very well as a holding midfielder so he thought Thorpe was more of that role.He did come on to play midfield role in the last 30 seconds...

332~~~
No. They've both been solid but in my opinion Thorpe edges it. I think prioritizing McNair has to do with potential rather than quality; Louie probably sees McNair as the more likely future first-teamer. Also, Louie did mention being very impressed by McNair's performances in training.

333~~~
He's not our best defender. People are just too sentimental about Evans. So you're saying his erratic play has been down to a lack of match fitness? Wow! I never saw it affect other players this way. Did you see him against MK Dons? Was that a lack of match fitness too? And even if it is a lack of match fitness, it happens too often because he's always coming back from an injury lay off, so ultimately he's not good enough.

Would you keep an employer at your company with similar output? If people are ok with Welbeck leaving because he wasn't the United standard, i.e Rooney and RVP, then they shouldn't be crying over Evans when he similarly fails to meet the United standards set by others like Rio, Vidic, Stam, Bruce, Pallister etc. If he wasn't a home grown player people would be calling for his head. Sentimentality over reality. I hope one of McNair, Blackett, Thorpe or Keane slots in and takes his place. Evans needs to go.

334~~~
Sorry, what did I make up the first time? You haven't seen the Vidic comparisons in this thread and in the matchday thread then?

335~~~
Its funny that the poster you're replying to suggested that you're letting emotions get in your way of thinking! Evans, 7 consecutive games in 2 years, almost 27, very erratic, always injured, he's our best defender though! The Evans supporters are the ones who are letting emotions and sentimentality get in the way of their thinking.

Like you said, i'd rather play one or two of the kids over Evans if they can be counted on to be available when we need them. Evans is just going to block their development.

336~~~
Nope.

337~~~
Of course it fecking was, he hadn't played for months. What point are you trying to make there?

I'm not getting into another pointless argument about Welbeck, but I don't agree that he wasn't up to it. I'd have kept him but that really has nothing to do with him being an academy player, I just felt judging him purely on his goals record was pointless when his contribution was much greater.

I don't think it's a similar situation with Evans at all. I just think he's our best defender and people are typically jumping to knee jerk conclusions based on 2 and a bit games. Your point is that he isn't as good as Rio, Vidic, Stam, Bruce, Pally. Well I agree, but by that token none of our centre halves are. Get rid of Smalling, Jones and Rojo too. And Rafael and Shaw because they aren't as good as Neville or Evra. You then hope he is replaced by some completely unproven youngsters. That's obviously mental. 

He has injury problems and we need to sort them out, I agree. But so do both Jones and Smalling. They've all shown excellent form in patches, dodgy in others and have struggled without a top defender like Rio or Vidic beside them. At a time when we are struggling to keep defenders fit and no top targets are available, I can't see any scrap of logic in getting rid of one of them and promoting someone who's barely played.

338~~~
To be honest I think many were surprised that he was picked ahead of Thorpe, I suppose it comes down to what the manager saw in training.

339~~~
I am sure he did well as a defender in that game as well <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Sorry mate - missed that one

340~~~
Thats on you. Don't accuse me of making shit up

341~~~
I've had a quick look on this thread, couldn't find any comparisons.

342~~~
As far as i am concerned all three of those players are on a knife edge as far as their United careers are concerned. If we can get two good CBs in the next two windows, those boys will be phased out. You can't equate what I said about getting rid of Evans because he hasn't been as good as those who came before him to getting rid of Rojo, Shaw and Rafael. Rojo and Shaw are both new to United and they are both young and not injury prone players. Evans is 26 and has been playing here in the first team since the age of 19. Thats 8 years and only one excellent season (2010/11), the rest a mix of good performances , erratic ones and long lay offs due to injury. He's had his chance, time for others to step in

343~~~
You haven't seen comparisons of his header to Vidic's technique? There's at least three Vidic mentions in this thread alone and a few more in the matchday thread. Anyway, its what it is.

344~~~
Really? You think posters are comparing McNair to Vidic because of a header? As I said, making things up.

345~~~
Was really surprised to see this guys name in the line up. Had never heard of him before hand and thought there were a few other youngesters in the reserves/U21 that were closer to the first team than him. Sounds like he had a good debut, so hopefully he can kick on and turn into a quality player for us.

346~~~
Because of one header? You're bonkers

347~~~
This is where it comes down to me, if you want him gone, that's fine but you can't just sell a player and say lets get a replacement. You have to have that replacement lined up. We have seen how common it is to miss out on targets and selling Evans without a guarantee of bringing in a top quality defender is far too much of a risk in my opinion.

Don't say well we need to get rid of Evans to make room, that's nonsense. Bring in a better defender than him and make him no longer valuable to the squad and I will agree, find a club for him. Until then, we need him.

And I don't want this to sound like I have anything against Blackett and McNair, you won't find anyone happier to see them involved and doing well, it's just we have to calm down at times I think.

348~~~
One thing is clear, the reserves will be excited to see how easily they can get chances under van Gaal.

349~~~
Yeah, makes a difference from last season.

350~~~
Thorpe was doing well in the first half of last season, but had two loan spells to Birmingham cut short by injuries to the same ankle, made only 6 appearances in loan.

The season before that he was a near constant in the reserve team, but was often deployed in midfield. I believe this was done to expand his game, as he was a very conservative CM/DM, as well as to give others a chance at CB.

Our games went from 3-1 to 1-0 when Thorpe was in midfield, have to say we were much more entertaining with him at CB. However in the first team he could afford to focus primarily on defense and would be unlikely to hamper our offense.

McNair was chosen to replace Thorpe and he formed a strong partnership in central defense with Ekangamene (who is no longer with us and used to playing midfield). He's quite good on the air and is calm and composed, though not as strong in the tackle as Thorpe, imo.

I thought Thorpe's two years extra experience would have made him the obvious choice, but I suspect McNair was just better in training.

As far as this season in the reserves it's hard to say with us shifting between formations. In our five games our back line has been (according to the match reports):

United 4-0 Sunderland; (4) Janko, McNair, Vermijl, Shaw (Thorpe in MF)

Liverpool 1-1 United; (3) McNair, Thorpe, Vermijl

United 3-0 Norwich; (3) McNair, Thorpe, Goss

City 1-4 United; (4) Vermijl, Thorpe, McNair, Varela (C. Evans 46)

Spurs 1-2 United; (4) Janko, Vermijl, Thorpe, C. Evans

351~~~
FM 14 says he's 173cms 5'8"

352~~~
Thanks for writing that out <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Gives a good background

353~~~
Someone else found a site listing him at a similar height. But from the pics I saw online of him next to the 6'2 Thorpe I'd say he's 6'1.

He was quite skinny last season, btw, he's filled out a good bit.

I'm a fan of Thorpe and I thought he should have gotten a chance last season. So I'm a little biased.

My recollection is that the defense in the reserves was very good In the first half with Thorpe, but a bit better with McNair.

But I didn't think it was enough to rate McNair over Thorpe, as its a team game.

But considering McNair was playing next to Ekangamene, who hadn't played CB previously for the reserves, I was pretty impressed.

Can anyone tell me if Ekangamene played any CB for the U18s?

Also, I wrote McNair stepped up in the middle of last season, was it actually at the beginning off last season and he just didn't get into the team much until Thorpe left?

354~~~
Hopefully at least one of the academy lads will come good.

355~~~
Was I the only worried seeing this thread bumped thinking that he might have got injured? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

The constant defensive injuries throughout the seasons have taken their toll on me <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

356~~~
To be honest I'd rather see this lad ahead of Blackett - he showed more in that last game than Blackett has apart from pre-season

357~~~
You should reserve judgement until you see more of him. One game against West Ham is simply not enough. No telling how he would've dealt with the speedy Vardy. Valencia raped him for pace a few times.

358~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Indeed reserve judgement, yet judge him.

359~~~
All im saying is one game is not enough. That wasn't a judgment, it was a small observation <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

360~~~
Neither Jones or Smalling looked as if they were in training today so I expect to see McNair again on Sunday. Another big game for him.

361~~~
Think Ekangamene played left back a few times for the U18s but don't remember him playing at CB...you need a MUJAC or someone to confirm though!

362~~~
Right on, thanks

363~~~
McNair, like in the U21, showed a good amount of composure at the centre of defence. He did little wrong against West Ham, but then again, West Ham aren't that great going forward, anyways. Still, once the big target men came in, McNair did well to deal with them and was a key figure in weathering the storm.

I'm happy that he's getting his chances. After a good season at the U21, he's getting his chance in the first team. With Smalling and Jones both unlikely to play against Everton, I'm looking forward to seeing how he does against better-quality players.

364~~~
Ekangamene did play as a central defender alongside McNair last season at the U21. He did very well as a central defender, as well, and I thought it made better use of his strengths than his supposed best role as a central midfielder.

365~~~
You clearly haven't watched West Ham then. 

They been pretty good going forward this season and have a few decent strikers, who are also quite physical. McNair dealt with them well.

366~~~
Youre right he mainly played lb or cm, I only ever remember him playing once as a cb for the under 18s following an injury.

367~~~
I'm aware of their more progressive football with Big Sam starting to move away from the long-ball tactic and moving in towards short passing and good movement (why he's playing a diamond midfield setup). However, it's early days for them, and, like Hughes at Stoke in his first season there, it'll take a bit of time before they become better going forward.

Having said that, I don't think McNair had an easy job at all. He still did well against West Ham, especially when we were under the cosh and Jenkinson (baffled as to why Wenger loaned him out) got more involved in the game. I'm very happy with his performance, and I hope to see more of him as he's shown that he has the mentality to make it into the first team.

368~~~
He's had a real taste of what the PL is about now. I just hope United fans don't get on his back when he does make a mistake because we have to understand that these youngsters like Blackett, Mcnair and Thorpe are a work in progress and need time to adapt. The media will play their part in magnifying an error a player makes but I don't think we should get sucked up in the hype they create regardless if its positive or negative. He had a decent début and has potential to improve and that's the end of it.

369~~~
Left wing a few times too thinking about it!

370~~~
Big test for him vs Everton and Lukaku then.

Somewhat worried.

371~~~
Him and Rojo as the pairing? Rafael and Shaw as the fullbacks.

372~~~
Lukaku has been playing a lot more wider than previous seasons and normally wide right. So he is more than likely up against Shaw and Rojo than McNair. If Matinez plays his usual game, it will be McNair v naismith more than anything during play. More worried with set pieces with our defence than anything. Everton are a big, strong team compared to our guys.

373~~~
Lukaku has  been playing wide to catch out LB's physically.

Considering our CB's being more of a weakness right now won't make that much sense to play Lukaku wide this game as he's not that great there too.

374~~~
Won't Blackett pair up with Rojo at CB?

375~~~
Charni and McNair played CB for a big portion of last season for the U-21's.

376~~~
No. LVG said Mcnair will start being only right sided defender fit.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Oct/juan-mata-and-paddy-mcnair-to-play-versus-everton.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...e=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

377~~~
Great confidence boost for McNair, LvG is really strict about not playing two CB's with the same main foot.

378~~~
Depends on if Martinez changes his gameplan. He seems to prefer having him wide right and drift inwards. But to me that means Rojo will get the brunt of Lukaku with Shaw. But if plays him as straight through the middle, it will be a big test for McNair. Obviously with the big loss with Mirallas injury, he may want to change up his attack to hit our weaknesses.

379~~~
Yes, I had wondered if Charni had any previous experience at CB.

McNair's success last season, considering his inexperienced partner, is all the more impressive.

380~~~
You guys know that Charni isn't at the club anymore, right

381~~~
Yes.

382~~~
Not surprised that he'll start. Rojo is guaranteed to start as the only fit senior defender and Louis doesn't like two right footers or two left footers in defence.

383~~~
Tbh they didn't target him as hard as I thought they would. Not taking anything from his performance. Valencia troubled him with his pace a few times though, but against Lukaku its going to be speed and brute force, not to mention Everton also have Eto'o. This will be a massive challenge for young McNair, matter fact it will be a challenge for newcomer Rojo too.

384~~~
Blackett - Left footed
Rojo - Left-footed

In LVG's system, both cannot play at RCB because in this system when a Left footer tries to pass down the right hand side, the balls will almost always be shaped away from the pitch and not within a pitch as a right sided passer would do.

385~~~
It's not going to be about individual match ups where we will have a challenge but, more as a team. Lukaku or E'to will get their one on ones if we end up playing stupid. Doesn't matter who is in the back if Everton are given the freedom of OT to constantly go up against them. If we play our game, keep the ball like we know how to and dictate the pace/play, Rojo and McNair will fare just fine.

386~~~
Van Gaal specifically refers to our defenders as right sided and left sided centre halfs. Unless he can help it, Rojo and Blackett will be fighting for a place on the left, and Smalling, Jones and Evans for the other. As they're all out, in comes McNair.

387~~~
Which is kind of strange considering Thorpe is available.

388~~~
Lukaku drifts to the right wing.. which means if anything it is Rojo who'll be up against him most of the time and Shaw. If he tries to target McNair by taking him down the left side.. he is less effective.

389~~~
Ties in with what was being said in the Thorpe thread about LVG seeing him as a midfielder.

390~~~
Mcnair has definitely leapfrogged Thorpe for the time being as a CB.

391~~~
i think he was chosen because he is more comfortable on the ball.

I am a little worried how he will deal with Luckaku, hopefully he does well!

392~~~
I think people are also forgetting Eto'o is at Everton now as well. Both our CBs have a job on their hands Saturday.

393~~~
So he's going to start against Everton then? He definitely deserves it from his performance against West Ham. Guess that means Jones is still out, though?

394~~~
Good luck to him. Another huge test, especially if Lukaku moves inside which I assume he will.

395~~~
Except that McNair had a great game in a tight match and has some momentum and valuable first team experience ahead of Thorpe.

396~~~
I don't think it is strange because Paddy is getting to play but that he said there is only one available which means he doesn't even see Thorpe as an option for the right sided CB.

397~~~
That has nothing to do with LVG's comment. I'm not saying Thorpe should start over McNair. McNair did well in his last game and should be rewarded with another start as none of the senior right footed cbs are available. I'm saying that it's possible LVG doesn't consider Thorpe as a cb based on his comment that McNair is the only right footed cb available.

398~~~
Thorpe is not even in contention because he hasn't played once. Therefore he doesn't figure in the equation. If he had said something similar last week, then your point would be more accurate. We can't put in a rookie with no game time ahead of a Rookie with game time. If Thorpe and McNair both started last weekend (hypothetically speaking, where LVG had no option but to play two Right footed CB's because hypothetically everyone else was out of the equation) then you'd be right.

399~~~
A couple of United fans (khoazany is one of them) have mentioned that LVG implied Thorpe was a midfielder right after the West Ham match.

400~~~
I know he asked if charni had played cb for the under 18s

401~~~
Dunno, about that. Thorpe is pretty comfortable on the ball himself and has played midfield very well too.

I think Mcnair was chosen because he is bigger and stronger. 

Have always thought coaches didn't trust Thorpe at first team level at CB because of his lack of physical attributes slightly. Maybe LVG also sees him as a DM more, dunno.

402~~~
He did said so and personally I don't think LVG is well-informed about our young lads (or not yet) due to his focus on the first team first to fully execute his "philosophy".Most of his knowledge about the lads seem to come from the U21s match he attended (so I don't think he know yet who is Joe Rothwell).Hopefully Thorpe will make LVG change his mind during training cause I don't see him becoming a holding midfielder long-term.Better to be Pearson.

403~~~
Damn...so you're telling me there's a possibility that Thorpe was overlooked because LVG considers him a midfielder? Thats kinda funny

404~~~
If it was because of his looks then, I'm fully behind LVG on this one

405~~~
I know it sounds funny but everything LVG said and done pointed towards that conclusion.At least Thorpe is really comfortable in that position so it's not the end of the world for him yet.Has plenty of time in training to change the boss's mind as well.

406~~~
I think you may be right but it begs the question of if he has the time to come watch a couple of the u21 matches then surely he has some time to have a chat with Joyce about the players or read some reports on them.

407~~~
We only know one match in which he attended and you can't help but spot the pattern of every new player he promoted so far to first-team training are the one who played well in that match.Any other possible reason why Pearson/Rothwell got overlooked this week in first team training even when 3/4 of our senior CMs aren't fit enough?Funnily the match he attended is the only match since God knows how long did we play Thorpe in midfield and bench Pearson.

408~~~
If you're gon diss another man's looks then show us yours hehe

409~~~
Ok

410~~~
Pearson was in first team training in the latest pics IIRC.

Rothwell has gone down the order with LVG though. Behind Pereira as well as Harrop now Seemingly when he was travelling with the first team squad on occasions under Moyes.

I am pretty sure LVG and his staff would have taken all reports from Joyce and other coaches and evaluated most of these players in training too as much as they can. Also Giggs would know too. For me so far it has been tough to spot any patterns though.

411~~~
Is that really you? I bow down to real musicians/artists.

412~~~
Yep

413~~~
We're seriously off topic but what band do you play with and whats your genre/style? PM some links to your music

414~~~
Will do tomorrow
In bed at the moment

415~~~
Do you have a link? Can't seem to find these comments and I'd really like to see them for myself.

416~~~
Lukaku generally prefers to attack on the Left. Rojo, and Shaw will have to deal with his presence.

417~~~
If that is true, that'd be very interesting indeed. A Daley Blind position perhaps?

418~~~
Maybe he drifts so much wide because fullbacks are generally easier to bully physically?

419~~~
Yes, he's played a lot of holding midfielder for the reserves over the last two seasons. Personally I thought it was to expand his game and improve his passing with a plan to bring him back to CB. I'm pretty sure he played CB at Birmingham on his loans last season, all 6 games (two injuries cut both loans short).

Of course a new manager is probably a big factor. He may like Thorpe's size at DM, Pearson is a bit undersized ands less experienced. He may simply like the way Thorpe plays that DM role and feels he's more needed as cover there.

I don't think I've ever read someone saying he's better in midfield than defense. But van Gaal sees things a bit differently, it seems.

420~~~
No that's not him I thought it's him but it was Rafael.

421~~~
Doubt Giggs has much knowledge on the youth players.

422~~~
Why not?

423~~~
I fear for the lad today. He's playing against a beast of a man.....

424~~~
Who's not been that good this season. Plus, we're playing at home and we ought to start asserting our presence from the start. I'm more wary of Naismith. That tricky little bugger has improved way beyond expectations this season. McNair would have to be on point to stop him.

425~~~
I fear for the team. McNair is fine whatever happens,  if he has a howler no one will blame him and he'll go back to the U21s. If he has a blinder he'll start to be acknowledged as a possible starting CB.

426~~~
Naismith?

Lukaku has mainly been playing from the right so far this season so it will be Shaw and Rojo who deal with him if he's there again.

427~~~
How good has this lad been eh? Has completely marked Lukaku out apart from that one moment when Baines launched a tremendous ball that split the defence. Has not been intimidated by the strength. But, the most pleasing aspect of Paddy is that he knows just where to be at the right time. Intelligence is the name of his game.

428~~~
I'm worried young Paddy might get in trouble for having a pocket on his shorts. Are they regulation?

429~~~
When David Moyes eventually gets a new job he needs to take his CBs and show them videos of this lad.



Smalling & Jones could do with a screening too <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

430~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

431~~~
Well you got that bang on Carl <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

432~~~
And also a good header. It's like watching the 'young' Evans.

433~~~
I'm at work so don't know where Lukaku is playing. Is it a safe assumption to make from the winky face that he's playing through the middle? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

In fairness, he has played the last few games from the right...

434~~~
He is great!

435~~~
Paddy is cocking mint

436~~~
Not absolutely perfect, but very solid again. Only let his man get past him on a very rare occasion.

He's been more impressive than Rojo the last couple of games and didn't look much if any worse than John Stones on the other side

437~~~
Solid today..And i really like his discipline so far compared to our other defenders. Hope he really builds on it.

438~~~
I loved how he bossed the tank that is Lukaku, but he was a bit nervy near the end. Would like to see more of him.

439~~~
Liking him more and more in the first team.

Dealt with Lukaku pretty well today forcing them to then shift Lukaku on Rafael.

440~~~
Bossed Lukaku today. Excellent performance.

441~~~
I think the problem is that we don't have any commanding aerial defender right now.

Hence when crosses and late pressure come in we cannot win any first headers clearly to push the ball away into distance. Need a Vidic.

442~~~
Rojo has a better first touch than him but that's all he has, McNair was excellent again today.  I fear he'll make a massive mistake soon becase of lack of experience, of course I'd love to be proven wrong, but it will be that mistake that makes or breaks him as a regular.

443~~~
He seems oddly calm and reassuring. The emerging quality is definitely there.

444~~~
Take a bow son. Take a bloody bow. What a performance.

The way he handled Lukaku was stunning.

445~~~
Strong performance, such a difference between him and Blackett at center back.

I'm not at all sure Thorpe could have done any better. Most impressive.

446~~~
A lot of these young lads have just needed a chance, that's all.

Brilliant from him today.

447~~~
Didn't look out of place at all today. Good game from him. Hopefully he keeps  putting in these performances

448~~~
Fantastic for me. So much for getting destroyed by Valencia and Sakho and so much for getting destroyed by Lukaku. Has done very well and forced Lukaku to try play elsewhere.

449~~~
I don't think LVG is the type to crucify a young player for a mistake to be honest. He will make mistakes his is young, but he looks like he can become a very good player and so does Blackett

450~~~
Yeah, there will be a screwup eventually. Hopefully he won't get attacked the way Blackett was when it happens.

451~~~
Had Lukaku in his pocket all day. Still early days, but this lad looks like the real deal

452~~~
Sorry I didn't mean that anyone would grill him I meant losing self confidence,  defending is all about confidence as much as it is for a striker.  It's all about how he'll handle himself when the times comes, Blackett is a fine example.

453~~~
There were plenty saying he'd get mauled by Lukaku, where are they now?

Only way to get experience is to play. I love the fact that with Van Gaal if you are good enough, you're old enough. McNair might be playing on adrenaline right now but, until he loses his head, he deserves to be starting. Lord knows only Jones has looked anywhere near him at right centre back.

454~~~
Yeah, Blackett always looked a little bit ropey in there. McNair hasn't yet.

455~~~
Very exciting prospect. It's only been two games but he's shown worlds of promise. He's brave and I think he reads the game very well too - I can't remember a moment where he was caught out tactically. He was always on the right side of a very imposing guy in Lukaku. Nothing seems to phase him and he's great on the ball. I also like how he's not afraid to try things, but he'll play it safe when he needs to. Cracking defender.

456~~~
He's been very good, looked very composed on the ball.

457~~~
Thought he played much better than his first game.

Looked a lot more assured.

458~~~
Calm, calm calm. Had Lukaku in his pocket.

459~~~
Its early days, but I feel lot more comfortable with him at CB than I did with Blackett. Seems more aware of what's around him and positions himself alot better. Did fantastic to keep Lukaku out of the game, as I think even Evans, Smalling and Jones would've struggled to handle him. Think he can make a real impact this season, and hopefully in the future as well.

460~~~
Showing maturity beyond his years. We've given him 2 tough games and he's passed them both with flying colours. Lukaku hardly got a chance our of him. When he's facing strikers with such pace and strength you've got to concentrate and defend with intelligence. Really impressed so far. He's justifying LVG's faith in him.

461~~~
His long passing is wonderful, so effortless at times.

462~~~
Well done to the lad, he was well good.

463~~~
Played well today. Was a bit nervous at first because he seemed too quick to get up Lukaku's ass, which I thought we'd pay for, but he settled, got to grips with a beast of a striker and kept him quiet for the remainder of the match. Good signs.

464~~~
Blackett was WONDERFUL until that last 30 min for Leicester. We re lucky to have both of them so we can remove Smalling and Evans from ever playing for us, hopefully they stay healthy.

465~~~
Blackett pretty much got away without little attention for 2/3 vs Swansea to be fair as he was still good on the ball.

466~~~
I've been a lot more impressed with him then with blackett so far. Looks solid defensively and good on the ball.

467~~~
Good performance today. He's done very well in his first couple of games considering how little experience he has.

468~~~
I disagree with all of this.

469~~~
Seems to have a good brain between his ears and ice in his blood.

470~~~
LVG will have a headache picking a CB partnership for next match.

471~~~
Sm of them will probably get injured again before it comes around given our injury record.

472~~~
incredible to think he is only 19 and this was just his second game. and very few of us even heard of him before. we were all talking about michael keane and tom thorpe but van gaal proves once again he got an eye for young players.

when smalling or evans return i believe it is paddy mcnair who deserves to keep him place in the starting line up.

473~~~
I really hope he gets the praise he deserves within the media, rather them just spinning the it as Lukaku had an off day. 

For a kid to come in, on his second ever PL game, and handle Lukaku like that really was phenomenal.

474~~~
Probably best not to throw him to the wolves of Chelsea and City, but he's already ahead of Jones and Smalling for consistency and not getting injured!!

475~~~
I'm very very pleasantly surprised. He had him in his pocket all day, bar one chances near the end of the first half.

476~~~
Lukaku was quite average today to be fair, although McNair had a solid game in dealing with him nevertheless.

477~~~
If his brain is that good, he'll get himself to a doctor asap in that case.

478~~~
Another good game from the lad. 2 senior games and 2 good performances.

479~~~
He's playing like an established PL defender. Bodes well for the future, very impressed with him.

480~~~
I love how he didnt try to lunge in when Lukaku received that over the top ball. He realised he was beaten and rather went around Lukaku to try block the shot.

481~~~

482~~~
He made Lukaku look very ordinary.

483~~~
What a spot from vanGaal.


Talk about grabbing a chance with every bit of you.

484~~~
The absolute state of that <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

485~~~
My thoughts exactly

486~~~
It's all right Paddy, you can let poor Lukaku out of your pocket now.

487~~~
Great performance again. When senior players come back, he will still make way but these games would have given him huge boost in confidence and we can be more comfortable now knowing that we have 2 good young CBs waiting to step up in Blackett and McNair if the senior guys are injured/not doing well enough.

488~~~
Imagine what a confidence boost these two games will have been for the kid.

Really mature performance today.

489~~~
Very good performance from the lad. Just once in open play where he lost Lukaku. Otherwise he had him in his pocket. He still has to improve a fair bit in set piece situations IMO. At the moment we have very little presence in there.

490~~~
He looks incredibly assured for a young man playing only his second game for Manchester United. Got a good feeling about him.

491~~~
So will he continue to play in the starting XI? Suddenly feel that dropping him for either Smalling or Evans is not so good idea after all

492~~~
He deserves to stay. He's out performed Evans/Jones/Smalling so far this season.

493~~~
If he keeps playing like this, he should start. Really proud to have an academy guy in the lineup, this is what United is still about.

494~~~
Played very well. If Jones is fit then I'd drop him but not for the other 2 crocks at our disposal.

Not sure why people are going hard on Blackett though. He was our best defender until those minutes at Leicester and had the added pressure of playing a 3 man defense which was causing all sorts of problems.

495~~~
Just when you thought Blackett is a positive surprise of the season, this guy comes and push everyone on the bench. Honestly can't see Smalling, Evans or Jones getting close to this lad with their constant absurd fitness problems.

Kid look like he's really taking the chance from Van Gaal but I would be cautious in throwing him on the deep water against Chelsea and City but who knows... maybe that's what we need, a little bit of shock therapy to the squad.

496~~~
I absolutely agree. I hope he continues to start and stays fit. Being able to play a run of games would be a huge advantage over the more senior players.

497~~~
I don't understand the logic behind removing him for the big boys. the more established guys come in rusty, no match fitness and no rhythm going. Based on that, I'd rather put in a somewhat battle hardened Mcnair before the others. 

If the others see him leap frog them, they wake up and smell the roses that this is man utd, you work hard for your place, if it means you are injury prone then go the extra mile to solving it, whether its improving your bio-mechanics, your flexibility, your strength or even your decision making.

498~~~
Very proud of him and he's brought himself into the reckoning as a legitimate squad option. We've gone from having three injury prone senior centre backs to six in a space of three months, and it only cost us £16m and a bit of balls from Van Gaal.

499~~~
Another calm mature performance from him. Keeps it simple.

500~~~
I think a lot of people need to realise this. Well written.

501~~~
Not sure I believe that stat...are you including U18s and England games?

502~~~
Its not as if McNair has been playing cb his whole life either, in fact far from it.

503~~~
I thought he was excellent all things considered; building really well on what he did last weekend against West Ham.

I'd certainly keep him in the starting XI for West Brom regardless of the potential availability of the three invalids; though I'd probably blink ahead of the Chelsea selection and withdraw him out of that one, as I'd think it would be too much of a risk on his confidence playing against the champions-elect this early in his career.

LVG will I'm sure have a plan for his develop already in place having seen how well he's done so far.

504~~~
Fantastic stuff, something about watching an emerging centre-half, great to see. For the tools ready to ditch Evans and Smalling on the back of those two performances, well...I can't find the words at the moment.

505~~~
Bar that one time he let Lukaku get the wrong side of him at the end of the first half, he kept him very quiet. He plays with an extremely high level of maturity considering he was only called upon due to a shocking injury crisis at the back. Fair play to him.

506~~~
But in that instance i thought Rojo should have picked up Lukaku. At the end of the day he was the one facing him so should have been aware of the danger.

Still i've been really impressed with him so far. I was thinking about this today but had SAF been in charge you wonder if Blackett or McNair would get a chance like this. The last time we had a similar defensive crisis we used Fletcher/Carrick as our CBs, SAF probably didnt think he should risk a young CB getting ripped apart by PL attacks but i like how LvG has put a lot of faith in them - injury crisis or no

507~~~
I already prefer him to Smalling and Evans.

508~~~
I'm not counting England, has he played CB for them? That would surprise me greatly.

Did he play CB at U18s?

He had 3 games at CB for the Reserves two seasons ago (he had the worst goals against average of anyone who played CB for us).

He had 2 games at CB last season on loan, 1 at each club (in which his team conceded 4 in the first half (after which he was pulled) and another 5 goal concession in 90 minutes)).

He's had, what, 2 games for us in a back 4 this season?

Even if he did get games at CB at U18s that's no preparation for the EPL.

509~~~
Its amazing how a 19 year old kid, in only his second ever PL match, can look more confident, more assured and less likely to shit themselves then two players who have over 200 United appearances between them.

510~~~
Wouldn't play him against WBA, because Jones needs some rhythm for the Chelsea game. He would deserve a start in our next match though, he was brilliantly calm and composed today, joy to watch.

511~~~
Yeah he played mostly as a CB in his 2nd year in the under 18s and a few times for England under 17/18/19s

512~~~
Another great game from young Paddy. Had Lukaku in his pocket all game.

513~~~
Wonder if Northern Ireland are thinking of calling him up. Looks better than their captain this season. (Evans is their captain, right?)

514~~~
As good as he's played I'd still definitely go with Jones for the next two. No defender in the league can handle Costa currently, better to let Jones try than possibly ruin McNair's confidence.

515~~~
Except for Kompany, who made Costa look like a 12 year old girl. But ye, I hope Jones is back too. We need that sort of aggression and strength against Costa.

516~~~
They should call him up to tie him up if not anything else.

Is he eligble for any other Country ?

517~~~
I wonder if he could end up being our Alaba?

518~~~
Steven Davis is our captain. McNair will likely get a call up very soon, was probably too soon to call him up him up for these internationals with only one senior game under his belt at the time, but next time round is lookin likely.

519~~~
Ah, right, cheers for the confirmation.

520~~~
If he keeps this up, could spell the end of the road for Evans.

521~~~
Just the south I'd assume.

522~~~
Now that you mention it that makes sense. He looks like his experience level is about that of an U18 center back. 

He doesn't look like a complete novice, I don't think. Just very raw.

As I said before, 2-3 years on loan playing CB and I think he'd be ready to play for us.

523~~~
Kept Lukaku fairly quiet today. Which is not easy to do.

524~~~
He's done brilliantly, but agreed he should make way for Jones to give him game time before we face Chelsea. 

I'd rather McNair than Smalling though. For me the way McNair has played and his potential will be the final nail on Chris Smallings United career.

525~~~
I'd have him behind jones and rojo so far. lets be honest evans and smalling have been wank.

526~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-umJTFr3Z0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Excuse the music... Wanted to make a video of his "duels" with Lukaku. Lost out only on one ball over the top to Lukaku, but overall did very well.

527~~~
His header from Baines' cross was quality.

528~~~
I agree, I don't think van Gaal will fancy how pedestrian Smalling is when possessing the ball.  I was surprised that he seemingly jumped the queue over Thorpe, but his play in the first two matches has proven that van Gaal made a good decision.

529~~~
Love the willingness to throw someone like McNair in there and see what he's got.

530~~~
Great job done

531~~~
He's a very good talent. But I think we should protect him a bit. Don't want to overplay him as he will make mistakes eventually. Everyone does. But we don't want him to feel them too many times at such a young age. Play him bit part behind Jones/Evans/Smalling. In 2-3 years time, he should be ready to be consistently thrown into big games. But I can see LVG's trust's in young players with Blackett in the last few games. And with Wilson in the Everton game. He could have brought in Fletcher to tighten up the midfield ala Mourinho-style but he thrown in Wilson and kinda asked him "now prove yourself young man". This is no small game and it'll do Wilson a world of good in terms of experience albeit only a short while.

532~~~
Yeah what a fantastic two games this young lad has had. Couldn't ask for much more.

533~~~
Another solid performance. Considering it is his 2nd game, he's done very well

534~~~
He kept lukaku under control... Something I was worried he wasn't up to

535~~~
Put some trust, belief in youngsters and they will pay it back with decent/good performances,always great to see that.I heard some  saying how we did not have a choice then to play them but that was not only solution.

536~~~
I like this kid, seems to be a more stable selection and impressed me more than Blackett

537~~~
Looks to me that he earned his place in the starting 11 for the next game too, even if some other CBs are back from injury.

538~~~
Hoping he and like many of our other players now turn up at away games.

539~~~
This kid. Doesn't seem to show any fear does he? Didn't back down against Lukaku one bit. Quite impressive from the last 2 games; very glad van Gaal is bringing through our youth players.

540~~~
I'll actually be a bit annoyed if one of the other centre backs comes straight back in. Definitely deserves to start against West Brom, and then take it from there in regards to the next two.

541~~~
Agreed in fact I was worried that Blackett might be in the team ahead of him for yesterday's game. Not due to Blackett's ability obviously but more of McNair's assured performance against West Ham. He faced a really physical team in West Ham bombarding his goal constantly for one entire half whilst also managing to keep out one of the most physical players in the league in Lukaku for the entire match. He has been incredible the past 2 games. The only plausible reasons I can think of dropping McNair for one of Jones, Smalling and Evans would be to shield him from the pressure and to protect him due to his inexperience and youth. However, for LVG it's if you are good enough you are old enough so that shouldn't be a problem as well.

542~~~
I'd be happy for us to rotate him, Rojo, Blackett, and Jones for the two CB positions, with an established CB coming in January or the summer. I've lost patience with Evans and Smalling - McNair's emergence has served as the death knell for the hopes I had for those two.

543~~~
He is called Paddy..maybe Martin O'Neill will steal in and nab him for the Republic <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

544~~~
He is from Ballyclare so despite being called Paddy I imagine he would only play for the IFA

545~~~
Even the one he lost out on (I think it was jut before half time), Lukaku had a shot off target but watching the replay McNair would've had a block on it had it been on target so he did well there too really.

546~~~
Doesn't look phased and really had Lukaku in his pocket yesterday. He's took his chance well and let's hope he's given more opportunities.

547~~~
No chance of that happening.

548~~~
The experience he's gained from the past two games he's played will be priceless to him. Did very well yet again yesterday and I hope to see him rotated when Jones comes back.

549~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29487243" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29487243</a>
Looks like he is going to be called into the Northern Ireland squad.

550~~~
Paddy from Ballyclare.

Maybe the FAI could actually put some money into their own youth teams, rather than scouting Northern Irish teams and approaching players based on their name/school.

Utterly disgraceful the way they act.

Fantastic to hear Getsme!

551~~~
If he's strong enough to take a physical challenge against Lukaku like he did yesterday then he surely got a chance to make it in United.

Good future ahead of him.

552~~~
Oh this again <img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/><img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/><img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/>

553~~~
I think some are going a bit over the top. He's done well in the two games but I would still bring back our senior CB's ahead of him. If I'm honest, Lukaku made it easy for him yesterday. 

He's got time on his hands. I think people tend to go over the top with our academy players one way or the other. I hope he has a future here but it's hard to tell over 2 games.

554~~~
Yet you fail to quote the post where someone more or less says he's most likely a Protestant so he will stay with them ums.
I understand that players want to play for the South but you can't blame Northern Ireland fans for getting pissed off when they see posts like that.

555~~~
He didn't really engage him physically did he? Everton played may be 2 crosses onto Lukaku's head but McNair was pretty much doing his job before Lukaku even got the ball. He was showing Lukaku where to receive the ball and got in ahead to take it away. Just a brilliant performance.

556~~~
Anyone born in the North has dual citizenship so is eligible to play for the Republic as far as I know. Hes not going to switch allegiances though

557~~~
Based on Smalling' performances in particular so far, I'd play McNair every time over him. At least he doesn't go daydreaming at some point in almost every game.

558~~~
Done himself no harm at all with those two performances... I thought Lukaku would bully him but he didn't really let him.. impressed.

559~~~
Its been an amazing month for him considering he only made his u21 debut for Northern Ireland less than a month ago

560~~~
So assuming Smalling and McNair were both fit and we were playing Chelsea tomorrow, you would go with McNair over Smalling?

561~~~
In current form, yes. Smalling has been God awful.

I couldn't care less if he's a senior player.

562~~~
Indeed, playing international football can only be a good thing for him. He has a chance of playing as well, Northern Ireland are missing both Evans and Craig Cathcart I believe.

563~~~
Its Ramshock though. He's on a wind up as per usual.

The poster that responded is talking out his arse. FAI poached no one. If a player declares for the Republic they'll pursue it if they deem them good enough, simple as that.

Alex Bruce plays for NI now. Should I have a rant about that?

564~~~
Has he returned Lukaku to Bobby martin yet? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

565~~~
You can't compare Alex Bruce to the players we have lost <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
I'm not going to get into it here but you say that the FAI have poached no one? Surely you don't believe that.

566~~~
Smalling has started twice this season. Came off the bench vs Leicester (was poor) but he's been injured otherwise. Not just the fact he's a senior player but it's because I think he's a decent CB and not terrible.

567~~~
I personally think that out of all of our now senior centre backs, he's the one that's most likely going to be shown the door when LVG spends some more money in that department. I was really excited about him after his first season too, but he's horribly regressed since then. I just don't trust him anymore, especially in the bigger games.

568~~~
Agree re. thread. Not sure theres a suitable one out there though....

And yes for the record I do believe it.

569~~~
This. This place is pathetic at times.

570~~~
I do know that

571~~~
They put more money in than the IFA do Wullie.

That'll do

572~~~
Sorry misread your post thought it said he could only play for the IFA not would

573~~~
Im not on a wind up as usual so keep your nose out Unionist Deco,

The FAI has 12 regional centres to work with kids on a daily basis. The IFA has 4 and I dont think its full time. 
Im involved with the Rosario club in Belfast and Im aware of the state of the youth game.

574~~~
Indeed. It's been an amazing couple of years for him if you think about it. I still can't quite wrap my head around how it's possible to go through the physical and positional changes he's gone through since he was 17 and not look out of place in United's starting XI at 19.

575~~~
It happens.
As I said I understand that players will want to play for the ROI, I get that, I think it's an unfair loophole that the Republic have, but it's their right to abuse it as much as they want. However, what I can't stand is people looking at a players religion to see if he will opt for the ROI. As for young McNair, I have no idea what religion he is, nor do I care.

576~~~
He wasnt even getting regular U21 action either. So LvG saw something Warren Joyce and Paul McGuinness couldnt see

577~~~
Yeah especially since its only a year ago that he was looking somewhat out of his depth playing as a centre half in the under 19s Champions League and getting sent off. His all round development in the past year has been very impressive and I think Warren Joyce deserves a lot of credit

578~~~
No problems. Him and Evans would make a good pairing if Evans stayed fit.

579~~~
How's it unfair? That's a very narrow minded statement. If a person feels Irish they should have the right to play for the republic. I only feel sympathy when someone changes their allegiances after playing for one country the entire way up until senior.

580~~~
Most of the players who have opted for the ROI have played underage football for Northern Ireland. As I said, I have no issue with it as it is the rules, however those players had no issue playing for Northern Ireland when they were younger. It wasn't until they had become a relative success or they had been approached by FAI scouts that they decided to switch allegiance.

581~~~
Totally the other way round.McGuinness's decision to make him a CB has saved his career.He couldn't compete with the likes of Pearson,Rothwell,Weir,... further on the pitch.Joyce played him almost every game in the second half of last season and he has improved a lot during that period.

582~~~
Id continue to start him, at the moment we don't have any senior CBs so i see no reason to bring Smalling/Jones ahead of him considering theyre also unproven.

I still have some faith in Evans ability but not on him consistently displaying it

583~~~
He's been an u21 regular since the turn of the year or thereabouts.

Yeah, by and large Joyce is doing an excellent job. Unsung.

584~~~
Utter bullshit. I know that the FAI have been in attendance at IFA Youth Games on the basis that they are scouting out potential players. 

And you can have Bruce back if you wish, I mean, it isn't like the FAI haven't done the same thing *Cough* Adam Barton *Cough*

585~~~
To a certain extent I'd agree, however Jones is the better player at the moment and would be better suited for the game against Chelsea. Saying that, many didn't think McNair would cope against Lukaku and he had him in his pocket the entire game.

586~~~
Theres a huge United connection in the Northern Irish squad at the moment with Carroll, Cathcart, McCullough, the two Evans, Norwood and McNair and Croskery and Jordan Thompson in the under 19s and Lewis Thompson played for the under 16s last month

587~~~
Indeed. I have high hopes for Norwood, never good enough for United but he has a lethal foot on him. Now young McNair could be our main CB for years to come alongside Evans.

588~~~
Alongside someone else maybe. Not Evans.

589~~~
Hmm another live one. You lot need to read up on shit and stop screaming from the same gospel sheet. Also get something for your cough

590~~~
I was talking about Northern Ireland.

591~~~
Yep definitely. The scouts in the North are very active.

592~~~
Who played at CB before him then Keane and?

593~~~
It's true, look at Getsme's post earlier on the page. I know people who have worked with youth players from both Irish League and youth football who confirm the same thing. Scout the players then drop a line to see if they are interested.

594~~~
Oh ok.

595~~~
They have every right to. The IFA have no ground to stand on. Your argument about the FAI not spending money on youth development was wrong. They have 12 full time centres to the NI's 4 and those arent full time. The passport and citizenship issue is somewhat a unique situation and any kid born in North can choose to play for South if they so wish its just the way it is.

596~~~
Thorpe and Keane then Keane went on loan and McNair took over the starting role since then (Love played CB for a few matches as well)

597~~~
So Thorpe and McNair both CM's converted to CB's. Makes you wonder what LvG didnt like in Thorpe. Is Thorpe a lefty?

598~~~
I was taking the piss about how the FAI approach Northern Irish youth players. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

What they are doing is morally wrong, they are abusing this totally unique situation to their own advantage, how many players from Northern Ireland actually end up playing for the Republic of Ireland? 

I believe that the FAI would be happy enough to continue their sectarian head selection of Northern Irish players because it gives them an advantage. I've yet to see anything otherwise. 

When the IFA are trying to make a more nonsectarian atmosphere around football the FAI are doing their best to stop them. 

But anywho, I'll be at Windsor on Saturday hopefully seeing young McNair make his debut.

599~~~
Complete and utter mad hatter bullshit. Behave yourself Nev ffs

And Michael O'Neill didnt select McNair I dont think

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/why-did-northern-ireland-boss-michael-oneill-not-pick-manchester-united-new-boy-paddy-mcnair-30628093.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/s...ter-united-new-boy-paddy-mcnair-30628093.html</a>

600~~~
Apart from air duels he managed to block him few times without a foul.

For a player with such little of PL experience a brilliant performance indeed.

601~~~
It were different cases.Thorpe was always a CB and only play CMs mostly in his first year for the U21s to develop his game and partially to save his career in case his height was too big of an issue to play CB.McNair was an attacking midfielder when he first come to us at 16 and played various positions in his first year with us (didn't play that much due to injuries from what I remember and he was really further behind the pecking order).He was converted to CB in his second year originally due to Ioannou's injury during the Milk Cup that year.

Thorpe is a right footer and LVG seem to regard him as a midfielder by some reasons.

602~~~
So you are saying that them picking players based on the religion isn't sectarian? Aye alright chap.

And you don't think the IFA are trying to stop sectarianism? Aye okay. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

And he was called up today.

603~~~
Its the FAI not the IRA, sectarianism has feck all to do with it behave. They select kids who they deem to be talented and who they think would be interested in playing for the south. So that rules out about 99.99% of protestant kids doesnt it which therefore leaves the nationalist kids such as Darren Gibson and James McClean. What part of this is hard for you to understand?

604~~~
lads, take the discussion regarding North v South to the football forum. Keep it friendly

605~~~
Of course sectarianism has something to do with it, look at the players who they selected who aren't talented just because of their religious background. If you want to be naive and think what the FAI is doing is fine, then go ahead and live with your head in the clouds. 

I see you never mentioned the other part mind.

606~~~
Very impressed by young McNair. I think we've got a diamond there. He played very assuredly against a very physical West Ham forward line and he wasn't phased by Lukaku who has given merry hell to far more experienced central defenders that Paddy.

607~~~
I'm confused. 

Are you saying the FAI is being sectarian by not targeting protestant kids from NI too? Even though the vast, vast, vast majority of protestant kids from NI would have zero interest in playing for the Republic?

Or are you arguing that the FAI is being sectarian because they're picking crap Catholics from NI? In which case I'd point out that we have a lot of crap footballers from the republic too...

608~~~
Out for 3 weeks hamstring injury

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29487243" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29487243</a>

I thought I noticed him get injured towards the end of the game when Everton were creating chance after chance.

609~~~
Unbelievable.

610~~~
You simply can't make it up with United.

611~~~
My final post on this issue within the thread, but the FAI target players from NI no matter how shit they are because they know they will turn Northern Ireland down. 

Anyway, it seems the wait for his first Northern Ireland cap will go on a little bit longer with this recent development, and more joy in the injury front for United. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

612~~~
I'm sorry but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

613~~~
If you didn't you'd cry.

614~~~
What the feck?

615~~~
Bloody Norah, not another one. I did see him slide off the pitch in the 2nd half and clutch his knee, but he carried on. Someone has put a hex on us.

616~~~
Chill out mate we still have a lot of defenders in the U18s...

Now this is not even a joke <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

617~~~
Oh Neviller I have missed you and your stubborn stupidity welcome back chum

618~~~
Thorpe to be given a chance?

619~~~
Moyes quite obviously had gypsy blood

620~~~
Jones and Smalling should be back

621~~~
We might get Jones and Smalling back. I'm just sorry for McNair because he had a great chance to make his mark with a run of games.

622~~~
I heard he's been seen flogging clothes pegs around Ardwick.

623~~~
Yep I think McNair will be gutted more than the overall team as it means Jones likely will come in and maintain his place. It will require another injury (which will happen quite soon) for Paddy to get back in the team.

624~~~

625~~~
Don't worry Jones and Smalling will injure themselves again soon.

626~~~
What kind of black magic is this shit?

627~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

628~~~
Unbelievable..

629~~~
Congrats Paddy. You're a real United player now.

630~~~
we are cursed. We really are. No other explanation.

631~~~
No wait, he is not actually injured? Another defender surely not? You'd swear some scouse bastard is making use of the old Voodoo dolls when it comes to our players.

632~~~
Just. wow.

Thank feck for international break, to be honest. But then it wouldn't surprise me one bit if Jones injures himself again before the West Brom game in a warm-up or something.

633~~~
Beyond ridiculous.

634~~~
Just our luck.

635~~~
Wait till few of our players get injured for their countries too.

636~~~
Wow, that's a bit shit.

637~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You can only laugh.

This club is a feckin meat grinder.

638~~~
This is worse than Arsenal and they still have Diaby in their squad!

639~~~
fecking hell. I usually loathe international breaks, but I find myself looking forward to the next one like it's some kind of checkpoint so we can hopefully get back on our feet. 

Every season, we run out of centre backs at some stage. How does this keep happening? I can't remember any other teams around us having to pull unknown youngsters up, or playing midfielders in defence like we've done at least once per season for the past 4 or 5 years.

I'm pretty glad we're not in the Champions League. The squad would be on it's arse.

640~~~
WTF..?! What did he do between the time he left the pitch and this morning. Crazy.

641~~~
We usually used to rival Arsenal anyway last few seasons but had more depth.

But this season we've broken all sorts of records.

642~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utZakuLolKk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

643~~~
We're gonna end up forced to play the under 11's best centre back.

644~~~
Didn't we once almost bring in David Gill's kid due to defensive injuries some years back?

Has Woodward got a lad, and can he play centre half?

645~~~
It's getting a bit ridiculous now. When was the last time Terry or Cahill were injured, let alone them and two or three other centeral defenders at the same time.

646~~~
You couldn't make this shit up, first time DDG had the same front four for two consecutive games and it goes to feck anyway <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

647~~~
It's two weeks until we play our next game anyway and I am not sure he'd play against Chelsea if Jones is fit (and van Gaal will probably want to test Jones and Rojo together against West Brom before Chelsea game). It's never good to have a player injured mind.

648~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I can't believe it. It must be a joke, the only standard for United defender is to be fit and you are in the first team ATM.

649~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

650~~~
Yes, although he wasn't exactly akin to some guy down the pub.  He was a proper youth defender.

We had Corry Evans and Scott Wootton at the time, though - maybe we should have used them instead?  De Laet too, although he wasn't available for European games.

651~~~
You can thank Moyes for that partially, Fergie and injuries for the rest of it.

652~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Gill" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Oliver Gill</a>.  Looks like he gave up footie.

653~~~
Hmm...well, maybe now Thorpe will finally get to play CB for the first team.

Perhaps these injuries are all occurring because the soccer gods, like me, want to see Thorpe at CB.

654~~~
You cannot make this stuff up.

655~~~
All the Scousers wishing injuries on our players each week must be delighted.

656~~~
I bet McNair would have kept his starting spot after the international break if he'd stayed fit. He certainly earned it. Now Jones will be fit again after the international break and will hold his place down from then. For 2 weeks until he gets injured anyway. McNair should be fit by then at least.

657~~~
How we can have any defensive stability or understanding when all our players get injured one by one.
Our defender can't able to fit more then 2 games. Rojo must be super human.

658~~~
There is really no other explanation. They probably still can't pronounce Rojo's name, he is fecked once they learn.

659~~~
Is Klay Rooney fit enough to play in United's defense ?

Of course he is ! He got two healthy legs and I need a drink.

660~~~
Nah, by the time the West Brom game comes around Jones and/or Smalling will be fit again. If anything this injury occurred because the footie gods love to f*ck with Thorpe's head. Perennially near, yet so far.

661~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> thank feck rojo isn't injury prone. Even our u21 defenders are injury prone

662~~~
Thorpe must be practicing some type of juju

663~~~
Jones was very good before his injury, so hopefully he's back. Real shame for McNair though.

664~~~
It won't be long until one of us is called in to play CB.

665~~~
Too bad we released Ekangamene, he'd be on the bench at this point as a CB.

666~~~
Ahead of Tom Thorpe of course.

667~~~
Oh ffs...
Cant believe it.....

CB at United, you can be sure you'll be injured after 2 or 3 games..

668~~~
W
T
F
?

How is this possible?

669~~~
If I didn't laugh I would cry. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

670~~~
This is mental

671~~~
Yep, decided to continue his studies

Couldn't blame him, the anti-glazer crew were spraying graffiti all over the family home at the time

672~~~
Like it was implied by someone in the "Injuries" thread a little lower, someone must have forgotten to ask our players to go a little (if not a lot) softer in training than during matches. Chelsea under Mourinho apparently hold soft training sessions and thus lose less players through injuries unlike the way we emphasize on playing like Neanderthals.

673~~~
"THE NETHERLANDS!! I SAID LIKE THE NETHERLANDS!!"

674~~~
It's a conspiracy I tells ya!

Thorpe, anyone?

675~~~
Also, he wasn't that good. Perhaps he could have made it professionally, though in neither of the <i>-ship</i> suffixed leagues.

676~~~
That was a odd one, horrible to hear about the graffiti on the family home.

I seem to remember him deservedly winning reserve player of the year after a really good season? not 100% certain though.

677~~~
Safer occupation: drumming for Spinal Tap or defending for MUFC?

678~~~
This is devastating news <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Just when I thought his and Rojo's understanding was developing well

679~~~
What the hell?! Seriously?! Let's just play mannequins in defence ffs

680~~~
Welcome.

681~~~
He studies economics at Durham according to Wiki... not all footballers are dumb!

682~~~
I expect you'll see time at CB before he will. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I never thought his passing was good enough to make our midfield, it's such a difficult area to play in. Would be interesting to see him as a DM though, to see if he has the speed of play required.

683~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

684~~~
he shows the same quality as our other CB's. He manages to be fit for 50% of our games. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

685~~~
Seriously, is he out for 3 weeks<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-injury-jinx-strikes-4395727" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">?</a> as the Mirror reports, or is this us protecting him from burn out given the international call-up?

686~~~
Ah feck. Just when things getting interesting to see academy product in the main team.

687~~~
So we've gone through three first team centre backs (Smalling, Evans, Jones), and now two of the u21 lads (Blackett, McNair). 

Assuming no one gets fit in the next two weeks it will be Thorpe starting at the back, and I'm wondering who we're going to chuck on when he gets ruled out for a month after being bitten by a dog.

688~~~
If you watch the match closely, you can see the moment when he gets injured. I noticed it at the time. Because it happened so late in the game and we had already used our 3 subs, he chose to stay on.

689~~~
How many hamstring injuries since the last 3-4 years ? Our players have weak legs ? Our warm up is shit ?

690~~~
Honestly speaking we could have a hundred CBs but with this curse-like phenomenon we'll still find ourselves without a fit CB pairing for the majority of our games. Strange and infuriating.

691~~~
Get over yourself. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Don't accuse me of other members thank you.

692~~~
Alright Willie

693~~~
Stop being a WUM, it's making you look like an idiot.

694~~~
Apart from Toure beating him for that one chance, I thought he did very well.

695~~~
I thought he did better than both Rojo and Smalling. I'm convinced he can become a good defender for us in the long run.

696~~~
Showed a lot of composure and did well again. McNair's performances have been promising, give him his chance to play a few games.

697~~~
Agreed and was playing out of position (he plays center right normally) plus back from an injury and thrown in to a team with ten men at an away derby. With no Smalling, Jones and highly likely, no Rojo. Will be starting next week.

698~~~
The lad did well when he came on. Fair play.

699~~~
On the ball he's better than all of them, need to be more aggressive on defending though.

McNair-Blackett for next week?Sounds like the only CB partnership we haven't seen this season...

700~~~
Promote him to the first team. Looks far more assured on the ball then any other of our defender.

701~~~
Looked good today.

Should have been tighter on Aguero on the goal though if i am nitpicking.

702~~~
This guy right now is our best central defender, seems a lot more assured than the others that's for sure.

703~~~
He is definitely starting next game and should keep getting more chances. Very impressed by him so far.

704~~~
Considering our lack of available center backs he's going to get a run of games here. I think he could really nail down a spot if he keeps performing like he has been.

705~~~
I'm struggling to think of a centre half having a better start to their time in the United team, nevermind one thrown in at the deep end from the youth team.

706~~~
feck all our CB's.

Should be first choice from now on. He's played in 2 games where we've been under huge pressure when down to 10 and looked very composed.

707~~~
It's not that hard to be fair.

708~~~
Confident. Good on the ball. Reads the game well and isn't a slouch. 

Should be starting. He's good enough.

709~~~
Coming into a derby when we are down to ten men and playing with such composure is a real credit to him, nailed on to start next week.

710~~~
Was excellent before the injury and performed admirably today, despite being thrown into the fire. Impresses with every single appearance. Hope he makes the best of this latest chance. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

711~~~
I think he's better than Rojo. He actually is composed. He's also much better than Blackett IMO from what I've seen of the two. He doesn't worry me at all when he plays.

712~~~
He was to blame for us conceding the goal and lost Toure a few times so lets not get carried away with that cameo performance.

713~~~
The only CB in the team that can be relied on. That's saying a lot for a 19 year old and the overall state of our back four.

714~~~
Agree with the calls for him to be starting games, looks far more mature than his years, his composure is great.

715~~~
I thought he was poor (relative to a first team player, obviously not relative to a reserve team player). I noticed 3 clear errors from him. Should have been tighter on Aguero when he scored. Twice lost Yaya Toure.

Of course Smalling and Rojo were even worse. But Carrick seemed better.

716~~~
The cafe hates pretty much every player but this guy it seems. He didn't do as well as people are making out here, could have easily been at fault for 2 yaya tour goals. But whatever, he was better than Smalling and Rojo today.

717~~~
He wasn't to blame. Yaya got the better of him properly once. Nothing wrong with that. Yaya bettered many players today.

718~~~
Tighter on Agüero? Carrick was on Agüero and then went to cover the near post area. In that split second Agüero got into position like the excellent striker he is. The big mistake was letting Clichy getting into that position to cross in the first place.

719~~~
Those things stood out for me too.

720~~~
Exactly. Can't believe people are calling that as a McNair mistake.

721~~~
Looked confident but lost aguero for the goal, and almost let toure in for 2 more. Good talent but not ready

722~~~
Probably fits into LVG's philosophy the best. We seem to love passing the ball out of the back these days and he is clearly very comfortable doing so.

Jones/Smalling and even Evans give me fits when we try to play from the back with short passes.

723~~~
First choice CB for our next match now? Who else have we got?

724~~~
Nothing wrong no, but it wasn't a brilliant display. I am still for the lad starting next game, I like him - just saying he can do better than what he did today - only defenders who can come out of that game with credit are Valencia, Shaw and Carrick at a push.

725~~~
Not bothered about the performance today. Give him a good few home games and we can judge him if he's ready then.

726~~~
Felt sorry for him as he was thrown straight into the deep end but I felt he did okay.

727~~~
More like first choice CB for the rest of the season. I'd start him ahead of Smalling, Jones and Evans.

728~~~
So what you're saying is, he let the best striker in the league get half a yard on him, and was outjumped by 6ft4" Yaya Toure a few times (though granted, one of those times he could have been positioned better)...??

Of course he's ready.

729~~~
Only behind Jones in my count for our best defender, atm. Looks more assured than all of our defenders including Jones too.

730~~~
cant believe 19 year old cb can became our best defender. 
i just hope we play him more.

731~~~
Despite his idiotic red card, I'd like to see Smalling and McNair as CBs. I think the pair will do very well, given the chance.

732~~~
He should do better on a few occasions with Toure but surely he's not at mistake for the goal.

733~~~
If he's fit play him. feck the other 'senior' tossers.

734~~~
Thought he did fantastically well being thrown in there.

Should be starting a CB for us based on his performances this season.

735~~~
No wonder he didn't do excellently. Both starting CB's off, his partner is a MC who hasn't played all season and there's a winger at right back with you one man down away to City. In comparison to that he did pretty well. Pretty much the worst scenario to come on as a defender.

736~~~
I agree - awful scenario.

737~~~
The worst Jerry, the worst!

738~~~
Maybe, but Toure is a seasoned world class player, eg that turn he did on McNair, with the young lad still learning. Far better and more experienced defenders have been well beaten by Toure. He's done pretty well all in all, given he has been thrown in at the deep end this season.

739~~~
I personally don't think he is good enough to start for us just yet, he allows the attackers too much room and doesn't play tight enough, you seem it with the Aguero goal and the Toure header which he should of scored from really.

There are positives there though, he is great at bringing the ball out from the back and is good in the air, just needs to work on his marking as against the top, top players you cannot allow them the extra room

740~~~
Again, think about the two players you're talking about...

741~~~
Which I agree, are two top players, but the realistic fact is, if you want to be challenging these sides you need to be the at the top level or you will be punished

742~~~
But this Aguero - the best striker in the league, and Yaya sodding Toure who was actually awake. Cut the kid some slack. 

Aguero will find half a yard of space whoever he is up against because he's THAT good. Yaya Toure will outjump 95% of players he's up against because he's that tall.

743~~~
And an accomplished defender would be bang tight on them, because that's what they do, of course Aguero and Yaya have the ability to peel away but Paddy was yards away on both chances, not even challenging for it. 
I will cut some slack though, he looks very talented and I do think he has a good long term future here but as of right now, he isn't at the starting level for the big games in my opinion. Although he will probably have to start every game now by default, could be the making of him though.

744~~~
Kompany looked an absolute fool when Rooney megged him. Not ready for the top level I suppose?

745~~~
There are maybe only a couple of our current CBs whom I feel more comfortable seeing at the back, senior CBs & new Caf favorite Blackett included. 

Quite remarkable that, given his experience...

746~~~
I would rather have 

Rafael-Carrick/Jones-McNair-Shaw as our back 4 until we can buy some more class back there, i was kinda glad Rojo went off just not in that manor, I mean he was a liability.

747~~~
He did well enough but did completely let Aguero go for the goal. Switched off there.

748~~~
Let's be honest now. He made a few errors tonight. Though it would be harsh to judge him on that.

749~~~
What's he meant to do? Read his mind? He's with him - and Aguero makes a quick dash perfectly timed for the cross into his feet. That's what Aguero does against ALL Centre Backs he comes across. He makes quick movements and makes space for himself, because he's world class.

750~~~
That's what all strikers try to do and all defenders try to avoid. 

It wasn't a very quick dash nor a feinted one. Watch it again. He takes two jogging steps forward and is free with Paddy two three yards away. All the time with Paddy having him in his view. Nothing special about that move at all. Lack of concentration from us is all.

751~~~
He's very composed for a 19 year old isn't he? Thought he played well today, especially considering it being a Derby and all. Would like to see him play more often, but I'm not sure if he's good enough to start yet.

752~~~
In his position, he is the best in the World at the moment.

753~~~
Agueros movement was fantastic tbh, McNair was with him and that split second movement meant it was too late for him to cover. TBH, it shouldnt have even got to that position, the initial pass to Clichy should have been cut out.

That turn by Toure was fantastic too, but other than that did well. No nonense and no silly mistakes. Should start for us next game.

754~~~
This is why I wish were still in the Carling Cup (or whatever it's called,) as it would be the perfect opportunity to give McNair some minutes.

755~~~
thought he turned away from the shot. Should have taken the hit.

still over all he has been very good for us.

756~~~
Of course defenders are trying to avoid this, but they are always in second best position, if they have to react. I can't see how that should be his mistake, it's just the way football works. If the cutback from the touchline is precise and the striker movement decent, it's nearly always a goal against any defender. How you say that Agueros movement isn't quick in that situation is beyond me, especially when you are in motion as a defender. The error was in my eyes, that we allowed Toure too much time on the ball in that situation, but that's easier said than done. It was just a really good move from City and Toures pass to Clichy just in perfect. 

All in all I was very pleased with McNair. When he came on, City had their best period of the game and were pushing for the goal and he had to play in a patched up defence. Can't get really imagine a worse scenario for an 19 year old defender in a derby.

757~~~
He's got some issues but the best thing is that there is clearly talent there. I can see him becoming a good CB for us.

758~~~
Feel better with him on the pitch than I do Smalling or Jones.

759~~~
I think we might have something here. He appears genuinely smart and a lot more calculated than any of our other center backs.

760~~~
Great to see a 19 year old coming on derby day and showing such composure. One instance which was a complete mismatch was him against toure's header which went over the bar. He needs to bulk up I guess. The quality is there for all to see. He's confident enough to bring the ball forward even under pressure which even some of our other midfielders are reluctant to do. Made some glaring mistakes though but he'll learn. Lots of positives. Very exciting prospect

761~~~
Very mature and composed yet again. Small mistakes are a given with youngsters. More first team minutes (which seems inevitable given our defenders inability to keep themselves fit/not suspended) and more experience and we could have a very good defender on our hands. He's shown a lot of promise for someone I considered more of a midfielder.

762~~~
This Paddy lad seems to have the same level of composure as Januzaj. Both are young, both will make mistakes here and there, but they are the future and a bright one. I am glad to see McNair progressing and doing well. Once we have more or less stable starting 11, the overall understanding between the players, their collective  play will improve and thus create more solid foundation for development of our young guns.

763~~~
and funny enough, They probably have more experience paying wit each other than any of our other partnerships, albiet at a differant level and differant positions.

764~~~
I thought he and Carrick looked like a decent pairing. Both comfortable on the ball. I thought Louis might look to keep that going as opposed to bringing Blackett back in.

765~~~
This 100%. There's mistakes in all of them.

766~~~
I'd second that.!

767~~~
Third.

He could have gotten closer to Aguero for the goal, but that's forgivable to me, a small mistake that unfortunately gave Aguero a better chance which he finished.

At least he can stay fit for a run of games and improve.

768~~~
Hopefully we don't bring Blackett back just because he's left footed. Blackett isn't a CB.

769~~~
What do you see him as? LB?

770~~~
Yeah. Just not a very good one.

771~~~
Don't really see how my opinion on this can be controversial. He made a mistake by not marking his man. I'm not saying it was a horrible error nor the biggest error we made when defending that goal, but it was a mistake nonetheless. I'm sure Paddy will be kicking himself a bit for it, as would any other defender. Defenders are always in the next best position but they still manage to follow runs, block shots and get first to crosses, corners etc. 

I agree that he, other than that and being turned by Yaya, had a good game. I obviously also agree that he is one for the future.

772~~~
Blackett has been raised as a LB, so he's our backup at that position.

773~~~
Some of the youth experts may know better but I can't remember them ever playing together for the U21s anyway.

774~~~
Don't think so, if so it was an aberration.

775~~~
Really? whys this? out on loan I presume?

776~~~
Paddy only started to get play for the U21s last March and was partnered with Charni in nearly all matches except for one with Evans and I think one with Keane and Blackett would have been on loan during that time. Blackett largely played LB for the reserves as well. They may have partnered each other a couple times at younger age groups but Paddy used to play in midfield until he was in the U18s and I think Blackett still mainly played as a LB.

777~~~
Yea I haven't payed much attention to the u18's or u21's since last season, apart from the big games, Yea I remember Blackett always played LB for the u18s and u21s. I never really thought much of him either to be honest, seems much better so far at CB.

778~~~
Apparently Blackett played CB for the U18s.

779~~~
Good on him for coming on and doing well, still plenty of work to do and plenty of time on his side but credit to the lad.

780~~~
Called up for the Northern Ireland squad to face Romania.

781~~~
Absolutely dread any thread getting bumped at the moment as I fully expect it to say - calf strain out for 143 months

782~~~
Was alwys likely to happen with Hughes and possibly Evans being out.

783~~~
Hughes is in the squad, Evans isn't.

784~~~
Is this his first call up? Great news nonetheless, should give him a wee bit of extra confidence.

785~~~
Haven't saw the squad yet but I swore Hughes was out for weeks if not a couple of months.

786~~~
Called up for the last squad but has to pull out due to the United CB curse.

787~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so true.

788~~~
Bit strange how unfazed he looks when he defends, really like his style of play. Geniunely wouldn't mind seeing him play all season.

789~~~
He was called up before but ended up getting an injury which ruled him out.

Apparently Hughes' injury is currently not known, waiting for scans to see how bad it is. I'd imagine O'Neill is just hoping that he might be okay, where as Evans apparently hasn't returned to training?

Anyway I'd imagine Craig Cathcart or Luke McCullough, two former United men, would take place of Hughes rather than McNair, and that McNair is only called up for the 'experience' of being in the senior squad.

Interestingly there are 5 former United player's and one current United player in the Northern Ireland squad.

790~~~
Where the hell has this guy come from? Impressed me every single time he's played for us. Had no idea about him at all before the Everton (that was his debut right?).

791~~~
West Ham.

792~~~
This kid looks like the real deal. Doesn't fold under responsibility like Januzaj and time is on his side. Having him and Shaw definitely makes me feel good about our future defensively.

793~~~
This absolute bollocks about januzaj has to stop. F*ck me, so after about 3 matches McNair looks the real deal because unlike Januzaj he doesn't fold under responsibility (who stepped up for moreless a whole season). And time is on his side, he's a whole 2 months younger than Adnan. Sounds like you'll be slaughtering McNair once he makes a balls up.

794~~~
Aye. Seems to be a new thing on this forum.

795~~~
I think its just poor english from <a class="username" data-user="85160, @vibe" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85160/">@vibe</a> 

I assume he meant McNair has the same mental strength as Januzaj and steps up in the same fashion.

796~~~
You could be right actually <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Apologies <a class="username" data-user="85160, @vibe" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85160/">@vibe</a>. My mistake.

797~~~
Its been happening to Rojo too, who is now a "car crash waiting to happen" I read earlier. The caf seem to have overly negative people who you would think were opposition fans the way they gloat about what good business they hav done i nthe past, while shitting on our own. I mean, even Shaw got a bit of stick for being more expensive than City's back line,its ridiculous.

798~~~
Yeah, it is getting a bit frustrating at the moment, I tend to ignore it but some posts just drag you back in.

799~~~
We have no idea how McNair will turn out. Evans was going to be world class early in his career...but that hasn't exactly happened..

800~~~
Gonna agree with this, usually I heard about our most promising youngsters from  reading articles or on redcafe but I don't think I ever came across his name. Very impressed but its early days, but if we have a potential world class CB in our ranks we'll be set for a long time!

801~~~
Wasn't Thorpe supposed to be the more promising defender? How was McNair become such a revelation overnight?

802~~~
Was absolutely convinced he was injured, when I saw this thread at the top of the page. 

Was about to go full on mental

803~~~
Exactly this. This kneejerk shit really grinds my gears

804~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No, it's my bad. Should've said "like Januzaj, he doesn't fold under pressure." Got my sentence structure mixed up.

805~~~
Delighted for him

806~~~
Really hope he goes on to become a star, just got his name on the back of my shirt…

Edit: Think the caf has just buttfecked me by putting the wrong number on his profile here…..

807~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What number did you put?


Edit: Just saw those profiles, didn't know about those. Andreas and Wilson have the wrong number too and wtf kind of Northern Ireland flags are those?

808~~~
Just say your surname is McNair.

809~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that'd really annoy me

810~~~
He makes me the least nervous of all our centre backs at the moment. Im not sure if that says more about him or the rest of them though. 

Hes so calm on the ball and assured in his position for his age and has yet to really do much wrong. I can forgive him for letting arguably the world's best striker get a yard on him on Sunday.

On the other hand Rojo is settling in, Jones and Smalling always seem seconds away from an injury/mistake/red card, and Blackett is equally young, so the competition is not high. 

I think him and Rojo could be a good future pairing, hopefully for longer than the usual 60-70 minutes before one gets injured or sent off.

811~~~
Unplayable. On his profile here says he is 52.. In actuality he's 33. So I'm walking around with a faking McNair 52 shirt like a gimp. I'll be easy to spot for any of you lot. Anyone reckon this can be rectified?

812~~~
You could probably do a hatchet job and turn 52 into a bad looking 33. Otherwise you're probably stuck with getting a new one, or hope that for some reason he gets given 52...

813~~~
Righto <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Just gonna have to walk around like an idiot. Feck it

814~~~
It was all I could think of <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Maybe bother him on twitter if he has it and he'll have sympathy for you and take 52 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. But seriously, I wasn't really sure what number he had and I doubt many will...until he starts playing more regularly anyway.

815~~~
Now we're talking

816~~~
I could become part of "the legend of why McNair switched to 52"

817~~~
McNair and Rojo is starting to become my preferred CB pairing.

818~~~
Likewise

819~~~
Technically it is the official Flag for Northern Ireland as no other flag has any legal standing.

820~~~
Oh didn't know that. So are the other home nations flags not official either or just the Ulster banner?

821~~~
I think the other three home nations flags all have some sort of legal standing, but the Ulster Banner became defunct in 1972 I believe.

822~~~
Good news on his call up to the Northern Ireland squad. Lets hope he doesn't get injured!

823~~~
Haha and I was between him and about four other players as well. His was the only number I didn't know off by heart. Serves me right I suppose

824~~~
If someone calls you out on it, just tell them Paddy's even more talented kid bro - Eoinaghan (which totally sounds like a Northern Irish name) - was given the #52 shirt on Monday after a marvelous performance for the u18s at the weekend and if they haven't heard of him then - haha - joke's on them, and perhaps they should STFU in future, ignorant sluts, and also *appropriate quip about their appearance*. Kunts.

825~~~
If you give me a lesson on how to pronounce that fecking name I might be able to pull it off. I'm only going to wear it in Lebanon where they won't even feckin realise.

826~~~
Eoinaghan <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's not even a real name.

827~~~
Must admit the laughs have made it easier to deal with my anger at their uselessness and my stupidity/haphazardness.

828~~~
From <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/man-utd-defender-mcnair-welcomes-northern-ireland-call-4047530#.VFv-78luRLM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tribalfootball.com/artic...es-northern-ireland-call-4047530#.VFv-78luRLM</a>

829~~~
Good stuff. Would be nice to see him and Evans as their CB pairing. If Evans ever stops being injured. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

830~~~
Still early days, but very impressive yet again. Has earned the right to start every game until we get a more accomplished defender.

Him, Shaw, De Gea and to an extent - Mata are the only ones to deserve some credit for today's game. Well done. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

831~~~
Another impressive performance. Credit to Van Gaal for playing him.

832~~~
He's been average and he'd had nothing to do. Not even close to impressive.

833~~~
Impressive in that he's basically a youth player thrown into the fire and playing better than a good number of experienced players around him.

834~~~
Really? Because Blind took pretty much all the responsibility for him (and Carrick has as well) and has been there to receive the ball every time. He's had virtually no defending to do (and he's been outpaced and outmuscled on the odd occasion he has where he hasn't flat-out failed to read the ball) and been a non-entity when we have the ball.

There's nothing about him that looks like it will be a Premiership player, never mind a Man Utd one.

835~~~
He's still fit and not dropped a bollock. That's impressive by our standards.

836~~~
He looks like he will be one actually. The fact that he has performed with the level of composure he has at only 19 suggests he has a bright future ahead at United.

837~~~
He won't make 100 Premiership appearances, never mind for United. He just offers nothing at the back, he never gets tight to his man, so they always have time on the ball and yet when it's played in behind he is always slow to read it and doesn't have recovery pace. He's just hiding at the back, dropping off and praying he doesn't get exposed. He's not made a catastrophic error so it's better than 75% of our centerback performances this year but Daley did 80% of the work at the back today, McNair has been a passenger.

838~~~
He's still yet to drop a massive bollock, which is more than can be said for most of our other defenders.

839~~~
Thank goodness you're nowhere near the coaching set up at United then.

840~~~
Which is doubly amplified by his age and experience level. Definitely has a bright future.

841~~~
Strange that we subbed him <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Thought he was looking safe as houses.

842~~~
You miss the runs through the middle to get our attack going then I take it ? He hardly went hiding and this is his third good performance for us and he has dealt fabulously with West Ham's front 2 and Romelu Lukaku.

Think you need to calm down a bit.

843~~~
Looked like he had a knock and limping a bit.

Another good performance.

844~~~
another solid permance from the lad.

845~~~
Slight knock I think, or at least, that is what we will tell the press, I expect it is the club pulling him out of the NI game.

846~~~
I like that he doesn't give off that dodgy vibe that other defenders do. You're just waiting for the likes of Evans and Jones to stumble into players or trip someone up at times. He seems quite assured or maybe we just need to see more of him.

847~~~
Not sure about the future.. but we needed to rely on a player from the reserves and he hasn't let us down. That is all you could have asked for

848~~~
At this rate the likes of Evans, Smalling, and Jones will have to perform or face being subbed for McNair.

849~~~
They have to be fit first before we can talk about that.

850~~~
We were lucky to concede just one in both of those games, West Ham he gets a free pass for (although he has similar before the second off anyway) but against Everton he didn't do well at all. 

What a strange thing to say.

851~~~
Well they have been at various times this year and McNair has more or less matched or outperformed them when he's been on.

852~~~
Did very well again, just the communication error with Blind that let Campbell through.

Last year Stones got into the Everton team at CB because of injuries and this year, after plenty of gametime he's being talked up as a good CB. I'm not saying McNair will be the same, but he's in a similar situation where he's getting chances because of injuries and suspensions to other players. So maybe by this time next year McNair will have grabbed his chances enough to be at the same sort of stage of development

853~~~
Very fortunate to get away with that error. I thought he was poor today.

854~~~
See below

<b>
</b>

855~~~
That one moment in the first half aside, I thought he was decent.

856~~~
Most of you forgot about him letting the ball bounce and allowing Campbell a one v one with DDG? 
Huge error imo and lucky not to be punished. 

BUT with some context, he's 19 being thrown in at the deep end and generally having a higher level of performance than older, what should be more established CB's.

857~~~
Calm and composed on the ball and shadows his man well, another good performance from him.

858~~~
He's consistent, hasn't made a major mistake, and isn't a crock. Because of all that, he's our most reliable CB at the moment.

859~~~
Conveniently leaving out Blind's involvement in that moment eh? It was a misunderstanding between two players. Happens to the best of defenders.

860~~~
Better than Smalling and Evans<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

861~~~
Again, just an incredibly odd way to conduct a debate. Not sure why you feel the need to invent anger on behalf of someone who disagrees with you to help your point.

862~~~
Is he injured or what? My stream died at the end.

863~~~
Lucky charm. We have won all games where he started <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Quality player, can have a great future.

864~~~
I don't need any help with my point. You are wrong.

865~~~
Brings the ball out and isn't fazed. Superb. Some senior players could grow a pair like him.

866~~~
Then why bother to do it?

867~~~
Why let it bother you ?

868~~~
Again, why do you feel the need to invent offence where there is none? I'm asking you a question, filing a case in a small claims court. It's strange behaviour which you seem unable to explain, that's all.

869~~~
I'd love him to just start all our games now, we need consistency and he needs the development and experience. He's a bright talent.

870~~~
I'm not leaving out anyone. I was discussing McNairs mistake. It was Paddy's side, he should've dealt with it. But yeah, it does happen to the best of defenders. I did pay him a compliment aswell, incase you didn't notice.

871~~~
That show lack of mutual understanding between him and Blind, which is understandable given one of them never played CB for us before.

872~~~
I don't even remember telling you that you were angry ? "Calm Down" referred to making 3 posts on the lad in the space of 15 minutes which started by calling his performance "far from impressive" to then claiming he will not be a future United player, to then saying he won't play 100 premier league games. When all evidence thus far (however small the sample size) has pointed to the contrary.

So not only have you been bang wrong about his performances, you've also managed to map out his career all in 15 minutes.

So yeah, calm down.

873~~~
He played well and didn't get injured, so give him a 10 year contract and never drop him again imo.

874~~~
Other decent performance from young lad.

875~~~
A post every 5 minutes just after a game? That's really the explanation you're going to stick with is it?

Ok then. How about you stick to talking about the points and leaving my posting rate to me? Thanks.

876~~~
Made that one mistake in the first half, but other than that he's been very solid in all of his games so far.

877~~~
Take it to PM.

878~~~
Gone one better mate. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

879~~~
Or just not bring it up at all in the first place? I just wanted to talk about McNair's performance. Not sure why saying a player who has made 3 first team appearances for Man Utd and otherwise been average in the reserves won't have much of a future here attracted that kind of comment.

880~~~
Yeah I think people are forgetting he's only 19 and still relatively obscure. A few weeks ago, people were baffled why Tom Thorpe wasn't being selected ahead of him.

881~~~
Liked his movement out of the back four moving into midfield. There was plenty of space for him to run into, wish he had kept going for a few.

882~~~
There's an ignore function. Use it.

883~~~
Calm, composed and hardly makes mistakes. Maybe should have cleared the ball (for the chance that lead to Campbell, miscommunication but that will occur when defences change so often).

Ive been at most ease when hes played CB this season.

Something ive wished Smalling would have done a few times. He does it with ease.

884~~~
Very impressive the way he's slotted into the team without problem whenever he's been called upon. Seems quite a mature and composed player considering his age and lack of experience.

885~~~
Anything about his injury?

886~~~
He's injured?!

887~~~
Agreed. Another year or two of experience and he could be quite a player.

888~~~
Hopefully, although I remember thinking similar about Smalling when we signed him (even though he'd had more experience at this level) and his progress has really stalled. Hopefully the same won't happen with McNair though. LVG trusting him has been one of the things he's really done right this season so far.

889~~~
If his performances last year along side were average then I don't know what a good performance entails.

890~~~
He was pretty good in the West Ham game when we were down to 10 men and had to desperately defend holed up in the box. He was also excellent in the Everton one, keeping Lukaku shackled throughout the match barring one or two instances. Don't agree with you at all here.

891~~~
Another thing to factor in is all how relatively new the position is to him. He started as a midfielder and has gone back over the last 15/16 months. Players who are intelligent enough to do that are invaluable.

892~~~
I am more comfortable when he brings the ball out of the defense than Smalling or Jones. A blunder today that could have been costly. Didn't have much else to do.  

Did he go off injured?

893~~~
Was LVG protecting him from the curse we have on injuries or did the curse get him?

894~~~
Looked like a precaution, As I said before, I reckon it is probably a pre-cursor to getting him to pull out of the friendlies.

895~~~

896~~~
Very pleased by Paddy McNair. Yes, it was only Palace but he doesn't seem the deer in headlights type. He's come in and done his job very well. You can count the mistakes he's made on the fingers of one hand since the West Ham match. Also, he dribbles the ball out of defence calmly and seems to have a clear idea of where he wants to go with it. If he keeps it up McNair could become a fixture. On performances alone I don't see any reason to drop him.

897~~~
You have to look at reserve performances in context. The standard of performance needed to be a successful Premiership defender are those of Evans or to a lesser extent Shawcross, people who genuinely excelled at that level. Even players who did well like James Chester don't break into the Premier League easily. A few tidy, if unspectacular performances don't change this. I'm glad we have someone at the back who isn't making tonnes of mistakes but it shouldn't be ignored that his partner (be it Rojo, Blind or Carrick) have been protecting him a lot and the amount of defending they've had to do in proportion (especially in Rojo's case) doesn't get enough recognition from some.

He's not been awful (decent in fact), he's not made loads of mistakes and clearly has a good head on his shoulders. Thats fine for now, and I'd keep him in the team. But it hasn't suddenly changed the player he is.

898~~~
It doesn't matter if he'll be a PL defender. The fact is you said he has been average in the reserves which is just down right wrong.

899~~~
Would you put 20 pounds on him not making 100 premier league apps?

900~~~
You're free to your opinion on his reserve performances, but if you think he's been playing to the standard that past players who have made an impact in the Premier League then I disagree, it's been nothing more than you'd expect from someone in the Man Utd U21 side for me.

901~~~
I'd put £25 on it, I'm <b><i>that</i></b> confident.

902~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>. 25 pounds on the table for anyone wanting to take this bet. (One might not see it for a few years though.)

903~~~
He'll get more in United shirt.

904~~~
I was pleased with his performance but he did mistake when he let the ball for Blind but maybe the lack of communication and experience caused that as he may heve thought that Blind as a senior player should take it. Itš like when there is some young attacking player and he sees for example rooney during his first match he is probably like Oh my god its rooney he knows best what with the ball Ill pass him and will not do the mistake and he will not shout at me that I didnt pick him instead of having a go myself.. not like Januzaj but he is lacking confidence recently btw. Back to McNair there was another chance when he let bolasie or whoever it wass cross the ball very easily. but apart that he played well and I thought for a moment that he is here for years.. looking forward to seeing from him more. hopefully he will have some steady CB partnership but it won't take long and someone will be injured again or he will be subbed by jones or smalling, more senior players.. Va Gaal cant take risks even he may be a good and better option than to pick some other palyers(Smalling red etc.) he is under pressure. We need to pick points and lot of people would blame him if he "risked" McNair instead of Smalling for example. The same goes with RVP and Wilson..

905~~~
At this rate I'm not confident he can't complete both those bets without contradiction.

906~~~
Holy feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So he didn’t have Lukaku in his pocket the entire game, he didn’t stop a certain goal by producing a game saving header at West Ham? Think you’ve been watching the wrong player.

907~~~
Really really like this guy.
I see not one reason for him to be replaced when the others return from injury. 
Fills me with more confidence than the others.

Just a well rounded centre back.

908~~~
Indeed, that's impressed me the most, still a long way to go though, but so far so good.

909~~~
Really like the cut of this lads jib. Already out performed Evans/Jones/Smalling/Blackett/Rojo for my money this season.

910~~~
That's true and so sad.

911~~~
Lukaku was playing far too deep to affect the game, his positioning was the problem. The header was great but I hadn't said otherwise. I'll end this without a condescending remark.

912~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

913~~~
He seems to be getting better. Though that mis communication was bad from both.

914~~~
Another solid performance besides that slip up. Confident, composed and smart. Long may it continue

915~~~
What? So McNair didn’t play well it was Lukaku that played shit? Gotcha

916~~~
Overly simplistic, intentionally so by the tone of your post. 

Lukaku wasn't the problem against Everton because for some reason (either him or Martinez) he was playing at too deep. Of the threats that almost cost us the 3 points nobody handled it well apart from De Gea. That's why we almost lost.

917~~~
Damn! Celine is feisty!

918~~~
Did De Gea play well or were the shots he saved not good enough?

919~~~
This is rather strange. We've conceded just 3 goals while McNair's on the pitch for a total of 300 minutes. Now, stats like that are certainly a team effort but if he's the terrible player that he's being made out to be, the number would've been certainly much higher because you're only as strong as your weakest link. 

If McNair doesn't play well = He's shite, won't play a lot of game in the league.
If McNair does play well = Well that's because the opposition sucked, he's still shite.

Cut the boy some slack. He had no first team experience prior to this season, wasn't even considered a top prospect by some academy faithful, was thrown in the deep end and has been extremely poised for someone not accustomed to playing at this level. Massive credit to his sense of purpose and resilience if nothing else. Hope he does well going forward.

920~~~
Yep, pretty much everything that he's been asked to do defensively he's seen it off. The miscommunication with Blind is both understandable and and an uncommon error from McNair. If he makes mistakes game after game it would be worrying, but he's not. He's been solid pretty much every time.

921~~~
He better not get dropped if other players get fit. None of the senior players deserve to come in over him.

922~~~
People are being overly critical about the lad, he's only 19 and his debut season was being dropped into an absolute shit storm of a season defensively. Clean sheet and three points is a good performance in my book.

923~~~
Can you actually blame McNair for that mistake though, I haven’t had a chance to look at it again but at the time I thought it was Blinds fault as he let the ball bounce?

924~~~
I think both of them. Someone needs to take charge and it doesnt matter who it is

Blind being asked to play CB and Mcnair playing one of his first professional games, and never having done it together before... Well its expected that they get their wires crossed now and again, isnt it?

925~~~
Indeed, I was expecting more mistakes to be fair, all in all no one can or should complain.

926~~~
Another decent game from him. I hope he can keep this up because he's done very well after being thrown in at the deep end.

927~~~
Apart from his mistake that put Campbell through, he was steady all game. His distribution impresses me a lot. You can tell he used to play as an attacking midfielder.

928~~~
This.

McNair should be rewarded with the manager's confidence.  Of the four "senior" CBs -- Evans, Jones, Smalling and Rojo -- I would go with Rojo as McNair's partner in central defense whenever that becomes a possibility.  Until then, we may have no choice and go with Smalling.

929~~~
Has done well. I remember Desailly making a similar mistake when he joined Chelsea and there are plenty others who judge misjudged the situation. If he's the kind that makes a mistake but doesn't get punished for every mistake he'll make then great! Some players do. He got away with it and he'll learn from it

930~~~
One long ball between the two center backs and we collectively lose our shit. How Campbell managed to screw that up was beyond me, I hope Wilson has better composure than any of the strikers our academy has produced in the past decade.

931~~~
If you have any serious discussion points about the quality of De Gea's goalkeeping bring them up in that thread. If you're making a ridiculous misrepresentative because you lack the motivation or ability to make a reasonable point, then don't.

932~~~
Another promising display. Deserves his spot in the side.

933~~~
Sign him up!

934~~~
Thought he played well yesterday. Fairly solid which is more than you can say about the likes of Evans and Smalling.

935~~~
He has done well but I have been most impressed with his composure on the ball and bringing the ball out of defence more than his actual defensive ability. Seems to stand off his man a bit and is not a tackler or winner of aerial battles. He reads the game well and makes interceptions but I would like to see him make it a bit more difficult for opponents strikers. Aware that he is a midfielder converted to centre back so still very impressive.

936~~~
Great news, hopefully he'll stay fit till Arsenal. We need at least one CB fit..

937~~~
Dont worry lads and ladies, there's plenty of time for him to get injured during the international break.

938~~~
That's what I'm fearing. 

Given our luck with injuries it wouldnt surprise me...... <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

939~~~
you know...I really like this lad. That backheaded save v West Ham....

bravery and class.

940~~~
Don't remember that.

Great stuff. 
Really like his performances till now. Just stay fit Paddy. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

943~~~
So impressed with this lad!

Starting to wonder if the likes of Smalling, Evans and Jones have had their chance and failed to live up to their billing? Wouldn't mind seeing McNair start regularly.

944~~~
I'm quickly becoming convinced he's going to make it here. So calm and composed.

945~~~
Didn't have much to do yesterday, but he looks much better than Blackett imo.

946~~~
Good to see some more positive posts today after some frankly baffling negativity yesterday, it almost feels like some are afraid that if he does well we wont invest in defense, personally I don't think he's one of the CB's that should be worrying about his place at the club.

947~~~
The one mistake yesterday with Blind that almost cost us is an example of the missing leadership that we have in the back ATM.  I think one big part of why there's so much confusion in the backline this season is because we don't have a Vidic or Rio as a sort of 'default' man for taking charge of balls in space and challenging attackers.  I'm hoping that McNair shows some leadership ability down the road because I don't see anyone else in the current squad who would be able to do it regularly.  Jones and Smalling are always hurt.  There's Blackett, of course, but he is also unproven.

948~~~
Fantastic player only 19, he got his chance and took it and in a few years time will be a starter!

949~~~
He's got balls. It might've been Palace but not many young defenders would force it from the back like he did yesterday. It may well be the midfielder inside him...but imagine Smalling with that much time on the ball, it would end up in row Z.

950~~~
He's done well, but as some have pointed out he hasn't been really tested defensively. On the few times he has been tested he's looked vulnerable. Wouldn't have him over Smalling when he returns or even Jones when fit as I think they are by far superior defenders and while McNair is probably stronger than them at playing the ball out of defence I don't think that it's not enough to merit a place in the starting eleven once everyone's back, IMO. Once Rojo returns that won't be as big of an issue either as he's more capable of dictating the play from defence. I'd probably even have Carrick at RCB/LCB along with Smalling over McNair, especially in big games. Before the game against Crystal Palace I would've had Blackett over him as the LCB aswell but Van Gaal seems to rate McNair higher. Speaking of Blackett he was just as impressive as McNair's been up until the Leicester game which leads to my point, we weren't able to control Leicester in the second half and that's where Blackett got found out (I'm not in any way writing him off mind you), just like I think McNair might be in similar conditions.

The fact that he's done so well recently most likely comes down to the way we've controlled games, in games where the opponent drives up the tempo is where we'll truly be able to judge how ready he is. But McNair's only 19, he's got his future ahead of him so any criticism I have against him is only for the time being.

951~~~
Or Jones, or even our 'ball-playing Evans'. He's so much more confident, composed, and assured than any of them with the ball at his feet. Some people say it's superfluous to a CB but the modern defender needs it.

952~~~
Other than the more obvious defensive traits, being confident in bringing the ball and starting attacks from the back is massive. It's slept on until you realise no one in the team can do it!

You can't win trophies without confidence from the back. As an example, Terry and Cahill are noticeably good as a pairing because both are generally quite commanding defensively and both help start attacks from the back. Then look at more obvious names like Silva and Ramos who add to their teams attacking prowess because they can get a move going.

We've been edgier and a lot less dangerous since Rio's back went. He was always very good at bringing it out even though his passing wasn't always on point. Even Vidic, particularly in the Ronaldo years, he do his bit too. I cringe when I see Evans throwing his hands out when he shits himself, Smalling shits himself when he knows he has an opportunity to go forward and Jones hasn't really taken the midfield role into defence with him which is very disappointing (in fact when he first arrived he was a lot more ballsy).

I do think McNair will do it less and less over time, but I do hope this sort of thing is part of LVG's fabled philosophy.

953~~~
That's a good (or bad) sign that almost every young CB coming from the academy nowadays are better on the ball than their seniors.Good footballing education does have its effect surely?

954~~~
He's looked better then any of our defenders so far this season tbh.

955~~~
He was supposed to be a midfielder.

956~~~
Played mostly at CB for the past two years.You don't usually have a fixed position at U18s level so it's not really something unusual.Being an ex-midfielder doesn't automatically make you good at bring the ball out of the back though.He looks more confident than Jones who used to play CM at first team level for us and Blackburn.

957~~~
For a player that 'young', I'm mostly impressed about his positioning. It's a trait that supposedly can only gained through experience, but McNair just has it.

958~~~
I know that but the selection is made around 14, he was selected as a midfielder and therefore has a 'midfielder' technique. Young CB in country like France or England are mostly still very average technically.
For Jones he was selected as a CB.

959~~~
His composure at 19 is quite amazing.

960~~~
The thing I like most about him is that he is hardly noticable in the game, if you don't particularly focus on him and the same applies for his opponent. I remember watching the game against Everton when Lukaku had his first shot around 35 or 40 minutes in the game and realised he played against McNair and both of them were hardly mentioned until then. He produced some really good performances against strong teams. They were all very consistent and concentrated. In my eyes he definitely deserves to start against Arsenal, regardless who returns until then.

961~~~
Agree with this, based on this seasons performances he's our best CB and should be starting every game, I've lost all faith in Smalling and Jones, picking those guys time and time again and watching them constantly screw up is insanity.

962~~~
I'll keep saying it... I currently have more faith/belief in him then any of our other centre-backs.

963~~~
Kneejerks, kneejerks everywhere!

964~~~
Might be a bit but I have to say Mcnair hasn't been worse than any of the more established players. If the team is picked on form he deserves to start.

965~~~
Not really, my opinion is based on evidence on the pitch, ever since his debut i've wanted him in the team so hardly a knee jerk reaction.

966~~~
Many people are saying the same thing about Blackett till the match against Leicester. 

Smalling did well against Chelsea and people were saying good things about him. Then he loses his head against Man City and nobody wanted him to pull on the Man Utd shirt again.

Jones was just unfortunate with his injuries. Before Moyes season people were constantly on how he's the next Duncan Edwards. Clearly he's not, but Jones has got a lot more than what's he's showing. And he's still only 22. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm equally impressed by McNair's composure and maturity. However,  he is still relatively inexperienced so it is expected that he will make mistakes.  And he's made mistakes. So far, he hasn't been punished for it yet, but when we do concede a goal from it, I hope that the CAF isn't going to be too harsh on him.

967~~~
Yes i agree with most of what you have said, but on form McNair deserves to be playing that's why he should start, when/if the day comes when he is not playing to the right level he should be dropped but that hasn't happened yet so he should play. The reason i'm so frustrated with Jones and Smalling is because we've had them for so long and they have not stepped up, if they weren't signed by United they would be considered just as run of the mill PL defenders.

968~~~
He's done well to date, and pleased for him. He's got more chance with LVG than anyone, as Dutch coaches know young players make mistakes and if playing them are prepared to support that view to allow them to grow. Whether LVG shows this in the prem, will come and whether fans stick by him after mistakes.

But he's looked great so far, and probably our best CB over the games he's played in comparison.

969~~~
based on this season's performances mcnair deserves a place in the team than smalling or evans.

970~~~
Really? He's been thrown in right at the deep end, alongside a partner that is new to the league and can't speak the language. He's had to see out 1 goal leads against both Everton and West Ham, two powerful teams with powerful centre forwards. He's then had to come on with 30 minutes to go in the City derby, in a team with 10 men, up against the best striker in the Premier League at the moment in Aguero. He's been tested and then some.

971~~~
To be honest Smalling has been our best central defender this season based on performances on the pitch. McNair has been equal to any of the others. 
Personally wish we could get a pairing going as all this chopping & changing isn't helping the team. Van Gaal must be pulling his hair out over our injury record at the back, it's feckin dire.

972~~~
Are you sure about that ? Smalling played 5 games this season and in this 5 games there is two disastrous performances one against Leicester and the other one against Man City.

Rojo has been our best CB, with Mcnair and Jones.

973~~~
So you didn't watch the Leicester game? Or see what he did vs City? I would say McNair has actually performed better than Smalling as well as Rojo and Jones (who was pretty good first few games before injury)

974~~~
If Evans wasnt such a brittle fanny it would benefit us immensely to have a CB pairing that would be playing for both club and country.

975~~~
Well you're just stating facts that don't really relate to the subject of my statement. As I said he and the rest of the defence for that matter have been protected by the fact that we've kept the ball very well and played with a really low in defence. If you look at the compilations from his games against West Ham and Everton, 90% of them consists of him passing the ball sideways in defence. The occasions where he's actually challenged by an opponent are very few and far between. The same goes for the game against City, by the time he came on the pressure on us was off and we were mostly controlling the game and chasing the equaliser. 

As I said though I think that he's done well but to say that he should have a permanent place in the side over Smalling/Evans/Jones is just setting him up to fall. We've already done it with Blackett this season, who did very well up until the Leicester game where he made a few mistakes and just like that he was yesterdays news.

976~~~
Yes I did. I still hold the opinion that he has been our best central defender thus far this season. You don't agree good on ya!

977~~~
Uh hum, he doesn't look out of place at all. And he actually takes the ball out of defence! We have a star in our hands.

978~~~
What you seem to be suggesting is that he hasn't had a great deal of defending to do. While you may be right in saying he hasn't had to throw himself into tackles like we would see from Jones, if I were to play devil's advocate, that could be because his positional play has generally been strong. He's played with his head up and the only time he's really lost his man in our 18 yard box has been against Aguero last week. 

He has a long way to go, and you certainly won't find me saying he should be in the team ahead of our other options, as he hasn't demonstrated nearly as much as these guys have done in the past, but to say that he hasn't been thrown in at the deep end and tested defensively is a little unfair. Sure, he hasn't had to come up against a barnstorming frenzy of attacks by players like Ronaldo and Bale, but nullifying a powerhouse like Lukaku, or defending well against West Ham on your debut is certainly evidence of defending well and being tested in a tough environment. 

What more would you like to see from him, for example? If it's playing under the cosh against the best sides in the league then I think he may well struggle, but that wouldn't surprise me given his inexperience. Most lads would.

979~~~
This kid is very impressive

980~~~
We were under the kosh against Westham and Everton, particularly against Everton he defended well (and to top it dealt with Lukaku very well)

I don't mind him starting games (if he plays next to someone experienced), the think with Blackett is that Rojo and Shaw have been fit mostly since Leicester. Im pretty sure he will get more chances if we have an experienced right sided CB fit and Rojo is out injured.

981~~~
I'd definitely agree with you on the bolded part, he seems like an intelligent player from what he's shown so far. Lukaku is having a poor season by his standards, he's been nullified plenty and against worse defences than ours. I'd say that the game against West Ham was where he was challenged the most but it was only on a few occasions.

The sample we're judging him from is far too small while the team has also been set up to keep the pressure off of our defence which makes it even more difficult to . I'd need to see him performing like he has consistantly over a longer period of time but above that I need to see how he performs when conditions are different. For me he needs to prove that he can maintain the level he's shown in games where the tempo's higher and there's more space for opponents to run at him. I also think he might struggle to handle larger, more physical players when the ball's played into the box as he's obviously not a powerful player.

I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to discredit him, i'm just trying to stay grounded. As a 19 year old CB I wouldn't expect him to be ready but he's showing plenty of talent.

982~~~
Fair post, and I agree with your reasoning in this case. Eventually, when our defensive situation is more clear, I expect he'll head out on loan somewhere to continue his development. That will give us a better indication as to how good he can be. If he excels elsewhere then we've got a player on our hands. Right now, it's actually quite hard to assess any of our defenders when they just need to be able to walk to get a game.

983~~~
The lad has acquitted himself very well so far, even better than some of the established players (who might I add have been playing under the same circumstances)

If we sign a couple of top CBs in Jan then yes he can go out on loan, but if not I would rather he remained here, trained with the first team and got starts ahead of inconsistent but more experienced CBs we have right now, maybe not in the biggest games, but definitely in a home game against Palace or Burnley etc.

All well as experience the team sheet should be selected on form, and this lads form has been very good.

984~~~
I love him but annoying for him is he's at the same club as Evans and Jones and has a manager that will only play a left footer with a right footer. Any left footed centre backs have a much better chance of getting in the team longer term I'd say. Unless we sign Laporte!

I actually love Jones but I very much am impressed by McNair - I also love Tom Thorpe tho!

985~~~
If they are good enough, they are old enough. I am sure LvG rates him highly and will take the best care of Paddy's development. The lad has composure and a proper football brain, and will turn into a first-class CB. He will make mistakes of course,  as he  very is still very young and inexperienced, however, a day will come when we all be proud of having such a fantastic CB in our team, our own academy product.

986~~~
Literally every single young CB can only wish to be at the same club as those two ( toss Smalling in and it's three ) permacrocks.

987~~~
He just needs to make sure he avoids the 'injury disease' at the club and he'll be fine. He's done well for a newly promoted teenager to the first team. Seems to have a good football brain and lots of composure. If he stays fit and takes in everything he'll learn from LVG, then he's got a bright future ahead. Hope he makes it.

988~~~
4 starts. 4 wins. LvGs lucky charm as the commentator called him.

989~~~
Another solid performance. Not perfect, but far wiser than his 19 years.

990~~~
So composed for someone that's so young. Just doesnt seem phased by the occassion and rarely makes a bad decision. Could have easily stuck his leg out on several occassions in the box but really kept his composure and saw out the danger. Much better player than Blackett.

I think if he keeps improving we will likely see him eventually become a regular for the club.

991~~~
He really deserves a lot of credit. Only 4 games into his professional career and he's looked so composed. I get nervous every time Blackett has the ball but this guy is completely different.

992~~~
He was flustered when pressed today though not helped with Smalling and Valencia on either side. Smalling wanted to use him as outlet and then be rushed a more ambitous pass which fecked up and came back on few occasions.


Solid in defence though and was much more switched on constantly than other side. Maybe can improve aerially a bit.

993~~~
Did well later in the game after our defence's very shaky start.

994~~~
Not convinced by him or Blackett tbh. Both look very shaky in possession and both were lucky at times not to give the ball away in key areas.

995~~~
Outstanding today.  The boy has a real chance, although too slow for my liking perhaps.

996~~~
Our lucky charm <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Start him every game!

997~~~
Both thanks to the system IMO. He looked assured enough when playing in a regular back 4

998~~~
Fair comment and I think the whole team looked shaky in the first 40 minutes in that formation. But even when everyone else had settled I saw Blackett get very lucky not to be dispossessed leaving Welbeck with a 1v1 and McNair really lucky not to let Sanchez in doing the same.

999~~~
He's very composed for his age. Held himself wel, very very impressed.

1000~~~
Yet another very good game from him.

1001~~~
Start him every game. He's earned it.

1002~~~
Arsenal were pressing and there was no outlet thanks to the system. Needed sm1 in back 3 to not just pass but drive into midfield which is risky.

Also having Smalling central doesn't help. He passed it sideways to them only and then even Midfielders and fullbacks kept passing it back which meant they had to force the pass under pressure.

Mcnair particularly struggled with this at times and so did Blackett with his dodgy back passes. But when they have time both are decent on the ball better than Smalling certainly.

1003~~~
Looks like a footballer this boy, cool and composed (despite some nervous moments today). Has a big chance to make it.

1004~~~
I really really like him, you can just tell he knows how to defend.

As Rio would say 'He can smell the danger'.

1005~~~
Not sure why he's getting critcism.

I thought Smalling and McNair hardly put a foot wrong. Blackett on the other hand...

1006~~~
I dunno mate. I think we have a habit of getting excited about youth players who are only drafted in as emergencies to cover for injuries. I'm not holding out much hope of McNair consistently appearing in the side. He was superb against West Ham but I think of an incident today like when (can't remember what minute) Valencia fires it at his feet in our half and he miscontrols and Arsenal get a dangerous counter attack on at 1-0. Doesn't inspire confidence.

1007~~~
Very mature for his age. Made a couple of good interceptions, and had the confidence to run with the ball like a proper modern CB.

I want to see him next to Smalling from now on, until we sign better CBs.

1008~~~
I thought he was good.

Only slight criticisms:

- He was a bit flat footed at times and Arsenal looked dangerous in the first half with their through balls in between the CBs to their pacey forwards.
- A few times he pointlessly ventured really far forwards for no particular reason, and pretty much got in the way and on another day we could have been caught out on the counter. Given how shit we were defensively I would have much preferred him to just hold his position.

1009~~~
Yes he did get caught out by welbeck on one occasion. Not really a crime though as welbeck is quicker than most players.

Other than that he is so composed on the ball unlike blackett who seems to panic.

1010~~~
Played well in new system (3 CB) against one of the best teams away. First half wasn't that good. Second half, seems like he's instructed to step up from flat 3 CB if needed to close down opponent; which is the way it should be on 3-man CB (as opposed to 2 CB system, which the CB has to hold the line with his partner).

A bit fault for Giroud's goal, but I put it as lack of experience against top class Striker; who could make a good strike even from that position.

1011~~~
4 starts 4 wins, the boy is a winner!

1012~~~
He's a shiny diamond in a heap of muck as far as our defence goes. Fair play to him, automatically one of our best CB's now.

1013~~~
And Sanchez caused him problems early doors too. I don't know if it was the CBs individually or fault of it was just an organization thing.

Also the Giroud goal too, although I'm not sure if that was Carrick or McNair as I was too busy screaming and swearing.

1014~~~
From where has LVG unearthened this gem!

1015~~~
Fair play to him, he's been very good for us and has really stepped up.

1016~~~
I think it's his natural game to get forward now and again, considering he used to be a midfielder for the youth teams, and generally this should be encouraged in a back 3. Scored a great goal in the last minute to beat Reading and reach the U21 play-offs last season, from a run forward and shot from outside the box. Was a little surprised to see him near their box towards the end of the game today mind, there's a time to just sit and not leave space at the back!

1017~~~
I think it was McNair, he thought Giroud was offside so he kinda treaded off the pace looking at the linesman hoping he's raise his flag. A bit of mental breakdown there but he had a great game nonetheless.

1018~~~
I personally thought it was more an organization/tactical shape thing. It seemed at times we left our back three wide open to be run at by the likes of sanchez and wilshere. Any defender would struggle in that scenario let alone a teenager.

Regardless, he showed a lot of composure and fits in well with our team philosophy of having defenders who are comfortable on the ball.

1019~~~
He's been plunged into some very hostile situations against players like Sanchez and others, and has maintained his cool throughout. Van Gaal obviously saw something in him to leapfrog him over Thorpe. We've won every game he's started, so he should continue .

1020~~~
I thought he was good. He doesn't give me the impression of awesome which the likes of Varane for example gave me when I saw him playing on the first season (and dare I say, our very own Chriss Smalling) but he has been very good on these 4 matches. Has a very good position awareness which in my opinion is the most important thing for a defender. Today he was very good, despite that time when Welbeck beat him with speed.

I think that he shouldn't be considered a backup/cover option. He should challenge our senior defender (if they ever get fit) for a place on the first team. He has been better and more consistent that any of them. Right now, would be unfair if he got benched just because one of Evans/Jones/Rojo get fit. He should keep his place if he continues playing like this.

It's hard to know if a young player will make it here, but Paddy surely has the right tools.

1021~~~
I'm struggling to think of an incident where he's put a foot out of place. That's saying something considering some of the teams he's played.

1022~~~
Him kicking Wilshere out of the match <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1023~~~
He has played against the likes of Aguero, Welbeck, Giroud in tough situations and yet apart from being turned over by Yaya Toure, I can't recall one incident where he has let the team down.

1024~~~
He had a couple of dodgy moments early on as he got used to the 3 man line, but grew into the game and never makes a stupid lunge in a dangerous area.

1025~~~
I'm impressed with him. These matches have been a great experience for him and Blackett. However, I think expectations will rise once injury problems are overcome and players settle to van gaal's system. Blackett might need another year to settle but McNair looks like he could make the rise earlier.

1026~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Even when he does put a foot out of place it's in a good way!

1027~~~
I'm very impressed by this guy, and he rarely makes mistakes. He is calm and assured and he can bring the ball out of defence even though he might lack a bit of pace. I have my doubts over Blackett but McNair is one for the future and he is still only 19 which is very young for a CB.

1028~~~
He looks to have the composure required in a defender,

1029~~~
Another very good performance, I think he will be a top defender for years to come.

1030~~~
I think so too,Mr reliable at the moment.

1031~~~
No bookings either ?

1032~~~
Been impressed by him and it can't be easy playing in a defense thats changing by the game.

1033~~~
I'm a fan.

1034~~~
Don't think he does enough for a 2 man defence to play there regularly but in a 3 man defence you need people who aren't going to drop clangers every 20 minutes so it should suit him.

1035~~~
Nice to see a bit more aggression from him today (excluding the Wilshere challenge). Given that he was an attacking midfielder until about 2 years ago, he's really come on well. Not yet convinced that he's got enough to be a regular starter in the years to come, but he's definitely making a good impression. Good to see the NI connection still bearing fruit.

1036~~~
not sure why anyone would criticse him. He shouldn't be playing in this game, but has to because of the massive injuries. Thought he equipped himself really well considering the massive experience of the opposition. This will do him the world of good.

1037~~~
Probably going to be in the minority here but I don't think his defending is that great but that is mostly down to him being slower and weaker than most strikers. Needs to be a bit stronger but he has done well.

1038~~~
I'd definitely be concerned about his physique because Welbeck found it piss-easy to hold him off any time they matched up against each other and he's not very quick. He's been reasonably solid so far, certainly more so than Blackett and probably Rojo too but I haven't been that impressed by him besides the fact he's very mature for his age.

1039~~~
Despite total lack of experience it's a win situation for him. How on earth he's gonna learn if we won't trust him like today and won't let him gain knowledge and Premier League experience ?

Of course he's gonna make mistakes, that's the part of the process. Stepping up from deep reserves and already taking responsibility as big as De Gea's or Di Maria's is a serious challenge even for elite football talents.

1040~~~
Welbeck had a couple of good moments against him, but thats what you'd expect of a striker Arsenal paid £16 million for against a kid with a couple of first team games under his belt. He will have learned a lot from this game and will be better next time

1041~~~
I think Welbeck had moments against him when he was pulled out wide with Valencia forwards. That would happen less likey so in a 2 man defense though i agree his lack of pace is a drawback but it's less important playing in a 2 than one of the wide CB's in a 3.

1042~~~
I also dont think he has a lack of pace, its just Welbeck is fast and the majority of our CBs are fast for CBs.

Its also a positioning and contact thing. A more experienced McNair will learn A) not to be in the same position where Welbeck skinned him and B) that as soon as someone does that to him, he has to put his hands on the player and try to get alongside him and make a tackle. Make a foul even to stop him getting away. He can't let him accelerate away and get his head up.

You dont have to be as fast as the forward, you just need to learn how to stop him getting to full speed without making an obvious foul

1043~~~
Seems like he gets caught out by pace too frequently. Most people will say "well X is quicker than most players" but it's his positioning or awareness that highlights this error. Welbeck was always going to come inside, McNair should of ran in a straight line and positioned himself to defend instead of being attracted to the ball and trying to match Welbeck for pace. 

His defending in terms of being turned by an attacker is excellent, he stands up well and anticipates the danger. In contrast Blackett is the complete opposite, if someone knocked it 20-30 strides in front and tried to beat him, he would most likely do a good job but in close corners he gets beaten too easily either going to ground or getting done by a drop of the shoulder.

1044~~~
He's only 19 to be fair so I'm sure he'll fill out. Shaw is a bit of an exception in the fact that he's a 19 year old built like a 25 year old.

Considering he doesn't really have the frame of a CB yet, or much experience, he's sure been doing an impressive job. The future looks bright for this lad.

P.s. just noticed these 2 were born in 1995... feck me I feel old.

1045~~~
He's certainly not slow. I don't know where that's coming from

1046~~~
Looks quite the player. Deserves to keep his place on merit. He's only going to get better if he's played every game.

1047~~~
Probably the best out of the three at the back. No worries about the fact we're playing this lad as he's gone about his job without any fuss.

1048~~~
Am I the only one who thought he went to sleep for the Giroud goal? He had plenty time to recover to shield him or block the shot once the ball arrived over his shoulder.

1049~~~
It's hard to tell if he is slow or just because he was up against Welbeck. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt until I watch more of him though. Thought he was decent, very composed for his age though.

1050~~~
I think it was more Carrick's fault for letting him in behind like that. McNair would have had to hurl himself to try and get a block which imo wouldn't be a good move as I don't think most players would have even shot one time like that. He did kind of slow up and look over toward the linesman but I still don't think he could have made it. Its an unbelievable fecking goal from Giroud though. You'd be luck to score that 1 time out of 100.

1051~~~
What?

1052~~~
Lack of pace is a concern. Any centre half who cannot get close to catching Olivier Giroud from a ball over the top will likely not be good enough.

If Smalling was on that side, that goal doesn't get scored.

1053~~~
He wasn't as Smalling was but he's done well when put in for an inexperienced lad. He was at fault for the Giroud goal though. I can forgive him for that though due to his age and naivety.

1054~~~
One arguable mistake from a very promising and inexperienced CB and the tide turns from praise to questioning whether he'll ever be united standard. 

Typical

1055~~~
Rather he made the mistakes now during his learning curve and gaining experience than in 6/7 years time like most CB's still do!

1056~~~
I like him. He looks a lot more natural in what he does compared to Blackett.

1057~~~
I think re the Giroud goal from both and Carrick it was just complacency if anything.


2-0 up in the 5th minute of stoppage time and us looking more likely to score on the counter if anything, i think they switched off slightly and were like let him have a volley from a position where 1 out of 100 would get scored if anything.

1058~~~
I particularly liked how they turned to each other to share a moment before realising Giroud might score

1059~~~
Got exposed quite a bit in the first half .

1060~~~
McNair is looking at the linesman for some bizarre reason.

1061~~~
Thought he was comfortably our best centre back yesterday. Seems to have more potential than say Blackett (who I thought was decent enough too.)

He's probably our most dependable (least likely to make a balls up) centre back we have in general. Amazing he's only started playing this position in the recent year.

1062~~~
Looked nervous but I like him. He will be very good when he matures.

1063~~~
Caught out of position & for pace a few times. Smalling was far better, not sure what game you were watching, better than Blackett, but in no way the best out of the 3 centre backs.

1064~~~
This is the thing. When you get past all the grand pronouncements about his either being disappointing or the next big thing, what becomes apparent is that we have a future prospect to be excited about, which is one of the joys of being a fan.

1065~~~
Yep. Comfortably so.

1066~~~
A bit worried about his pace, but he is only 19 and as a fellow countryman I hope he goes on to great things.

1067~~~
No one seems to ever worry about Hummel's pace why we all so concerned about McNair? Fact players aren't all quick... His only 19 and looks like a player that loves to defend lets just hope he matures. To me he seems like a player with a bright future.

1068~~~
Perhaps because Hummels doesn't play for us, hence people not concerned about his pace every minute. 

Also, getting left in a foot race by Olivier Giroud is pretty unacceptable at this level. He's amongst the slowest centre forwards in the league, and he jogged away from McNair to score.

1069~~~
95th minute, Giroud was fresh, McNair had put in a real shift all game.

1070~~~
4 wins out of 4 when he's played <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

But he cost De Goat the clean sheet on Saturday <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

If he can apply those concentration levels for the full game then he can develop into a very good player, made some excellent blocks and tackles and deserves to keep his place in the team.

1071~~~
There're tons of slow forwards who are nightmares of defenders.That goal is more of a miscommunication between McNair and Carrick + a bit poor positioning + a bit complacency due to the lead + Giroud just came on and was in full energy.

1072~~~
Watch him wilt when he hits 22-24 like all our young center backs.

1073~~~
He shows promise, and looks so calm out there a lot of the time. Though his positioning last night along with our other CB wasn't that great. Though that could be partly down to switching back to three at the back and the overall lack of a leader at the back to give them real structure. I prefer him to Blackett right now, and feel he should keep the spot if neither of our regular CB are fit next week and we go back to two at the back.

1074~~~
To be 19 and playing like 5 games in his Premier League career and showed the kind of promise is really something special.

1075~~~
Against Arsenal, he showed that he's not really used to playing at 3 at the back. His bad positioning indicated his struggle with that role, and he looks more comfortable when we're playing 2 at the back. It was promising to see him play more aggressively as central defenders should in a back 3; it shows that he can adapt his game to different formations. However, his lack of experience did tell against Arsenal with some of his bad positions and the manner that he switched off for Giroud's goal (though it seemed as if he thought Giroud was offside).

He also struggled against Welbeck's pace (understandably so; even top central defenders struggle against Welbeck for that reason). Also, a few times during the second half, he covered the exact same area Smalling was, forcing Valencia to come inside and cover McNair's area.

He may be very promising as a central defender, but he still has quite a bit to learn. However, throwing him in the deep end against Arsenal is a great experience from him, and this should help him really develop as a central defender.

1076~~~
For expensive and/or experienced first teamers like Rojo, Jones and Evans to leak goals against the likes of Leicester and MK Dons, to come in and keep City and Arsenal down to one apiece is very good indeed. Yes i'm bending those stats how i see fit, so what? I like the lad.

1077~~~
I still don't think you can blame him too much for that Giroud goal. Giroud comes across Smalling onto Carrick and Carrick just allows him in past him. Carrick should have done a better job at tracking him and he didn't try very hard to catch back up either. McNair was a few steps ahead, Welbeck was drifting in front so probably being aware of him, and had no chance of catching Giroud once the ball was already over. He slows down slightly and looks over to the linesman which is stupid but he isn't catching Giroud anyway. To top it all off it is an absolutely unbelievable goal, it is crazy to even attempt that shot let alone score it.

1078~~~
Yeah, that's my take as well. Giroud caught Carrick off guard, and he hit an unbelievable shot the second the ball reached him.

1079~~~
Got skinned by Welbeck far too easily that one time and looked nervous at the start, but did well overall.

1080~~~
I'm not really sure what the fuss is about. He's pretty average and he doesn't have the physical gifts that Blackett has. If you could combine the two, that'd be some prospect.

1081~~~
Ooooh you saucy devil. 

(You'll never go back)

1082~~~
Blackett is taller, faster, and stronger, you numpty. It has nothing to do with being black.

Also I don't know much about his penis but hopefully its better endowed than his passing ability.

1083~~~
There seems to be a habit in here for singling out a player to blame when we concede a goal, it happens, teams concede, sometimes it's no ones fault. Even if it is a defenders error that leads to a goal as long as it's not idiotic or a player repeating the same mistake over and over then I don't see it as being a major issue.

1084~~~
Thought he got a bit found out on Saturday. The whole defence were dodgy positionally throughout. But he got caught a few times and looked pretty slow at times. Welbeck ran right round him at one point. Maybe just a slightly poor start and Arsenal bombing on just caught him out a bit. 

One bad game out of 5 or 6 isnt bad at all. And we won, so nothing influential and more experience for him, although his pace is concerning.

1085~~~
Blackett looked like a rabbit infront of headlights on Saturday, he's not composed enough even though he has the physical attributes.

I thought McNair did very well considering his experience, made good tackles and blocks, he's earned a starting place for me imo.

1086~~~
Paddy has the potential, that's obvious but we all know wheter young player make it to the top is down to a lot of things. Anyhow, you can't say he doesn't deserves to play atm

1087~~~
For a young lad who, let's be totally honest here, had no idea that he would be anywhere near the first team this season, when he reported back for training.  He has done remarkably well.  Yes, there have been some very basic errors but overall he has been quite good.  He will have learnt so much and he looks pretty confident and composed out there.  Reading the game at this level and speed takes time and experience, so he has done brilliantly. 
If he carries on like this, there is every chance he will go on to have a great career at United.  Lets just play him at CB, give him game time during the season and watch him grow.
Could save the club 10's of millions on transfers if he carries on progressing in such manor.
Well done Paddy.

1088~~~
Personally I think McNair is a better player than Blackett.

1089~~~
I agree. He should have made his run in a straight line. With the curved run, he had to be a faster player than Welbeck to catch him. 

So in my opinion, McNair has a great chance to become a big thing for us. Its more about experience than anything else for him.

1090~~~
Overall I was impressed on Saturday. Also, he isn't fully grown yet either so I imagine he will physically improve. 

Right now I'd still walk Jones straight back into the side when he's fit.

1091~~~
Yeah me too. I don't think he would or will get many chances when the all defenders are fit but he's done brilliantly. Jones, Smalling, Rojo and Evans are all better defenders but when they're back it might be good for him to go on loan somewhere and grow as a player. His height is a worry for a centre half but Cannavaro was small and done well I suppose.

1092~~~
I haven't even noticed him being particularly short tbh. The worry for me is him not being strong enough yet, and too slow. You would worry that Peter Crouch would run away from him.

1093~~~
Nah, he isn't that slow. Welbeck made him look a bit slow, but then Welbeck makes a lot of people look slow.

1094~~~
Tbh I haven't really noticed his pace until Welbeck went past him like he wasn't there but Welbeck does that to most defenders, it's not being close enough to him in the first place that was his issue. He can build strength though. I doubt he will shoot up in size at this stage.

1095~~~
I was more concerned at how he didn't ever look even close to catching Giroud, who is no faster than Mertersacker himself.

1096~~~
I doubt anyone would disagree at this stage....

1097~~~
Giroud was fresh, but yeah Mcnair is definitely not "quick". He looks on the Vidic side of it. but it should be enough with good positional skills. Lightening pace like Smalling/Varane is pretty rare in top Cb's.

1098~~~
Fabio Cannavaro is 5'9, Paddy is at least 6'0.

1099~~~
McNair is listed as 5'8 , which i find hard to believe. Looks at least 6'0.

1100~~~
He's 6 foot or 6'1 iirc.

1101~~~
Cannavaro was also an incredibly player who won the ballon d'or.

1102~~~
Of course he was bloody brilliant. Comparing his size to McNair is just a bit odd though as he is 3-4 inches shorter.

1103~~~
McNair is taller, I think there is no doubt about that. Anyplace that lists McNair under 6 foot is outdated. My worry is his physicality, not his height. He seems not overly quick and a little weak. Of course, that can be improved to an extent.

1104~~~
McNair has no problems with physicality. He's 19, he'll fill out. The fact he had Lukaku in his pocket for 90mins, the most physical center forward in the league, should debunk any notion that he's 'slow and weak'. Welbeck is very quick, let's be honest. He's had the beating of most defenders for pace for a long time. Nothing to see here.

I thought Paddy played very well on Saturday, especially when put into context. Context is everything, and difficult to achieve from an armchair. It seems the bar for Cafe approval has become a prodigious performance of pant wetting proportions every week. Out paced by one of the quickest players in the league? Slow, weak, physically inept! Misplaces a header? Crap in the air! Man gets in behind? Has no reading of the game! At least he's only 19. By Cafe standards he's still got a high ceiling. God help him if he makes any mistakes at 20 though. Wasted potential, never good enough in the first place, innit?

Off to the Januzaj thread. Probably time to cut our losses now he's failed to live up to the hype.

1105~~~
He's apparently 6'0 according to another site. Sounds more accurate than 5'8.

1106~~~
He's done OK, like Blackett. M Keane and Thorpe seem to be off the radar. Will be surprised if any of them make it at United long term as I suspect that there are better centre back prospects a year or two or three below them in the academy.

1107~~~
Don't see him as a long term starter even when he is at his peak. He is very slow and awkward. At best i see him as 4th or 5th choice when we have everyone fit or bring in better players. He's done OK in a couple of matches, but not sure what the fuss is about.

1108~~~
Gotta love everyone writing off the long term prospects of McNair and Blackett when they've played barely a handful of senior games.
I'm sure all the PLs best defenders were flawless at the same stage.

1109~~~
I'm more comfortable with low expectations of the youngsters then the overhyping that happens too often, overburdening a player too early in their career.

1110~~~
Awkward?Some people have ridiculous standards.

1111~~~
We've won every game he's started

1112~~~
It's a ridiculous understanding of the normal development path for centre backs.

1113~~~
Laughable also considering how inconsistent or at times downright shite Smalling/Jones/Evans have been this season when they've played.

Blackett and McNair have essentially a free pass from me given their age but McNair has impressed me just as much as any of our centre backs.

1114~~~
"badstubered" by van gaal obviously. 

hopefully he'll continue to impress and avoid all of these injury syndromes that badstuber and most of our defenders got.

1115~~~
If you say so.

1116~~~
Only time will tell.

1117~~~
We've won every game he's started.

Keep playing him and we'll win the league...

1118~~~
In terms of defensive contributions (tackles, interceptions, clearances and blocks) McNair is bottom of the pecking order which goes Jones (average 15.1 per game), Rojo (11.9), Smalling (10.5), Evans (8.7), Blackett (8.7) and McNair (8.6). He's also bottom of the 6 in passing accuracy. That's not to say that he hasn't done spectacularly well - he has. But in no way is he the finished article and, when the senior players regain fitness, he's likely to go back to the reserves - he's simply not as good as Jones, Rojo or Smalling (although, at this point, it's pretty close between Evans, Blackett and McNair).

1119~~~
Sure.  But saying they'll never be top grade defenders is as stupid as saying they will be definitely be future world class defenders.

1120~~~
I think he's looked a lot more assured than Blackett and is the 'no-brainer' back-up option if we have to play a kid.

One of the big upsides of our injury plight is seeing these guys get minutes and often flourish,

1121~~~
Maybe they should make all CB's start out as midfielders, would be for the better. Case study: Paddy McNair

1122~~~
I'd say Rio Ferdinand is a better example.

1123~~~
How did he get ahead of Thorpe in the pecking order? Im curious

1124~~~
LVG must really see something in him, because before his debut it was barely plausible that he'd debut before Thorpe. I think it's a good sign, there must be something about him that LVG really rates and wants to work with.

1125~~~
It's not laughable when you've got exactly those players to compare to. Remind yourself at how good Jones and Smalling were at that age. What kind of performance they were capable of, Jones especially. Jones played 28 PL games when he was younger than them. He was frankly better than them. McNair has been good but Jones was better. Injuries have not been kind to him but those two need to make a big progress to get to his standard.

It's not unreasonable to make guess work at this stage. After all, it's only guesswork. If someone would ask me I'd have to guess that neither of them are future starters for Man. United but to be fair, that's a very easy guess to make as the odds are stacked against them. Evans is 26 now and has only been a starter in his United career because of injuries. He's never been first choice. So if they end up being as good as Evans then they'd still only be good enough as backups.

I'm just happy that he's doing well. Maybe he's going to be the kind of a new generation of CB's. Started out as a MC but was moved back. Comfortable on the ball. There aren't many CB's like Vidic or Rio in sight so he might just be this new kind of breed of player.

1126~~~
The thing I like so far, is the fact he never seem's flustered. Jones still has that body language or panic at times, and I have noticed Blackett dithers too long and then ends up getting rushed too. Mcnair though just has that air of calmness which I think is important, especially in a vital role like a CB.

1127~~~
got to agree with you about his calmness. sometimes he does hoof the ball unnecessarily under no pressure but he does look calm most of the time.

1128~~~

1129~~~
Probably due to him being good vs. longer balls and making clearances, while Thorpe is a little bit short. LVG has mentioned lots of times that its difficult to defend against longballs and when we have injuries at the back and need to bring kids in, its only going to get harder. But Paddy has been one of our best at defending against them this season

1130~~~
He's 6'2! His official stats are outdated, they say he's 6'1. McNair's stats say he's 5'8 but he's at least 6'0 now.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.manutd.com/sitecore/shell/~/media/812263A8E04344189C496A62892CE30D.ashx?w=480&amp;h=270&amp;rgn=0,0,1280,720" src="http://www.manutd.com/sitecore/shell/~/media/812263A8E04344189C496A62892CE30D.ashx?w=480&amp;h=270&amp;rgn=0,0,1280,720"/>

1131~~~
Well thats that then. I certainly didnt expect him to be that tall

Still my point is that McNair has been one of our best clearing longer balls. It doesnt really matter if Thorpe is 7'4, if McNair is doing better dealing with them then he's doing better and I guess LVG is in the best place to judge who is doing it better.

1132~~~
That's what's wrong with todays football. His idol is fecking Sergio Ramos, that's just sad.

1133~~~
Ramos is a pretty good defender. I'm sure he wasn't idolizing his red cards.

1134~~~
Alright. McNair just popped out of nowhere for me, never heard of him before he got called up.

1135~~~
He said if he could pick his favourite defenders <i>of all times </i>he would pick Ramos and Rio.
Ramos isn't really good defender, but even if he is, you can surely agree that there were dozens of better ones to pick out even in last ten years.

1136~~~
McNair's history probably doesn't go back more than 4-5 years, during which Ramos has been quite good.

1137~~~
Seriously, don't let the red cards fool you. He's better than you give him credit for.

1138~~~
I've watched him more than enough to say he is average defender who is considered to be good mostly because of his abilities on the ball.

He really wasn't, but OK, we have different opinions on Ramos.

1139~~~
He's not the most likeable guy, but he is a very good defender. I'm sure McNair is more interested in the latter.

1140~~~
If anything, it's rather refreshing his idols are players in a similar-ish mould to him. I'd agree and say I'd prefer a Ramos or Rio over a 18 yard clogger.

1141~~~
Surely he's heard about other greats, like Baresi, Maldini, Nesta?

1142~~~
Dunno why dude's getting so worked up over McNair's opinion TBH. He likes Romos ? Big deal, maybe he intends on mimicking Ramos' effortless ability in possession, which is extremely good for a defensive player, or his extroverted passion for the game.

As an example Lionel Messi idolized Aimar, hardly the greatest player in the world, was considered a letdown in Valencia and is currently playing in the Malaysian League.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/aimar-messi-s-childhood-idol" target="_blank">http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/aimar-messi-s-childhood-idol</a>

That's what's wrong with footballers of the mid 2000s ?

Maybe he wants to formulate his own opinion, based around players he's observed, than rely on hearsay in a display of name-dropping. Or maybe he's a hipster, and doesn't subscribe to conformity wrt the established order.

1143~~~
I wouldn't say Ramos and Rio are very alike myself.

1144~~~
I'm sure he just likes Ramos' goalscoring ability and some of the things he's done on the ball, something that McNair as a former attacking player can model his own game on

1145~~~
I like your second theory better. Anywho, he could model himself as Robert Huth for all I care, as long as he comes good.

1146~~~
He hasn't even played at CB for that long so probably wasnt modelling his game on defenders at all tbh growing up. Not sure why people are getting worked up.

1147~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yep, that's exactly what's wrong with football,,,

1148~~~
wow he never watched jaap stam play..

1149~~~
He is 19, he would of been like 6 when he left. I only just saw/remember Stam playing and im a couple of years older

1150~~~
I didn't say "Kill him because he likes Ramos!", ffs, it's just stupid that someone has Ramos as his favourite defender of all times.

You don't think it's sad that Ramos is considered as one of the best defenders in the world year by year?

1151~~~
Jaysus, this page. How is liking any player sad? Not everyone's favourite players are Ronaldo and Messi, they can like whoever the feck they want.

1152~~~
Ramos is a very 'modern' defender. Personally I don't think there's a single centre back currently playing at the top level that gets anywhere near the legends of the 90's and 00's (the latter for me ending with the decline of Rio + Vidic). Defensively speaking of course. Centre backs at the top level are geared more to being surrogate CM's these days, in my opinion of course. Granted you'll have a few that play with a more classic style but ball playing seems to be an important attribute now rather than halfway down the checklist.

1153~~~
If he had said David May was his favourite, would that be more or less acceptable?

1154~~~
If he'd said that he'd certainly need therapy,  two spoonfuls of Cod-liver oil everyday and leeches applied to his genitals for an hour each morning..! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1156~~~
Right decision to take him off. Hope it doesn't affect his confidence

1157~~~
That average rating will take a hell of a beating after the game.

1158~~~
Our Centre backs are a mess.

1159~~~
Tough decision, but the right thing to do. Seemed completely unconcentrated.

1160~~~
He was a liability. Had to be done. He's got good potential, hopefully he'll look at it as a learning experience.

1161~~~
Felt for the lad, but our defenders didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing.

1162~~~
His first bad game. Ouch!

1163~~~
Feel for him, but it had to be done.

1164~~~
Noted that he gave the ball away too often in his early performances, today he did it 2 or 3 times before being taken off. A lack of composure. Having said that I dont think he was much more guilty of it than Rojo who was lucky it wasnt him getting taken off for the same reason.

1165~~~
That was the performance a lot of us were cautious of when loads of people were constantly calling for him to start and asking why Smalling and Evans should get the call ahead of him.

1166~~~
Poor but tactics more or less forced him to be poor, should just hoof the ball rather than try to play out, only got caught out because he wants to play football but we don't have enough in midfield to do that

1167~~~
He's made mistakes before, this is the first match that it's been costly.
Those who said there's clear light and day between him and Blackett hopefully will see that they are very similarly matched.
McNair's composure gives him the edge over Blackett for me but neither are ready for the first team.

He'll be fine.

1168~~~
His passing was really bad today. Feel for him, he's young and hope he doesn't let it affect him.

1169~~~
He was poor but he wasn't the problem either. 

Don't think he is suited to a back 3.

1170~~~
Nightmare performance. Gave away the ball and was caught on the ball too many times. Didn't help that Evans came on next to him. Smalling made a huge difference.

1171~~~
He has been punished by LVG

1172~~~
LvG being very honest here. Says Paddy had 'no confidence' after gifting Southampton three chances. Had no choice but to take him off.

1173~~~
and to be honest with you i agree with LVG. The boy looked devoid of confidence. Taking him off was the best for him.

1174~~~
Still better than Evans.

1175~~~
no he wasnt mate.

Seriously, he lacked confidence. at his age it was the best way to deal with the situation.

1176~~~
yep....Evans at his sparking best tonight. 


PS. My cardiologists say i will be all right.

1177~~~
yeah, he was bad today. Young players have those games.

1178~~~
Glad LvG took him off, lost all his composure and cool after being forced into mistake after mistake by Soton's pushing.. We need 2 DM's, not one.. Defenders didn't have an outlet as Soton just man marked any player that the defense could have passed to, mainly Carrick. And looks like LvG has said keep long balls to a minimum, and all the defenders just kept dwelling on the ball for far too long

1179~~~
He was bound to have a poor performance. It happens, especially for a 19 year old kid who wasn't even our top youth defender coming into the year.

1180~~~
He was very poor but not surprising he is nowhere near ready for the first team, luckily he hasn't coat us any points but it's clear he isn't the answer to our CB problems for at least a couple of years.

1181~~~
Feel sorry for the lad, but can't say our other defenders look any better. We look all over the place with three at the back. Surely Van Gaal can see that.

1182~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He actually is!

1183~~~
He's done pretty well in all the other games he's played so the first part is wrong. You expect inconsistency in youngsters, it's all part of the learning process. We'll find out far more about his character in how he reacts when next selected.

1184~~~
What comes after "no confidence" ? As that'll be what Rojo has, giving away more than 3 chances

1185~~~
Him and Blackett are only playing because of injuries, ideally they won't play much for rest of the season because neither is good enough at the moment, inconsistent performances Re to be expected but there is also a big difference between doing a good job for a few games and being good enough to play regularly. at this time he is nowhere near easy to play regularly to the level required.

1186~~~
If you'd clarified that you meant that he's not ready to regularly I would have agreed with you. He's relatively inexperienced as a CB as was an attacking midfielder until he suddenly had a growth spurt and filled in at the back for the Academy when they had an injury crisis.

1187~~~
He wasn't injured?

1188~~~
Was disappointing but he's just a 19 year old playing in an unfamiliar set-up being part of a leaky defense and shielded by a midfield which was all over the place. Hardly an environment for a developing teenager to excel in, esp in a high pressure match against a good team away.

Really should have done better with his passing though and he was deservedly taken off with the right side of defense being a liability in the early exchanges of the match. Will be a good lesson for him mentally I hope.

1189~~~
I didn't think he was that bad. One glaring mistake to play in Long. Other than that it was like the Arsenal first half where he started shaky. And that's to be expected from a young player fresh in first team action, away to a talented side and in silly set up.

In a normal back 4 he's shown he's astute enough to play smartly at the back and let his decision making balance out a lack of pace. In a 3 it's ability to make swift turns which is causing everyone problems IMO.

1190~~~
I liked LvG's post match interview. Very honest but also the bit about it being "just one match, just one moment in a lifetime". He will know what to do with Paddy going forward, he's seen it all before with these promising but raw youngsters.

1191~~~
Any link to his interview?

1192~~~
He made several bad choices. To be fair to him, both Evans and Rojo made the same mistakes several times in the same position. Risky passes, caught on the ball, leaving space to run in. This points toward them being casualties of van gaal's game plan and the lack of options from midfield. Young did better than valencia, and carrick better than fellaini and herrera, but all struggled, so I'd put most of the burden on van gaal's shoulders. But he has to make the decisions, and he did, and it looked scrappy, and it collected a win away against a better placed team. So in the end i guess we should laud all and scrape all more equally.

1193~~~
Sorry mate I just saw it on the stream after the game. I'm sure one will pop up soon.

1194~~~
Felt a bit sorry for him really. He was having a shocker but he is young and will learn from this experience hopefully.

1195~~~
Let's see if he can bounce back from this... my guess is yes. A setback is the perfect step for a comeback as they say

1196~~~
Still we have won every game he's started! 

Felt for the lad but it had to happen. I thought he was going to wait till half time though. Had a bit of a mare. He's what, 19 though he'll learn from it. I doubt before the season started he was even expecting to play for the first team this season.

1197~~~
Felt a bit sorry for him. Think it's time he goes back to the U/21s to get some confidence up. That is two poor games in a row. He is young though, with much time to improve. He has filled in admirably when we needed him too.

1198~~~
Difficult one for him tonight but all part of the learning curve.

1199~~~
Thought he was okay until Smalling went off. The he sort of fell to pieces and the tactical change was needed. However while Paddy was poor, Rojo for me horrific.

1200~~~
He'll be fine long term, but the sub had to be done. He's done very well so far on the whole but was a bit lost out there today, got taken off before he potentially costed the team which would have been even worse for his confidence.

1201~~~
As some have said Rojo was just as bad if not worse in his lack of composure and relinquishing of possession.

1202~~~

If you haven't found it yet <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1203~~~
Absolutely ruthless from Van Gaal but he did what was needed. As Gary mentioned some managers would've waited till half time but these are the kind of decisions VG gets paid for.

Also as VG said, its only one game and McNair will hopefully be better for the experience.

1204~~~
I thought LvG was great in the press conference, was fair in his assessment and said it's not going to happen for a long time (once in a lifetime moment). Hopefully this will not dent the lad's confidence.

1205~~~
ruthless it may seems to be but that's life and that's why Louis Van Gaal is a world class manager.

tough on a young lad like paddy for sure but the team is more important and he was a complete liability last night. he has done nothing wrong before this, hope he bounce back stronger.

1206~~~
Early hook was totally justified.  Was giving the ball away. I get the feeling LVG has finished giving people the benefit of the doubt. He's calling people out and demanding quality performances.

1207~~~
He had some individual errors, but the defense as a whole was always verging on calamity. Many players in front of him gave the ball away carelessly as well, putting him under pressure. The team/system/philosophy deficiencies certainly didn't help his performance. Tough spot for a young player to be singled out as the problem.

1208~~~
I felt for him. Tough game but IMO he shouldn't have started because we should've played a flat four to begin with. Im also pleased about the reactions in here, no harsh or unwarranted criticism. How come Blackett doesn't get the same treatment?

1209~~~
Very impressed by LVG taking McNair off - leaving him on would just have been what Moyes would do, in other words, setting up your players to fail rather than to succeed. I'm a huge fan of McNair, and I'm sure he himself was glad to be taken off before costing the team. The lad just keeps his head down and gives it his all with no fuss or nonsense.

1210~~~
Feel bad for the boy, but something had to change and it was the right decision.

I'm glad this thread isn't filled with people screaming for his head. Paddy has been a pleasant surprise for us this season. He had a bad day today as did Rojo and Evans, but I put a lot of our shocking defensive displays down to that godforsaken 352. For some reason this formation brings out the inner Prunier in all our defenders. For the last few weeks Smalling looked so assured on the ball and even he looked shaky on the ball today. This has happened every time we've gone 352 that it can't be a coincidence.

1211~~~
Good on LvG to make the call that early.

1212~~~
I doubt that. I think he would have been disappointed/embarrassed to be taken off and annoyed at how he performed.

1213~~~
Great question.

1214~~~
McNair has looked a bit more stable and reassured than Blackett has, even though the latter looked good during the pre-season tour. I think LvG has finally realized he can't get much more out of the inexperienced youngsters than he has this year, and attempting to force the issue will result in our conceding more goals and damaging their confidence. Evans and Rojo couldn't have returned any sooner, and getting Jones back will be another boost.

1215~~~
To be fair, he alluded to this during our pre season tour. He said that both Blackett and Mcnair are great on their day, but consistent performances from them would not be possible.

1216~~~
Blackett is unfairly criticised when he makes the slightest of mistakes. McNair has a bad game and its because he's young and inexperienced. It should be the same both ways. Just saying.

1217~~~
I don't think it's merely a bad day in the office tbh.Can't be so coincident that the trio Rojo,Evans and McNair all performed badly and gave too many balls away.Something is really wrong with that system.

1218~~~
I agree with this.

1219~~~
bingo.

1220~~~
McNair hadn't put a foot wrong before this match whereas Blackett has made me nervous every match he plays.

Blackett was directly responsible for a number of goals being conceded early in the season. McNair wasn't at fault for the goal in this one.

I agree that Blackett has shown promise should he continue to improve. I'll be hoping for him to succeed. But turning him into some sort of martyr in this thread is nonsense in my opinion. 

Perhaps Blackett would have been pulled off before halftime earlier this season if we had been able to. Perhaps he'd have received less criticism then. But the fact is he played, made errors, looked fragile and/or limited and justly received some stick as a result.

1221~~~
McNair and Blackett deserve to cop the same amount I think. McNair has probably performed better than Blackett in some matches but they have both looked poor. Sure you could say McNair hasn't directly cost us a goal from a mistake like Blackett but that is more down to luck/poor finishing.

1222~~~
Had a poor game yesterday, it happens. The kid is 19 after all. He'll learn from it and bounce back. Taking him off was the right move imo.

1223~~~
Not great when you are having a shocker plus playing in a defensive unit where no one is sure of what they are doing.

1224~~~
Won't have been good for his confidence to be subbed before half time but he really was completely out of his depth yesterday. I didn't expect LVG to be that ruthless but it needed to be done. Obligatory comparison to Moyes who would have done nothing until the 70th minute.

1225~~~
Ok to take him off, but the injury to Smalling didn't help him and the rest of the defence. At to be fair, Evans was not good when he came on, and Rojo had a terrible game aswell. Hopefully McNair will learn from the game and his mistakes, and keep working and developing. It's natural for players to have bad matches now and then, specially young players. He will be class in a couple of years time..

1226~~~
LvG knows how to handle youngsters, so I'm not worried about him. He'll definitely learn from this.

1227~~~
I hope he is made stronger than to sulk after being hauled off in what was a terrible performance. 

Needs to work harder and be more assertive. He would be fine in the long run, I feel.

1228~~~
I was going to come in and make the point about Blackett being criticised but good to see it has been mentioned a few times above.

1229~~~
It must have been a blow to his confidence and he must have been embarrassed by the early substitution. However, I think being taken off early would have been better for him than him staying on and making further mistakes which possibly could have led to goals, making him a scapegoat of sorts. 

On the flipside he could have gotten better as the match progressed on but it looked uunlikely, as the whole team was playing like shite and the defense on the whole was shaky. It was not the right atmosphere for a teenager to be playing in. High pressure match against a good team away, with his team not playing well and he himself being off colour. 

Damage limitation and an astute call by LVG if you ask me. I'd prefer to regard it as him protecting McNair rather than him punishing McNair. Bit of both tbf but veering towards the former imo.

1230~~~
LVG was spot on to take him off, he had to be cruel to be kind.

1231~~~
I actually think Mcnair, except yesterday has been solid if not spectacular, and i don't know if anybody has noticed it, with Blackett it seems like the jump from reserves to first team is far too big for him, he takes far too long on the ball before deciding what to do with it and gets robbed, and constantly hoofs it forward to nobody, it actually pisses me off to see him being that much casual, while Mcnair looks focused and solid, although both are in-experienced, i actually think Mcnair can make it here, hence he wouldn't get as much criticism from me or other people, while for Blackett, i feel he will never make it here and he doesn't have the potential and ability as a player to succeed here.

1232~~~
I think the Leicester game has really knocked Blackett's confidence. He looked very assured before that game but not so much since.

Taking McNair off before an error proved costly was absolutely the right call and better for him in the long run. He's been good in his brief United career so far. Hopefully that continues and this gives a bit of perspective to those who would have him as a first choice starter.

1233~~~
I have said a couple of times that I hadn't actually been impressed with his defending apart from against West Ham. He seems to stand off markers and let them run at him. Which would be fine if he was strong/quick but tbh most of the time he looks like a boy against men. Those saying he is better than Evans need have a word with themselves and rewatch last night's game. I see more potential in Blackett, but that is probably because he is more developed physically.

1234~~~
I guess that's because people expected far less from McNair. To be honest at the beginning of the season many fans barely knew of him while Blackett was already highly rated and expected to make a few appearances (though surely no one expected we'd rely on either of them to this extent), McNair looked like a player who might never play in Premier League for United let alone start games consistently. He's been very good so far, yesterday was basically his first bad performance.

1235~~~
He is a boy against men, he will mature and grow out of it. He's 19 and probably didn't expect to make his PL debut this season at all.

1236~~~
I think they showed Van Gaal high fiving him when he walked past after being subbed so I think it was handled well, Van Gaal will make sure it doesn't affect him. The good thing about Van Gaal is he won't be afraid to start McNair again in the future if he has to, it's not like he'll be frozen out.

1237~~~
Absolutely awful display from him. Quite unbelievable just how bad he looked. Very young though.

1238~~~
What goals? His only bad performance was against Leciester. He played 90 minutes in 2 games where we got clean sheets. We've only had four clean sheets all season.

1239~~~
Blackett wasn't highly rated by anyone. You're overstating things. If anything most people were surprised he made the jump because Michael Keane and Tom Thorpe are rated more highly.

1240~~~
Moyes out!

1241~~~
McNair was very good in the Everton match too. Dealt with Lukaku well all game and made a great block just before De Gea's brilliant save from Oveido.

1242~~~
I'd be surprised if either Blackett/McNair make it at this club.

1243~~~
So he had one bad 30 mins, lets not even talk about Evans this season. McNair has clearly been the better of the two, doesn't mean he is better. However how comes he puts in 1 bad performance and all of a sudden the knifes are out.

He played very well vs Everton and also did well vs City too, he is young and so poor performances are going to come its only natural, you just have to look at Januzaj (who has a few poor performances in his wonder season last year)

1244~~~
I don't think that he has been subbed because of his mistakes per se, i think that it was a matter of lost of confidence and the fact that our midfield was drowning.

1245~~~
Not at all, if you go back through my posts throughout this thread I have said a number of times that I have been more impressed with his ball playing ability rather than his defending (though that has even deserted him in the games against Arsenal and Southampton, again the system we played in both games is a huge cause of this). He stands off attackers and isnt quick or strong enough (yet). I am aware I am being harsh as he's only a kid but I just think you can tell he is a midfielder converted into a defender.

I have said in the Evans thread that I think I may be blinkered when it comes to him as I don't think he has been as bad as most seem to (apart from that MK Dons game which is the worst I have seen him play since West Ham in the Carling Cup. Out of all our defenders he has proven himself the most and injuries have held him back massively.

1246~~~
I remember Lukaku getting in behind from a couple of route 1 passes but you are correct, he handled him well - we can't forget that our goalkeeper saved us that day, we didn't defend that well. Though we are talking about an out of sorts Lukaku this season, still looks drained from the World Cup if you ask me.

1247~~~
I think the wide 2 of our CB's in a back 3 they way we are playing it are looking poor in possession when pressed simply because their is a lack of options for them in front to pass too.

They have to either hoof it somewhere or just try and carry it forward in which case they risk losing it. 


That's why i think some of the reactions are over the top. And it happens each game with almost all our CB's except the central one if he is a good athelete to cover on both sides whenever we play a back 3.

1248~~~
You are spot on. Blackett and McNair both had this problem at the Emirates and then last night McNair, Evans and Rojo all had similar problems. I can only see that system working with players who show for the ball in midfield, maybe a trio of Herrera, Carrick and Blind. It will never, ever work with Fellaini in it

1249~~~
LVG just probably wanted Fellaini deeper with Herrera providing more dynamism as he was struggling more ahead and dropped Carrick central to distribute from the back. It didn't work much either really but think that was the thought.

Don't think Mcnair was substituted because he was the only One causing us problems. But their were more structural issues.

1250~~~
Yeah, i think the same. 
But someone talked about Mcnair confidence apparently Van gaal talked about it.

1251~~~
I don't feel sorry at all for McNair......he plays for Manchester United and not Hull City!!!!
He was terrible and it was the right decision
McNair will get another chance no doubt. He must just learn from that.

1252~~~
LVG sure doesn't like to protect or put too much praise on individual players like SAF.

He blatantly lays the smackdown everytime whoever be the player. Sometimes even over the top(not in this case).

SAF would have just protected him, covering up of some sort even if had to take him off most likely.

1253~~~
He's a kid who being asked to play a role he's probably never played before in his young life. A CB in a back 3 is very different from one in a back 2. I don't personally think he'll be good enough long term, but I'm not gonna make any final judgements based on outings in a 3-5-2.

He was terrible, though.

1254~~~
He was out of his depth, which was bound to happen sooner or later given his lack of experience. Still, when you look at his cumulative performances, he's been quite good for a player of his age who just a few months ago wasn't even our top youth CB.

1255~~~
I actually think he protects them well, particularly in the media. He is constantly defending his players. Perhaps McNair was an exception though.

1256~~~
McNair has heard surely some nice words by Van Gaal and the coaching staff in the last weeks

We don't know what Van Gaal has said to him in the dressing room and Van Gaal was just honest about McNair's performance

Like said McNair must just learn from that match

1257~~~
Hmm.. who has he defended out of turn or covered up for ? Or even over the top praised ?  He even started criticizing Rafael vs Leicester when asked about the referee's decision. Last week said De Gea was just doing his job and Wilson should have scored as he does in training. Also, been blunt about Falcao and RVP recently. Before that publicly said Mata didn't give enough as a #10 and Rooney as striker. Also herrera vs WBA, Shaw and the whole being unfit and extra training thing etc.. amongst others. Even Anderson got his fitness revealed publicly. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

I find him pretty blunt in terms of saying what he feels. Doesn't do much mind games, Bullshitting or even protective man management in the media. Even with the young players so far.

Definitely has very less filter in terms of what he feels and what he says publicly. Sometimes can be overly harsh too. Different style of personalities and management, i guess and the squad will get used to it though different personalities will take it differently.

1258~~~
I guess I mean the stories about the budget we'll have in January and stuff. He said it was "disrespectful" to the players he has at the moment. He said Anderson trained at a high level though too, not just criticising his fitness. He praised De Gea after the Everton game. Even in his comments last time they weren't negative. He praised him but said he can still improve.

1259~~~
You can bet that Ferguson would have absolutely torn into McNair in private. van Gaal favours a different approach, there's no questioning either of the two managers approach in bringing through young players.

1260~~~
Mcnair has been fantastic for us this year, and if a 19 year old centreback has a bad game, i hope he puts it behind him quickly and moves on.

It is positively ludicrous for anyone to say he won't make it here. He might not, true, but he's a kid in every sense of the meaning. He has shown tremendous composure for us in previous matches and I would love it if he turned into a regular player for us.

1261~~~
He is extremely honest. He was poor and despite his age, he gets told exactly that. Doesnt harm imo since all our players know that LVG will look after them and work with them. If Paddy has the right attitude, he will learn how to deal with it and become stronger and better

1262~~~
pleasantly?

With Rio & Vida (and Evra) departing, and with several seasons already behind them I really hoped Jones, Evans and Smalling would step up and take over the mantle. With them struggling Blackett and McNair have also been gifted a tremendous opportunity. Sadly they all seem to be falling over themselves NOT to succeed. Any combination of the above could still make it. Injuries, tinkering with formations, changes to training, and LVG "philosophy" confusing the life out of everyone, havent made it easy, I get that, but still.... you're handed the keys to the kingdom and you fumble about

I'm a striker, so defending will always be a mystery to me. I understand that its about forming partnerships and trust, and that it takes time, but still.... I expected more from the new brood.

1263~~~
In all honesty as bad as he was I think Rojo was just as bad, if LVG had decided to take him off instead of McNair I don't think the reaction on his thread would have been any different.
McNair needs a few weeks/months out of the spotlight.

1264~~~
Two middle of the road CBs who play regularly together are better for the team than two very good CBs who don't.
That's what's so frustrating about our CBs, they are all clearly talented but they can't stay injury free to form a partnership.

1265~~~
Miss Fergies praise, Jones the new Duncan Edwards <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1266~~~
I agree with everything you have said. They have been given a great opportunity that not many youngsters get at their age at one of the biggest clubs in the world to try and showcase their abilities but i think it is a mix of mis-management and inexperience with these defenders - they do not seem anywhere close to being ready as of yet.

Once we get Jones/Smalling back, they should be moved back to the reserves or it could halt their progress and dent their confidence in the long term.

1267~~~
McNair had 6 defensive interventions (tackles, interceptions, clearances, blocked shots, aerials won) and 72% passing; Rojo had 27 interventions and 77.8% passing. McNair has a long way to go before he's even close to Rojo.

1268~~~
I actually expected him to have a poor game. Afew his past game against Arsenal a lot has been made in the media of his tackle on Wilshire, many people including Wilshire have called it 'terrible' or worse. Many Arsenal fans have called for retroactive punishment, etc. All this got to take a toll on his confidence and I'm not surprised that LVG commented about his confidence after the match.

1269~~~
McNair did look quite unsettled throughout the match. Southampton's high pressure combined with our disjointed, almost-nonexistent build-up made it difficult for McNair, and he showed his struggles with him being unsettled on the ball and not taking good positions to receive the ball. Defensively, he was average, with him being unsure about when to push out to the right channel and when to go into the middle. He also struggled to deal with Pelle's strength.

All in all, he was lacking confidence and looked nervous throughout the match. He still wasn't that leaky, defensively, but he was lacking composure on the ball, which caused us several issues in the first half. Once Evans moved to the right, we slowly became more solid, and Evans showed more composure on the ball than McNair did on the right. This will definitely be a good learning experience for him, and I hope that he uses this match to improve his game.

1270~~~
He defended Shaw after Hodgson went to the media and said he agreed with him about Shaw's fitness.

1271~~~
I dont think Van Gaal was criticizing him to be fair.. He just said what we all knew was the reason he was taken off. His only other option was to lie and say McNair had a knock and that's why he was taken off. Which still wouldn't help mask what was an error ridden performance till then. I think its a smart move by LvG to be upfront and honest about what he thought of Paddy's performance.

1272~~~
Rojo played the whole game while McNair got taken off in the first half, so comparing their interceptions is hardly fair. Do you know how many Rojo had when McNair was replaced?

1273~~~
Nice touch by LvG to bring him on for the last 5 minutes.

1274~~~
Thought so too. Nice example of good man management.

1275~~~
Ye this.

1276~~~
Nice touch by him but I don't see how it was a big deal to take him off against Southampton. If he's mentally strong he'll take it no problem and learn from it, it was a great decision to take him off.

1277~~~
Nice to see him get a few minutes after what happened on Monday.

1278~~~
Glad he got some mins. Will give him confidence. Seems a really shy kid, probably a bit star struck, needs to take some lessons from Wilson <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1279~~~
Two good interceptions in those 5 minutes. Or it was one interception and one clever backpass?

1280~~~
Nice to see that from LVG, making sure being hauled off at half time isn't the last thing the kid remembers when he next starts a game for us.

1281~~~
Indeed, will do him the World of good.

1282~~~
Agreed with those who thought it was a nice touch by LVG to bring him on.

A bit of a slap in the face for those who claimed that LVG's comments post match against Southampton was terrible management.

1283~~~
Definitely. Thought it was lovely to see. He's been excellent with the youngsters so far.

1284~~~
Agree with everyone, thought it was very smart by van Gaal.

1285~~~
yup. nice from van gaal. good management here.

1286~~~
McNair must be thanking his lucky star to have LvG as his manager. I'm glad to see LvG is continuing United tradition of giving youth chances, albeit it could back-fire him if it's not working. Hopefully McNair learns fast enough so we don't have to buy those 'already-made' CB in the future.

1287~~~
He obviously sees McNair as a future piece in his system. Good management to make him a part of the victory as that probably made McNair think of other things than the early sub when he went to bed.

1288~~~
Been quite impressed with him today, the lad really got potential.

1289~~~
McNair has played 7 game for United (8 including today) with 21 points from a maximum of 21 (24 including today). #luckycharm. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1290~~~
Really composed today considering he is playing in the centre of that three man defense.

1291~~~
Had a great game in the middle of the defence. Really happy about this lad progressing through the ranks <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1292~~~
That should be 'started'. He came on as a sub against City away.

1293~~~
Props to Van Gaal for bringing him back in so soon after his horror show and early substitution. 

He knows how to develop juice, that's for sure.

1294~~~
Meh. Some strange comments. Looked very nervous again. Good prospect he is but he still makes me bite my nails everytime he has the ball.

1295~~~
Ah heck that distorts the whole stat.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Correction : 21 from 21 including today. (Sub vs Liverpool too..)

1296~~~
Better than his two senior partners. Kudos to Van Gaal for giving him a match so shortly after his bad performance, and kudos to McNair for playing this well.

1297~~~
I'm going to go against the grain and say I think he got beaten easily a couple too many times today.

1298~~~
What?I feel confident every time the lad had the ball.He definitely had composure on the ball for his age.Need to improve his defending but that will come.

1299~~~
Good run out for him today after his first hiccup a few weeks ago, showed good character.

1300~~~
Really? Well a matter of opinion I guess. I don't think he is all that composed. Still very young so I'm not complaining at all.

1301~~~
You have to remember he's a midfielder who converted to centre half not so long ago. I thought he did ok today. Well done paddy

1302~~~
He did well enough, considering his age and inexperience he is never going to be bombing forward a-la Jones etc, ultimately he (and the team) were heading towards a good clean sheet until Jones gave away the penalty.

1303~~~
I'd agree. Weakest of the 3 centrehalfs today. Still did ok.

1304~~~
Can get dragged out of position too easily at times but it may be due to the formation we play. Jones was obviously right of the three but sometimes both of them would come over to challenge Gouffran leaving the centre exposed. It's things he will pick up with experience, still don't feel confident with him in 1v1 situations but he didn't do much wrong today, a decent performance.

1305~~~
I thought he played well (as the whole defence did). Good to see that van Gaal is still putting his confidence in him despite a few bad games earlier on.

1306~~~
I'm very impressed with this kid, who's only 19 and just played in maybe his 7th or 8th match for the first team.  We can dissect minute flaws in his game today all we want but Paddy is well on track as one for the future, which may be very soon.

1307~~~
Fair play to him, another solid, assured performance. Can't as for anything more from him.

1308~~~
NI has a decent defence...as does England <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1309~~~
Played well against Newcastle. Not sure Kane is a great matchup for him, though. Would prefer Smalling against Spurs.

When you consider that this kid is 19 and was a CM until at least 16, he's a really interesting long-term prospect.

1310~~~
It's becoming a little like when people used to mention either Rafael or Fabio, people couldn't complete a sentence without saying Fabio was the player who was thought to be the better player in his early days.

Now with McNair, every point has to be backed up with him being a former CM.

Such a big echo in here.

Great to see him doing well though and long may it continue.

1311~~~
i thought mcNair wouldn't fit into a back 3 system.  but so surprisingly he is so good in a central role of back 3.  indeed playing on the flank of b3 there would be more decisions you need to make. when to take on the winger; when to hold on the space; the optimal option to take when ball is under your feet...

in a central role of b3 indeed the job is a bit more simple, but you need to be very experienced to read the game right.  mcNair is certainly not an experienced player but he has a cool head, that maybe the reason why he is doing good in this new role.  bravo!

1312~~~
I'm probably being a bit harsh but I don't think he was that good yesterday. Too slow and was caught out of position a couple of times. Also looks a bit weak physically for me

1313~~~
Very shaky in the first 15 minutes, but improved as the game went on

1314~~~
Was surprised that he was played in the centre of the back 3 instead of Evans or Jones. He did alright, I'm glad LVG gave him a start after the Southampton match, that is good management. I expect Smalling to play at Spurs.

1315~~~
Once again, he played well. Bit shakey at times but nothing too serious. Great to see LvG putting him in the side again, even after that horror show against Southhampton. Think he will be on the bench against Spurs.

1316~~~
I was quite worried every time he was on the ball, seems quite calm on it but maybe too much, it's almost like he would think he still plays for u21, the tempo is three gears faster, but had a decent game overall, couple of good defensive headers. Anyway he really needs to work on one on ones, he seems very slow, he was fouled in one case but struggled in another.. he will be good but for the next game bring SmallKing on..

1317~~~
I think he lacks a bit of aggression for a cb to be honest. Too often he seem happy to let opponents take a touch or two when there's a pretty good chance for a tackle on. I also miss a bit more of a physical presence, him using his body more aggressively in duels. 

Also, his passes tend to be a bit underhit which slows the tempo down and creates a problem for the receiver. I think it's because he's slightly nervous and errs on the side of caution.

Still a decent match by him but to be fair he wasn't particularly tested and when he was, he didn't look assured in his one-on-one defending.

1318~~~
For a 19 y.o. CB on his first pro- season, he's doing really well. So far, he's shown potential, enough to keep at least as squad player for next season.

1319~~~
Incredible pressure on such inexperienced player and looks like the recent tsunami of injuries will require in near future even more sacrifice from Paddy as LVG still strongly believes in his abilities.

It's gonna be hard but many youngsters on his place would already crack on this level. He may be something in future. We'll see.

1320~~~
Didn't impress me at all yesterday. Was average at best, don't really get the praise being lavished on his performance.

1321~~~
It's natural for fans to praise a young player when they just have an average game (nothing wrong with having an average game). Blackett was public enemy after Leicester, then McNair was put in and did well and it was immediately McNair is better than Blackett etc. Same with Wilson, he has done well enough when he has played this season but he hasn't really done anything but gets huge amounts of praise for running hard.

Again, nothing wrong with their performances, they are both doing really well, especially McNair but I agree the praise is a little over the top purely because they are youth players.

1322~~~
Looked very nervous to me but did ok.

1323~~~
Poor performance but managed to prevent himself from going into meltdown, as he did against Soton.

1324~~~
Considering he wasn't even on the radar last season, I think he's done well enough to date. Playing in an unfamiliar system with several different partners, and he's looked solid enough (Southampton away apart, perhaps).

What I especially like about him is that, even though he doesn't have the biggest stature, he seems very brave and determined, and never shirks a physical battle. Reminds me of Seamus Coleman a bit in that sense. Must just be the way they raise 'em in Ireland.

1325~~~
Don't know what's happened to him. Looked calm and composed on the ball in his first few games.

Now like a nervous wreck and second to a lot of balls. Even when he tackles someone the opponent somehow still has the ball.

1326~~~
Seemed to panic a bit a few times which could've led to some dangerous situations, but overall he wasn't too bad.

1327~~~
Does not appear to be strong or fast enough.

1328~~~
I like him. 

However, I just feel like a proper mauling from a decent/good striker is just around the corner. Which usually happens with young defenders, but it can be beneficial as it helps them grow. 

Every time he plays I wonder 'Will this be the game he gets taught a lesson?'

Did well alright today, I can't expect too much from an 18 year old Centre back, part of a team that kept a clean sheet away from home.

1329~~~
He looked nervous but did make some good challenges and interceptions. Still looks to be getting adjusted to the pace of the PL, seems to get caught flat footed sometimes.

I personally think it'll do him some good to be able to sit out a few weeks and get a good rest. It's been a real baptism by fire for him, whereas Blackett has had first team experience in the championship at least and is more used to playing against much more physical teams. 

He's young and still developing but we are having to depend on him too much and he doesn't look ready to be playing at this level imo and has done exceptionally well so far but I think we really need to give him a rest

1330~~~
I do think he's very promising and seems to be able to read the game well and make vital interceptions, but he looked so nervous today. So many stupid little passes and mistakes that I'm sure can be ironed out.

1331~~~
I would argue that Costa is the only top striker in the league he hasn't come up against.Aguero and Giroud did exploit him a bit though.Despite the "shaky" look we have only conceded 1 goals with him starting in the last 2 matches and that caused by Jones's brainfart.

1332~~~
I think his nervousness has more to do with the fear of screwing up than anything else. I don't think he's mentally ready to be playing regular first team football at the moment. A rest would do him some good

1333~~~
Thought he was very poor today and lucky that none of his errors amounted to anything, lacks pace, aggression and isn't physically ready, I hope he doesn't start the next game.

Having said that I think he reads the game pretty well and has some potential and in two or three years time he might be a decent player but nowhere near ready at the moment and probably needs to go out on loan next season.

1334~~~
He's not ready to start away to a team like Spurs but LVG obviously didn't want to take a risk on smalling to prevent an injury relapse so fair play to McNair, for a player currently miles out of his depth he has been solid.....a good defender in the making perhaps in a few years

1335~~~
Technically really poor, and panics too often when pressed by forwards. I cant see any potential in this lad and its only the shortage of CB's at the club why he's anywhere near the first team. Lets be honest, is he any better than other young CB's that never made it at this club who are applying their trade elsewhere? He wasn't pulling up tree's in the reserves either.....

1336~~~
Thats nonsense. 

How many games did he play as a centre half in the reserves???

1337~~~
Whats nonsense, never made any reference to the amount of games? Don't remember any post on here pushing Paddy's development to the first team. I watch a lot of non-first team matches, and he was no more than steady. I stand by my assessment, technically not good enough and would be even further exposed if we were in Europe. He's not alone with the current CB's at the club....

1338~~~
Yeah, I would definitely not play him against Stoke.

1339~~~
So the number of actual games he played for the reserves as a centre half has no relevance at all to you saying he wasnt pulling up trees for them. Makes sense!

Here is a quote about his technical ability from someone who'd actually know...

1340~~~
There is <a class="username" data-user="39261, @gooDevil" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/39261/">@gooDevil</a> if I remember correctly.McNair had only half a season for the U21s before this season so obviously people thought Keane and Thorpe are more likely candidates for first team opportunities.McNair was solid and improved very fast last season (which was confirmed by Warren Joyce).

1341~~~
Seen him enough at U21 for half a season to make my assessment. Oh, someone paid money for Bebe so are we suppose to take anyone's assessment verbatim? For a player that was previously a midfielder, sorry I've seen nothing to suggest this from McNair. I had Keane and especially Thorpe in front of him, and ok the coaches are better positioned to see his ability but I've not seen anything yet to suggest different. I hope I'm proved wrong.

1342~~~
What did I say?

1343~~~
You were saying that he deserves to feature in pre-season or something like that.

1344~~~
Had couple of weak moments but overall thought he did fine today. Got through a lot of work as well.

Some harsh comments as far as i am concerned.

1345~~~
I know Paddy took a lot of stick today, but the boy looks a sensational young talent as a central defender.  No, he's not Stam or Vidic yet and probably never will be, but he will complement a monster of a partner on the back line very well.  Good things lie ahead for him if he can be smart about his development.

1346~~~

1347~~~
By no means perfect today, but interestingly whoscored gave him an 8.14 today. 6 tackles, 6 interceptions, 8 clearances and 1 blocked shot mean he did the majority of the defensive work in the backline by a mile

1348~~~
I think McNair's biggest problem at the moment is that he's not still adjusted to the pace of the Premier League and at times is nervous because he's scared of making mistakes.. He went from Reserve team football to first team football very quickly, and that's tough for a player who's also learning a new position. Going from AMC to CB is not an easy thing to learn I'm sure. He has the talent and technical ability to be an excellent ball playing CB, I think right now he needs a break from 1st team football. Hopefully Jones, Evans and Smalling can remain fit for a while now.

1349~~~
He had a Smalling'esque performance, I think pure defensively he was solid, some good tackles, interceptions, defensive headers, on the ball he was shaky tho. The lad is still 19 but he clearly has potential. The who scores rating confirms my view I got of him. I wouldnt mind a loan, if he gets to play at a PL frequently he can become top notch, also looks like the defender who is class with few space behind him.

1350~~~
I noticed this, at the same time I can't stop being terrified whenever he's got major defensive work to do or gets put under a tiny bit of pressure on the ball. 

His reading of the game is actually quite good I'm realizing, but he lacks aggression and a bit of physicality.

1351~~~
I do rate McNair, however it was Thorpe who I was hoping would get big minutes. I don't remember if I called for McNair to get preseason minutes or not, honestly.

McNair had, what, half a season with the U21s, with a short midfielder as his partner? He looked very good and the team defense was strong. Then we go and release his partner Ekangamene after that summer, so apparently the coaches felt it was McNair holding down the defense.

I think Thorpe is pretty good, though even a top youth player is unlikely to make it with the first team of course. I think it's odd he's not gotten any chance at CB for us, and instead got a look at midfield, but I'm sure there's a good reason.

It's so hard to tell with these kids sometimes, I'd like to think McNair would make it, but the standard we're looking for is higher than ever. Evans looked better at his age, but we've all seen how that's no guarantee.

1352~~~
At this level he absolutely lacks aggression and physicality. I'm sure they've got him in the weight room every day, though.

1353~~~
Still way to much analysis over his game. He wasn't great but he did his job and in a tough game like that, not much more can be asked of him.

1354~~~
I agree. He was a standout for me, and to think how little experience he has, I really have high hopes for him.

1355~~~
A tired generalization of Chris Smalling's game. His distribution has been top notch this season and he's been great on the ball.

1356~~~
Tbf if he turns out to be another Evans that's not really a worst thing in this world.Evans had couple of good seasons for us.

1357~~~
Considering he looks even younger than his age out there somehow, he's performing quite well. Hopefully he'll emerge as a physically transformed player as happens often enough with 19 year olds.

1358~~~
Yikes, that's some harsh words after a perfectly fine performance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I think he looks better as the CB in a back 5, where he is staying back most of the time and letting Jones/Evans burst forward. If he keeps developing, he'll be a very good CB in a few years.

1359~~~
Can understand criticism of his defending but "technically really poor"? That's just nonsense.

1360~~~
He is good at football but not very good at the physical aspect of the sport.

1361~~~
Defensively he was good today, but he is not a natural footballer. Barely any composure on the ball and his first touches/dribble attempts almost cost him again. It was summed up nicely when Rafa at one point had the ball and had a player closing him down, and he did a little cutback with the ball getting him out of danger like any natural footballer would do in possession and it looked completely foreign to Paddy, he tried to hoof it right out of Rafa's possession. Rafa told him to calm down but I don't think he can. Not sure if that is of age, or if he's low on confidence, or if he's just shite on the ball..

1362~~~
He is solid - but I doubt he will ever be good enough to be a regular. But I prefer him to Blackett. Watching Tyler Blackett play is not recommended less than an hour before going to the doctor to have your bloodpressure measured.

1363~~~
Putting this idea out here but does anyone think that he could be a good DM for us?

1364~~~
I think when you look at the quality players like Carrick and Blind bring to that role, that's what you have to continue to look for, I don't think you can't look to players like McNair for that role.

1365~~~
Carrick and Blind already operate in that area and are very good at it so it would be pointless. He's got the technique for it though.

1366~~~
Pearson is a better option if you want a young DM.McNair's all-round game just not enough for that role.

1367~~~
Why does he play in the middle of three CBs ? Wouldn't you want the more experienced player to have the more central role ? Not criticism, just trying to understand.

1368~~~
So many different ways to look at it in my opinion and probably too much debate has been had on it. People have said van Gaal rates him higher than the others so he put his best in the middle etc, in my opinion, I think it was probably the other way and van Gaal supported him on both sides with more experienced players.

Out of the 3, Evans is probably the most comfortable on the left side, Jones is very comfortable on the right, so it made sense for him to being the centre. I don't think it's that big an issue though, I can see why people think it is though.

1369~~~
Evans has played LB before, Jones has played RB before. I guess they can push out of defence easier if they can get on their strong foot (I know Evans isn't left footed, but he is the best option considering the injuries). We didn't see too much of them coming out of defence though.

1370~~~
I think this is because of a couple of factors.

He looks the least comfortable on the ball out of our CB's so surrounding him with two easy options either side of him for a short pass is sound logic. 

Also, as the middle CB he's not going to get dragged out that often and can concentrate on winning his aerial duels and tackles, which he does quite well. Also, he's not that dependant on using pace to cover for the full backs out wide. He's also less likely to get run at directly. 

Overall I see the logic even though I'd prefer Smalling there when he's fit.

1371~~~
The way we are playing this system right now the side CB's role seems tougher than the centre ones if anything. Especially in terms of distribution.

Mcnair cannot play on the left in this Plus Jones has been our best RCB in this and Mcnair would struggle on the outside for pace more and cannot drive with the ball to break the press like Jones.

1372~~~
Cheers everyone

1373~~~
Never going to be good enough for us.

1374~~~
Yeah, he doesn't have the strength of personality to make it I don't think. He doesn't want the ball, and when it comes to him you can see him start to worry.

He'll probably end up moving around clubs in the Championship. He has done his job though.

1375~~~
Post's like this make me laugh, thanks.

1376~~~
And these ones.

1377~~~
Okay. Explain.

1378~~~
I'm gonna cut him some slack because he can pass and defend but putting a inexperienced young defender in a 3 at the back situation which makes him completely change and rethink his game clearly is effecting his performances.  Most games we play 3 at the back we get pressured like feck so that clearly doesn't help any of our defenders. 

I'd like him to go on loan for a few years and see how he turns out, I've high hopes for him but I think Blackett is better.

1379~~~
I really don't need to.

1380~~~
Posts like this make me laugh.

1381~~~
It is pretty funny to see someone on here question McNair's strength  of personality.

1382~~~
Thought he had one of his better games after a shaky 1st half. Still not seen anything to suggest he should be in the starting 11 though. Do not think it would be wise to start him at Stoke,

1383~~~
Ok, then if I must

You say he doesn’t have the strength of personality to make it here, where is the proof that he doesn’t? Is it because he was thrust into the first team with literally no first team experience and surpassed all expectations or was it that he hasn’t looked out of place and some would argue has been one of our better defenders this season, maybe it’s when he was subbed after 40 minutes against Villa but still didn’t let it affect his performance yesterday? Or maybe it was when everyone said he would be bullied by Lukaku, but he managed to restrict him to one shot the entire match?

You also agreed that he will never make it here? Again show me the proof, there is nothing to suggest he won’t make it here, he is 19 and has played a handful of games, and has performed above expectations. It’s a bit early to be chucking him out the door isn’t it, actually why don’t we write off the entire underage players, it will safe us time and energy and help us buy all these superstars that are floating about.

And as for floating about the Championship? How have you come to that conclusion? Even if he doesn’t make it here why couldn’t he make it at another Premier League Club?

1384~~~
I think he has comfortably been our worst defender this season so far. He had a good game against Everton, yes, but he doesn't fill anyone with confidence. This is especially apparent when he's the last defender and attackers are baring down on him. His touch is always too hesitant or too heavy.

It is too early to write him off I admit, he is 19 after all, but if we are bringing in more defenders, which we surely must do, players like him, Thorpe and Keane are not going to make it here.

Craig Cathcart was once highly regarded here and look where he is now, as was Corry Evans. Luckily for you it's not me making the decisions, but I don't think anyone would be at all surprised if he went at the end of next season.

1385~~~
To be fair McNair has shown himself to be a very admirable and promising young player, without really indicating he'll ever become top class. Or indicating that he won't become top class, for that matter.

To be sure of getting a top class player, you have to buy a top class player, and that's probably what we need to do, given our weakness in this position. So Blackett and McNair aren't going to get as many chances as they'd like to play and may feel they have to go elsewhere.

1386~~~
Writing of a 19 year old CB to the championship, my word, I suppose this place would be dull without such idiocy. 

Even ABU opposition fans I've watched our games with have been impressed with this lad everytime. He's solid beyond his years he just needs more experience.

1387~~~
In your opinion he has been our worst defender, in many other he has been one of the better performers, to say he has had only one good game is way off the mark, the majority of the Caf seem to agree as his average rating is the same as Rojo and only very close to Jones who is leading the way.

Thorpe and Keane haven’t caught the eye of LVG, there is an argument to be had that they may not make it here, as for Evans and Cathcart, they didn’t have the talent to make it however they weren’t given the same reasonability that LVG has gave to McNair, thats the big differance here.

Many players have come through the ranks and been a success here, I don’t have to name them as we all know who they are, many more are now playing for other Premiership Clubs, Shawcross, Richardson, Alex Bruce, Drinkwater, Rossi, Howard, Campbell, De Laet to name but a few.

It’s far, far too early to write off McNair, it’s silly to even suggest it IMO.

1388~~~
This. At his age and first season, up and down performances are expected. Whether it would be costly for us as a team and we could afford that, it's another story.

1389~~~
I gave up long time ago trying to explain to them that every youngster promoted from the rank will have flaws in their games at first due to their inexperience or in some case,zero experience about senior football, especially one who only played U21s football for half a season before this season like McNair.

Fans nowadays have zero patience and refuse to really watch a player for long enough before making judgement.McNair is not comfortable on the ball?Give me a 19 years old CB with an experience like him playing at this level who looked more assured on the ball then?Oh too bad there is none.Making mistakes?Callum Chambers also bloody did a lot and it's not even his first season of PL football.

Let's just fill the squad with full of top class players when we're at it.Surely it will solve all of our problems.Who care about develop youngsters from the rank?They're full of errors anyway.

About McNair, he's still learning the CB role.I hope people watched him in 2012-2013 to realise the massive improvement.Give him 1-2 more seasons and some will have to laugh at their comments.

1390~~~
McNair's age and inexperience can't be overlooked when evaluating him. This summer, he was if I recall not even part of the US tour and buried below Thorpe on the youth CB pecking order. Van Gaal obviously sees something in him that he would like to develop and Paddy has done well with the opportunity. Anyone criticizing a hard working 19 year old kid trying to make his way in football needs to give themselves a slap.

1391~~~
I'm amazed anyone can make a call on the future of McNair, M.Keane, Blackett or any similar defender who has played a few PL matches and done ok in some games while looking out of their depth in other matches. We don't have enough evidence to know either way. We don't know how much they can develop physically, mentally, tactically. We don't even know what their current average performance level is (LVG will have a better idea from seeing them in training but even he won't be sure at this stage). If they start 25 PL games would we see a ton of errors or just a few more than you'd get from Jones, Evans or Smalling ?

1392~~~
Funnily Michael Keane has only make a couple of mistakes when playing for Burnley, much less than McNair and Blackett.He's more experienced though, just need the confidence.But yeah he was shit against MK Dons so let's get him out of the door asap.

1393~~~
It was only an exhibition but he looked so lost for pace against Bale & Ronaldo in preseason that I think it kind of left an impression on everyone since then. I know not a lot of defenders have a chance against either of those but Keane was pretty much beat the moment they received the ball. I'm kind of pleasantly surprised he's been pulling a few MOTM awards at Burnley.

1394~~~
There will almost inevitably be winners and losers this summer as we appear to have a bunch of young(ish) defenders whose performance level is very similar. What has surprised me is that the more experienced young defenders (Smalling, Rojo and Jones) don't look that much better than the relative novices (McNair, M.Keane and Blackett).

I've noticed more than a couple of errors from M.Keane just from watching the highlights of Burnley matches. No idea how he compares to Blackett or McNair as I'm conscious of almost every minor error they make.

1395~~~
He was shaky in his first 2 matches for them but grown since then.As far as I aware I can't see any real mistake from him vs City.He and his CB partner made one vs Liverpool that lead to Sterling's goal.Can't recall any big mistake from him from the match before that.He's the type of players that need confidence at the level he's playing at to perform well.

1396~~~
Martin Keown essentially said that the middle position in the three is the easiest as you don't have to cover the full backs.

1397~~~
Hes been better than Blackett thats for sure. Look at our win records for each of their individual starts....

1398~~~
So defending doesn't take any technical ability?

1399~~~
Its becoming clearer that Getsme just defends North Irish players to the death. Well, fair play.

1400~~~
Well said. Especially considering that he has played fairly well. I mean he had some great performances, some average ones and a very bad one.

But then again, no-one expected him to play this season in EPL. However, he has played 10 games which shows that he is doing something right. After all, he was supposed to be our 8th choice CB, but now he is our 5th choice.

It is too early to make any judgement on him and so far I have been impressed with him.

1401~~~
One of my bug-bears on here is the way so many people jump to conclusions about a player's "technical ability" as though it's some fixed score out of 100. McNair's more comfortable on the ball than most centre-halved seeing as he was playing in midfield until fairly recently. The heavy touches, sliced clearances and clumsy moments we've seen in his last couple of starts are much more likely to be down to inexperience and nerves than any kind of fundamental flaw in his technique.

1402~~~
I don't really know how people judge him, he hasn't been that bad, he is so young and inexperienced that i'm still surprised by his performances.
Remember, centerbacks don't play at 19 years old, only the freaks are good at that age.

1403~~~
Nice to see some sense been spoken in this thread

1404~~~
WTF <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Is Jones and Falcao Irish? What about Valencia or Fellaini. I defend players who come into unfair criticism? But sure you beluebe what you want. Criticising Mc Nair without justification is stupid, it doesn't matter where he is from.

1405~~~
I guess it's just a different view than yours. I'm not saying that he's not a good player, just not good enough for us. Young players get the opportunities at this club but they need to be ready now which he's not. What do you think will happen to him if predictable we sign a couple of experience CB's, he's already behind 3 players and that's not including a midfielder dropping into a back 3?
His opportunity has come about not purely based on his ability but the situation with injuries. If we had a full compliment of defenders and he was still getting his chance, then that's based on his ability.
It's believed that selling Danny was based on Wilson ability and there's the difference. If we sell any of the current CB's then I'll start to look at Paddy differently....

1406~~~
I thought was was our worst defender yesterday, whilst also being the best. He made a few mistakes, but he is learning his trade beside erratic defenders. He still got stuck in and made some great clearances and headers.

He's 19 and the amount of stick he gets is unfair. He is miles better than Blackett.

1407~~~
I thought he was poor in the first half at spurs but really grew into the game in the second half. Jury is still out for me if he will make it long term, would love to see the lad succeed and hope he fulfills his obvious talent as a composed centre back.

1408~~~
You defend McNair and Evans ad nauseum even when its obvious they've had a stinker. I don't care about the other players you listed, but you're the biggest fan of the Northern Irish players here. I think thats fair, just stating that its obvious.

1409~~~
Its very obvious. I've mentioned this before.

1410~~~
i thought some people were harsh in the matchday thread saying he had a mare and a shocker etc. He had some shaky moments, but otherwise was pretty solid. He has made a huge step in the last few months, he needs time to adapt. Of course he is nervous and will make mistakes here or there, but it hasnt cost us so far. I like that van Gaal trusts him and he gets some game time.

1411~~~
What do results have to do with individual performances in this context? Might as well go deeper and look at stats.

1412~~~
This.

1413~~~
He is a 19 year old CB playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world and in a tough league.

Mistakes are to be expected unless you are expecting a prime Maldini, Rio and Beckenbauer wrapped into one.

McNair will still be a work in progess however lets wait to judge him properly.

1414~~~
The criticism here of McNair yesterday was way too harsh.  He had 2 or 3 miscues but otherwise was very composed and allowed very little daylight for Spurs.  He's a substantially better passer than Evans and Jones already, which is crazy.  Paddy still has to work through the jitters, but let's cut the boy some slack.  This was only his 5th or 6th match at this level and he was facing a formidable Spurs side away and dealing with a referee who was fukking us all game.

1415~~~
That is a crazy claim. You got that much right.

1416~~~
The rush to judgment on young players always amazes me. I know people like to be in first, presumably so they can say "told you so" later, but really the conviction of some of the posts in the thread is just baffling.

Rio came to us at 23/24 with a couple of hundred first class games behind him and he still had a reputation for odd errors, misjudgements and concentration lapses. Vidic was 24 and he didn't exactly inspire anyone with confidence in his first few games for us.

I'm hypersensitive to mistakes made by our players, whereas I scarcely notice the mistakes made by opposing players. But I also remember enough about what even experienced players look like when they arrive in a new team to know that arriving in United's first team at 19, joining an ever-changing defence and not standing out like a sore thumb or a defensive liability, is actually impressive.

1417~~~
I think it's clear McNair is better than Blackett regardless.

1418~~~
My rating for Evans is .1 above the Caf average, my rating for McNair is .2, I defend players who deserve to be defended, the criticism Evans in particular has recieved this season has been way over the top, to suggest otherwise is bonkers. As for McNair, I've explained already, as have many others why the criticism of his performances are far to judgemental.
You don't care about the other players I've listed? I see where you're going with this. Some fans including your good self, need to have a sit down and look at the bigger picture, how many would have got rid of RVP after a few bad games this season?  Vidic, Evra and De Gea when they first joined were terrible, Rooney, Rafael, Mata, Falcao, Carrick, Fellaini, Smalling, Valencia, Young all have shown terrible form over the last few years, should we just get rid when they show a dip in form or make a bad pass?  I could go on but I can't be arsed.

1419~~~
I don't see anything at this time to suggest that M Keane, Blackett, McNair or Thorpe will ever be anything more than backup players and will probably carve out careers in the lower half of the premier league or in the championship. 

It will take dramatic improvement (which is possible) for any of them to still be here in a few years time but they are all young and with our constant injuries you never know but if even one could make the step up it would be a great bonus. The odds are heavily stacked against them though and competition for places is likely to increase when new signings are made.

1420~~~
To be fair he doesn't really have strong competition ahead.

1421~~~
Not, it's not. McNair seems to be getting of a free ride here whereas Blackett got plenty of abuse.

He's been a bit lucky that many of his mistakes haven't been punished or he would be getting the Blackett treatment.

1422~~~
McNair has put in good performances, Blackett has not. He hasn't followed up his pre-season games. Thats why a dodgy performance and then a few mistakes on his return to the side aren't the end of the world. Because he's already shown he's a fairly dependable stand in when we need him. Blackett is yet to show that

1423~~~
Revisionism.

Blackett started the season well. Not saying he was flawless and his passing was a bit annoying but he defended quite well for the most part. A quick look at the Blackett thread confirms that. Had an atrocious 2nd half vs Leicester which opened him up to some ridiculous abuse.

McNair started alright albeit his 2 best performances came when we were parking the bus with 10 men.

1424~~~
Blackett started the season by giving a goal against Swansea, the revisionism is on your side, stop judging CBs in their first dozen of games, it is close to impossible to know what we have at the moment, they could be average or very good in three or four years.

1425~~~
Yeh can't understand how McNair's good performances were used to try and make Blackett look poor.

I think Blackett has been doing really well. Looking forward to seeing him in the cup.

1426~~~
I think thats harsh tbh, he wasn't flawless like the guy said but he defended well mostly, then had a shocker vs Leicester (like quite a few others).

1427~~~
Where in that post am I judging either of them?

Blackett defended fairly well for the most part. That's not revisionism, that's what happened. Your post is pretty much proving my point. Blackett was punished for a small mistake (which then tends to stick out in the mind) where as McNair's mistakes so far have gone unpunished which probably explains why he's not gotten as much stick. Heck even in the Leicester game, Blackett was our best defender until we collapsed in the last half hour.

They've both had seasons you'd expect from young unproven CB's. Long way to go yet for both of them.

1428~~~
Blackett has made himself look poor. How many good games has he actually had? He was at fault for a Swansea goal, was crap at Leicester and wasn't very good against Burnley either.

EDIT - He didn't do much wrong when he came of the bench recently, I'll give him that.

1429~~~
I'm not going to list good and poor games because at the end of the day, it will all come down to opinion. He has made mistakes, how dare a young player? Considering the circumstances, he came in and did well. I know a lot of United fans won't accept anything short of a 8/9 out of 10 but for me, for his first few appearances for the United first team, did quite well.

1430~~~
That's not harsh he made mistakes after mistakes in his positioning and his marking, more than McNair, but that's normal, he is an inexperienced defender, half of what make a good defender is on how they deal with the accumulation of information, that they gain by playing, it's a very long process.

Sorry, i misinterpreted this:

1431~~~
The thing I think is harsh is the constant blame for the Swansea goal.

1432~~~
I like to think I am patient with players, Blackett just doesn't have it.

Swansea
Sunderland
Burnley
QPR
Leicester
Everton (subbed on)
Arsenal
Villa (subbed on)

QPR his only good game then? QPR created feck all. Maybe Sunderland as well, I don't know, I watched that on a shitty stream.

1433~~~
I didn't blamed him, he was partly at fault and that's not a big deal. It's like Shaw against Everton.

1434~~~
I guess I misinterpreted this:

1435~~~
Defended quite well in most of the games excepting that mistake vs Swansea and some of his passing. Against Everton, he made a pretty good block at the deat. Started shakily against Arsenal (like everyone else) but overall he was alright.

Also doesn't help that all of his starts have been in a back 3.

1436~~~
Its not a anti McNair for me. For a lad of his age to come into the first team and perform is admirably, however this has happened based on circumstance imo. The injuries at the back have meant LVG has had no choice but to look at alternatives. Now compare this situation with Wilson. It's well documented that his promotion to the first team, and selling Danny was based on his potential and ability. I'm pretty sure we would not be talking about Paddy in the same way.

If all fit, paddys behind Smalling, Jones, Evans, Rojo and that's not even based on us signing a couple more CB's or potentially Blind or Carrick playing in a back 3.....

1437~~~
The only way he starts is if we play 3 at the back. That's the only reason he was taken on tour. He's been far from good.

1438~~~
True but a few of those won't be here after next summer.
Also Wilson hasn't been great in the first team yet.

1439~~~
He said that Blackett started the season well. I supposed compared to Mcnair, Blackett made mistakes who costed goals against Swansea and Sunderland, but was very good against Burnley.

1440~~~
Not sure about that tbh, those players are still young in CB terms and might look better if played with a more experienced player. Wilson done ok imo but that aside the fact we let Danny go in order to promote him to the first team, you can't get a bigger endorsement than that....

1441~~~
With LVG every player is responsible for his own performance. If they don't perform they wont get to play with a more experienced player next season. If McNair or Blackett show more promise than any of them they are gone.

1442~~~
Agree but equally if they are not fit, LVG can't make an assessment. I can't say that Smalling isn't good enough or Jones for that matter, they've just not been fit long enough. Evans equally. I can't see McNair or Blackett being pushing those two. These are players that are very good once fit, even potentially world class in the future and people often forget this.....

1443~~~
The thing about fitness, is that we all knew before the season started that all 3 of those players would have injuries this season. The assessment will be made on their performances whilst fit, I doubt the boss is going to be thinking they are potentially world class on those performances, ok maybe Smalling is the exception but the rest I doubt it tbh.

EDIT: We're going to be aiming for the title and potentially the UCL next season, I think you'll find the boss will be quite ruthless.

1444~~~
Jones I believe is a very good player, maybe the best CB at the club. I think he's looked pretty good since coming back. If Smalling or Jones became available, they would be bought by a top 3 club. Can't be any potentially better English players at their age. These players have international and CL experience too....

1445~~~
Chelsea or City wouldn't sign either of them.

1446~~~
Arsenal already wanted Smalling and I think Chelsea would take Jones. He's potentially a young Terry.....plus for CL major factor that they are both English. As much as I think he's a idiot, can you imagine either player next to Terry......

1447~~~
Arsenal are not a top3 club and are not going to win the league any time soon.
Jones hasn't played 20+ games at CB over a extended period and looked top class so why would Chelsea (managed by Mourinho) ever sign such a player? Just beacuse he has england caps?

1448~~~
Most people on the cafe have been over reactionary about players. If it were up to redcafe we'd have terminated the contracts of Mata, RvP, Falcao, Young, Valencia, Jones, Smalling, De Gea, and more by now. So obviously the cafe is a terrible barometer of player performance. I'm not trying to offend you, I don't mind that you are supportive of your countrymen. If We ever signed a Canadian player (lol) I'd be overly supportive of them too.

1449~~~
We have, Owen Hargreaves. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1450~~~
sort of, the bloody crock!

1451~~~
We've just signed that youth player too, josh doughty his name is I believe. Hopefully he'll make it here and stay with Canada as he is eligible for the us and England too.

1452~~~
I think otherwise

1453~~~
Blackett looks the bigger talent to me than McNair. It will be interesting to see which one of them survives longer.

1454~~~
No, he was a little under par and we could see clear weaknesses. Posts in the Blackett thread will tell you that several people including myself remarked that he didnt look comfortable defending high balls, often letting them bounce and getting himself into trouble.

McNair on the other hand coped with pretty much everything in his first handful of games, including impressive reading of balls behind the backline and being able to see off the attackers trying to get on the end of them. He also took responsibility for a lot of the headed clearances, tending to make more of them than Rojo who was alongside him. It was that maturity and ability to cope with what was thrown at him that made him look a better defender than Blackett. He didn't look a world beater, but he looked like he could do the job when asked to.

You have McNair who is putting in a 6.5-7/10 defensive performance and then you have Blackett putting in a 5.5-6/10 defensive performance. Its obvious that if McNair has a dodgy game he's going to be forgiven a lot easier because we know he can do a job.

1455~~~
I have to agree, I know it goes against popular opinion on here but I really like the look of Blackett. Nothing against McNair, I just see more in Blackett.

Who knows how their careers will play out though.

1456~~~
Blackett is harshly criticized on here. Nothing against McNair either, I hope he's not another Jonny Evans though.

1457~~~
Yeh, Blackett felt the full force of the United fans backlash after a costly mistake in a game that we lost. If McNair's nightmare cost us against Southampton, he sadly would have been in for the same treatment but we won, so it's easily forgotten and put down to being a young player.

1458~~~
I don't see anything special in either of them. I see two young players with limited ability who look very shakey at times and need to have the whole game dictated to them.

1459~~~
McNair looks a better defender currently, its as simple as that. Blackett had some bells and whistles with his distribution and dribbling in pre-season, but those havent looked as good in the premier league so far (in fact he's looked shaky and suspect) and they are fancy fluff on top of the important stuff. The important stuff is the actual defending, where McNair has clearly done a better job so far.

I can see why someone might think Blackett will become the better player, but there's no evidence at all to suggest he'll become a better defender. Thats one of the main areas he's lagging behind and needs to improve if he's going to have a future at United.

Right now McNair is clearly ahead in the pecking order, and Michael Keane is doing well on loan. When he returns in the summer Blackett might be the 3rd choice of the 3 unless he has a dramatic improvement

1460~~~
People need to understand how quick a pecking order can change. Who would have thought McNair would be in the position he is in at the start of the season?

One injury, one good performance, a signing, a player leaving etc anything can dramatically change the outlook for a player.

1461~~~
He's not going up that order without playing well himself, thats the point. If Blackett plays like he has done so far this season we're more likely to sign someone than bump him up the order

1462~~~
Blackett is actually a better natural footballer and defender (especially on one vs one situation).It just that his weakness (concentration lapse and unaware of the runner near/behind him) are so obvious and easy to be exploited.Those are coachable but I haven't seen much improvement from him.It's a shame because he would be very good otherwise (his sloppy passing is more due to being nervous/inexperience than his ability).Currently playing Blackett would be suicidal in the type of game against good counter-attacking team.

He (Blackett) needs to up his game before the season ends otherwise it's very hard for him to keep his place for next season.The one that matters (LVG) seems to rate McNair higher at the moment and we'll have a young defender who's a regular at PL level (Michael Keane) coming back.

I actually think Borthwick-Jackson (U18s) is a better version of him so it would be interesting to follow their development in the next few seasons.

1463~~~
He was about as under par as McNair has been, no more. Also, McNair gives you the impression that Andy Carroll could breeze by him given the ease with which he's beaten 1v1. Even on his debut, Valencia went past him as if he wasn't there and that's happened way too many times since then. He's made mistakes in just about every game he has played.

1464~~~
Agree. Course he's must be of a quality cause he's come from the academy but young players promoted to first team have to be ready now. Yes, they will be inexperienced at this level but they should have the quality, but I can't see it. Like I said Young players here get their chance but don't always get their time. Even potentially after this window, we may have signed another CB. If he's that good, he should be playing weekly if fit. He will never get a better opportunity than this season.

1465~~~
With respect the McNair and Blackett, I hope we keep in mind that we're talking about two very, very young players.  We can't rely on either to lead us to a CL trophy next season, but they are both outstanding long-term prospects for us.  They may or may not break through as our first choice central defenders 3-4 seasons from now, but all things considered they've stepped up very well for us.

I'd have no problem having either in the rotation for us to deal with the QPRs of the world to give I've senior defenders -- such as Jones, all of 22 years old -- the occasional break.

1466~~~
I thought he looked shaky as part of the back 3 again but perked up a bit when he moved to RB.

1467~~~
It looked like it was all going horribly wrong in the first half, but I thought he looked quite composed at FB in the second half. He doesn't look scared of the ball, which is certainly something.

1468~~~
Has no positional awareness at RB though, which is fair since he never played there before.I wouldn't play him there against any PL team.

1469~~~
Felt sorry for him as he should have been taken off after his head injury. Not surprised he looked dazed for the rest of the first half.

1470~~~
He's obviously not ready, he should've been loaned to a lower league team this season but injuries dictated that he became a regular.

1471~~~
Accident waiting to happen, has been fortunate to get away with a lot of errors, not his fault as he has been forced into action but he needs a year or two in the championship and dramatic improvement if he is to be here long term which in all honesty I don't think he will be.

1472~~~
He was much more agressive today. First time I've seen him try to assert himself physically. Is actually very good on the ball, can make that out by how easily he was bringing the ball out of defense, just needs to learn to make a pass quicker instead of trying to find the perfect pass.

1473~~~
His 100% record continued today though, didn't it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1474~~~
Thrown in because we have injury prone CB's and FB's. Poor lad. Not ready.

1475~~~
I think he will be the moment we bring someone in to replace him.

1476~~~
He started against Tottenham.

1477~~~
Ah, still unbeaten so, the dodgy bastard.

1478~~~
People said what they want but we actually had a very good defensive record with him starting.

1479~~~
Yeah, but he's obviously not the reasoning for that. de Gea saved our bacon in most of them games.

1480~~~
Definitely but the way some said about him as if he's another Wootton is funny.

I still persist with my opinion that Keane and Thorpe are better than him at the moment but I don't think the lad has been as poor as some made him out to be.

1481~~~
He's been clawing his way back since the Southampton game, where the wheels came off quite badly.  With Shaw's and Rafael's injuries he was obviously pressed to stay on in the second half.  He looked shaky, but that may well have been due to the head injury, but he managed to do his job, and was part of a defense that kept a clean sheet and isn't that what we ask of our defense?  He looked more capable than Blackett did during the first half I felt, and had been doing well recently.  A lot of his poorer performances have been when Smalling has played, with Jones and Evans around him he's been better.

Next week is a huge game for him, if he plays Southampton will target him as they did once they got into the game at St. Mary's, it will be a test of character for him, which I do think he's capable of passing.

1482~~~
This. I voted him my MoTM, looked good at the back.. He had a few shaky moments but was better than Smalling and Blackett for me..Had more agression to his game today and was asking for the ball more too.

1483~~~
I wouldn't go that far... Certainly looked better today though. A little confidence seems to be coming back.

1484~~~
We'll have Jones for Southampton so I don't think he'll start.

1485~~~
I'm very pleased with how our 19 year old central defender is developing.

1486~~~
That handball was stupid, what on earth was he thinking? On another day he could've quite easily have been shown a red card and cost us the game.

1487~~~
It looked accidental to me,ball hitting his elbow as he was turning.

1488~~~
It was accidental, clumsy yes but think the above is a bit harsh.

1489~~~
Wow man some people are just uber harsh.

1490~~~
I'm sure he was thinking, no danger here... let's see if I can get away with one and practice the old basketball skills.

Or maybe it was a total accident and he wasn't thinking about handling it at all.

1491~~~
Yeah. No one was criticizing Smalling for his handball against Stoke.

1492~~~
His contract is up in June.

Is there any chance he's goint to do an Eckersley/Fryers?

1493~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> That's fecking scary, got a source for that?

1494~~~
We're about to offer him a 20k/week contract.

1495~~~
<a class="username" data-user="64066, @Flamingo Purple" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64066/">@Flamingo Purple</a>

Transfermarkt

<a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> 

Got a source for that?

1496~~~
I don't usually remember the source (saw on Twitter), especially when I have no doubt that he will stay if offered.

1497~~~
I was happy with his ballsy performance Sunday but I don't think he should play against Southampton.

1498~~~
Read on BBC that he rejected an initial contract offer from United...I can't find any other sources that back this. Does anyone know?

1499~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30834875" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30834875</a>

This is bad news, real bad. LVG will lose a fan of his if he lets this happen.

1500~~~
Need to be more proactive with these youth contracts.

1501~~~
Let's what?

He's been offered a contract and rejected it according to reports. 

I wouldn't lose any sleep if McNair leaves to be honest.

1502~~~
This club needs to harness it's young players and give them the best opportunity. Why pay millions for a player like Falcao and not give McNair and Blackett the contracts they want? They've proven they're quality this season and with more game time and composure I believe they will become real stars.

1503~~~
He'll want a contract as part of first team squad now you'd imagine and before in november he would have been offered a contract more u21s level.

It would most likely be sorted but club should be more proactive and not let contracts run out to this degree. Happening with too many younger players, and could lead to another Pogba somehwere.

1504~~~
Who said he rejected it?

And disagreement in terms of wages etc. in the initial offer is normal in contract negotiation.

1505~~~
Yeah let's ruin our wage structure. Give players who played around 10 games big fat contracts. Then next season when other players come through can ask for more. 

Have they really proven their quality? They proven nothing when people are still calling for us to sign new defenders.

1506~~~
I have no doubt his agent is looking for wages more in line with his being in the first team, rather than what he's actually worth which is substantially less than that.

I'll lose no sleep if he leaves, to be honest. He's not Pogba.

1507~~~
Unconcerned, I know both McNair and Blackett are young and have been thrown in too early, but I haven't been overly impressed with either. Brown, O'Shea, Evans and Jones all looked better at their age.

I trust van Gaal's judgement.

1508~~~
People are also calling us to buy new CM's where we have 2 new 30 million each signings and new strikers/strikers where we have a bunch of players on big fat wages.  At CB we haven't really made any glamorous established signing to please people either.

Anyway, He is a 19 year old talented CB who has done well given the circumstances and shown potential. Seems fair to try everything within reasonable means to get him to sign given possible marginal cost of losing him. I'd be very surprised if it was any over the top figure demanded as he wouldn't get it anywhere else either.

Less sure about Blackett but should give him a new contract as well.

1509~~~
I bet you're the same type of person who says the money doesn't matter when talking about players like Falcao, Di Maria and RVP who are doing a lot more to ruin the wage structure. Hey we're United we only give multi million pounds contracts to ageing foreign players, giving money to promising youth prospects would be silly.

Also how can you say they've proven nothing? They've proven themselves to be far beyond most teenage defenders in the world right now, McNair has made a few mistakes sure but it's clear to see the lad has talent.

1510~~~
Would be a shame to see him go for free, but I wouldn't be that concerned. I haven't seen anything that has made me think he is going to become a real worldclass player, so I can't see him being our first choice CB for years to come anyway.

1511~~~
Were you saying RVP was ruining the wage structure when he was winning us the premier league. Bet you weren't.

Far beyond? Whenever Blackett is on the field there is a mistake going to happen. Just need to look at the weekend. Wasn't even good enough for Birmingham. They were happy to get rid of him.

I wouldn't rate McNair ahead of Keane, who I'm more annoyed Van Gaal let go of. 

Yes let's give big contracts to youth players, who proved nothing and have played about 10 games. Then next season the youth players coming up can ask for more.

1512~~~
I don't really rate Blackett but I guess you're not around when Leicester fans called to terminate Harry Kane's loan deal when he was on loan at them.

Also who is saying it has to be a big fat contract?Too much assumption.

1513~~~
They've been as good as you could ask two players in their situation this season but I am totally with you. There's no blinding natural talent there whatsoever. We owe them nothing as players and the experience they have gained this season will be invaluable to their careers. 

Fosu-Mensah is where we need to be looking. All the attributes for a top quality defender while being accomplished on the ball. Taunzebe and Cameron B-J too. They're both a step up on Blackett and McNair in terms of natural talent although their development is obviously behind due to age. 

If we're looking to the future it's these guys, I think one of them will be part of Van Gaal's legacy much the same way Xavi, Valdes, Muller et al are.

1514~~~
Why? Keane played twice this season and was sh*t twice.
McNair played 10 times and was sh*t once.

1515~~~
Haven't seen much of him, but he looks the real deal from what I have seen.

1516~~~
Would be happy if he was signed and then sent on loan. Wouldn't lose sleep if he was let go. He has potentail but it's not top class; lack of pace is a real issue. 

I would be surprised if Blackett can find a regular spot at a championship club, let alone at United.

1517~~~
Not really. I'll be very surprised if either turns out to be a top 4 CB.

1518~~~
Nobody knows what's going on, it's all pure speculation at this point. However, I refuse to believe that McNair and Blackett are stupid enough to hold the Club to ransom.

1519~~~
Only if they are good enough. McNair is only playing as a stop-gap until we have no injuries or sign better defenders.

1520~~~
If they're not in our future it can be better for them and us to move on as we get compensation and they get the chance to start their careers. You can be sure they have both been offered fair contract but been told they will be going on loan next year and will play no part for the foreseeable. They've then got to ask themselves the serious question, will I ever actually make it here? Unlikely.

1521~~~
We had only 1 injury and he was on the bench.

Too much assumption, again.I suggest we wait until we really know what's happening.

1522~~~
I would assume they're holding off to get more money. 

Their agents know the club has some money kicking about and are willing to give out decent wages to average players, so why not try their luck. 

I do think both Blackett and Mcnair will be here next year though.

1523~~~
I wouldn’t be too fussed if either or both of Blackett and McNair didn’t sign new contracts, both are just fairly ordinary players who have been thrown in due to the circumstances. Don’t see much of a future for either as anything other than the backup players they have been this season and if we had centre halves who actually played regularly that would limit their game time to a minimum.

Ideally they would sign and we could see how they develop on loan just in case but I don’t see either being a big loss and think they would both find it tough to replicate the career path of Michael Keane let alone be first team players here.

1524~~~
They are both better than Keane IMO. I guess time will tell

1525~~~
The fact that it's been left speaks volumes. Both him and Blackett are only in the position due to circumstance and imo not because of their ability.

1526~~~
I don't know how McNair can't have a future here, he's done extremely well for a kid thrown in the deep end at times.

1527~~~
Players are judged far to quickly these days. Unfortunately critics voices tend to be the loudest and most unforgiving, I'd imagine it's only a small minority of United fan with the large majority realising that young players need time to develop.
If a player makes one or two mistakes then suddenly they're not United quality, not what we need or should be sold or loaned to Hull or QPR. I wonder how many fans would have got rid of Vidic and Evra 6 months after they joined? 
Unless a player is being praised in the media as being the next Rio or Vidic, or play for Real Madrid, Barcelona or Munich then they are written off before they've been given a chance. The same has happened to Wilson this season.

1528~~~
Same with every fan base of every club.Bale,Kane and Bentaleb were written off by many Spurs fan in their tender ages for example

1529~~~
There's absol nothing wrong with having an opinion on a player and making predictions for those players on those opinions. 

I've seen enough of both players in both the reserves and first team football to be able to form that opinion. When it comes to the reserves there's been enough youth defenders to compare them to over the years and in terms of the first team there's been plenty of young defenders come through over the years to draw comparisons at similar ages. 

Neither of them stood out in the reserves and certainly not as centrebacks as neither you could call natural centrebacks. Blackett a left back convert and McNair a midfield convert. There were more natural and accomplished players that left ahead of them and there is far more natural and accomplished players coming through behind them. 

They are only getting game time this season because the stand out youngsters who was ahead of them in the pecking order earned a loan move and subsequent transfer away. On top of that, we've had unprecedented injuries that has seen almost all our centrebacks injured for long periods. 

It's currently:

Smalling
Rojo
Jones
Evans
Blind
Blackett/McNair

When you see how many players are ahead of them written down like that you realise how crazy it is that they have been called upon at all. 

It will have done their career prospects the world of good playing this season but they won't make it here long term. We're going to invest in the summer and strengthen to a point that they won't be needed again and contract talks will have touched upon this. With the 3 we have coming through in the u18s, by the time these two have had their loans and come back they will be even further behind. 

I'll be surprised if they sign contracts, they may well feel that it'll do them better long term to continue their education with us and being sent on loan but I put money on neither of them being here past their 23rd birthday.

1530~~~
Of course everyone is entitled to an opinion, I didn't say otherwise. My point is many of today's fans are impatient and want instant results and top class performances straight away, even from youth team  or new players, hence why I used Vidic and Evra as examples to how wrong fans can be some times. There are plenty more examples out there, <a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> gave another three good examples of players who have been written off before they began.
McNair is 19, Blackett is 20, a lot can happen is 18-24 months in a players development, especially when they are training and playing with the first team, therefore it's far to early to write them off IMO.

1531~~~
Players can drastically improve but the point there is nothing particularly special about McNair or Blackett, they are no better or worse than dozens of players we have produced who are earning a living in the championship or the premier league but they have been given a chance due to circumstance and a formation that requires three centre halves. The problem they will both have is they won't play as often (injuries permitting) if they are here next year or they will go out on loan and that doesn't always work out very well.

1532~~~
Of course, but it doesn't change the reality that it's far to early to judge them. If in one of two years they haven't managed to move forward in terms of appearances, experience and reliability then it would be easier to form a balanced and fair opinion on their future prospects.

1533~~~
It's not to early at this point neither is anything special, neither of the are bad players either but around and you will players of a similar age who are much better, they might improve they might not, neither were exceptional in the reserves and odds are neither will make it. would be more of a shock to see one or both of them playing in the first team in two or three years time than to see them in the championship. The balanced and fair opinion is that like most of the players in the academy they won't have a future here because they are trying to get into a team that wants to win trophies and opportunities will be limited unless you are exceptional which they aren't.

1534~~~
Quality performance so far today at right back. Sure it's against lower level opposition, but it's still been impressive.

1535~~~
Great so far, what has happened?

1536~~~
He is literally everywhere.

1537~~~
Could be that he's more comfortable as a RB? Would be insanely fortunate if that's the case, considering our problems at RB.

1538~~~
I swear, he's controlling this game. Mental to see. I know its only Cambridge, but that makes no difference. Many players hide away in games like this. He's totally stepped up tonight. Could see him playing more at right back this season.

1539~~~
Top lad is Paddy.
Shame he looks like an extra from Emmerdale though

1540~~~
What is going on!<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's on fire!

1541~~~
Playing very well, so much better than Valencia.

1542~~~
Charging runs, a thunderous shot, excellent movement, and he got it to the byline with some close control and won a corner.

1543~~~
He's not a right back but he's doing a fine job there today.

1544~~~
Superb tonight 

Confidence and hunger - our best RB performance this season by a mile (league 2 I know)

1545~~~
Has looked far far better at RB than he did at CB. Looks completely at ease.

1546~~~
I know he was signed as a midfielder, but has he ever played RB for the youth sides or for the reserves?  Looks very comfortable there.  Its nice when a RB is playing that knows he can do more than just pass to the RW or put in a cross.

1547~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1548~~~
He's got a future here this lad.. very impressive.

1549~~~
Easily MOTM so far.

1550~~~
He's on fire today, great to see!

1551~~~
Good half

Impressive first season for him in fairness. Only one bad performance really

1552~~~
Roberto McNairlos

1553~~~
Wholeheartedly agree. Excellent first half.

1554~~~
That was a Rafael-esque performance.

1555~~~
Top half that. Really liking his passing. 

Who needs a RB when we got Paddy ay <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1556~~~
Played RB for the reserves last week and scored. Can't say I remember him playing there any other time.

1557~~~
Could this be a discovery of his new future position ?

1558~~~
Fantastic 1st half from him, which is doubly impressive given his youth and experience. MOTM so far.

1559~~~
Fantastic performance so far. He might be the RB we're looking for, if we're lucky.

1560~~~
It's only Cambridge but he's done very well today. Also looked pretty good at RB vs Liverpool U21s.

1561~~~
I like the lad, but let's remember the opposition he's up against!
But thus is good for his confidence if nothing else.

1562~~~
Granted, he hasn't really been challenged on the wing, but it has been a very good performance thus far and he looks so much more comfortable as a RB compared to CB.

1563~~~
People saying he's not a RB yet he's only 19 and started out as a CM not a CB, basically he could be getting Schweini'd here as he looks excellent at RB and did well there the other time he played the role when both out fullbacks got hurt.

1564~~~
Paddy Neville is good at RB.

1565~~~
Interesting that LVG has used him as a right back primarily over the last month.

Maybe he sees this as his future position.

1566~~~
His technique is too good to play CB. Comfortable on the ball while running and linking well with team mates. Rafael-esque performance (attacking-wise).

1567~~~
Similar to Jones and Smalling impresseing at right back early on. I still think he is a centre back though

1568~~~
hehe its worth reading some of the absolute nonsense spouted in this thread a couple of months ago. Tards gona tard

1569~~~
But also tonight he is the 2nd coming  of Christ

No god  damn middle ground

1570~~~
I don't remember them ever looking that comfortable on the ball, even against lesser opposition. Plus McNair was originally a midfielder. Can't really make conclusions based on only one game though of course!

1571~~~
For me this is just a little more proof that he could be a decent ball playing CB for us. He can pass well enough. I don't see him as a permanent RB.

1572~~~
This is why Im not going to get carried away. Also O Shea all those years ago.

1573~~~
I do and I remember Jones tearing up the league at right back for a spell

1574~~~
Fair enough <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1575~~~
Yep true! But its the potential that's there that pleases me most. The lad is only playing as a defender for about 12/18 months (?). People choosing to ignore that and write him off is laughable.

Dont think he'll be a full back long term either but who knows given the progression we've seen to date.

1576~~~
I take it back, I much prefer going overboard about a player than the usual shite

I've been guilty of it many times

1577~~~
McNair = the new Cafu? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1578~~~
Coleman in disguise?

1579~~~
That's right full sorted for the next 15 years. Well done Paddy.

1580~~~
He Dani Alves'd that right flank today.

1581~~~
He was a right terror down that side, great to see.

1582~~~
Great game at RB.

1583~~~
Top quality tonight, didn't think he was that fast!

1584~~~
Surprised at his speed today as he looked quite fast, but in other matches, at CB, he has looked a little sluggish. Excellent on the ball, terrific technique and made Rooney look like a pub player on the same side at times.

1585~~~
MOTM for me. Hope he can continue this good run.

1586~~~
Showed his attacking pedigree tonight. Little to do in defence but my MOTM.

1587~~~
He was absolutely everywhere tonight. Great performance. Really happy for him.

1588~~~
Yeah really convinced me as a right FB. He at least had the guts to get forward and I think he should get a shot there for a few games and see if he can done this well in the PL against good opponents as well.

1589~~~
Can we now end the debate on who's better out of him or Blackett?

1590~~~
Great crosses, passes, pass selection, first touch and good in tight areas under pressure. All round excellent today. MOTM.

1591~~~
This. Will be interesting to see if LVG gives him a chance there, and even more interesting to see how he performs if so.

1592~~~
Smashed it.

1593~~~
Probably grabbed that spot for a while. Here's hoping he takes the opportunity!

My MOTM, promising performance, even against a lower side that was still great.

1594~~~
I think he started RB in a reserve game last week(Scored as well). So it something the club have been thinking about.

1595~~~
Fantastic talent. He played very well at right back against Liverpool reserves the other day as well I thought.

1596~~~
Great performance from Paddy tonight. He was excellent. Seems he picked up from where he left off when he occupied the right back spot against Liverpool for the U21's.

1597~~~
He looked good in this position against Liverpool U21s. He looks so slow at centre back in the Premier League. I wouldn't get to excited yet, it could all be about levels. Let's see how he performs in this position in the league.

1598~~~
Pleased with him again tonight. I can see him really making it with us - I think the last time I thought that about one of young defenders, it was Wes Brown. Stay fit, Paddy!

1599~~~
Yea, it was Cambridge, but please let that be enough to start him over Valencia for a while.

1600~~~
He's got technique too.

1601~~~
Tonight was the best game I have seen from McNair for sure. It is hard to judge him versus Valencia/Rafael due to the calibre of the opponent, but he got forward well and his crossing was decent, and it was the attacking part of his game which I had questions about before kickoff, as we already knew that he could defend fairly well.

I still wouldnt trust him against a decent quality winger, but as I said, definitely his best game for us and something to think about.

1602~~~
His first touch was flawless. He's a proper footballer. Weird the way he looked so composed and comfortable in possession tonight, yet has looked quite nervy in central defence.

1603~~~
I reckon he has solidified his place at right back in United's all time greatest XI.

1604~~~
Top game tonight. Just hope he hasn't found his level I.e. Cambridge

1605~~~
Needs to learn when to make run if he wants to play there but he is young enough and can adapt. Rafa would tear them apart on the right side if he started. BUt in the end it was a very good performance. Shame he didn't get on the scoresheet. I think he can actually be for us someone like Chambers for Arsenal. We can use him here and there. He is very good on the ball doesn't panic at any time always plays with his head up. I also liked how he wanted to get the ball all the time waving at his team mates on the other side to pass him the ball. He has got potential..

1606~~~
Has the Gary Neville's about him. As outlined elsewhere he was very comfortable and very positive going forward. Would be interested to see him play there again.

1607~~~
I didn't get the see the match but all the comments are very positive, sure it was against a lower opposition but you have to start somewhere. 

Would be a dream if he turned out to be quality, him and Shaw would keep us sorted at full back for 12-15 years!

1608~~~
Very good performance from the lad. He could have been slightly more adventurous with the ball at his feet (a couple of times he had the chance to really drive inside/into the box, but opted against it) but I suppose he's not the most natural dribbler in the world, so it's a very minor criticism. Did really well getting up the line and was generally taking up decent positions in which to receive the ball.

1609~~~
Looked a good 90 min from him at rb for the 1st time. But then so did Phil Jones, got 2 assists if I remember correctly vs Bolton

1610~~~
What an outstanding performance from the baby-faced, 19 year old Northern Irishman!

I really wouldn't concern myself with procuring a right back this summer.  True, his performance tonight was only against a lowly midtable fourth division club but the boy looked magisterial out there tonight.  We've got three competent right backs, the third being Valencia, to handle whatever opponents we're going to see over the next 18 months or so.  Focus on a top rampaging central midfielder, not a central back and we're good enough to compete for the prem trophy next season.

Unless we buy the German national team, we're not going to be good enough to compete with Real Madrid for the CL.

1611~~~
I don't know. Do we really have to put down one young player because another one played well?

1612~~~
Decent performance, was shitting myself when I saw LVG placed him at RB but he was solid and actually linked up well with Rooney !

1613~~~
Impressive. Doesn't really suit wide positions, but he showed why he was as much a DM as a CB for the youth sides. Good passer and very tidy on the ball.

No real defensive test today, of course.

1614~~~
To be fair Valencia played agaisnt this exact opposition less than a fortnight ago and was one of the worst on the pitch for us <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/> You could technically use that to compare Paddy's performance tonight.

1615~~~
I don't think he's good enough to make it as first choice long term in any position but tonight showed that he may have a role as a utility man in the future. The new John O'Shea?

1616~~~
In a way, you are given bit more freedom with the ball in wide areas such as fullbacks. In CB, you cant afford to lose possession far too many times.

1617~~~
The bolded was the thing that impressed me the most about him, I am not sure why some have decided he can't become our RB after that performance, maybe he wont but he did enough to get more chances to convince LvG he can.

1618~~~
Was a quality performance from him tonight. Not sure he has the tools to be a RB in the long run as he doesn't really have that attacking prowess, but maybe he will develop that with time.

What I did like was his quality on the ball, he was so assured threading that ball around. I'd prefer to see that moulded into a top centreback, but he just needs to get the experience and physicality to be more dominant there. For now, he looks like he'd be more than able as a RB whilst he develops.

1619~~~
Cambridge are fecking shit, but it was a good performance anyway. Still very young and has shown some maturity to his game.

1620~~~
McNair can cross the ball. He is infinitely better than Valencia already, even if it was only Cambridge.

1621~~~
This was even a debate?

1622~~~
Im not going to defend the original Cambridge match because it was a very poor show and I agree, but the tactics were different and with Fellaini up top, McNair at least had someone to aim for in the box. Also due to it being 4-4-2 tonight, McNair was able to make overlapping runs and <i>attack the space</i>.

1623~~~
We played 442 against Cambridge. With fellaini up top it wouldn't matter to valencia as he would still cross it into the full back's shins <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1624~~~
Very good showing tonight, I was pleased for him.  The real test will be how he fares in 1 v. 1s (I don't see any evidence that he's good in those) but he looks a hell of a lot more composed than some of our other backs and has a pretty decent cross.  Interesting that he played RB against Yeovil and wasn't all that bad, either.

1625~~~
Blackett is a championship player and that will be his level.

1626~~~
He looked good at right back, in my opinion, because he was essentially playing in midfield for most of the match. I think he may just be a better midfielder than defender, even though he doesn't play there for the reserves anymore.

1627~~~
Isn't that the "Alaba" role that people were raving about?

1628~~~
Unfortunately I don't think we have the midfield to dominate the way Bayern do, in order to make it work consistently. Also Paddy isn't David Alaba.

1629~~~
Had a very good game but doesn't offer what Rafael does there. Could have hurt them so much more, especially when Rooney was in possession. But at the end of the day, he had a very good game.

1630~~~
I really liked McNair's decision-making as a right back. He always made the right choices, and the passes he played were very good. Some of the passes he played as a right back were top notch, particularly his passes into the middle, which were quick and allowed us to play at a fast tempo. His lack of dribbling did show up, but then again, he isn't a wing back, so I wouldn't expect him to be a dribbler. Still, though, it was great seeing him get double-teamed by the Cambridge players. McNair, of all people, being double-teamed! His crossing was also decent for a central defensive player, and it helped us that he could actually deliver telling balls into the box for others to attack. I also really like how he just doesn't look for a cross and, instead, considers and pursues other options.

His passing choices indicate that there is some promise of him becoming a good ball-playing defender. Plus, his movement and positions were also quite good. McNair never played out wide, and the last two times he's played as a right back, he's performed quite well. Now, that doesn't mean that he is a definite right back, but at least we now know that he is a promising ball-playing defender and that the period where his performances were nervous and shaky were just a blip.

1631~~~
Could this be our new O'Shea - he can play as a DM, as a RB and as a central defender. If we only can get him in goal as well - we might be there!

1632~~~
He just needs to nutmeg Ronaldo, lob a keeper from outside the penalty, and win us the game at the death against Liverpool to become O'Shea's spiritual successor.

1633~~~
He is a fantastic prospect. His rise has been phenomenal as well. From very recently joining academy, primarily as midfielder and then doing admirably as CB in PL to RB, he has shown versatility and good technique in all roles.

1634~~~
You can see that LvG has identified his abilities as a footballer and why he has put some faith in him ahead of Blackett for example, despite a fair few ropey games. I think LvG could be the perfect manager for his development.

1635~~~
He's actually not that bad on the ball, that powerful, I would have loved it not to be blocked.

1636~~~
Lad can pass the ball eh? Very composed on the ball.

1637~~~
Better rb than a cb it looks like. I'd written him off as a nobody but his performances in the Liverpool under 21 game and last night show there's hope yet.

1638~~~
I loved the way he kept calling for the ball, time and time again I saw him with his arms in the air asking for the ball. That's the type of attitude I love to see in a young player.

1639~~~
Would be very interesting to see how he would do given a run at RB.

1640~~~
Very good performance, his best of the season no doubt. He's very comfortable on the ball which is no surprise considering he used to play as a holding midfielder. Would rather not see him at centre back again this season as he is simply not ready for that position, but based on yesterday's performance certainly has a place in the squad covering right back seeing as Rafael seems to have disappeared

1641~~~
It was only against Cambridge but he did very well. I was surprised at how well he did at RB, also when he went forward.

1642~~~
If he gets a few more games at right back against better opposition and maintains that level of performance I think Rafael and Valencia are in trouble. Never realised he was quick.

1643~~~
He has looked very slow in the Premier League where the players are faster, though perhaps he is just especially slow on the turn at centre back.

It is all about levels. The U21s and League Two are the lowest levels in the professional game. He still has it all to prove in that position.

1644~~~
I also thought he looked really composed when he came on against Leicester. And he showed promise earlier in the season, there was one game (can't remember against who) where he made an unbelievable clearance with a diving header. Last night showed that he's improving all the time.

Really impressed with the lad. Great touch, good awareness and always willing to go forward. Love the fact that he keeps moving when he makes a pass, takes opponents with him and frees up space.

1645~~~
Actually I'm not so sure the difference in speed between divisions is quite as big as you think. For me technique and movement/tactical awareness are bigger factors. Its not that I'm saying he's close to being first choice there, I mean we're likely to buy a RB in the summer and if McNair can be good enough as back up then Valencia and Rafael might be on the way out.

1646~~~
That was his PL debut, against West Ham. Played a blinder that day.

1647~~~
Not so long ago in this thread people were questioning his ability on the ball. its weird what people see sometimes. It was that ability on the ball and his late conversion to a defender that make him a far more interesting and promising prospect than Blackett.

Im actually looking forward to seeing him in the DM role at some point. Not convinced RB is his position long term but I think we can safely say we wont see Smalling out there ever again, thank fu*k.

1648~~~
People see what they want to see.

1649~~~
Running forward with the ball in the right back position is a very different "ability on the ball" than having the ball at you feet at centreback with a premiership striker barring down on you.

1650~~~
Very true, what did you think of his passing last night? He started the move for the first goal with a pretty technical pass I thought....

1651~~~
The pass into Mata wasn't the "easiest" or first available pass, but definitely the best. He impressed me I must admit, even his running was better than I expected. I suppose he didn't have much tracking to do, so most of his energy was going forward but he looked more effective than Jones or Smalling there IMO.

1652~~~
I was suprised how fast he is. And he was always on the move or demanding a ball. When he receved a ball and passed it he always moved to make himself available again. One of the best attacking performances from WB i have seen this season.

1653~~~
Other times he's played RB he's looked like a CB playing there, not yesterday, thought he looked good. 

Only found out recently that he signed for us as a Striker. So he should have decent feet and an attacking mentality.

1654~~~
As good as he was at right back we must bear in mind that up was up against Luke Chadwick who wasn't the quickest even when he was young. Played excellent regardless.

1655~~~
While that's true, his passing and movement isn't effected by anybody else. His choice of pass was the thing that impressed me the most.

1656~~~
chadwick was rapid when he first break into our first team. then his hamstring kind of gave him away, or any other injury but before that he was very quick.

1657~~~
tbf either rafael or valencia would have trashed them yesterday, they had no clue how to defend the wide spaces on much bigger pitch. And that was their problem they worked hard and well as a unit but struggle to cover the space. McNair did his best to get them in trouble

1658~~~

1659~~~
Good news. I was saying a few weeks ago that we'll probably get rid of him and Blackett as I haven't seen anything special but I may have been wrong about Sir Paddy of McNair.

1660~~~
Although prob should've started a new thread for this.

1661~~~
Hopefully yesterday's game is a start of something and not his Alex Buttner moment. We could direly use a right back of that quality. You could see in the Leicester game that Van Gaal was intending to use him as a right back so the signs are probably there.

1662~~~
Good news. He could really have a future here imo.

1663~~~
Excellent news, I imagine his versatility as well as ability on the ball appeals to LvG.

1664~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/van-gaal-battle-will-go-on-30954415.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/van-gaal-battle-will-go-on-30954415.html</a>

1665~~~
A few people have mentioned John O'Shea which I think is an apt comparison here, having a player with that kind of versatility is always going to be positive, especially for a manager like LVG who tinkers with the formation constantly and probably explains why he was elevated above the likes of Keane & Thorpe. Hopefully we'll be back in the CL next season which will mean more football for the squad players.

We'll still sign a RB in the summer though. Sorry, Paddy.

1666~~~
McNair vs Cambridge, 1st half

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8go9ExDj8uw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1667~~~
i voted for him for MOTM v cambridge thinking "well he'll get one vote f it" to seeing he had over 60% of the vote. he was well composed on the ball.

1668~~~
Strange conclusion considering he was excellent on his debut against West Ham, followed it up with some decent performances as well I thought.

1669~~~
He had a few games where he looked really slow and sluggish, maybe the Saints game just took the confidence completely out of him.

1670~~~
Yup, his last 2-3 games weren't great with the exception of his last performance against Cambridge of course. That was to be expected for a young lad playing at this level though.

1671~~~
A few weeks ago I wasnt convinced by him and thought he would probably be sold to end up in a mid-table PL side. Whilst one performance doesnt prove anything, and the opposition were of a lower quality than we normally face, McNair did very well and was my MotM as well. He certainly hasnt done himself any harm with that game and I am happy to at least give him some more time to show what he can do.

1672~~~
Yeah I agree completely. Rafael is always injured and Valencia isnt good enough at defending though, so if we get a new RB in next summer, McNair would seem a more suitabke back up than those two if he can show some good form in that position

1673~~~
He offers distribution and can play midfield ?

Sign him.

1674~~~
It is a huge difference.  Explosive pace and power.  Not many athletes like Bale and Ronaldo in Ligue 2.  Obviousley thats cherry picking examples but most players in the premier league are athletes.  Look at the pace and physiques of even Nani and Valencia.

1675~~~
No there isn't a huge difference. There are plenty of players in the lower leagues with the same pace and power as Bale and Ronaldo, it is that they do not have the technical football skills like the two of them to take advantage of their pace and power to the same degree. Again, lower league players are professional footballers, they train and workout everyday just like premier league players. They are athletes and also have great physiques.

1676~~~
Disagree.
Name me a couple of 6 foot units that are built like brick shit houses that run like kanchelskis??

1677~~~
He was immense against Cambridge.

He had more touches and more passes than anyone else in the team. And he did it from rightback!

It's usually Blind/Carrick who top those stats (or if we're playing really badly, one of the CBs). It speaks volumes that McNair managed it from the least glamourous position on the pitch and in the midst of such illustrious company.

90 passes and 93.3% passing accuracy. Those are Xavi numbers. Nobody else in the side came close to matching him on the day. The kid has a lot of potential.

1678~~~
I once made a comparison with him being our chambers but I guess the better would be our Eric Dier, in terms of where he play, he is center back but quite young to start there, not dominant enough and mistake prone, so is shifted wide to gain confidence and actually can do the job. Future is bright for Paddy but we will see where he ends up as he seems to have skills to play all defensive positions, I think Van Gaal may experiment a bit with him playing as DM as he experiments with almost every player. Anyway I think he will spend playing RB most of the time where he gain that confidence if our center backs are fit. He wasn't really looking sure at CB for me so far..

1679~~~
<i>Really slow and sluggish </i>is an exaggeration. He's been beaten for pace once or twice by quick players but that's down to inexperience as much as anything else. He might be average-paced but he's not slow.

1680~~~
Impressive stuff. I would say this performance was closer to Rafael than Jones/Smalling at right back.

Very good decision making, quality on the ball (even when running, much much better than Phil or Chris), passing, crossing! Deserves a chance at RB, if Valencia managed to learn how to play the defensive part of the game in this position then so can he. And he already looks more threatening than him. 

Quite interesting what next for him. Another gleam of hope.

1681~~~
This is pretty much my take on him so far. Doesn't convince me at all at CB but he's recent performances at RB(He was very good at RB in a recent reserve game as well as the Cambridge game)give me hope that he's got a chance here.

1682~~~
I'd be pretty damn surprised if he has the quicks to play fullback. You look at the best teams in the world and the slowest starting fullback is Ivanovic, and he's actually pretty quick and powerful once he gets going. I guess Lahm is slowing down too, but he's so good on the ball it's criminal. Alaba, Bernat, Felipe Luis, Azpilicueta, Zabaleta, Clichy, Alves, Alba, Carvajal, Marcelo and the others are all quick enough to threaten on the overlap. 

He's very good on the ball, though, so hopefully he can be a CB here. Definitely an intriguing prospect.

1683~~~
Thought he was injured when I saw this thread bumped

1684~~~
Watching this again confirms the impression I had during the game that he played wider and much more like a conventional full back in the second half, or maybe it was after the substitutions. In the first half, even though Rooney was in CM in a notional narrow diamond, he was often on the touchline, with McNair inside attacking down the right channel rather than overlapping beyond their fullback. A few times in the first half, McNair also ran from out to in. I think it's this positioning that led to him being so involved in the game. Perhaps LVG has been playing FM this year, with the new 'inverted wingback' role?

1685~~~
Nah I dont agree. There are players in the lower divisions who are where they are cos they're quick and strong but not so technical, it's a very physical division and no so technical. If you watch Goals on Sunday/Football League Show quite a lot of goals seem to come from a pong ball over the defence and a striker sprinting onto it.

1686~~~
Pleased for him with his new deal. He's proved me wrong on that front, I'll be interested in seeing what sort of near and mid term future he has with us now. I expect us to buy two right backs and two centrebacks in the summer so he'll either get a premiership loan or stay as 5th choice.

1687~~~
Edit - 

<b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Managers/Louis-van-Gaal.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis van Gaal</a> has heaped praise on young defender <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Paddy-McNair.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Paddy McNair</a>, claiming the talented Northern Irishman could become Manchester United's first-choice right-back for a decade.</b>

McNair came through the club's youth ranks as a central midfielder but eventually moved back into central defence, a position in which he made an accomplished senior debut during this season’s 2-0 win over West Ham United at Old Trafford.

Adding a further string to his bow, the 19-year-old played a full match at right-back during the midweek win over Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth-round and was even voted Man of the Match by Reds supporters on the club’s <b><a class="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/manchesterunited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Facebook page</a></b>.

As van Gaal told <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a></b> on Friday, the Reds' no.33 is one of many youngsters with a bright future ahead.
As for McNair himself, the youngster has explained how his experience as a centre-back helped him in terms of positioning during his outing at full-back in Tuesday’s comfortable 3-0 win over Cambridge at Old Trafford.

1688~~~
Wow really? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> In what context?

1689~~~
I was going to say that a single good performance at RB does not a career make, but then, McNair now has one more great RB performance than Valencia...

1690~~~
He played well for one game at RB against much much lower opposition. 

At this stage, saying this is just as ridiculous as calling Phil Jones the new Duncan Edwards.

1691~~~
Unless perhaps he's been insanely good in training at RB? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Besides, hyperbole is better than "we'll try to do our best at making ourselves difficult to beat". <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1692~~~
That quote doesn't bode well for Rafael. Gutting <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1693~~~
May the best player win.

1694~~~
If he performs better than McNair then he'll play. If not, then McNair shall play.

1695~~~
I'd say that staying fit for longer than a month would be a good thing to begin with.

I still hope we sign a proper RB in the summer though, don't mind Paddy being number two.

1696~~~
It certainly would!

1697~~~
Could we not just have Mcnair, and Rafael fighting it out for the no 1 spot, with the loser been a perfectly good backup when the main man is injured.

Would save us around £25 million too on either Coleman, or Clyne.

1698~~~
Paddy will be immense.

1699~~~
Hadn't realised he had signed a new contract, good news, wonder if Blackett has too even if it's just for potential sale value.

1700~~~
Rooney looked silly positioned on the right last game but he did give a lot of support to McNair, so that tactic wasn't as off the wall as it first seemed.

I do thing LVG's quote doesn't bode well for Rafael.  He might be encouraging competition between the two RBs but if McNair keeps improving (a very big if), it's a battle that Rafael would likely lose due to his poor injury history.  I think his time at United is limited, regardless.

1701~~~
Rafael will go. Can't stay fit. Van Gaal doesn't want a huge squad and can't afford people like Rafa in it.

1702~~~
And he doesn't have Adriano versatility, Guardiola also wanted a little team at Barcelona but he found the place for Adriano because he was able to cover 4 or 5 positions.

1703~~~
Safe to say the Gaffers a fan, then. He seems to have his favourites, so good news for Paddy.

1704~~~
Out of interest, has McNair played many times at right back for the reserves? I saw he played right back against Liverpool, so I wondered how many other times he'd featured at right back.

1705~~~
To be fair, he did play Badstuber at left back frequently, even with a proper left back in Contento in the team and a converted wing back in Pranjic.

I'd take this comment about McNair with a pinch of salt at the moment. I think he's more suited to playing in the middle rather than out wide as he's rarely, if ever, played in a wider position for much of his time at the U-21/U-18's. Plus, as a full back, McNair comes into the middle more often than any other full back for us, indicating that he doesn't really play as a proper full back who would stay wide and provide width.

1706~~~
He won't be our future right back. Nice from Van Gaal to big him up but it isn't going to happen. I've been really impressed with him so far but to be honest, he isn't going to be more than a back up option when we splash the cash on defenders in the summer.

1707~~~
I dont think Mcnair comes close to the amount of talent Rafael has as a RB. Rafael has the abitity to be one of the best modern RB in the world.

Its just a shame Rafael cant stay fit.

1708~~~
Don't know if he will be a good RB over time but he certainly pulled his best Dani Alves impression he was fantastic against Cambridge.

1709~~~
Rafael is United's Lucas Leiva <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.  The less he plays the more "world  class"  He becomes.  I probably gonna get flamed for this but the overating of Rafael kinda gets a bit over the top sometimes.

1710~~~
To be honest, he is one of the most criticized players at United. 90% of fans are screaming for a new RB, even two.

1711~~~
I think they are screaming because of his injury record and not because of his ability. He's a fan favourite, a tenacious fellow and it's hard not to like him as he gives is all which is all you can ask. I just think his actually ability is a bit overstated at times

1712~~~
I think most of his admirers (like myself) point to that 12/13 season to prove that he has that ability and that with a fit Rafael, there is no need for serious investment in that area, especially with Valencia there.

1713~~~
I think most (if not everyone) would agree.  When the two players are compared on natural talent alone, Rafa is by far the best.  But staying fit is also something of a talent here at United.

1714~~~
Has McNair played at right back for at youth level for any prolonged period? Or is he totally new to it?

He used to be a midfielder right? I guess that would help in terms of his technique on the ball and going forward if LVG see his long term position as a right back.

1715~~~
I believe he was originally a striker, although most elite level players were.

1716~~~
I've never heard of him being a striker, he was signed as an attacking midfielder and was converted into a CB in the u18s.

1717~~~
Sorry if I am mistaken.

1718~~~
When did he sign a new contract and for how long?

1719~~~
I think it's the other way around. When he plays you remember just how much he gives us going forward down the right hand side. He mostly gets criticised for his injury record which is fair enough and the complete myth that he is still overly rash defensively.

1720~~~
Agreed, I have never seen a RB have such an impact on a team, he immediately makes us a better, much more balanced side.

1721~~~
Rafael has such an impact on us, you could almost always see how much more dangerous we are with him.

1722~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/02/06/louis-van-gaal-claims-manchester-united-starlet-will-become-the-new-gary-neville/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/0...ted-starlet-will-become-the-new-gary-neville/</a>

1723~~~
I hope to see a good performance from him later on today, whether it be RB or not.

1724~~~
Very high praise indeed from van Gaal in the media about this lad.

1725~~~
Given that LVG rarely praises players he really must see something in him.

1726~~~
Start him today at RB and lets see if he can handle West Ham.

1727~~~
If he can keep this up at RB he'll have a future here. Our right backs are terrible.

1728~~~
It would be brilliant if McNair could cement the RB spot for himself. A homegrown talent and then no need to buy a new RB. Hopefully he plays there against West Ham today to see how he gets on.

1729~~~
Getting a little bit carried away after a good performance against a dire league two side.

Today we'll see if he is good enough against tougher opposition.

1730~~~
He looks a bit like Shaemus Coleman too..

1731~~~
A very Irish way to spell it how you say it.

1732~~~
Nothing would be better than this! However, Cambridge were beyond shite at OT but I'm still excited to see how he gets on against better teams.

1733~~~
2 minutes since the club posted it on Facebook and here it is! I'll never be quick enough to break any news here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Lovely news though.

1734~~~
Don't we normally give young players longer deals? Is this just a reflection of how quickly it has happened, or could it be a new policy?

1735~~~
Having a decent game. Really is good on the ball.

1736~~~
Struggled in tight spaces for me personally but he is young. I like his passing.

1737~~~
Once Herrera came on and gave him a hand against Kightly he improved.

1738~~~
Got a right foot like a traction engine. Can't wait to see one of those thunderbastards hit the back of the net.

1739~~~
I thought he did pretty well today. One of our better players.

1740~~~
He's pretty good on the ball.

But struggled defensively first half with the diamond. 2nd he was good defensively and got sm crucial headers too in a 4-4-2 when Di Maria was also helping out.

1741~~~
Thought he was ok. Nothing special. More composed than the rest of the cnuts back there though.

1742~~~
An upgrade on Valencia.

1743~~~
Thought he was awful in the first half. I can't believe LVG favours him over Rafael. I've yet to see that he has the potential to make it here. His only really good game came against a League 2 side.

1744~~~
He's not really that good at right back.

1745~~~
His best game was probably against West Ham. That game against a league 2 side just happens to be his only other game as a RB.

1746~~~
Cambridge was still his best game for me, regardless of where he played. But you're right, he was pretty good against West Ham as well. Today wasn't impressive for me, Kightly had him in his pocket in the first half.

1747~~~
Clear that he's better in a position where he doesn't have to be as careful with his passing as a central defender does. Set up a lot of good attacks with some fairly risky passes I could never see Valencia making.

1748~~~
Thought he had a decent to good game(Highlight been the pass to Di Maria in the Burnley box).

1749~~~
Well some questioned if he could play RB against better opposition and tonight it didn't look like he had the pace for it. I love the accuracy of his delivery but the fullback position requires pace more than ever these days. Oddly enough I think he could make a decent DM.

1750~~~
What impresses me the most is his passing. Plays the right ball at the right pace - and more positive than all our defenders.

1751~~~
Can't fault him for effort, but we would be so much better with a right back out there. Rafael, where are you <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1752~~~
He's a CB, and he could be a very good one. Shouid certainly be playing there ahead of Evans now.

1753~~~
Still needs to learn when to move forward but his passing is really good

1754~~~
In the squad again and we're winning. Still raw but he's aware what tempo we should play to create something.

His football education started promising but still some long road ahead.

1755~~~
I agree, he lacks any speed needed at RB he doesn't need that much of strength there but he struggle with it today little bit too, also his work with the ball is overrated, he's had a good shot and looks like he likes to pass the ball which is one of his biggest assets, passing the ball with his head up. He just needs to get muscles.. wonder if he could handle defensive midfielder role, he couldn't do much worse than rooney.. but the muscles are really needed he is very week kid..

Rafael back to the first team asap..

1756~~~
Don't think he's good enough isolated in one-on-one's against wingers to be a great right back. He's really good on the ball though.

1757~~~
I like the look of this kid, whether it will be RB or RCB I think he could have a good future here.

1758~~~
He plays.. we win.

1759~~~
He was decent at second half, but I'm not really convinced about him. Right back is better position for him at the moment given his inconsistency on ball. He wasn't particularly good defensively, losing tons of headers to Michael Kightly and looking quite slow at times.

1760~~~
He had a decent game tonight and it was nice to see him try a shot on goal from distance.

1761~~~
Defensively suspect in the first half but the whole defence was shambolic so not that worried. He is not there yet but he links up very well, offers some threat on the right side. Deserves another start IMO.


It seems van Gaal has given up on Rafael and he’s looking for other solutions. What is a sensible idea.

1762~~~
Did alright. Potential there to at least be a squad player.

1763~~~
I like his passing. Looks a threat going forward too.

1764~~~
Didn't look too out of place as a right back, it's clear he has too much technical ability to be deployed as a center back, this may well be his future position, he reminds me alot of Coleman.

It's nice to see a variation of passes from a fullback rather than the generic "Run byline, stutter, stutter, deliver a poor cross" from Valencia.

1765~~~
I think he'll be a very good defensive mid, which is likely where he plays for the U21s.

1766~~~
I can't say I recall him ever playing DM for the u21s. Think he could be good there though, hes a smart player and very good on the ball. Been very impressed with him stepping up to the first team. Just needs to get better at dealing with pacey attackers, should try drop off sooner to get the extra step on them and be able to block them off getting in behind or to jockey them wide.

1767~~~
Thought he looked very promising. I hope he's retained as our second choice (at least) right back next season.

His first touch is excellent and his passing is properly impressive. The kid never shies away from the ball. 

I know he's a very different kind of player to Evra, but there's a similar air of leadership from fullback about him. We used to build a lot of our attacks from the back through Paddy because he was so reliable and so willing to take on responsibility. I see that same willingness in McNair. I hope he can build on it.

1768~~~
Both him and Rojo were too far up the pitch in the first half and were getting found out. Burnley wingers/backs were able to put crosses in the box with considerable ease. 

I like McNair, he is good with the ball at his feet and can defend when in the right position. His lack of pace is what bothers me.

1769~~~
I thought he's shown some good moments of pace. Especially against Cambridge, getting forward he looked reasonably quick. I think his issue might be positioning and reacting to situations in an unfamiliar position more than anything.

1770~~~
He looks far better as a RB than he ever did as a CB. Pace might be an issue but there's definitely something to work with.

1771~~~
He was my MOTM last night by a country mile as energetic and positive as RVP was lazy and lacklustre. Head and shoulders above everyone else bar DDG. Great positioning, decent passing, good vision and he can cross it unlike "Shins" Valencia. This guy is a great find and warrants a starting place every game. Playing him with Evans might jeopardise his confidence and his career though.

1772~~~
Id love to see him in that role as well. Maybe a league cup match next season or something. I think it would really suit him...

1773~~~
Yeah, you can sense the wheels turning before he reacts sometimes, but that comes with playing time.

1774~~~
In his long career as a centre back you mean?

1775~~~
I think his most likely role in the first team is as a utility player in the John O’Shea mould, he doesn’t really possess the ability to be a top fullback, centre back or midfielder (unless there is dramatic improvement ) but he is good on the ball and has a good temperament so I think he is someone who could plug gaps in those positions.

1776~~~
Exactly what I meant.

1777~~~
Ditto. Wouldn't be too surprised to see him eventually end up in midfield.

1778~~~
Decent on the ball but I've yet to be impressed with any of his defending since the West Ham/Everton period.

1779~~~
The best thing about him and the thing which I think Van Gaal will be most impressed with is how quickly he learns and adapts to new roles and positions and his development over the past year has been fantastic. He's still growing as well which might explain to a degree why he sometimes looks a lot quicker than other times, the same happened with Welbeck around the same age. He's beginning to add some muscle to his frame now so he could be very powerful in a year or 2.

1780~~~
Looks pretty comfortable at RB for the most part. Good at passing to feet and isn't afraid to get up field. 

My only gripe with him from yesterday was that there was a point where he lost his man and the player ran in behind him off his back and almost got in on goal. But that just comes down to simple positional sense that he doesn't have yet as a RB. He'll be fine though. 

We potentially have a great RB option on our hands. Happy for the lad.

1781~~~
Does anyone know how tall McNair is? It's saying 1.72M on wiki and a lot of other sites, which is only 5ft7. Surely this isn't true.

1782~~~
Very ordinary player. Should never start ahead of Rafa and Valencia.

1783~~~
He is Bob Basic

1784~~~
He's a much better passer than either of them which given our style of play counts for a lot. Atrocious marking from corners today though.

1785~~~
I'd like to see a proper winger play ahead of him. Valencia or Young instead of Herrera would look better to me.

1786~~~
He misplaced a lot of passes in that half, despite only passing to the nearest man.  Don't think he's any better than them.

1787~~~
He should be more advanced when we have the ball, he is usually not there when we have space on the right.

1788~~~
He has been trash today, it happens... hope LVG brings on Valencia

1789~~~
Not having the best of games. Can't blame him as he probably has never played as a right back since the last month or so.

Makes you wonder whether Rafael would be the better choice? Mcnair is a fantastic prospect but Rafael is clearly more experienced and gives us a lot more pace and width on the right flank.

1790~~~
Yeah, poor game thus far.

1791~~~
Decent game for the young lad (nothing exceptional), thought he was ok. Like I said, this is a game where I think Valencia would be a better option.

1792~~~
He has no options in possession. We don't have a natural winger as Herrera is central and neither RVP/Rooney are running the channels. I don't think he's a future RB anyway but the set up of this team is terrible.

1793~~~
Mental decision to start him in a game like this. Utterly mental. LVG is an idiot.

1794~~~
Valencia's passing is rock solid so I wouldn't agree with that.

1795~~~
Thought that he was pretty awful in that half. I don't think that he got a single cross in because he isn't good enough to attack his full back. I mean he ran the ball out of play once. He was caught on his heals for passes from Hererra a couple of times and his marking from corners is far from good enough.

And he doesn't look pacey at this level at all.

1796~~~
He's a CB not a RB. I said that even after the Cambridge game. Valencia is far more suited to the role

1797~~~
It's stupid decision to start him. But this formation without a RM doesn't suit him. Atleast Shaw has Di Maria on the left.

1798~~~
Absolute nonsense. He's played nice, tidy passes into the feet of van Persie, Rooney and Fellaini rather than doing Valencia's usual thing of recycling the ball backwards to Blind or Herrera.

1799~~~
He lets the ball run across him too much and that stops him having a better angle for the pass or cross.

1800~~~
i agree. His forward passing is very good, risky but i like that more than passing the ball back a la Valencia.

1801~~~
either of whom? you have to have some kind of bias to claim he is a better passer than Rafael

1802~~~
Yeah, that's true, he did make some decent passes into the middle. He also made some not so decent passes to the opposition. I'm surprised you'd commend his passing, it's average at best.

1803~~~
He's a centre-back.

1804~~~
I don't understand Van Gaal's thinking here: he promotes Valencia ahead of an established RB for the majority of the season and fosters some improvement in the player, only then to exclude him in favour of a centre-back who has done a passable job against Football League opposition. If this is Louis' idea of rotation, it's falling short of the mark.

1805~~~
Utter crap. Hopefully he gets subbed for Valencia at HT

1806~~~
He's a far better passer than Valencia, but that's a given since Valencia is shite at passing. I wouldn't say he's a better passer than Rafael, and he's a much worse dribbler meaning that when Herrera doesn't move out wide he finds himself totally isolated, and not able to dribble his way out either.

1807~~~
I think Rafael's clearly the better right back and I'm not convinced McNair's good enough for us but I don't think Rafael's a better passer than him at all.

1808~~~
Clearly not a RB.

1809~~~
McNair a better passer? Rafael does the 'give and go' a lot, lot better than McNair.

1810~~~
Shouldn't be using hard away games for these experiments with young, unproven players. Valencia needs to come on. Solid defensively, and he'll offer a bit of pace going forward.

1811~~~
McNair can pull off the good pass often enough, but on a consistent basis in terms of passing and moving it isn't what you would expect from a right-back

1812~~~
I think he's better as a CB.

Still, it winds me up that if he plays badly, he's quickly dropped while RVP seems to get an infinite amount of chances to 'play his way out of form' or something.

Edit: That might have been a little off topic but I needed to complain somewhere. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1813~~~
Didn't see the game but was it necessary to take this guy off at half time? Looking at the subs we eventually did (taking off both fullbacks and Di Maria) could we have given the kid another chance and utilise the option to make a change better by bringing on one of Wilson or Falcao?(i know he hasn't shown it but we know he has a performance in him going by his reputation)

1814~~~
Stupid decision by the manager to start him, looked completely out of his depth and shouldn't be anywhere near the team unless there aren't other options.

1815~~~
Yes, he was pretty disastrous in the first half, and he shouldn't have started in such a hard away game. We played with no wingers and we really needed pace from outwide, and we didn't have that. Some passes which were played to him into space he couldn't get to quick enough and rolled out for throw ins. He had a couple of runs down the right which just rolled out for goal kicks. I've liked what I've seen of him at centre back, but I don't see him as a right back.

1816~~~
Tough game for him today but I don't think he has the pace to be a RB.

1817~~~
Bit odd to start sticking the 19 year old CB who played well in 2 games at RB (Liverpool U21s and Cambridge at home). Especially when we have Rafael available!

1818~~~
It wouldn't be LVG if he didn't have atleast one player in the lineup playing out of position.

1819~~~
Hauled off again early in a match. I've not seen the game yet but was he really as bad as Tony Cottee described? He said he was really struggling at right back and doesn't look comfortable in that position compared to when he plays as a centre half.

1820~~~
Doesn't have what it takes to beat his man, good at distributing the ball and is apt in his positioning which makes him a better centre back than right back. Even still, not good enough yet to be first choice. Should be third or forth in the pecking order.

1821~~~
He was really bad, yeah. He's just not a very good player. 

His new contract also proved that the club don't have that much faith in him. If we really believed in him, he would have gotten a longer contract.

1822~~~
He's not a right back, never played there, ever.

1823~~~
I still think he has potential as a holding midfielder once he develops a bit more physically.

1824~~~
LvG: *Adopts new formation so people can play in their best position

        *Plays half the team out of position anyway

1825~~~
I can't actually believe LVG started him in a PL away game, at right back, because of one good performance there against Cambridge City 

How can he justify that decision in any way?

1826~~~
When Fergie was playing Jones and Smalling there, it tended to be either a moderate hit or a moderate miss. I don't see enough upside to justify trying it again in anything more than an emergency

1827~~~
He wasn't awful awful, but he lacks pace and doesn't want to dribble with the ball enough to be a modern fullback. There was a point where he had loads of space to run into, instead he just turned back and passed inside. That's worse than Valencia!

1828~~~
That's what I thought. His inclusion should be saved for playing games like Hull or QPR at home. It was a tough away game in an important stage of the season. Valencia was fit, and Rafael is seemingly fit too, but not being included in the squad. It was an odd selection, and one that I don't think should have happened.

1829~~~
Possibly because he worked hard in training and showed Van Gaal what he was looking for. We only have access to players for 90 minutes, whereas LvG observes them every day.

1830~~~
I have no idea. Was confused when I saw the team selection. No idea why he was picked, especially in an away game against a decent team. Stupid decision.

1831~~~
So that's the second classy left-footed goal scored by a United right back in the last week.

1832~~~
He's in the NI squad....hopefully he plays this time.

1833~~~
Anyone watch his debut for NI tonight?

1834~~~
Thought he was pretty average. Anya got behind him a few times though, he's not a right back.

1835~~~
I was partially watching with the TV in the background... He's no RB that's for sure. He reminds me a lot of Chambers there. Very clunky and easy to bypass. Both are good enough on the ball and with space will find an apt pass, but pacey wingers seem to get the better too easily.

1836~~~
Did Evans and McCullough play at cb? How has McCullough been? I remember watching him play for our youth teams.

1837~~~
Evans was probably the best player for Norn till he was subbed. Not saying much but it was a half decent performance.

1838~~~
McNair became the 105th United youth player to make his international debut…some going that!

1839~~~
Thought he was fantastic. Best I have seen him play CB certainly

1840~~~
Absolutely terrific performance from McNair so far, I thought. Particularly given it's his first game in two months. He's got a good shout for being our best (and certainly most composed) CB on the ball.

1841~~~
Superb on the ball, very smooth for a CB, only made one error so far.

1842~~~
Can't ask for more from a teenage defender. Hopefully he keeps it up in the second half.

1843~~~
Very good. Passing is great.

1844~~~
Impressive stuff from him. Definitely the most natural on the ball out of all the defenders.

1845~~~
He's an odd one; he sometimes makes a great run forward, but then other times he has several good options to pass to then gets scared and goes back to DDG. Good half for someone who hasn't played in a while against the top team.

1846~~~
He started off as an attacking midfielder... so him being good on the ball isnt really that surprising. 
He looks more confident now.. and looks bigger too. Bulked up as the caf would say.

1847~~~
A very good performance from him so far he is so calm with the ball. I can see him being a big favorit or LVG in the future.

1848~~~
I'm impressed.

1849~~~
Very assured. Didn't look out of place once.

1850~~~
Impressive performance. Looks wise beyond his years.

1851~~~
Very, very impressive performance.

1852~~~
Impressive performance. Think LVG will turn him into a very good player.

1853~~~
Good performance from him particularly in the first half. 

Should start ahead of Jones if he plays like that week in week out

1854~~~
Should be proud of that and Smalling.

1855~~~
Settle down now. He had little defending to as Chelsea sat in. He was great on the ball but despite the opposition and venue it was not the hardest game for the centre backs.

1856~~~
What a performance from the kid. I actually thought he might be the weakest link today. Proved me wrong.

1857~~~
I actually think he' still a bit safe at times.I know he's capable of being more adventurous than this whilst not screwing it up.Should start in those games that we're expected to dominate possession as he can offer something valuable on the ball.

1858~~~
Couldn't ask for more from him, excellent on the ball and showed good nous on more than one occasion to cut a pass out.

1859~~~
He didn't have a lot of defending to do, but he did pretty much everything well.

1860~~~
Bit of a beast, his forward runs are far better than Smalling or Evans.

1861~~~
McNair was very accomplished today. His early season promise hasn't faded. Very bright future ahead of him.

1862~~~
Couldn't watch the game today(shitty internet)but he's improved massively this season(recent performances in the u21 have been very good)

1863~~~
Our second best player today (to Shaw) in my opinion. Was confident on and off the ball, didnt seem overawed by the occasion in the slightest.

I was impressed by him at RB a few months ago, and was impressed with him at CB today. Seems like a real prospect.

1864~~~
Yeah. Save it for the home games, I'd say.

1865~~~
Kid was really good and also impressive on the ball.

1866~~~
What a first season he's having. The way he carried the ball forward and spread it out to the left wing was absolutely marvellous. Not to mention his two cracking efforts at goal. Struck the ball clean as you like.

1867~~~
Good game from that lad today

1868~~~
He was great. His development is one of the reasons I don't think we need a new centre back.

1869~~~
Thought he was excellent... second behind Luke Shaw in MOTM terms.

1870~~~
What a big job he's had to do today, and he's done well. I'm not sure if we should send him on loan somewhere or keep him and give him some games at United.

He's got potential that's for sure.

1871~~~
Did well. Hope he can keep developing.

1872~~~
Could we mould him into the new Carrick?.

1873~~~
Christ on a bike! Should we not try to mould him into a first team defender competing for a place when all are fit before that!

1874~~~
Surprised by his composure, deserves to keep his place.

1875~~~
Why? hes clearly better on the ball than most CBS and lets face it he will get more time as a DM than a CB!

1876~~~
Very impressive today, so composed and accurate passes throughout the game

1877~~~
This kid definitely has a future here. Hope he keeps improving. Hummels-Rojo, Smalling-Jones and Mcnair should have our centre backs for next year.

1878~~~
I think he could have a top future ahead of him. Very impressed today.

1879~~~
Very good today. Pleasantly surprised

1880~~~
um the kid was very cool. not looking to hide. did very well.

1881~~~
This was Chelsea away! I think we're expected to dominate every game now...

1882~~~
Excellent. Voted him my MOTM.

1883~~~
I rate him highly (one of the reasons why I don't want us to buy a new CB is because of him) so I have a high standard for him, especially with bringing the ball out of defence being his forte.

1884~~~
He was great!

1885~~~
he was bloody fantastic, before the game I was little bit worried but after today's performance I am all for him to start next game. He really benefited from ridiculous performance from Herrera who linked all parts of the ptch fantastically well. Shame he wasn't playing further up the pitch but we had no choice and it really helped McNair and Smalling to combina Fabregas, Drogba and co out of the pitch..

I love his offensive outlets. Great we have center back who is not afraid to go forward and have a shot

1886~~~
Me too. He was the single best thing about the game.
The one player in our squad who looks a really intelligent defender.

Obviously Smalling, Jones, Rojo etc have their strengths. But I wouldn't call any of them a thinking mans centre back.
McNair has that nous. I'm really confident he'll go on to be a top, top player for us.

1887~~~
Good performance. I like him a lot.

1888~~~
If I'm LVG, when Rio retires I'm on the phone ASAP to get him in the background staff working with the defence but especially McNair.

1889~~~
Reminded me of the way Huddlestone strikes the ball. He just strokes it like he's barely even touched it, and it just arrows in a perfect straight line. Great efforts.

Looks like he has learned a lot from the couple of really ropey performances he's had this season. It's been a mixed bag for him. Hope he can kick on from today and play more like that. Looked cool as feck on the ball.

1890~~~
He likes to shoot

1891~~~
Excellent today, especially with bringing the ball out of defence. However, he was not under any pressure defensively all game. Certainly one for the future. Much more composure to his game than some of our more experienced defenders.

1892~~~
Surprisingly impressive today. Looks very talented. Amazing how last year I hadn't even heard of him.

1893~~~
Unlike Blackett, he doesn't look out of place with the rest of our centre backs. I'd be disappointed if he didn't make it as he's shown as much promise as Evans once did, for us anyway. I hope the next stage in his development is to loan him out to a PL side next season.

1894~~~
McNair was good, really good. I was really worried about him playing today but he proved me wrong. Well done.

1895~~~
And he's not worse at it than Di Maria <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1896~~~
He was good today for sure. Don't remember him being so brave and composed on the ball when he played earlier in the season. Perhaps he wasn't, and is now benefiting from playing in a more confident United team.

1897~~~
Did not think he had this kind of performance in him.

1898~~~
This is why you give young players chances to develop !

1899~~~
Always has it in his locker if you watch him in the U21s, it's just a matter of transfer it into the first team which obviously would take times.

1900~~~
Great performance,  looks like one who could make it here.. LVG could mould him into something spectacular... Looked not fazed at all..

1901~~~
I unfortunately don't watch the U-21s that much. Good to know though, cheers. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1902~~~
I don't think Blackett is as bad as people make out at CB.
He's young and will make mistakes but I feel he's shown great promise there and himself and McNair could go on to be a great pair.

He's not the 2nd cousin of a left back though.

1903~~~
I really don't see it. You can count his good performances for us on one hand. There's more talented centre backs we could develop than Blackett who has a ceiling that isn't top class. McNair could be brilliant, you can't say the same about Blackett. 

I'd rather sell him and focus on developing another one of our youth players in that position as our back up centre back.

1904~~~
Glad he started ahead of Blackett

1905~~~
Very few centre backs are top class at that age.

It's more about looking at his attributes. He's quick and strong, he's technically good on the ball, if a little casual at times. 
He has that languid running style that seems to eat up yards and looks a decent tackler.

He reminds me a lot of a young Rio. Another man who could have been accused of casualness once or twice during his career.
The discipline and concentration of defending will come with time and experience. The basic ingredients he has already.

1906~~~
The problem is he's a defender who's pretty poor at actually defending. Rio had occasional lapses in concentration but Blackett regularly makes the wrong decisions, gets over powered by smaller opponents, gets beaten in the air by smaller opponents, pushes up when he should drop back, doesn't track runners well and gives the ball away in dangerous areas. Its no coincidence that he looked good in pre season because opponents were lacking fitness and sharpness as he is good on the ball when he's not pressured but he's looked poor since then. He's a cb who only looks comfortable playing on the left side of a 3 at the back as he gets a lot of cover from the other cb's and from the wing back.

1907~~~
It really says a lot for me when McNair looked the more composed defender when next to Smalling.

Well done Paddy.

1908~~~
I don't think that was ever in doubt. In my eyes McNair has given himself a shot, a long way to go yet though. Blackett, on the other hand, I would be very surprised if he was still a United player in two years time. I expect him to leave this summer.

1909~~~
I take your point but I'm not sure about loaning him out. If we're in the Champions League next season and with the amount of injuries we get, I'd keep him here. Him, a new CB, Smalling, Jones and Rojo will hopefully the pool of centre halves next season for me. Evans to go in the summer and Blackett to go somewhere on loan for the season.

1910~~~
He looked a far better left back coming through, although never looked a real first team prospect. As you say, poor positionally, poor concentration and poor temperament.

1911~~~
I'll have to watch him a few more times I think.
I haven't really seen him be that bad but I haven't seen every game he's played.

1912~~~
I think he was excellent. He hasn't played much in the last couple of months or so but you can see the massive improvement in him. 

Makes me wonder if some of the loanees might have benefited more from training with LvG everyday.

1913~~~
Lingard probably would have stayed if not for the injury. LvG not had much of an effect with Januzaj unfortunately!

1914~~~
That warm fuzzy feeling you get when an academy player does well...

I would like to see him play as a DM in the future

1915~~~
Well maybe we would see the improvement in Januzaj as well if he could just get a rare start.

1916~~~
Not bad for a guy who's still a teenager.

1917~~~
he's a massive talent - way ahead of Blackett. 

Is CB his best position though? he's got a great shot on him

1918~~~
Except for Southampton away, he always seems composed on the ball and when defending. So calm and played well next to Smalling. Hope he gets a chance here because he deserves it.

1919~~~
Good solid game by Paddy but this isnt surprise, Drogba is awful this days so i would be very concerned if he and Smalling had problems with him.

1920~~~
I reckon he'll make cracking players out of Rothwell and Pearson. There's so much to work with with both of those lads.

1921~~~
Some dodgy defending, but looked awesome everything else. I dare to say that given more chance with Smalling, he'll do better than Jones or Rojo.

1922~~~
Became a man today

1923~~~
I take back what I said about him in the Tyler Blackett thread. It was the correct decision to play him over Blackett, he can be very proud of his performance today and who would've thought he'd have a shot on goal like that. He's not short of confidence clearly.

1924~~~
We need gifs of some of those runs he made.

1925~~~
This guy has risen to emergence pretty quickly, had a good game today as well.

1926~~~
Didn't seem out of place at all today, some good efforts on goal from him too.

1927~~~
He plays with a certain reassuring confidence and swagger. Hard to believe him and Shaw are still teenagers.

1928~~~
spot on with every word, it's a shame as his physicality and athleticism would make him a great player if he possessed football brain. It would be a real miracle if Van Gaal turned him into some player

1929~~~
He is incredibly mentally strong. Great talent.

1930~~~
His runs up the middle reminded me of playing Highschool basketball as a power forward.

"What is going on here? Why am I bringing the ball up? Wait, nobody is going to guard me? IM GOING HARD TO THE RACK!"

I loved it ;p

1931~~~
He seems like Blind, great mind and technique but lacking the athleticism to become a top class defender. We'll see.

1932~~~
I was thinking  whether he could play as DM and I am of the opinion that he could after watching this game, he could be our Chambers, versatile defensive player..his passing is really good actually have an eye for pass, his movement with the ball is great, benefiting from playing as a midfielder earlier in his career, I actually never watched him playing there I know him only from u21 where he played only as CB IIRC. He's got good passing range and shot too, I'd definitely like to see him there. For CB he's little bit too tiny and lacks a yard of pace, it wouldn't mean a world in midfield.

1933~~~
Great game, calm and composed like it wasnt champions elect at home.. 

Fantastic by Paddy. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1934~~~
Impressive performance. Was worried Drogba would bully him, but he seemed fine.

Bright future - let's hope he develops even further.

1935~~~
He was very good and confident on the ball on the ball today.

1936~~~
He's really suprised me, just thought he would be another youth product that would find his place at a lower level. However he seems to be quietly growing and may well have a future at the club. I would like to see him hit the gym and bulk up, he can afford to add that physicality as a CB.

1937~~~
He was good. But he rather face Drogba than Costa or Remy. You know what you'd get with Drogba. He's done well in the big games.

1938~~~
Very good on the ball as per usual. Didn't have much defending to do as we were so dominant on the ball. Not convinced by his defending so I'm not sure where his long term position would be.

1939~~~
Looks like it comes natural to him. Will be great to see him grow.

1940~~~
Had a solid game today, looked very comfortable and composed in possession. I think we need to bring in a new CB and loan McNair out for a season to a PL team.

1941~~~
I get the impression McNair and Blackett may be loaned next year.

1942~~~
Probably the best part about this system is that it gives us an opportunity to play young players in positions like defence and midfield. He didn't have much defending to do but got valuable game time. The system's really compact so a young player can slot in as long as the others are pretty experienced. 

Will be a lot tougher breaking in as a CF though unless you are capable of playing out wide.

1943~~~
He has a bright future. IDK he might be ready to make a big contribution next year.

1944~~~
A fine display in what was always going to be a real test. Didn't look out of place.

1945~~~
Disagree.I think we can still afford game times for one of them next season.If a new CB comes surely Evans will be sold.Ideal situation is Blackett loaned out.TFM/Tuanzebe to cover in the case we really feck it up with injuries.

1946~~~
Would do them the world of good. McNair needs to play consistently in a back four for a mid table club, not a relegation bound club. I think Blackett needs to drop down to maybe the championship, maybe a promotion challenging side to get some consistent playing time and confidence. He looked uncomfortable today when he came on.

1947~~~
Love the balls on Paddy......Not literally, as I haven't seen them nor do I wanna tbf.

But, nothing seems to phase him...Apart from that game at Southampton, which was strange....Other than that, high hopes for him

1948~~~
Impressive. Look so confident on the ball too.

We need to sign a world class CB if we are going for the league and CL next season but i would love to reserve a place in the team for mcnair.

Such a confident young man.

1949~~~
I don't think a young player having a tough time of it in a tough game is strange. That's football.

1950~~~
What a difference when played in his natural position LVG will be well pleased for him. Was outstanding at the back yesterday.

1951~~~
No I mean, he wasn't phased in other games, where the pressure was bigger....But he seemed to crumble at St. Marys for some strange reason

1952~~~
He has done well,  and is a better prospect than Blackett.

1953~~~
Much much better imo. I would like to think the only reason why blackett is ahead of thorpe is because he is left footed.

1954~~~
Now that you mention it, what has happened to Thorpe??

1955~~~
I really like him. Smooth as feck on the ball. Is Thorpe really better than him? McNair doesn't seem to be fazed by the big stage at a all. Should probably have tracked hazards run though.

1956~~~
I think given he's good on the ball McNair could provide good cover for both centre back and right back positions. On the other hand playing week in week out will make him develop into a proper tough defender.

I'd send him to one of the more technical teams like Swansea, Southampton etc

1957~~~
I think it's Herrera who should have tracked Hazard's run.

1958~~~
Herrera should have but most likely would have struggled to cope with hazards pace. As would carrick I think. McNair was deeper and didn't have anyone to mark I think, given shaw had covered one of the two attackers (with smalling on the other?). 

I would have to see it again, but it's one of those situations where you need a few players to be alert.

1959~~~
I love this kid.  He was immense today and his future is bright.

If I were Phil Jones I would carefully review the video of how Paddy plays football.

1960~~~
McNair was over in the left CB position, nowhere near Hazard. If anything it would have been Smallings job - but I wouldn't even put much blame on Smalling tbh. I seriously don't think McNair did anything wrong for the goal. Have a look again.

I hope McNair keeps his spot in the team after that performance. He deserves to.

1961~~~
Very good on the ball, composed and confident. With the right defensive coaching he could be a very good player for us, was impressive all game

1962~~~
Hard to believe he was dragged off at HT away to Swansea the last time he started for us.

1963~~~
Trying to predict the long-term future of a versatile teenager is tricky at the best of times, and when said teenager has gone from being a pint-sized #10 to looking like a proper Premiership CB in about 3 years, it seems damn near pointless. But right here, right now I agree, I think he'll be the perfect replacement for Carrick somewhere down the line.

1964~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11UrHCCqdqw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1965~~~
he made some exceptional passes, and played with a lot of confidence yesterday! Great to see him grow over this season..

1966~~~
I don't think anybody expected him to feature as much as he has, at the start of the season. Was very composed yesterday, fair play to the lad.

1967~~~
He's developing faster than anyone expected. Another year or two and he we may have a starting XI contender on our hands.

1968~~~
I have to take it back, this lad is a proper footballer. Given we have Shaw as well who was equally outstanding yesterday, if we can keep DDG, the future looks bright for the defence.

1969~~~
Is it me or is he getting very little credit in the press for the job he has done this season, especially yesterday?

1970~~~
I'd actually sell one of Jones or Evans if it means he'd get the games to develop for us.

1971~~~
To be honest I've not been that impressed with him earlier in the season aside from his debut and the Everton game but he was excellent yesterday.

1972~~~
I certainly wouldn't. Evans may well leave at some point, but Jones is definitely here to stay and will also improve under LvG.

1973~~~
Yesterday at a few points I confused him with Carrick (even though he wasn't playing), he was so far forward and knocking some great little passes about. You can tell he used to play further forward during his teens. Think he is nailed on the become a first team regular for us in the seasons to come.

1974~~~
His surging forward runs reminded me a bit of Jones as well. Its as if Phil instructed him to not be shy and make a few runs into the opposing half. He's also got a wicked shot on him. I reckon he'll knock a few goals in over his career.

1975~~~
I think if everyone is fit, he wouldn't be ahead of Smalling and Jones/Rojo but I was thinking something similar yesterday. Maybe we could use him as back up for Carrick/Carrick's back up back up next season once in a while. We'll have a lot of games next year and our injuries never seem to end.

1976~~~
Just realised Evans is back now from his suspension, if all 4 players that were injured on the weekend can't make it for the Everton game, maybe we could consider playing McNair in midfield with Evans at the back?

1977~~~
Unbelievably comfortable with the ball at his feet. You can tell that he used to be a midfielder. If his defensive game sharpens up over the next couple of years we could have a solid player on our hands.

1978~~~
Yeah, he did really well in that aspect. He had a really good attempt on goal too so the signs are there that he can pop up with a few, not just headers from corners.

I just checked his wiki page after thinking he might actually still be a teen after I said such and McGuinness has compared him to Carrick himself. I see him more of a defender myself but he could do a job there. By the time he is 22/23 he will be a real contender to be a starter if he continues to progress as such. Wilson seemed to be the youngster to make the step up this year but it has been Mcnair. Even after the dodgy performance against the Saints he has just continued with the same exuberance and confidence that he did previously to that game.

1979~~~
Can't wait til one of those master blasters hits the net.

1980~~~
Sell both and bring another top drawer centre back in. Smalling/Hummels?/McNair/Rojo

1981~~~
I am the exact same. He really impressed me, well done.

1982~~~
If there's any doubt of Jones or Rojo's fitness, I'd like to see McNair start again. In fact even if they are fit you could make a good case for him deserving another starting spot after his performance.

1983~~~
He had a good season for a 19 years old rookie centreback.

1984~~~
I think he ranks near the top when it comes to pleasant surprises this season (alongside the more obvious candidates, Young and Fellaini.) That header in his first game is one of the plays of the season, as far as I'm concerned.

We've heard about how LVG introduced the likes of Alaba and Muller at Bayern; you can't help wondering if he sees similar potential in McNair (offering him a contract seems like a good indication that he does.) He just looks very comfortable on the ball, very composed in the manner of Carrick. Perhaps a season-long loan to get him regular playing time might not be a bad idea.

1985~~~
There was a lot of hype about him after his first few games. I couldn't see what all the fuss was about. But the more I have seen of him the more impressed I have been. He definitely has something about him. He has been excellent this season.

It is extremely premature to suggest him playing the Carrick role. Playing a few nice passes and making some surging runs out of defence is a long way away from dictating the tempo of the entire team's play.

1986~~~
Considering the circumstances, I thought he was incredible yesterday. Showed maturity way beyond his years and experience, and his ability on the ball is very very good indeed.

1987~~~
For me he is better than Smalling, Jones and Evans.

1988~~~
I think he's an exceptional prospect. I can definitely see him maturing into a Carrick type player.

He pretty much ran the game from right back against Cambridge, and he displayed the same composure and fearlessness yesterday. I hope he gets a few run outs in midfield before the end of the season.

1989~~~
He was really a pleasant surprise.  I actually have rated him more than others on here but I expected him to struggle against the league leaders.  He didn't look out of place at all and made some superb carries through the middle.

I don't want to get too excited yet because we did over Evans's potential and came to find out that he needed a solid defender like Rio or Vidic next to him.  I'm also not certain if we should ever play him as a MF, as he looks a bit heavy on his feet.  I would sooner have Jones play there before him ATM.

1990~~~
He's got a hammer of a shot on him. Looking forward to one of those slapping the back of the net one day.

1991~~~
I'd like to see Smalling and McNair CB partnership for the next few games. I think it could work quite well. His confidence on the ball is his biggest asset I think. LvG will love it, too.

1992~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1993~~~
Unbelievable composure on the ball for a rookie defender playing away against the no.1 team in the league, should be given more time to develop.

1994~~~
Championship/Lower Premier League loan would be good for him. His defending needs quite a bit of work yet and I think that kind of environment would really help bring it up a level.

1995~~~
Far more comfortable on the ball than Jones or Smalling.

1996~~~
That is like saying he is better looking than Carlos Tevez and Frank Ribery.

1997~~~
He played well yesterday but I think some are getting ahead of themselves. People wouldn't have been saying these things after the Southampton or Swansea games.

He's done relatively well for us since he joined the first team but I would still much rather have Jones and Rojo ahead because they're better than him. I would probably have him over Evans because I don't think Evans has a future here anymore. Sell Evans in the summer and go with 5 CB's next season. Smalling, Hummels, Jones, Rojo & McNair. I'm just using Hummels as an example by the way.

1998~~~
I agree. I think I have a better first touch than Smalling ffs.

1999~~~
TBH I would probably sell Jones in Summer to if it was up to me, And have Smalling / Rojo / McNair / Hummels? as the 4 rotating, as Smalling will obviously pick up injuries.

2000~~~
Why would you do that? Plus if we are to compete in the Champions League it wouldn't be wise to go with 4 especially given McNair's inexperience and injury problems to Smalling.

2001~~~
Agreed. We'll need five with European football and the injuries we get back there and I think Evans will be the one to sacrifice.

2002~~~
His potential is there for everyone to see and only 19.  He may have bad games here and there but he will get better and better given the right coaching and platform to perform.

2003~~~
I hate the way that we've had glass centre backs for so long that United fans now think that you need five frigging centre backs to cover two positions in a 50 game season. A sad reflection of the sicknotes we've had at United for the last couple of seasons.

2004~~~
Well tbh I just think that it might be time to cut ties with Jones now. He has been here a few years and hasn't really progressed at all, Plus he is always injured and we cannot persist with the Jones \ Smalling injured all the time routine, it has set us back just TOO many times. I think realistically one should go, and Smalling has more to his game then Jones IMO.

2005~~~
He's 23 and has been playing well this season, both are injury prone but Jones seems to be preferred choice to Smalling when both are fit (recently anyway).
Personally I'd keep both for one more season at least.

2006~~~
Both have a year left on their contracts so you'd expect if they're part of the long term plans they'll be offered new deals this summer.

2007~~~
Personally I would sell Evans and keep this guy at the club......Smalling and a new CB (Varane/Godin/Laporte/Hummels) would be my starters with Jones, McNair and Rojo coming in and out.

2008~~~
Seriously? Or are you joking?

2009~~~
Actually if we go with only 5 centre backs next season (with whoever stays out of McNair/Blackett also counted) I'm sure we will have to use Tuanzebe/Fosu-Mensah at some points with our injury records.Blackett is effectively our 6th choice and he played 10+ games this season.

2010~~~
Yes, very serious-he is already more composed than Smalling & Jones

2011~~~
Would you have said this last week?

2012~~~
So you forget hes been sub'd off at half time not so long ago.
Hes a top talent and very good player, but hes not as good as Smalling, and way to early to say hes any better than Jones.

2013~~~
Has LvG traditionally played with one ballplayer and one cover in his backline (when playing 4-3-3) or has he expected both to push forward and be able to play?

McNair might see his most obvious position blocked by Hummels should we sign him. He didn't look too out of place at LCB against Chelsea, but then Chelsea gifted us all the play.

2014~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11UrHCCqdqw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2015~~~
Can anyone tell me how tall he is? From the games that I have watched he seems to have the standard height for a centerback but for some reason wikipedia is telling me that he is 172cm? FIFA have him on 176cm, 182cm on irishfa and 186cm on FM15. I am a very confused man atm.

2016~~~
good game paddy, love his long range shots, he could also work good with Smalling but bigger challengers will come up, yeah bigger than Chelsea away, they couldn't chase the ball well with the tactics and players like Zouma included so we had good amount of time on the ball from wchich ball playing MCNair benefited a lo, we will see how he copes with more aggressive and positive playing team but I like him a lot

BTW 6:52 my fav moment of the game Smalling taking down the ball like a boss, yeah terrible first touch..

2017~~~
And is he better prospect than Stones?

2018~~~
We won't sign Stones so I don't really care.They're on different stage of development as well.

2019~~~
So what if he was subbed off on one occasion....he's young that is going to happen!!

2020~~~
Yes, i've seen enough of him to form a conclusion that he is better than Smalling, in particular on the ball whether passing the ball short or simply coming out with the ball.

2021~~~
He's nowhere near as good as Smalling, who is our best defender right now.

2022~~~
Not saying that he is better than Smalling or Jones, but his bad performance came at right back, where he will generally find less space to go forward with the ball, and being primarily used as a center back and DM he may not have been very used to the positional discipline required to play the role, despite the good performance the game before. As CB he can potentially have a lot more space to run into unmarked especially since LVG sets his teams up to create space at the back.

2023~~~
He was poor at RB, shouldn't count against him, he's completely unfamiliar with that position.

2024~~~
I'm a huge McNair fan, but yeah he's not close to Smalling yet. I think he'll catch on very quickly though, his instincts are great.

2025~~~
Way way too early to be saying he's better than any of our first team defenders just yet. He was very good on Saturday, and he had a couple of impressive performances earlier in the season as well. It's all about how he develops and how he performs when the pressure is really on. I don't want to take anything away from his performance, but I think Chelsea were the least attacking team we have played this season. I think even Yeovil and Cambridge offered a bigger threat to our defence than Chelsea did.

There's definitely something about him. He seems to have constantly been thrown in when we have injury crisis', but he's mostly done well. That's a credit to him and his mentality. You could hardly blame a player for shitting it in a bit by being thrown in, in an away game against the best team in the league, but he looked very assured. Good to see him have the bollocks to not just get rid of the ball like we often saw Blackett do earlier in the season, but stepping into midfield, and even getting shots on target; away at Stamford Bridge! Top lad.

Would be good to see him get a Premier League loan and play week in week out. I don't think he'll get that here next season, especially as I predict we'll bring in a CB this summer as well.

2026~~~
I thought he played with some real class on Saturday, bringing the ball out of defence and taking some decent shots. There's been the odd game where he's struggled but overall I think he's been good this season. Always great to see a youth player come through and play well.

Deserved that new contract.

2027~~~
Come on...

2028~~~
He looks about 6ft 2in. But he's had a bit of a late growth spurt in the last 2 years.

2029~~~
I think it's fairly unlikely he'll ever become as good as the current versions of Smalling or even Jones. But they're both pretty unique/special talents.

Interesting prospect though.

2030~~~
McNaibauer

2031~~~
He was only promoted to the U21s for the second half of last season, getting multiple starts for the first team in the league is way above what what we normally line up for a prospect of his age at CB. He won't even turn 20 for another week!

I think he's looked great at CB for someone his age. He was playing midfield for the U18s anyway, he hasn't been a CB primarily even.

2032~~~
I would like to see him perform at the level he did on Saturday for a consistent period of time before I said that. He has shown potential though, but he isn't as good as the other CBs. Otherwise LvG would have played him instead of them.

2033~~~
What was impressive is that normally when Smalling, Jones and Evans to a lesser degree run forward with the ball, it all looks good for a while then they get to a certain point and panic a tad about what to do next. When McNair got forward he was refreshingly composed, which is probably due to his midfield roots. He made the right passes in the attacking third and had a couple of half decent shots. His composure in such a big game away, at such a young age was impressive. Hopefully his development trajectory continues in the same way next season.

2034~~~
Would there be a case for him to learn the DM role from Carrick and Blind for a couple of years? Ready to step in as an option when Carrick retires.

2035~~~
For that he will probably have to improve on his vision, first touch and distribution imo.

2036~~~
This!  I couldn't even name Chelsea's 4th choice central defender (after Terry, cahill and Zouma) let alone their 5th or 6th

2037~~~
Well said. Defenses have dared him to come out in every game he's played at CB and he's shown great composure.

2038~~~
We played 3 at the back for a while, though on the other hand you wouldn't necessarily expect Hummels to play 50 games and be injury free all year.

2039~~~
Once we shore up the midfield, Carrick will be out 5/6th choice centreback.

2040~~~
The lad is naturally suited to the possession game. Smart feet and a good head on his shoulders. His runs forward are actually how Beckenbauer used to do it! Pierce through midfield and have a go at goal. He's got something special about him the boy.

2041~~~
He's awfully indecisive when he's having a bad game. An early error seems to rock him for the rest of the match. That's a few times now.

2042~~~
Head dropped today and started feeling sorry for himself. 

It's expected. He'll learn from it

2043~~~
It was expected when he did it against Southampton? and got taken off. This has happened a few times now and it's not a very good thing to see. He's young, but not <i>that </i>young.

2044~~~
That trying to tackle for the first goal was typical of him. He's made tackles like that before and got away with it.

Just don't see anything special to suggest he has a long term future here. Where as you look at Stones, who is a similar age then you see the big difference in quality.

2045~~~
He needs to be more decisive and firm in his tackling, loses too many 50/50's for a CB

2046~~~
As a 19 year old with virtually no experience, he's been quite impressive this year. Another year or two and he'll be a top player.

2047~~~
Bit of a let down after an impressive performance against Chelsea.

2048~~~
Another Southampton standard shocker from McNair. He seems to completely lose confidence once he makes a big error. Never recovered from terribly weak challenge for their first goal.

Of course he has had a super season etc etc.

As to whether he will be a good player in the long run, I have no idea.

2049~~~
Just really panicky and hesitant. Was also his fault we might be without Rooney now FFS.

2050~~~
The next good game he has has to be met with caution. There is a player there, but he's just a kid and he's very much a work in progress. Expect inconstancy.

2051~~~
There is promise there for sure, unfortunately he just let his head slip but he is getting better.

2052~~~
This exactly.

2053~~~
A learning experience for him today, he had a lot more defending to do than last week and he buckled on a few occasions.

2054~~~
He'll learn from this but he was terrible today.

2055~~~
Looks good bringing the ball out but defensively not good enough yet, if he had done his job for the first goal it could haven been a different game. No point being great on the ball if you are a defensive liability.

2056~~~
Wonder if it would be better to hone him for the Carrick role, he's confident on the ball but doesn't seem to have any specific trait that makes him a good CB.

2057~~~
as long as he doesn't need to defend he's fine, it's almost the same with Blackett he struggles to be a good defender when actually playing in defense

2058~~~
He had another off day which is expected of a young CB and I was surprised he wasn't hooked again. He was good on the ball mind you, but was given a lesson by Lukaku on many occasions and was nowhere near good enough for Everton's first goal where McCarthy ran the ball right through him.

Perhaps he stayed on as part of his learning process, needing to dig himself out of a hole he helped create. At the same time there was only Blackett or moving Blind to CB as alternatives.

2059~~~
He's having trouble stringing together some form. He's had a couple of good performances at CB then immediately followed them up with poor games, I think he also did the same at RB and was hauled off in the first half of the next one.

2060~~~
Nah, not really a defender is he. Good on the ball but just like Rojo and evans he can't defend. All good and well when the opposition poses little to no threat but in a game like today, he's gonna hurt us.

2061~~~
A bit harsh as he's much more competent than Blackett at defending, but I share similar sentiments.

2062~~~
Have to agree with this. No coincidence that his best game came when he didn't have to defend.

Maybe a loan can help him develop the defensive side of his game...

2063~~~
He was terrible. Another game he could've been hooked in and I wouldnt have been surprised. Hopefully we don't have to use him again for the rest of the season.

2064~~~
I do quite like his marauding runs forward.

But that really should be a secondary element to his game rather than the only positive you take out of it.

Don't think he was horrendous today as some are suggesting. Should have been more decisive on the tackle for the first goal. Scared of giving way a penalty.

He'll learn.

2065~~~
Or we could look on the bright side, and say that he's a 19 year-old who shown great promise this season, with the dips in form (some quite startling,) that are to be expected with someone who is so young, and not getting a regular run-out. I think he'd definitely benefit from a good loan spell, but I think we've got a real prospect on our hands.

2066~~~
I said this after the Chelsea game, and still think it would be a great option with Carrick getting older. Paddy clearly can play, he's a good passer and dribbles confidently into the space. It's to be seen yet though if he can have the positioning required for that role, but I am sure he could mould into that.

2067~~~
not a bad idea.....

2068~~~
Stones seems to fancy himself a bit. I do worry that McNair isn't a good enough defender. Really good on the ball but quite shaky at his bread and butter.

2069~~~
He is good in possession but probably needs to hit the gym and bulk up over the summer. A bit soft for a centre back. Has to be stronger in the tackle.

2070~~~
He was great against Everton at home and we did a load of defending that day.

Poor today mind.

2071~~~
He hasn't shown great promise, honestly going down this road would be a waste of time for all parties involved. Its quite clear he'll never be good enough to be a first choice defender for us. He's good on the ball and that's about it. He has no recognizable defensive game at all and asking him to develop the whole package is just asking too much.

2072~~~
If any of our academy should play that role it should be Thorpe, he has proved time and time again he can do it and it well at reserve level. Then there is Goss and also Pearson who can also play that role. There's no need to give McNair a new role because he's not all that he was hyped up to be as a CB.

2073~~~
I think there's actually quite a few players who are better in that role at the club than Thorpe he's never looked particularly impressive in that role, he does a job there but thats about it never excels there and is clearly better playing centre half

2074~~~
He's 19, are we expecting players to flourish from the age of 16 now?

2075~~~
He's just a kid, games like these will happen. 

Can't really blame him a whole lot when the whole team bar Smalling was shit today.

2076~~~
Exactly, Remember when we bought Smalling and he was still at Fulham, they played him a lot of games and almost every game he made a mistake or two.

2077~~~
He needs to spend some time in the gym. And by that I mean I think he needs to get proper hench. 

He seems to have a similar physique to Evans... I hope he doesn't go down the same route and end up being an easy target for big centre forwards.

2078~~~
People get lost a bit when they judge young players,it looks like being 19 is a new 30 for defenders.For example,anyone knew anything about Vidic or where he played when he was 19 year old?I doubt it.

2079~~~
Bad game from him today. Needs to work on his defensive side of his game a whole lot more, as today we saw him being indecisive in tackles (cost us the first goal) and some poor positioning at other times. Saying that I really liked how he brought the ball out of defence with some of his runs today. He seems so comfortable carrying the ball forward and it really opens the game up a lot as the other team has to scramble to cover him. 

Hopefully he improves significantly on the defensive side of the game when we don't have the ball in his next game.

2080~~~
Not a great performance from young Paddy today, but if he keeps working hard he'll have a great career.

2081~~~
Good grief.

2082~~~
He is no Rio.

He is no Vidic.

He is no Stam.

His height is only 1.72.

He is not what we need.

2083~~~
He was loaned out to a club called Spartak Zlatibor after coming through Red Star's youth system.Yeah, a bit different from playing against Chelsea away plus Everton home and away.

But perhaps clueless fans would still say he's no Vidic.

2084~~~
He's 20 years old. (Today, Happy Birthday Paddy.)

And he isn't 1.72 you numpty. That's shorter than Mata. 

Rojo is 1.86, Van Persie 1.83...

2086~~~
Hopefully we will add 1-2 more defenders next season and he'll end up playing Championship football before soon.

2087~~~
I thought he did alright. It was his (and Blind) mistake for the first goal, couldn't handle Lukaku few times, but looked mostly fine. I've seen worse performance by Jones and Evans. At least he looked better than when watching Varane against Celta Vigo.

2088~~~
1.72 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2089~~~
He followed his best performance of the season with one of his worst, which is a shame but he's young and will learn from it. He definitely should have cleared the ball for the first goal and seemed to have a dip in confidence thereafter. DDG didn't help him on a couple of occasions when you'd expect your goalkeeper to come and collect the ball but he stayed rooted to his line. 

His height stats are probably old as he was smallish and has had a significant growth spurt over the past year or so.

2090~~~
Paddy Mcnair known as the imp.

2091~~~
Why not hope that he disappears off the face of the Earth? He is such a hateful character, isn't he?

2092~~~
Oh what a drama queen.

At Championship/low EPL club level he can built a decent career. Take Shawcross as an example. He's had a great career at Stoke.

Also Id rather see us play a cnut whose magnificent in his role (:cough: Keane :cough: ), than the nicest guy in town whose pretty crap in his role (:cough: Ando :cough:  ).

We can always loan him somewhere and see how it goes. He's definitely not United quality yet.

2093~~~
One game - he's great.

Another game - he's shite, no hope for him.

Not to mention the 1.72 facht. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2094~~~
Even Prunier had one good game for us.

2095~~~
He had just one good game for us? 

McNair I mean.

2096~~~
Are you talking about yourself?

Nah let's not compare him to the mighty Varane.Paddy's Championship quality at best.

2097~~~
No, that's not what I said. But I don't think 20 is all that young either, particularly if we're talking about the young players playing at Manchester United, or other top clubs.

It's not just a couple of mistakes either. I wouldn't be commenting too harshly if it was. Instead, his whole game turns upside down on the basis of one small error, and that was now the third game this season in which he could have been hooked early because of it. That's not a good trait to have, irrespective of age.

2098~~~
I am replying to your quote.

Young defenders are highly unreliable. I've lost count of the amount of young defenders being hailed the next Maldini or Baresi only to fail miserably. Im not referring to what fan's say either, most of them are too emotional and clueless. Im referring to what managers like Sacchi and Capello had said. Even our own SAF had dropped some silly comments on the matter. Do you remember the new 'Steve Bruce' Ronnie Wallwork? What about Wes being twice as good as Rio? Not to forget that random guy who said that Jones reminded him of Duncan Edwards!

To be fair its understandable to commit these sort of mistakes. Young defenders need to grow both in size and maturity to make it at the highest level. One injury or a dip in confidence can also ruin years of hard work. One good game means very little. TBF even one good season means nothing at this stage. OShea had a magnificent first season which were followed by....oh you know.

Mcnair needs games. Young defenders needs that. Hence why I believe that the best course of action is to let him go. We can either send him on loan or else put a minimum fee clause in his contract which is exclusive to us. Not playing with United is not the end of the line. Some great players had started their career with a dissapointment

2099~~~
1
Nop

2100~~~
He's been fine for a first season of professional football and has had great games. Hoping he ends up playing in a lower division soon so we can replace him with an expensive big name player rather than he develops into a useful player here is exactly the sort of thing I'd expect from you though.

He's 20 and was not even expected to make his debut this season. He's done very, very well on most occasions and exceeded expectations. He was poor yesterday and against Southampton 5 months ago but I expect this from time to time.

2101~~~
Let's murder everyone who isn't one of the top 5 defenders in the world in their debut season at 19/20. Feed them to alligators or dinosaurs.

2102~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> sarcasm noted.

Shocking claim about that championship thing. You'd think that the Premier League is full of 20 y.o. Baresis.

2103~~~
We need an 'expensive' CB irrespective on whether Mcnair stays or goes. We've got no leaders at the back and bringing in one would benefit the current crop greatly. Now since we can't keep hoarding players in and expect them to magically develop without giving them regular first team football than some one will have to be sacrificed. SAF sacrificed Pique and Shawcross to give games to Evans. These things do happen in football.


 Having Mcnair sent a smaller club may well save his career. If we truly believe in him than we can either loan him or put a minimum fee clause in his contract. However he needs to leave United. At his age he should be playing regular football.

2104~~~
Loan would do him good but to say sthing like he's Championship player at best which was said here is.. Well typical for football fans. Its mostly black or white. No middle ground.
Lets give him time, he can turn out to be good, lets not overwrite him so quickly.

2105~~~
I believe that he's CURRENTLY a regular first team player for a low EPL side/Championship football. He might attract the attention of Bayern for all I know but he would end up spending months on the bench same at United (if we had a decent defense). That doesn't mean he will spend all his career there? He's 20 FFS not 34

I cant understand why so many people loathe low level football. Beckham still recall his time at Preston as instrumental for his career. David Platt move to Crewe after being shown the door at United and he ended up England's captain.  Beardsley played for a season in Canada before moving back to England. Championship football is not the end of the line

2106~~~
You used the word "end up" in your original post which normally used to talk about one's calibre, not "current level".Nobody is loathing Championship football here.

I still think it's better to keep him as number 5 CB for us next season though.As proved every season our number 5 CB would still get plenty of games, especially with McNair's versatility.If we sign a new player, it should be to replace an useless senior player (i.e Evans) rather than push the young players down the pecking order.I think McNair would be valuable in home games and if LVG didn't want to send Blackett out on loan this season (who's everyone can see desperately need a loan) ,I doubt he will send McNair out next season.

2107~~~
If you would read my post carefully you'd see that I wrote - Loan would do him good.
No need for caps lock.

2108~~~
Well then, you misunderstood me. I try to answer to every post addressed to me. I would have answered your question if you only asked.

Regarding your second paragraph that's exactly how you ruin a young defender's career. At 20 the boy needs regular football and not bits and pieces of game separated by weeks and months of reserve football. I believe we should loan/sell (minimum clause fee which is exclusive for us) Mcnair to a smaller side and keep one of the 'useless' senior player as number 5. The boy will get regular first team football that hopefully will allow him to improve and prove himself that he's United quality while the rest will have to fight hard not to end up being the one constantly sitting on the bench.

Kindly note that most of the 'useless' senior players were once hailed and hyped on this same forum as much if not more than Mcnair is.

2109~~~
I actually agree with devilish. Amazing.

2110~~~
Sort yourself out mate.

2111~~~
Google gives height 1.72

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Paddy+McNair" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/search?q=Paddy+McNair</a>

Is Google ever wrong??? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2112~~~
This site says 1.84. Which is more reasonable. I have no idea why Google says 1.72...

2113~~~
Yes.

2114~~~
He pulled out of that challenge with McCarthy. I don't think there is an excuse for that. Jones or Rojo would have erased McCarthy in that situation.

It wasn't a case of him being afraid to give a penalty either I don't think, the ball was in front of him to win and McCarthy was intent on running forward. He just pulled out unfortunately.

2115~~~
Well... guess what! The official web site of the EPL says 1.72! <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2116~~~
He's a young lad, games like this will happen now and again. Most of the team was shite, keep the faith in him he has a lot of good qualities.

2117~~~
He's not bloody Rey Mysterio, where are they getting those stats from.

2118~~~
Come on, he did okay yesterday. Made some errors, but overall okay.

He is still young, but what a season he has had. Great debut season for a young boy, great promise. Hopefully he can build on and learn from a great leader/defender in the next couple of years.

He is good when bringing the ball forward, and he will learn the defensive part of the game. Great talent.

2119~~~
1.72m ? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

And are you comparing him to 19 years old, Stam, Ferdinand and Vidic? Or to those players at their prime?

2120~~~
Happy 20th, Paddy.

2121~~~
Very weak challenge on McCarthy for their first goal.

2122~~~
Thought he showed enough to highlight why he's so highly thought of at the club. Yes he made some mistakes but the lad is 19 and if you had ever watched any of the greats at 19 thats par for the course. Only at our club, we give young players the opportunity to learn as they go in thye first team. Long may that continue and I for one will look at the positives from his performance and what that experience will give him and us 3-4 years down the line.

2123~~~
got massive potential but Im not sure if CB will be his long term position, I'd actually be inclined to give him a run out at RB next weekend as Tony V looks like he needs a rest.

2124~~~

2125~~~
That's it, he's not a teenager anymore, no more excuses.

2126~~~
Personally I think we should disregard all players that under the age 21 (it's the new 30 IMO)

2127~~~
I don't think he's anywhere near good enough right now but there's definitely something there to work with. To be honest, before the last 2 games I'd written off both him and Blackett but the confidence and composure he's shown with the ball has been encouraging and something I hadn't seen from him previously. Loan him out for a couple of seasons and see where he's at defensively once he returns.

2128~~~
Looks great on the ball but it looked like Smalling was having to do a lot of his ball winning yesterday. I thought he looked the same at Chelsea to be honest. Definitely looks a player, but not sure CB is his future.

2129~~~
Definitely a work in progress but there's potential there alright. Think LVG said he's one of the players who have improved the most since he arrived and that will have to continue.

2130~~~
I thought he played pretty well yesterday. What is most promising is his composure on the ball, he is excellent at taking it forward into midfield. Compare that to Smalling, who shits himself whenever he gets over the half way line.
McNair will fill out over time and get stronger and in a couple of years he could be an outstanding player - still some work to do though.

2131~~~
The amount of people on here who seem to base their entire opinion on players and especially young on their last game is incredible. He's an extremely inexperienced player and as such will have good games and bad games as he learns more about the game and comes to terms with first team football. The most impressive thing about him for me is how quickly he is learning as 18 months ago he wasn't even making the u21 team and there was no indication whether he would even be kept on at the end of the season. Just as a good game last week didnt mean he should be our first choice cb as some were implying a poor game this week doesn't mean he's not good enough and never will be. He's coming into one of the worlds biggest teams in a very pressurized environment in probably the most difficult position for a young player to come into the team and has shown far more positives than negatives so people need to have a bit of perspective here

2132~~~
Honestly I didnt even think he had *that* bad a game yesterday. He was partially at fault for the first goal yes, but other than that the entire team played badly. I didnt rate McNair as one of the standout bad performers by any means. I thought he did well for the most part and carried the ball forwards well when the opportunity presented itself.

I thought there were plenty others who had a worse game - Valencia, De Gea, Falcao, Di Maria, Mata and Blind to name but a few.

2133~~~
Yes. The ball was ahead of McCarthy and as a defender when you go for a challenge you need to be firm and make sure the ball is out of danger.

2134~~~
I've seen nothing from him to suggest he can make it here as a centre back with the exception of that header against West Ham.

A definite talent in possession though, wonder if he could play in Carrick's position ?

2135~~~
Yeah, he weakly tried to clear but all of a sudden just backed off from the challenge and let him through the goal. You dont do that, esp. when the opposing player is so close to your goal.

2136~~~
It's impossible to judge the future career of a 19 years old centerback, who is in his first season and isn't a starter. Only the coaches have an idea because this position is all about how the player process the information gained after every games.

2137~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/has-paddy-mcnair-justified-van-gaals-faith-in-him/364925" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/has-paddy-mcnair-justified-van-gaals-faith-in-him/364925</a>

A statistical view over McNair's last two performances.

2138~~~
He seems to be comfortable on the ball but when he's required to make a defensive play on it, he panics at times. Hopefully the composure will come with time.

2139~~~
It'll be interesting to see how he develops, I wouldn't be surprised to see him tried as a #6 in the summer.

2140~~~
His defensive ability is probably championship level at the moment, on the ball he is better than most premier league centre halves and that is why he manages to get games. How much he can/will improve the defensive side of his game will determine if he is around long term.

He could possibly be suited to playing in midfield more than CB, would be good to see him played there in cup games rather than at RB because I don't think he is equipped to play there long term.

2141~~~
He wasn't that bad. As you say, our performance was indicative of a collective lack of team focus. When the team is focused, various players look very good and conversely, when its not, its open season on the likes of Valencia, Falcao, Blind etc. Its also important to bear in mind the lad is still just 19 (20 now) and has been thrown into the fire in his first year with the first team. He will continue to improve in the coming years as long as his progress is nurtured correctly by LvG and staff.

2142~~~
His only mistake was the goal really and even then he did well to get in the way of the ball from the initial pass inside, he just got extremely unlucky with where the diversion ended up.

2143~~~
I get nervous when he is playing.

2144~~~
Mcfail

2145~~~
He's just not very good at defending in the slightest. Another error, another goal.

2146~~~
Awful freekick to give away.

2147~~~
He looks good with the ball but he panics so much when it comes to defending. Still a long way to go for him if he's to have a chance of making it here.

2148~~~
will never be good enough for us,  needs to be as far away from the club as possible.
As soon as I saw his needless foul on Fletcher with Brunt around I was like we are going to suffer from this.

2149~~~
Meh Vidic would have given away that freekick when caught deep every time.

Not sure it was that big a fault considering the position. Fletcher was about to get a shot away and it was a counter.

2150~~~
Not good enough defensively unfortunately, he is a liability and it is just a question of whether he gets away with it or not. Should be loaned out next season because that part of his game needs dramatic improvement and he will learn more playing every week.

2151~~~
As soon as I saw Paddy McNair's name on the team-sheet I felt we might lose...He's cost us in all of the last 3 games. Van Gaal is to blame though for insisting on picking him. He might be a Vidic in the making but he is 5 years away from being ready for first team football at Man Utd

2152~~~
Thought he was decent today. Yeah, the free kick was a poor one, but it's one of those that almost every defender give away. Should've scored though.

2153~~~
Vidic can tackle. He just isn't aggressive enough and just can't tackle.

2154~~~
Tbf he didn't have any other option last 2 games except Blackett.

Today he didn't play Jones for assesing Match rhythm though as per his not playing injured players too quick philosophy.

2155~~~
I like how he charges up the pitch with the ball like a peak Vieira and then remembers he's a center back and turns and passes backward.

Jokes aside I like his confidence. I like how he wants to play from the back and is willing to receive the ball in somewhat dangerous areas. And generally he handles himself well.

2156~~~
What the actual feck?So people would rather let Fletcher through in that situation?Let's the blame game begins...

2157~~~
You've seen nothing? Come on, hes 20 and in his debut season and hasnt looked out of place that often.

2158~~~
One of the last players to blame for today's defeat.

2159~~~
Smelling was close by. fletcher is hardly the quickest, if Fletcher was through he would have got a red.

2160~~~
One of our better performances. He gave away the free kick which led to the goal, but at the time that he conceded the foul it was the correct decision for him to make - it was unfortunate (although completely expected) that they scored from it.

Didnt have much defending to do, but carried the ball forward well and joined in the attack whenever possible (which was most of the time).

2161~~~
I am talking about the specific situation. I think what he did was the best option after being caught deep and no defensive shape on the counter.

2162~~~
So many twatish fans on here, they seem to leech on to something that they might consider a mistake from a player they don’t like and milk the feck out of it. What happened to giving youth players a chance?

2163~~~
Come on.Every defender will give out a foul in that situation.Fletcher was clear through on goal and could take a shot.I doubt a defender in that situation has enough time to judge whether the opponent is fast or slow.

2164~~~
Honestly I thought he was fine today. Though the foul that lead to their goal was absolutely brain-dead from him. 

Missing that header was pretty poor too.

2165~~~
I'd have preferred to see Blind partnering Smalling with Young at left back....we can not afford to be playing clueless 19 year olds at this stage of the season

2166~~~
For the last time, if Fletcher was through why wasn't it a red? He was at fault for missing the header.

Our defence looks nervy with him around. It's not a coincidence.

2167~~~
Holy feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2168~~~
I thought he was ok, needs to hold his position better at times though, he makes too much work for Smalling when his concentration drifts.

2169~~~
I give up on this thread.Good luck on the blame game folks.

2170~~~
Granted, the boy has potential.

But he's just too young and inexperienced to risk playing him at this crucial stage of the season, especially in a position where we are so fragile. He had the opportunity to get us something from this game from both ends, and epically failed both times.

2171~~~
'might consider a mistake'?

I like McNair but that half challenge was laughable and has ended up costing us the game. He deserves stick for it.

2172~~~
You blame someone and you blame someone now goddamit.

2173~~~
He's just not ready for the first team no matter what way you look at it. Van Gaal obviously likes to give youth a chance and that is a good thing but you have to draw the line at times. Would Mourinho play McNair for 3 major games in a row at this stage of his development? Absolutely no chance. Would Ancelotti or Guardiola have played him for 3 major games in a row at this stage of his development? no chance......he should be nowhere near the first team.....Carrick missing was a huge problem but McNair playing was equally as huge a problem for us today and he cost us in the end with a stupid mistake that any 19 year old is guaranteed to make

2174~~~
Watch it again, the tackle was always going to be made. It resulted in a frekish goal from a FK. Lets say he didnt make the tackle and Fletcher scored, I wonder what everyone would be saying then eh?

2175~~~
bollocks, what cost us the game was the inability to create scoring chances at the other end.

2176~~~
Don't want to be too harsh on a young lad, and I know a lot of it is necessity due to injury, but I genuinely haven't seen anything to suggest that he's good enough.

2177~~~
Blind from what i've seen is a disaster waiting to happen in a CB role in back 4 and he would have probably given the same foul as he has done from DCM. Plus on top of that Young at LB. Sigh.

Anyway, you are being too harsh on Mcnair. He's there given the situation only.

2178~~~
Indeed. And also blowing up the chances we did create.

2179~~~
Honestly I'd much rather seen him in midfield instead of Rooney

2180~~~
How is he going to get ready?

2181~~~
He is more than good enough on the ball, he is very a poor defender at this point. He is just too weak. I think that we should keep hold of him for another year or two though. He could develop that side of his game. I would send him on loan next year as I don't think he is off the required defensive level for our first team.

2182~~~
This. I just don't see the sense in blaming the person who gave away the free kick for probably the flukiest goal we've conceded all season.

2183~~~
He can get ready in Carling cup and FA CUP appearances for us. To play him in our biggest games of the season is just stupid really..he actually played really well today but the mistake he made was guaranteed to happen and it has cost us bigtime........if we blow top 4 this season than this club is in big trouble financially

2184~~~
Honestly I'd like we introduce an ancient and outdated concept ie we play players in their natural role

2185~~~
How the hell he's playing ahead of Jones (on the bench) I have no idea.

2186~~~
He'll be disappointed with giving the foul away and missing that chance, but our problems lie deeper than that. To blame him for this loss is harsh.

2187~~~
Exactly McNair was a midfielder, Rooney never was

2188~~~
Who else is there to play as CB? The fact that he stood up and hasnt looked out of place has to be a credit to him.

2189~~~
Evans light. Actually very good with the ball but junior level when it comes to defending and positioning. It's not his fault LvG opts for him though.

2190~~~
It wasnt a tackle. He backed out but did it too late. Its not a mistake a player should be making at this level.

2191~~~
Given McNair missed a free header from six yards then his point probably still stands then. Errors at both ends cost us.

2192~~~
LVG said he would asess Jones' match rhythm before the game.

I suppose he didn't pass the test.

2193~~~
And there i was thinking conceding a stupid free kick that led to a goal had something to do with it.

2194~~~
Young and learning. Put in some good displays this season and the experience will do him good.

2195~~~
That's the problem. He looks like a midfielder playing defence. Can't blame him, because thats exactly what he is. Just not sure what van Gaal sees that makes him think he's good enough to play at centre half ahead of some of the other youngsters who have years of experience in the position.

2196~~~
It was a professional foul, it happens time and time again during a match.

2197~~~
He's shite at defending. Good at bringing the ball out but poor at what he's actually on the pitch for.

2198~~~
If he's on the bench surely he's past fit?

2199~~~
He's very good on the ball but he actually cannot defend.

2200~~~
I'd have played Blind beside Smalling.....and Young at left back...you need experience in such an important game.....West Brom are monsters in height and physicality and were always going to bully an inexperienced defender

2201~~~
That didn't happen though. He made one very silly error which was very unlucky to result in a goal and other than that we looked very comfortable. Admittedly Smalling did almost all of the defending single-handedly but that's besides the point. McNair wasn't bullied at any stage defensively and he used the ball well.

2202~~~
Who plays in Blind's position? Is Di Maria confidence a factor s to why Yound played ahead of him?

2203~~~
I don't think it's particularly fair to attribute much blame to the free kick. Not the brightest, but not unusual to give a free kick away when he wasn't sure Smalling was there to cover. If they hadn't got lucky as feck with that free kick, we wouldn't be talking about it and he'd most likely have a lot of positive posts about his performance.

Should have scored too, but again, hardly an unusual miss for a centre back. Let alone a 19 year old one. I'm sure he still has a bright future.

2204~~~
Again McNair had a decent game today but it's obvious that he is still miles away from being ready for this level and it showed today...Needs a loan at a championship club next season......I think with McNair in the team and Carrick also missing at the same time - we've basically looked like a relegation level team with those two weaknesses in the team

2205~~~
He's naive and I'll put that down to his age. I mean, Fletcher is going no where, just stand your ground. He along with Jones are so prone to giving away these silly freekicks, I really hate it.

2206~~~
Let's not be twats and pin this on him.

Even our best defenders have always had dangerous-free-kick-conceding fouls in them.

Blind has never played CB before he joined Manchester United. He could do a job there, but no better than McNair. I'd expect the same from him tbf: good on the ball but not great defensively. Playing 3 players out of position in defence probably isn't what van Gaal prefers if he can give a chance to the youth.

Nope, doesn't have to be. Earlier this season Young was on the bench and came on because Shaw was injured, and he got taken off again in the 80th minute again. He was there in case any defender would've gotten injured but probably wasn't fit for a whole match, the only other option would've been a fit Blackett on the bench.

2208~~~
Agreed we have gone 3 matches without scoring a goal our predicament is not down to a young defender who is just learning his trade.

2209~~~
He's not ready to play regularly as a defender in the premier league. Don't blame van Gaal for playing him though when everyone else is injured.

2210~~~
As I say, defensively no - seen next to nothing. He is a talent on the ball though.

2211~~~
Feel for him. He seems to go from looking a real talent to looking horribly out of his depth. I've got real concerns about his ability in the air and vulnerability 1 on 1.

2212~~~
I hope Jones is back soon.

2213~~~
Just part of being inconsistent at a young age I think. Though I agree with you on his weaknesses. He has time to improve on them though.

2214~~~
Is a novice and it shows sometimes.

2215~~~
Paddy McNair just turned 20 a few days ago.

2216~~~
Thought he did well tbh apart from that foul. He even has the confidence to carry the ball upto the midfield. Just don't get too carried away lad.

2217~~~
Jones was on the bench yesterday

2218~~~
Let's not beat around the bush. Not only is he not United quality, he isn't even Premiership quality. I hope he never plays for us again.

2219~~~
Some of the comments here. Wov.

2220~~~
Some very harsh comments on such a young player.
I hope he gets a loan next year and lots of games / experience
Looks a good prospect from what I have seen this season

2221~~~
WUM?

2222~~~
Not surprised by some of the comments. Seems all a defender needs to do these days is some mistakes and he's declared not good enough (well apart from when his name is Smalling it seems on the Caf whose mistakes and needless fouls in dangerous areas are usually quickly forgotten somehow). Even the likes of Varane or Hummels have been called overrated here in last few weeks after some mistakes, what chance does McNair stand then?

It's not like he is a highly rated world class talent who we bought for huge money on huge wages, instead he is a teenager from our own youth who has had some really good games in difficult circumstances for us and who is definitely not the reason we haven't won for 3 games. How can we expect any youth player to develop with no room for mistakes? 

I can understand if ppl already think he doesn't have the potential to be a top class CB for us (although I couldn't tell right now) but how anyone can be sure he will never be good enough even as a squad option considering some very promising games he has had is completely beyond me. 

Being a defender/gk is a very tough job anyway, especially at such a young age when you have not made a reputation yet. I mean a striker or attacker can miss a sitter or pass/cross to noone or shoot from 40 yards out and he will still be applauded. But a defender makes a mistake and he is immediately slated for that. However if the striker/attacker hadn't wasted a previous chance then the defender's later mistake would hardly have mattered  (just an example).

I hope LvG and our coaching staff have a bit more patience and faith in him as imo in the little time he has had at top level he has showed enough potential for a teenager and deserves a proper chance.

2223~~~
Hogwash

2224~~~
Personally, I think he's been our best player over the last three games. Maybe I'm nuts.

2225~~~
Nonsense. He's a 19 (20) year old kid making his way in football. He'll do well here.

2226~~~
Fortunately van Gaal seems to have faith in him as he continues to play him.

2227~~~
Yes he's young but he's making crucial mistakes in important games. Isn't his fault that he's being picked and he's played well at times but I hope to god that he isn't in the team again this season. He needs a loan somewhere before he's ready.

2228~~~
Agreed, I see potential in his game. He has been an adequate backup when called upon, sometimes much better than that. Other teams are going to score on us, all of our defenders make mistakes including some howlers. If the kid learns form his errors he could definitely make a contribution in the future.

2229~~~
The kid, even at 19, seems to have a football brain on him, which is probably why LvG keeps using him when Jones, Evans, and Rojo aren't available. The experience he gained his year will do him well next year.

2230~~~
This is a joke post, right?

2231~~~
He fouled a player. That's it. Still a top prospect.

2232~~~
20 years old, debut year. solid defending, good going forward thrown in the deep and still has only made a handful of mistakes. No idea what you guys are expecting from Mcnair in his first season of first team football but he has exceeded all my expectations so far.

2233~~~
But he miss a open header <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2234~~~
And RVP missed a penalty, always said he should have been playing Championship football.

2235~~~
I thought that would stir up some interest.

I worded it harshly, but no I don't think he will ever be good enough for us. Some parts of his play are very good, but he is far too suspect defensively for my taste. He would be better off moving back into midfield.

Also, if he is playing at a level lower in the Premiership in say 3 or 4 years time, you can't say I wasn't correct.

(I also don't think Harry Kane will make it either btw guys. But that's for another thread.)

2236~~~
That was pretty much the only time he had to defend the whole game and he ended up giving a silly foul.

2237~~~
He likes to maraud up the pitch, but I don't understand what exactly you meant by football brain. His positioning is suspect many many times and many times I have seen him make the wrong choice in terms of either trying to close down an attacker or just track back a bit till his other team mates can come back for cover. Sure he is young and very inexperienced but personally I don't feel he will be good enough as a first choice for us.

2238~~~
I want to commend him for helping to see out an important game on Saturday.

2239~~~
A loan elsewhere, preferably in the EPL would do him good. Plus, he would be a good "agent" for us next season as well if you know what I mean. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2240~~~
I don't get all the criticism, personally. People seem to even want to blame him for the offense sputtering recently. I think he's been fine.

2241~~~
Yep, letting Murray juggle the ball in our box was helping us out. He needs to go out on loan next season and just play regular football.

2242~~~
Is every small mistake players make now going to be highlighted and exaggerated on here? Or is it a simple case off I don't like such and such player so I'm going to pick up on his every mistake to prove that im right? Either way it's fecking pathetic.

2243~~~
So what do we think of the lads prospects for next season then?

2244~~~
If only Evans is getting replaced I could still see him play a role he wouldn't have expected before this year started. I don't think he will go out on loan, he's a perfect talent for van Gaal to personally work with.

I really like him, he's got to improve defensively but he's good with the ball at his feet already and doesn't panick often. I wonder what his best position will be though: midfielder, rightback or centreback.

2245~~~
Don't think he solid enough defensively to play at CB. I wouldn't mind seeing him in DM or CM more as he seems good on the ball and can actually bring it forward, and in retrospect his passing will most likely be decent enough as he will have more time on the ball.

We should try to set out a loan for him, with the requirement to play DM for the other side to see how he gets on. I'm surprised he was picked ahead of Thorpe in all fairness as he's a much better and more natural defender.

2246~~~
IMO we need to decide on a position for him and find somewhere he can play regular football in that position.  I don't think playing against kids in the U21s and the odd first team game will help him in the long-term.

2247~~~
Played very well and will only get better.

2248~~~
Hoping for a loan at a good team, think that would really be for his benefit.

2249~~~
for me, he took his chance with both hands last season
i fully expect him to feature next year and i'm looking forward to him improving again

2250~~~
He impressed me last season. Especially when called upon against Lukaku, who Paddy kept in his back pocket.

Someone has to bring a gif of that header against West Ham. One of the best defensive headers I have ever seen.

2251~~~
He is a CB, leave him at CB. Sure he used to play in midfield but he has never played there at senior or u21 level. Being good on the ball for a CB doesn't make you a midfielder, if we want a youth DM then Ben Pearson would play Paddy off the park. Paddy has showed a lot of promise at CB and just needs to get stronger and used to playing senior football. Once he does he will be more confident and cut out some of the little mistakes or moments of indecision he has. Supposedly van Gaal doesn't like loaning so I imagine he'll stay and with our injuries he'll get a decent number of games anyway.

2252~~~
I thought he was poor most of the games he played. But it looks like LVG saw something in him, so maybe we'll see improvements next year.

2253~~~
He clearly wasn't given his age and respective experience in the positions he played. 

Young center backs by their nature are inconsistent and make mistakes. If the manager chooses to select them its something fans have to put up with.
