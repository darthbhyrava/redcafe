1~~~
I think he'll end up being our best CB by the end of the season.

2~~~
I'd love to know what van Gaal thinks of his ability in midfield, just out of curiosity, since we've seen him play there a bit.

3~~~
Centre half is his best position in my opinion he has all the qualities to succeed there.. Anyway even though he could be used in midfield, it won't happen.. Sheer lack of numbers back there given we plan on playing 3.

4~~~
I really like Jones in that midfield terrorisor position. He's good there and makes up for his current lack of discipline as a defender. 

However I totally agree with the above. Long term he's a CB, and given how few of those we have, I can't see him in midfield. 

Also he's too limited to play CM in a 3-5-2. He would need to be the base of a 3 if he was to play there.

5~~~
Yeah, don't think he will be playing in the midfield any time soon.

6~~~
Has it all to prove this season for me. After a great start to his United career, I feel he's gone backwards. Personally, I'm really not convinced he's as good as we all hoped or thought he was. He's a very blood and thunder defender, and throws himself about far too much. He really needs to add some calmness to his game and learn when to, and when not to dive in to challenges.

7~~~
The problem is last season. It seems like everything at the club has halted, and those that we were expecting to really kick on and progress have not really had the opportunity to do so. I think we will see a few players this season come to life, Jones being one of them. Agree with the OP, he'll be our best defender this season.

8~~~
Jones did kick on though, its just it was in midfield where he did a good job and looked more comfortable passing the ball around.

9~~~
Not particularly. He may have improved as a midfielder but we still were never able to control games with him playing there. We all know his potential lies at centre half and that's where we want to see him, and in that respect due to rotation and injuries we didn't manage to see significant progress.

10~~~
OH sh!t, I did not mean to start a conversation about Jones in midfield!

It was more like a sideshow curiosity, it's been probably the weirdest debate of the last few years, and I certainly didn't mean to revive it.

I was actually kinda hoping van Gaal thinks it's a silly idea and would dismiss it.

Don't get me wrong, he can do a job there, a great job even, but I get the idea van Gaal wants a lot more from his midfielders than that.

Being in a back 3 will allow him to be more involved in the offense anyway, so it's a good position for him I think.

11~~~
His performances and generally those of a stopper in midfield, dont have a significant effect on controlling games. Their role is to stop the enemies' moves before they get out of hand, put out fires and give the ball to better ball players. Its on someone else to make sure we fluently pass the ball into good areas.

He broke up play and passed the ball better than he had previously, on the ball he looked like a defensive midfielder which is the role he was playing. No longer did he look like a CB being asked to play in midfield.

Then he got injured and didn't come back performing as strongly as he was before injury and I dont believe he was used in midfield much as our plans had moved on. When he played he was used in defence.

I'm not saying we should use him in midfield, but there was clear progression from the player. He was doing a better job than the previous season when he played the role. He didn't stagnate and not improve, he just improved in the role that he was being used most often in until he got injured and his season disrupted

12~~~
This is his season to show us what kind of player he's going to develop into. He won't be playing in midfield purely because of our CB numbers so for the first time in his United career, he has the perfect chance to stake his claim for a CB position. (this could change depending on signings, of course)

13~~~
Personally, I think Jones was a poor buy. All well and good to dream that he'll succeed, but the evidence and the track record are just not there.

14~~~
I think mostly due to us not wanting to use him in CB he hasnt lived up to the price tag. And now we need to play him there and make up for lost time.

At the same time the skills he's learned at right back and in defensive midfield aren't just forgotten once he goes to CB. In some ways it should help him on the ball from the CB position. But he's not the person you think of as a composed ball player, so he might need to learn to relax a little bit and not do everything like he's in a hurry to play the position. There's nothing wrong with his passing for that kind of role, just his mind

15~~~
Injuries aside he would have developed fine had he just been played consistently at CB.

16~~~
An excellent post.

17~~~
playing with 3 CBs should benefit smalling and jones the most, more playing time at their actual position now.

18~~~
I know what his role was, but that role is pretty much redundant at a side like Man Utd who want to play attacking football. To play a midfielder who's sole job is to defend in a 2 man central midfield is going to hamper any desire to control games and play good football. Carrick does all of what Jones does with exceptional positioning, awareness and reading of the game and he's able to dictate the tempo with his ability on the ball. Unfortunately, his role included more responsibility further up the field last season which didn't suit him, and thus didn't have a season as good as the previous one. 

Jones may have improved in that area, but it's still clear that he's a natural centre half as his instincts differ to those of a natural midfielder. Even out and out DM's like De Jong and Makelele are/were aware of what's around them and composed on the ball; Jones isn't, and if he feels pressurised or uncertain he will get rid, instead of making space for himself and laying off a simple ball. It's unfamiliar territory for him, and as a centre half he's a good ball player because he's used to the role and is aware of where pressure may occur, whilst having more time on the ball and all of his passing options pretty much in front of him. If he played Midfield for 10 years he may develop those instincts and become a good defensive midfielder, but with the potential he has at centre half it would be an absolute waste.

19~~~
Personally, I've never been a fan. He has a lot to prove, hopefully he can this season. He just always looked like he was prone to lapses in concentration or he'd go gung-ho and get injured. The three-back should help him, let's hope he can progress and hit the heights so many expect.

20~~~
A bit like Smalling (although different type of player) aren't quite where they should be in their development. Both suffering from the John O'shea syndrome. Can you imagine Vidic or Rio playing RB or defensive midfield?

21~~~
No, but thats also why Jones and Smalling might suit playng in a back 3 better than Rio or Vidic

22~~~
Sky sports reporting that he's out of tonight's game.

23~~~
he seems to be match fit. I predict an injury during the game.

24~~~
Sky Sports is full of sh*t.

25~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Was just thinking that. Maybe they meant Smalling?

26~~~
They're thinking 'Let's wind up the United fans', so I wanted to call them out.

Amazing how completely unreliable every since media source is.

27~~~
I know right. Had all my hopes on Sky Sports too. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

28~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Well, they're are definitely on the 'more official' side. 

Personally I think TV stations and serious papers would do well to stay away from that sort of fantasy journalism, so that when they did say something people could believe it. 

At least put all that sort of stuff in a seperate, 'what the tabloids are saying' section so people don't think that the rest of your information is that unreliable.

29~~~
Very impressive today.

Was a real leader in the 2nd half as well with Blackett and Keane on either side.

30~~~
Yeah, good stuff. Tough in the slide tackle and made some vital blocks. Needs to be a bit stronger with his awareness though, he shouldn't need to rely too much on last ditch tackling.

31~~~
Was great today. Always alert, cleaning the others mess. Won pretty much every ball he went for.

Nice from him to help and teach the younger CBs coming through the ranks. He looked like the captain back there. (screaming on them, but with a confident and commanding tone, and re comforting at the same time)

not like the scenes of Cleverley moving his arms and screaming like a girl every time he lost the ball (not captain material here...)...

32~~~
Like him as the centre of those back three. Play him there every week and he'll flourish. Nailed on to be the next club captain after this one IMO.

33~~~
Jones and Evans will be the heart of our defense this season. It is all up to Smalling to make the third CB spot his now.

34~~~
Yup, although Blackett is a surprise contender to that #3 spot.

35~~~
Blackett and Keane plus Potential signings will be his contenders but I think right now Smalling should be seen as the main contender for the third CB spot.

36~~~
Blackett isn't ready yet, lets players get in behind far too easily. Fantastic on the ball though, he pinged a 50 yard ball over the top to Rooney to absolute perfection in the second half.

37~~~
Commanding today, especially in the second half where he acted as sweeper on more than one occasion when Cleverley got caught out.

38~~~
I think he showed that RCB is much more optimal spot for him than CCB is. Although some of his challenges were good, he still lacks positional sense, but with his speed and his acceleration, reaction he could we be very good RCB.

39~~~
United have 3 very good CB's, the only problem is keeping them injury free!

I'd even be tempted to give one of them the captains armband to see if that extra responsibility could some how have a positive effect on there injury luck.

Strange idea, but sometimes the mind is the bigger problem, see Valemcia post leg break.

40~~~
I don't even think Valencia's is a good example, he was fantastic when he made his comeback, but then became what he is today the season after. Cleverley is more apt.

41~~~
Excellent performance by Jones tonight. Hope he secures a permanent CB spot. He's much more likely to get himself injured if he's not playing the midfield stopper role too.

42~~~
He's still very young. I think if he's played cb consistently and stays fit, he will be one world class defender...

43~~~
Sorry, meant to say "much less likely" above. He's a lunatic in the stopper role.

44~~~
Positive to see Jones' performance. Looked very confident and didn't make many mistakes at all. Always thought he looked error prone at CB in previous seasons but yesterday he looked beastly. Great to see him playing in his <b>natural position</b>. fecking right back... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

45~~~
I've only just got round to watching last nights game and PJ was man of the match for me. Looked very comfortable at the back and in the second half he seemed to have the youngsters either side of him arranged very well. Madrid had very few good chances and I think that was more to do with our very well disciplined shape at the back, rather than Madrid's lack of creativity.

46~~~
Poorish first, much improved second. Somehow ended up closing down Liverpool on their 18 yard line.


Phil Jones.

47~~~
I worry about him the most of our centerbacks.  His decision making on the right is <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

48~~~
Not a penalty.

49~~~
Who needs Benatia when you got Jones ;p? Played fantastic, his pace is a very very big weapon, first match in a long time without brainfarts.

50~~~
Along with Blackett and Smalling we have 3 very quick centre backs. On Smalling and Jones there's no surprise they're looking so solid right now, they're finally getting a run in their actual positions.

51~~~
I like when he decides to turn into Messi and start dribbling everyone on the pitch.

52~~~
Despite the Caf going soft on the mop because he got shit on I think Jones was clearly our best player today, strong and fast with some excellent interceptions and he plugged the gap a couple of times when Valencia got the other side of Young.

53~~~
The talent is there both with him and Smalling. Hopefully Van Gaal is the man to unlock it fully. No more right back, no more midfield.

54~~~
Played very well, think he's nailed on for the right CB role this season and Smalling the same in the middle.

55~~~
Thought Smalling and Blackett were better than him. he still had a good game, tho.

56~~~
Looks ready to step up big time, really impressed with him today.

57~~~
One of the very few bright spots for us today, tackled well, tracked runners well and looked commanding.

58~~~
Looked a bit nervy at first, settled well and was probably one of our best players overall in the end, not that that took much.

59~~~
Had a good game.

60~~~
Credit for the last ditch defending but looks so uncomfortable with the ball and where had he gone for the Swansea 2nd?

Hope youse are all right about him but worries me fairly constantly - not convinced

61~~~
MOTM for me today. Solid, and made some great last ditch tackles.

62~~~
He might looks clumsy with the ball sometimes, because of his huge and crooked physical build, but if you take the 'Jonny Evans brain-fart passing factor' into account, Phil Jones might actually be our best ball playing centre-back. He's no Vertonghen or Pique, but he's played some brilliant passes in our last 5 or 6 matches.

Considering Phil Jones is only 22 years old, I wouldn't be surprised if he literally becomes the best or top 3 defenders in the world. Can't really name a more talented CB in the -23 years of age category, I like Jones as much as Varane (who is 9 months younger).

63~~~
He's gonna get injured very soon sadly, his style of play is way too crazy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

64~~~
Whatever we say, he has to play CB doesn't he?  With some calm, commanding presence next to him, passing on a bit of positional nous - and see how it goes

not FB or MF (assumes we improve the 'dynamism' of the MF at some point, surely...)

65~~~
I agree ............ which will be a shame.  Played some good stuff today, but his overenthusiasm in the tackle is worrying.

66~~~
Poor first half. Excellent Last ditch tackles in the second made him look better.

67~~~
How is he our best rated player? His last ditch tackles were from situations he created.

68~~~
Have never seen him as a truly natural defender.  A 6 yard box defender who'll make Blackburn-style last ditch tackles, and will throw himself at and under anything near the goal, but not a reliable defender for a top team where concentration, playing higher up the pitch and pure defensive nous is key.

ObviousIy he's young, but I'll be surprised if he becomes a top-level centre back.

69~~~
Not sure if serious...

70~~~
We see him do this a lot, stretch himself and make last ditch tackles. Without him today it could of been embarrassing, but the question you have to ask is why is he having to do that in the first place?

71~~~
He was poor in the first half but come out second half a different player much more confident.

72~~~
Him and Smalling are just awful on the ball. It's a real problem area.

73~~~
I don't think they were that bad, but it's something Van Gaal said he'd work with them at. Can't expect it to happen overnight.

74~~~
Whenever teams hit us on the brak...Smalling and Jones seem to not have an idea as to what they are supposed to do......Jones seems like he is still very far away from sorting out his game apart from his brave heart tackles...Smalling too just looks absolutely miles off the pace to be ready to be our main defender

75~~~
Just because he always makes last-ditch challenges doesn't mean he can't defend FFS, not everyone is Baresi. He's growing into his new role, he'll be fabulous for us if he stays healthy. He's got one thing a lot of defenders don't have and that is he absolutely loves defending if that makes any sense, he lives for it and will do whatever is needed to stop the other team scoring. He needs to refine a few things but he's going to thrive under LVG.

76~~~
Him and Smalling showed progress to me, they pressed and looked positive. They need to improve on the ball but in terms of general defending they looked good. Smalling muscled Bony often. Inexperience in other defensive areas cost us, Jones will be top-class if he stays healthy.

77~~~
Exactly. I think he had a poor game today and just because he did some nice tackles doesn't hide the fact he was bad. 

Started off poorly as well on Swansea first attack. Yeah Jesse let Routledge go but that is just him playing out of position and lack of experience. Jones had no idea where routledge was and was too far away from Jesse in terms of position. If it wasn't for the fact Routledge touch was so poor, they would of been in. Out of the starting defence, Jones was the poorest today.

78~~~
How is he winning the MOTM poll?

I thought his positioning was awful. Yes he made some last minute heroic tackles but if he hadn't been inept in his defensive positioning he wouldn't have been in a position where he needed to make those last ditch tackles in the first place.

79~~~
Dead serious. For example:

Have you ever seen Ramos play in CDM? Ancelotti used him there vs. Barca away last season.

Phil Jones played in midfield vs. Real Madrid, also once for England vs. Spain. He looked way better with the ball at his feet playing in midfield than Ramos did playing in midfield.

Now defensively, Jones is talented for sure, he's got all the assets Ramos has and the same wildness. And Ramos is considered to be a CB who's pretty good with the ball, he looks pretty smooth and silky although he can make some wild passes. But when you compare them playing in midfield where there's less time and more pressure on your passing, I think Jones has shown to play better there with the ball. Hence the comments about him looking a bit goofy, but being a deceptively good passer.

80~~~
He looks well built and you'd think he'd be strong but he got brushed off like a cobweb by Bony for the 1st goal.

81~~~
Bony is a bit of a tank tbh.

82~~~
Agreed. Jones may not be the most elegant CB, but he more than makes up for it by being incredibly athletic. The tactical side of his game will improve as he get older. Now obviously our defense did not play a blinder yesterday, but laying all the blame on them for the goals conceded is very unfair imo. Fletcher or Herrera should have tracked Ki. Letting a man stand unmarked at 20 yards is unforgivable.

Young was poorly placed for the second, but isn't exactly a fullback by trade. 

Switching from four to three at the back is a very radical change, and it will take time to adjust. Both Jones, Smalling and Evans are young still, and imo, all three of them have a very high potential. Get Shaw and Rafael back, and we have a back 3(5) who is not only young, but also has a very high ceiling.

83~~~
I'm not convinced by him still. Great at last ditch tackles and can handle one on ones, but in terms of proper positioning and knowing where to be in key moments, he's still all over the place. I expected him to step it up this season but truth is, I'm yet to see a proper proper defender in him. He seems to have to do more than he should to snuff out trouble.

84~~~
Evans is too old for that excuse now, he is 27 in 4 months time.

If he hasn't realised his potential by now, he is never going to.

85~~~
He did really well yesterday and I don't think he should be blamed for being blocked by Bony. He was the stand out player in yesterday's game and it seemed like he wanted things to happen more than the rest of our team.

86~~~
he was our best defender yesterday imo, even when asked to play at Right Back, he showed strength, determination & most importantly did his job well

87~~~
The best of the lot of the three yesterday. He will become very special.

88~~~
agreed, he will be at least as good as Rio at his peak for us eventually imo (that's assuming he stays of course, which if we keep not signing players he won't because we won't be in Europe again for years)

89~~~
Why do people feel the need to say things like "at least as good as peak Rio?" Is it like a wild counter argument to people saying he's shit or something?

90~~~
Tbf to Jones, he hasn't really had Rio or Vidic to guide/teach him unlike Smalling and Evans. Most of his games at CB have come partnered with Evans or Smalling.

Both Evans and Smalling have had extended runs at their time here being partnered by Vidic or Rio. I think they're both defenders for that experience.

91~~~
no? not to me anyway, Rio at his best was world class, anyone who can be that good or better is going to be an immense player...

92~~~
I thought he played well, but the only thing that annoys me about him is, after that great run he made during the game he was then limping, every challenge he goes into he comes out of it limping. Now is he hurt or is it for show. How many times are people holding their breath because they think he's hurt himself and he hasn't. If Jones was injured everytime he starts limping he would never leave the treatment room. He either needs to be fitter if running is causing him to limp or to man up a bit.

93~~~
I thought he was brilliant. Puts in some crunching tackles.

94~~~
At least as good as our best ever defender at his peak? Really?

95~~~
I think he's more likely to be that good than he is to stay at United if we don't make the top four again this year.

96~~~
Impossible to fault him for trying and throwing himself into tackles etc but I think the way he does get caught out of position or find himself in no mans land from time to time is worrying. 

He's erratic enough at times and if he could learn to keep a cooler head, try to stay a step ahead of the posse instead of panicking the way he does sometimes when under pressure he'd be far better off.

97~~~
All over the place in the first half again. When will he at least show some signs of player who is maturing? Exposing our already soft backline time and time again with David Luiz style of defending. 

I am not pleased with him at all.

98~~~
I dunno, the point of the 3 defenders is for them to be more aggressive.. stepping up and cutting out early.

I thought he had a good half personally. Sometimes his ploughing forward was a little risky, but when no one else is doing it....

99~~~
Tbh, he has had to do a lot of covering for Valencia already. So that has pulled him out to the right quite a bit. Perhaps Jones is so fed up with our poor midfield, he feels has to do something with the ball.

100~~~
Scarily, Blackett has probably coped better with covering Young than Jones has covering Valencia.

101~~~
Good point about Valencia, their understanding was terrible, but even Valencia was covering for him probably more often than he was for Valencia. His high up field trips cannot be explained though, it's just his game since he signed for us, no way he is instructed to attack that high.

102~~~
Well thats not really a fair comparison. Young has shown some capacity to learn how to defend so Blackett has less he has to cover for. Despite playing at right back a bunch of times Antonio Valencia has shown no ability to defend at all. He likes to run at a player and aggressively put his foot in to tackle or usually give away a freekick, but any actual defending his goal he remains clueless about.

103~~~
I don't understand why we play Jones on the right and Smalling in the middle. They would both be more effective if it were switched the other way round.

104~~~
Taken to Van Gaal's system pretty well IMO.

105~~~
I don't think so. It was another performance in which second half he was best of a bad bunch due to last ditch defending but he really struggles positionally.

106~~~
I'd have thought that playing 3 at the back would give him more room to charge forward with the ball. Obviously, Valencia and Young would need to stay further back but it's something different. There were times today where Jones had the ball with plenty of room ahead of him and instead of carrying it forward he was looking for the first available pass.

107~~~
Interesting performance by him today. First half he and Valencia looked dodgy on the right in terms of space in between.

2nd half as the leader in central position he was very good.

108~~~
He was fantastic. Agree that he and Smalling should switch positions as Smalling's ability to step forward and play a decent pass isn't anywhere near good enough to play as the central defender in the 3. Very vocal today too.

109~~~
He was very good today. Stealing Stevie's "we go again" rallying call isn't on though. Be original at least!

110~~~
I'd like to see him as the central man of the 3 too. He likes to bring the ball forward. Smalling had a lot of 'free' possession to bring the ball into midfield but he didn't know what to do with it. Jones was MoM again

111~~~
Jones is still learning to be a CB so i'm just happy he is starting at CB and so far has come through 2 games without severely injured himself.

This season will not be pretty for Smalling or Jones but the more games they can play together the better. Jones is the least of LVG's worries.

112~~~
I doubt that. A 10 year old girl would be better on the ball than Smalling is. Jones would serve as an easier outlet for him the way it is now.

113~~~
I like you.

114~~~
Neville picked him out as our best performer in commentary, for what it's worth. The Caf is probably right though if they say he was shit.

115~~~
This!!

116~~~
The central CB in a 3-man defence is typically meant to be the one who carries the ball forwards and plays ahead of the other two. Smalling however plays deeper than the other two CBs, which means he does not distribute the ball or carry it forwards as well, and it means if one of the other CBs DOES venture forwards it leaves us very lopsided at the back.

The whole point of putting Jones in the middle would be because he is better than Smalling on the ball. However Smalling I regard as a much better defender than Jones, meaning his natural tendency to drop back and cover would be of more benefit than it is currently.

117~~~
I'm not entirely sure why people throughout the matchday thread and possibly in here (haven't read through) were suggesting he was only doing last ditch stuff today. Very solid from Jones, he's showing maturity and is probably the only 'senior' outfield player who hasn't pissed me off in the two games for us. The test will be against a seriously good team to see where he really is.

118~~~
As a right center back he has no business charging around the center line. Wickham holds it up, protects it from him and then they play it right where he came from, that's just poor stuff really.

119~~~
Now that Scholes has retired and Evra sold, he's now my favorite United player.

120~~~
Like people have mentioned, he did look a bit shaky in the first half, but lets not forget this is still a system that Jones, and our other centre backs have to get used to. They will find themselves defending a lot more in wide areas, as opposed to when you're are playing two at the back. Sunderland obviously knew that and were going with diagonal balls in behind our wing backs from the get go, who looked pretty lost when defending, to be honest. I think we'd look a lot more solid when Rafael and Shaw are back, as they are defensively better, and playing at full back requires them to defend spaces in behind a lot more often than Valencia and Young who are natural wingers. Everything taken into account, I think Jones had a very good yesterday, especially in the second half.

121~~~
I thought he was very good, personally. I think most of the criticism here came just after the first half, where the totality of our defending and playing out from the back was shambolic, so not really fair to single Jones out. But he really kept us solid in the second half, with two very young defenders either side of him. And it wasn't just last ditch stuff as some have suggested, his positioning was often very good, he spotted the potential danger well in advance and made the appropriate decision quite a few times.

122~~~
Has LVG said much about how he rates Jones, currently and potentially?

123~~~
I think Jones and Blackett have been the most impressive CB's so far. I wouldn't call Jones injury prone which means that I think with a good run of games he could develop into our best CB.

124~~~
Jesus, fecking shocking so far.

125~~~
Been really solid after the shaky start. Will get more comfortable when playing in a settled back line. Hopefully Rafael, Shaw, Rojo are fit/ eligible to play soon.

126~~~
The only one holding our defence together.

127~~~
If Jones was injured at this point, we would loose every match. Feel sorry for him to have to clean up the mess after Valencia, Young, Blackett and Evans.

128~~~
Arguably our best player so far this season IMO. He's been surrounded by dire CB's in every game he's played so far this season but he has been holding it together well.

129~~~
Been the only defender who has remembered how to defend this season. Just hope he stays fit and he should be starting most games at CB.

Personally, he'd have been my choice for vice-captain.

130~~~
yep our best palyer so far in the season.

131~~~
yeah Evans.

132~~~
At this moment he is far and away our best defender. 

He did start nervously though

133~~~
Starting to deliver. I hope he keeps this start up.

134~~~
No, Evans is equally as shit but first 15 minutes for Jones was a fecking circus, he should be kissing de Gea's ass in the locker room right now. Thank God he somewhat settled after that period.

Oh my God we're arguing who's our worst defender.

135~~~
Apart from the time he charged out and floored all in front of him which led to a free kicking being hopped off the cross bar he's done alright. The best of a bad lot at the back so far anyways.

136~~~
He's our number one CB now. Evans looks all over the place.

137~~~
Covering Evans' back all day. Burnley would've score by now if he wasn't on his game.

138~~~
Best defender again and looks a lot more suited to the middle CB role than smalling did.

Fairly good, but with a couple of rash moments like normal

140~~~
Held it together for us at the back today. Been impressed with his start to the season.

141~~~
He's been our only good player so far.

142~~~
Looks to be our only consistent CB at the moment

143~~~
Probably our only player this season who has been playing ok so far.

144~~~
IF we go to a back 4 how do people think him and Rojo would go together as the CBs?

145~~~
Are people really forgetting or trying to ignore the first 15 minutes from him? In 2nd minute we could've been 1-0 down after him charging like an idiot into their striker, crossbar saved us from the free kick. Then he was flopping around the pitch, slipping like Steven and positioning wrongly all the time. Credit where it's due, he's got his shit together later in the game but God, to call him 'best' or 'consistent' is just making my eyes bleed.

He's doing this kind of shit every single game. Stupid fouls, out of position just to do the last-ditch tackle that wouldn't be needed in first place if he wasn't going full retard all the time.

146~~~
He is because the others have been dogshite.

147~~~
To be fair he's probably our player of the year so far. Was the best defender again today I thought. Still had a few bad moments but compared to the rest he was good.

148~~~
Excellent. One of the few positives of this season so far.

149~~~
Very good again today. Love how he's trying to be the leader at the back, someone needs to.

150~~~
He was good. Good to see him playing the central role, where you need someone leading. He does that. Was great to see him giving 'our best defender' Evans a real bollocking.

151~~~
the only one showing passion and willingness to organise the defence. Evans has more to fight with himself and his lack of confidence. Complete liability at the moment.

152~~~
Bulls on parade.  They don't complement each other besides preferring the opposite foot.

153~~~
That wqs Valencia he was bollocking.

154~~~
Absolutely.

155~~~
I hope he is now seen by the club as a centre half only and not a utility man, apart from in exceptional circumstances. 

Done quite well so far this season.

156~~~
He was doing the job of 2 defenders, his and Evans'. Evans was shocking today whilst Jones was excellent. I'm not surprised he's the one to pull the weight as I always thought he's got the potential to succeed if he's given a chance at making that role his.

157~~~
Was good to see him constantly talking too. Gave Evans a bit of a bollocking at one point. We need some leadership.

158~~~
Has stepped up with Vida and Rio leaving.

159~~~
true...plus he s only 22 - at times ppl forget that.

160~~~
Been by far our best defender so far this season. Blackett has done alright too but hopefully its a sign he's starting to step it up. Hopefully he stays clear of injuries.

161~~~
He's really stepped up in so far this season. Hope it can continue. Ideally, I'd still like an experienced player to talk to him and keep him in check, but his performances have been promising, in my opinion.

162~~~
Yeah that's what I thought, they both seem like the need a cool and composed player next to them.

163~~~
Has been phenomenal this season. Has held the back like Vidic at times. It's very promising stuff seeing as this is something we can build off, unlike the previous few seasons where we looked like losing every game due to our defence. Now we look more likely to hold down a clean sheet and scrape a goal or two. It's absolutely crazy to think Jones is only 22.

164~~~
Liking the look of him at the moment. Got a real 'Over my dead body!' attitude to defending. And all them faces he pulls? That's just him conveying the mixture of terror and defiance the thought of conceding goals so clearly fills him with.

Really liked the look of him in 2011/12 as well, especially in the first months of the season, with those bursting runs forward and last ditch tackles.

Injuries and being played out of position in a struggling side haven't done him any favours over the last two years.

But he's young, and could yet turn out to fulfil the potential that saw both Wenger and Ferguson want to sign him.

165~~~
I think he's clearly our best center back this season.

166~~~
Jones looks like the one capable of stepping forward and becoming the 'leader' back there.

167~~~
A good performance from him, he is improving in my opinion and starting to look more composed both with the ball and in the tackle.

168~~~
I still don't understand what everyone sees in him.  He appears to be an average defender that makes up for his shortcomings in enthusiasm...

169~~~
Woah there Captain Hyperbole. Phenomenal? Held the back like Vidic? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He's been what he always is, a bit of a clumsy oaf with the occasion game that is suited to his bull in a china shop style of play.

170~~~
Ok, my bad. He's improved, a lot

171~~~
He's the real captain in waiting.

172~~~
Woah there Captain Hypercritical . Clumsy Oaf? bull in a china shop ?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I couldn't resist it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I just think we are seeing the reason why we bought him, To play Centre Half not right back or midfield
Of all our players he is the one that has upped his game this year.

173~~~
Just want to say amongst all the transfers and excitement over the past few days, our phil has really impressed me so far this season playing in his natural position, love the way he was yelling at the rest of the defence last game when they were being sloppy, honestly think he can go as far as he wants in terms of becoming a world class defender, still only 22.

174~~~
This. Love Phil Jones. Hope he continues to get constant games in his preferred position and continues to improve. Been very impressed with him so far this season.

175~~~
He spent a lot of the game having to come to the rescue for the mistakes other players made around him. Exactly why I think he is our best defender.

176~~~
The fact Jones can make up for his and others bad positional defending is great asset. He wont have to rely on it as much as he gets older because he should pick up good positions with experience, our best player so far!

177~~~
Big season for Jones. I think he's going to step up, with a couple of others.

178~~~
Has been very impressive so far this season. I shall start referring to him as 'One'.

#SmallingPlusOne

179~~~
He's really leading from the back. Very impressive, along with Blackett (who just needs to cut out the hoofing)

180~~~
He is not going to be a Rio for us but his positional sense will get better as he gets older. Right now he's already starting to display leadership qualities of a seasoned defender. He's going to be fantastic for us.

181~~~
Really impressed with how he has stepped up this season. Love his last minute tackles and interceptions; they have become so crucial for us already.

However, I have my doubts about his ability to play the in the middle of a back 3. The middle CB in the back 3 needs to be able to step up, carry the ball and pass it very well- which so far all of Jones, Smalling and Evans have failed at. What was also interesting to see was that LVG preferred Jones as the center of the middle 3 over Evans; I would have thought Evans would be preferred there for 1) his ability to pass the ball 2) Jones' ability to play right back. However, it was Evans playing at the right of a back 3; which possibly shows LVG trusting Jones more with the ball and/or as a leader

182~~~
He is going to be the real  for us. Has been excellent so far for England, he has that presence of a Centre back. Not giving one inch of space for the opponent to take advantage.I just hope he doesn't get injured.

He can be England's best centre back, and most importantly Man utd's best centre back.

183~~~
Continuing on his impressive form for the national side. Good to see.

184~~~
was always the case, not just this season. If he stays injury free and gets a run of games at CB, easily the best centre back at the club.

185~~~
The only position he has the ability to become top class is centre half in my opinion. Barring an absolute emergency, I hope we resist any temptation to use him as a utility man this season. Now's the time for his development to be solely in central defence and hopefully we will then see the rewards.

186~~~
I also think he already is the best centre back at the club to be honest. Not slagging off the others but I've always been a big fan of jones.

187~~~
Did he play in the centre for England tonight?

188~~~
Yes left CB with Cahill.

189~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://static.goal.com/452000/452050.jpg" src="http://static.goal.com/452000/452050.jpg"/> 

That face again<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

190~~~
Got skinned by King which could have cost a goal.  Otherwise fine.

191~~~
No what could've cost us a goal was Cahill passing it to King in the first place!

192~~~
That too.  It was poor by both of them.

193~~~
No thanks to Cahill and every CB struggles with those because they know the other player is waiting for the slightest chance to go over. You could see how compact he made himself when making the challenge to reduce the risk.

I thought he had a fine game.

194~~~
Surely that's a commonly held opinion?

195~~~
Yeah, exactly. He should have maybe been more fleet footed/decisive and shepherded him more but he reduced the angle well and didn't dive in for a silly tackle and probable Penalty which he usually did more before. He was thinking of it and then let him go instead on the narrow angle which though not ideal wasn't bad considering the pace at which he was coming and Harts position.

196~~~
Am honestly not following the narrative that he's comfortable on the ball and is now a commanding centre half. I've yet to see ANYTHING in Jones' locker that makes me understand why he was rated so highly at Blackburn. He has a poor first touch, his passing is erratic at best and he is reckless at times when cooler heads would prevail. Every time I see him travelling with the ball my internal monologue is shouting "GET RID" because I know that a heavy touch is likely just around the corner or he'll try to hit a team mate and instead pass it straight to the opposition. All that's happening at the minute is that Smalling is even worse and is taking attention away from him.

The one game in his entire United career that I've been impressed with him was vs Real Madrid at the Bernabeu and he man-marked Ronnie out of the game. Any other time he has been meh or dross.

197~~~
Really just a label he carries with him since the start at United. The guy averaged 88.3% in accurate passes last year and he was played plenty in the midfield and as a full back as well. 

Higher than Evans and Smalling as well as Kompany last year. This year has has greatly improved stats in terms of passing accuracy, tackling, long balls.

198~~~
He has a heavy touch when playing in CM. For a CB his ability on the ball is very good. It hasn't shown thus far in a 3-5-2 due to Cleverly/Fletcher rarely offering for the ball and the defence needing to go long as a result but that should change when Herrera returns or Blind is in the side. 

To say he's had 1 good game is a bit mental btw he had several excellent games when we won the 20th title.

199~~~
Hopefully he'll never play RB every again, but I remember those marauding runs down the line that show more ability on the ball than most CBs. Being really composed on the ball is not his strength, it was more his ability to change the pace quickly with his movement that sometimes made him a success running down the line, but it still involved some pretty decent ball control. Playing in the centre it's more congested and we don't get to see this so often (probably a good thing incase he loses the ball in that area...), but his ability on the ball is definitely underrated.

200~~~

201~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What? That's a really bizarre article and headline. He's been our best player so far this season.

202~~~
Neil Custis ? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Has he even watched United games ? He's been our best CB this season by a distance and just 22 and probably our best player overall. And he actually improved last season amongst the shambles compared to previous seasons.

Just because Van Gaal sold players this window now press will have a field day till january saying all kinds of players are faxing the axe etc..

Atleast pick the player to make it more believable. Or it's a sensationalistic clickbait.

203~~~
What a news story. He has been an absolute monster this year and if he kept it up he'd statistically be head and shoulders above T.Silva/Hummels/Kompany. 

He is in the form of his life and they somehow make him out as a scapegoat? I can't remember reading a story as incorrect and full of bullshit.

204~~~
If I was shit at my job, I'd get fired.

How do these guys just suck a story out their arses? Ffs.

205~~~
I think he has a future here, with a bit more experience he will cut out the rash tackles.

206~~~
Anyone else read that as Phil Babb Factor?

207~~~
I have found the praise for Jones to be a bit unwarranted this season/pre-season. He has been just as error prone as any of the other defenders, but by nature of the old John Terryesque last-ditch tackles, huffing and puffing etc he never seems to be victim of the same level of criticism that Smalling and Evans get.
I would say all the defenders have been as good/bad as each other so far, in different ways.

I do think the article posted is rather overdramatic though, there isnt any need for Jones to be "axed", but calling him our best player is rather far fetched.

208~~~
He is averaging 6 successful interceptions per game, and 6 successful clearances per game which is far and above any of our other defenders. Actually his successful tackles are at 3.7 which is below Valencia and Evans.

And then in possession he has highest passing accuracy of all our players(not just defenders) at 91.5% and this includes 4.7 long balls per game and around 1 key pass each game.

Considering all this and the fact that he hasn't made any obvious errors like all our other defenders even positionally in a new system they are adapting too while playing 2 different roles don't see how he isn't our best player so far. Not like there's been great amount of competition either.

209~~~
You'd think if they were going to fabricate a story about one of our CB's they'd have at least picked Evans given his last two outings.

210~~~
I think he's my favourite player these days. He always looks like he cares and he's always making those last ditch tackles and blocks. John Terry-esque. Only not a complete cnut.

211~~~
jesus christ. is there any way of calling people out on this shit? have they got no professionalism, its just making stuff up.

These cnuts go to uni to get into that career, and they have less respect than traffic wardens.

212~~~
This is fecking annoying, he is probably a confidence type player he is natural centre back whose versatility had worked against him. Does not need headlines like this.

For me right now he is one of our most important players, can be one of our main defenders for another 10 years

213~~~
This is the kind of bs that really annoys me. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

214~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

MOTM in 3 straight league games = Out-of-form Jones facing United axe.

How much do these press people make ? I'd like the job please if it's high paying. Premium wages for zero work. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

215~~~
He's our best defender. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

216~~~
That's not saying much really.
Monster? Form of his life? A sentence comparing Jones with Silva, Hummels and Kompany?

He's young and has potential but Christ, people are seriously lowering their standards with the praise Jones gets.

217~~~
I say he has been statistically ahead of them, it doesn't mean he is currently better than them, it surprisingly means exactly what it says "Statistically ahead of them". 

The statistics are mentioned above and they are higher than Thiago/Kompany/Hummels of previous years.

218~~~
He was heavily involved in a title winning year not in his favoured position. In his favoured position he always looks good at the age of 22.  

Why has it become such as a mad notion to include a utd player in the same bracket as other good players?

219~~~
A fabricated story is better than a real story. No research, no facts, you can have it say whatever you want. And in this case, the obvious ridiculousness of it is exactly what makes people read it. I bet his boss is very happy.

220~~~
I dont know if it is fabricated or not. Remember we held the same doubts about Welbeck being sold.

221~~~
It's true, often there is no smoke etc...

If it came from inside I just hope it's LVGs way to push him on. Although I think I preferred Fergies method of saying he could become a great.

222~~~
100% this.. I mean that's the why reason we have Vidal to pick for Saturday.... Oh wait

223~~~
We are not going to sell him. He's been playing really good for three matches. Even if he plays bad I doubt we are going to sell our versatility player. We still need his role.

224~~~
Jones isn't out of form. But trust the Sun to make up news.

225~~~
Out of all the United players they could accuse of being out of form it had to be one of our most in-form players. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

226~~~
If we sell Jones LvG and Woodward need to go! Enough said!

227~~~
I think he is also leading in votes for United's player of the month

228~~~
Stats are nonsense to be fair, Jones shouldn't be our busiest player against Swansea, Sunderland and Burnley.

The passing accuracy stats just shows how often we knock it around between the centre backs and the wing backs. Many of his last ditch tackles are only necessary as he made a mistake in the run up to it, and he gives away many dangerous free kicks.

He has the potential to be a good player though, he can play a number of positions and seems to be rarely injured.

229~~~
Wat? Many of his last ditch tackles were necessary because everyone else in the back line is playing horribly. He's been the only thing holding our defence together.

230~~~
Well that's just nonsense. A year ago that might have been true but it's certainly not remotely true to what occurred this season. The majority of his 'last ditch tackles' have been the product of Lingard, Januzaj and Valencia at wing back who need cover, whilst Smalling and Evans have actually played their way into trouble on numerous occasions requiring someone to clean up.

It means very little after 4 games but he's been our best performer by a distance so far.

231~~~
Nope, I agree with Manucho here, of course bar our horrible defense ( because it is horrible no matter how you look at it ) he's basically often putting himself on those situations. He's probably our only defender that's able to pull out those spectacular last ditch tackles, thus the praise. But it's himself that's quite often putting a necessity of those tackles.

232~~~
Phil Jones has really impressed me with the way he stepped up, he looks solid and made some really good interceptions and saved the other defenders with what some would call last ditch tackles a lot of times. I always thought that if he can stay fit, he would be the first name to be picked in any defense, be it a back 3 or a back 4.

233~~~
That's very true. WUM's obviously do get more hits then good, accurate stories.

234~~~
I know but it's still relevant. Off all our players Jones is the last one you could accuse of being out of form.

It's from the Sun of course it's not true. Chances are Neil Custis got two pieces of flint and starting rubbing them together and came up with this story himself.

235~~~
Easy to write about something that may or not not happen four months from now. No one will remember it then.

Even if someone at United wanted to send a message, he wouldn't do it through the Sun.

236~~~
Ridiculous headline. Jones has been fantastic so far this season, and for me our best player overall. Previously I was in the Evans + 1 camp but going on this season, it's definitely Jones who should be a certainty at the back.

237~~~
Im surprised neil custis' later tweet hasn't made it here after that story. He said :


‘not my opinion but LVG's i actually think he's ok'.

Thats quite a statement when you look into it, he tweeted it at 1055 pm last night, just as the back papers were breaking, he was quick to distance himself from it being an opinion piece about what he thought.

Then, he drectly says its 'lvg's' opinion. Thats a bold statement to make.

Something weird about this one, i dont like it. Have a feeling its not as b.s as people think.

238~~~
If that was the case then why does he keep playing him as the middle CB in the back three. He has played Smalling and Evans to the right of him and Jones tends to be in the middle. Surely he wants his best CB there.

239~~~
Our best player so far this season. No argument.

240~~~
Does Custis have twitter? We should tweet him this thread / MOTM results so far this season.

Bad form my arse.

241~~~
How would Custis know van Gaal's opinion? I somehow highly doubt he's shared it with him.

242~~~
He's been good this season, particularly bearing in mind it's a new system, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if LVG was a bit dubious about him. The last ditch stuff won't be as easy against really good sides. There you get punished for your mistakes. 

Hopefully we keep faith, though. He could be really good if he got consistent games at CB.

243~~~
The same way he and other journos knew that welbeck was likely to be sold. There are many ways these stories get out of the club. Doesn't mean they are accurate, but he must have heard this from someone he trusts

244~~~
Aye true enough.

245~~~
He's leading the league by a distance in interceptions. (Which are different to tackles or blocks.)

The people claiming he's only been doing last ditch tackles because of his own mistakes etc.. are just living in stereotype frankly.

246~~~
He's been very good - surprised me! He's been our best player this season, I think. He's perfectly suited for this set-up, as is Smalling tbf. I'm looking forward to seeing Rojo in there as well. I wonder if I would have Jones in the middle and Smalling to the right, but then again, Smalling is much better in the air than Jones.

247~~~
Smalling's defensive attributes are well suited for this system. He is big, quick and strong and his positioning has gotten better too. His on the ball ability is the big letdown though in this system for me. Jones when he has space can drive forward with the ball, even shimmy past a defender and then pass, or just make better medium/long passes. Smalling on the other hand with space in front of him just takes his time and passes it sideways too much. And when pressed particularly he doesn't have a way to get out which results in pass back to de gea or other defenders putting them in pressure.

248~~~
I think you are spot on here, mate. Smalling's physical attributes are perfect, but his passing and inability to carry the ball out of defense do let him down a little, sadly. Sounds like Rojo will be very good at that though, so hopefully Smalling will simply be the defending best of the trio - he's a beast in the air and won't lose many races either. Jones is very good, but he struggles against strong and big opponents like Lukaku.

249~~~
I know right ? Maybe this is what <a class="username" data-user="69151, @Annahnomoss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69151/">@Annahnomoss</a> was referring to. The sample size is really small but as of now Jones is outperforming some of the best defenders around in their peak seasons :

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s28.postimg.org/r1mvqmz65/Untitled.png" src="http://s28.postimg.org/r1mvqmz65/Untitled.png"/></a>

250~~~
Currently Jones is a beast, if he stays fit, and gets a good run of games he will soon be among the best I reckon, he has all the attributes to be one of the best, the only thing he is missing is positioning and his aggression/control, but that will come soon.

251~~~
I got the boot stuck into me on here for suggesting that this is his last season and I still think it's happening. I agree that he's hugely improved but the problem is he's improved on being hilariously shit to being average and still not good enough. Wouldn't be surprised if LVG doesn't fancy him. Could we do better? yes. Have we got the money to? Yes. All adds up to no more Jones for me.

252~~~
Dont remember the time Jones was hilariously shit, he hasnt been good always but hilariously shit? Think you replaced Evans with Jones.

253~~~
Spot on. Also he's not average now like dude suggested :

Potentially world class more like. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

254~~~
Nope. They're both Keystone Cops defenders.

That Squawka stuff is hilarious. You stats junkies do know that according to Squawka Jones was a better performer than Kompany last season? REally?

255~~~
Sure you're not misplacing Jones with Bartra/Pique?

256~~~
Because it seems like Jones has been around for ages I think people forget he is only 22. He's done really well so far this season. Our best player. Hopefully he stays injury free, this could be a key season in his development as it could be his first where he is played consistently at CB. I really think he could kick on and become an important player for us if given a good run in his natural position.

257~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Quite sure.

258~~~
Now serious, when has Jones been hilariously shit?

259~~~
For ever man <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's mediocre. Big heart yes I'll give him that. Not good enough for where this team is going. Severley limited skillset and an almstt complete absence of composure. 

I'm predicting that there will be no Jones and no Rafael and no Evans here this time next year. I've a sneaky feeling Smalling might make it but wouldn't be surprised if they're all out the door.

I think sometimes we underestimate the exact scale of the rebuild LVG is going to undertake here. We've put up with poor performances from average players for so long that a run of 3 games from Jones, against really ordinary opposition, where he hasn't has one of his usual calamities has him suddenly being championed as as good as the likes of Hummels.

He is nowhere near good enough, nowhere near, to stake a place in the heart of a defence that is going to win the EPl and the CL and thats the goal here.

260~~~
WTF, I highly doubt we are watching the same player.

261~~~
sweet jonas the shit i have to read in here...

262~~~
Exactly. That and also his 91.5 passing percentage, which can be compared with T.Silva who last year got 92.7 and the year before that had 89.5% for a team which is a high possession team and recycles possession in the defense even more than us. 

Long balls accuracy and successful amounts are also similar at 4.7 for Phil Jones and 4.9 for Silva in 12-13 and 7.2 in 13-14 with a very similar accuracy in them as well. 

I highly doubt he will continue it, but hopefully he can at least remain at a highly improved level compared to previously. 

Claims that he is still living on "last ditch tackles" and/or have poor passing is just perceptions based on previous seasons. His least impressive statistic is his tackling this season, even if it is still good of course. He also has 0 errors this year.

263~~~
This is something that really irks me. Apparently once a player has been tagged it's rather difficult to get the monkey off their backs. 

It's similar to how De Gea still has question marks over his ability to catch the ball, especially from certain sectors of the media. This despite being error free (vs Sunderland COC was the solitary error he made in the whole of 2013/ 2014 IRIC) and being aerially dominant for the past 2 seasons running. 

Conversely people refuse to accept that some players that were world class in the past no longer belong in that bracket (eg Kompany). They still include him in the conversation for the best defenders in the world when actually he's some ways off the top now.

264~~~
Same with people who say Smalling his distribution is shite, it really isnt that bad, its decent.

265~~~
I first found it really annoying but now I find it really hilarious. If somebody posts facts to support their argument, like you did above. 

Then somebody always comes in without any facts and claims facts are shit so they win the argument because they didn't provide any facts.

266~~~
Jones may be a shit midfielder, and no doubt a worse striker, but he's turning in class performances now that he's getting in a decent run at center back.  Expect to PJ dominate at center back for club and country for the next 6-8 seasons.

267~~~
Jones is a very good midfielder when plays there.

268~~~
Depends on whether we stick with 3 at the back i reckon.

Also, if we're in the business of retaining only those defenders who are technically efficient and good on the ball then Smalling would be out before Evans.

269~~~
Some people want to sell the whole squad. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Oh and if we ever stupidly tried to sell Jones i am sure there won't be any shortage of suitors. Same as with most of our players except a few. (And even more for Jones.)

270~~~
Don't understand the basis of some of the criticism here of Jones. In a season where we have lost the big boys in Rio, Vidic and Evra, Jones has been our best defender by a mile since the start of the season. It is Smalling and Evans who have yet to perform.

271~~~
Gonna get rid of Smalling and Evans long before that day.

But I have always rated Jones, though he's certainly had his moments of madness. I guess we'll see this season if he's gonna make it.

272~~~
Jones is proving me wrong. I had Smalling and Evans as our best CB pairing at the start of the season. Jones has been a lot better than both this season though. Hope he can keep it up.

273~~~
If only he can stay injury free and start regularly in CB he'll come good for us.

274~~~
I really like him at the centre of this back 3. He had the leadership that the position requires and had shown it thus far.

275~~~
Smalling hasnt put a foot wrong since pre season, its unfortunate that he is injured again. But Evans has been really bad.

276~~~
Not all the squad no. Just a large swathe of a squad that finished 7th last year and against average opposition has 2 points out of 9 this. Thankfully it seems LVG has come to that conclusion too.

I think a lot of people confuse effort with ability when it comes to Jones and I don't get it. Maybe he's turning a corner and will step up now but I'm not rowing in with that idea after just 3 games against the mighty Swansea, Sunderland and Burnley. Forget your squawka stats - according to that site JOnes made no defensive errors the whole of last season. Whats that all about then? 

Anybody reckon Jones would get in the City or Chelsea squad? Not me.

277~~~
He would easily get a place in their squads, no doubting that. Being a regular starter is a different matter but a place in their squad, of course he would.

278~~~
Not surprised at all. I love Jil Phones.


The Sun <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

279~~~
As I've said this summer, I believe Jones will establish himself as first choice this season.

280~~~
He's 22 years old ffs. Always had obvious potential and seems to be starting to put it all together. Having a storming start to the season. Anyone who can use that evidence to conclude he will definitely be gone next season is, quite frankly, clueless.

281~~~
My favourite central defender at United. He will become a legend.

282~~~
I would agree with you he is a bit over rated. He has started this season quite well which is a good sign as I disagree that he is nto good enough for where the team is going. The player that broke through at Blackburn was a superb youngster and he is definately good enough for me to become a top defender for the club, if perhaps for me not world class.
He has been very mediocre for us though so far you are correct. Whether that is due to not having so many opportunities early on with experienced defenders ahead of him at first, beign shunted around in different positions or what I dont know but I think he has enough good qualities to his game to be the new Vidic in a defensive partnership with a Rio liek partner. And that is for me the problem with our current defenders, wwe dont have a Rio like defender (Im saying this irrespective of now being a back three). Our weakness in defense is we have nobody that can read the game well and play the ball out from the back and cover the spaces (which is really important in a back three). Id like ro see JOnes on the right of a back three and if Rojo does well on the left then that space to be filled at centre back would be the one area to be fought out. All our centre back options were young signings or promotions to the team, and none of them have really progressed or met the require standards and this is a big season for them with the experienced exits we have had from the club. Personally though I think Jones is the one player ahead of Smalling who has the chance of being one of the names on our first eleven team sheet in 4 years time for example. I think you are under rating him a little bit, just as many over rate him a bit.
Rafaek is the interesting one for me, such a promising but naive defender when he started at the club. In Fergies last season IO thougth Rafael was the most improved player at the club, really started to look at top class right back.....yet last season it seemed like he had amnesia and went right back to the over eager and naive defender he was before that year. I hope LVG with his tactical nouse can get Rafael to progress again and he may be a top defender, otherwise I agree he will be gone quite soon, as for Evans and Smalling, I see them both as squad players so to be honest you could be right there also

283~~~
At the same age Phil Jones is now, Gary Cahill was being loaned out from Villa to Sheffield United. 

But yeah, Jones will never be good enough for a team with aspirations of winning the league <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

284~~~
Pogue, Jones and Smalling have suffered in the opinions of fans by being played out of position. These pair will benefit from this but now is the time for both to play centre back consistently. I watched Smalling be outstanding (against Bayern I think it was) in Europe. He has a lot to offer as has Jones and it would not surprise me if these two end up being defensive rocks for United and they will also benefit greatly from a proper midfield in front of them.

285~~~
The cliche is that they're "victims of their own versatility" but they're mainly victims of us lacking a reliable right back (in terms of not getting injured and trusted by his managers against any opposition)

286~~~
I'd agree with that, I'd have loved to see Coleman fight it out with Rafael here and never seeing Smalling Jones Fletcher Valencia at right back again ever! That's one thing I was delighted with LVG when our first choice players have been injured he's put reserves in. Instead of putting the likes of Carrick at centre back etc etc

287~~~
Means nothing. Different players develop differently. And comparisons with Cahill don't work for me as I think he's not top drawer either.

Jones is hugely overrated by the likes of yourself but I think some of this is collateral damage from expectations being gradually lowered at this club to the point where mediocrity gets well and truely established. That and wishful red tinted thinking. We are where we are because of mediocre players and our problems remain defensive ones. LVG knows it, has stated we are in the market for defenders (plural) and I reckon that spells P45s for Jones, Rafael and Evans between now and the start of next season. I'd be delighted to be proved wrong and that many of our problems will be solved by certain players getting extended runs in favoured positions, benefitting from improved coaching and an improvement in the quality of player higher up the pitch but I don't think we'll be getting back to the top with them on board.

288~~~
Jones isnt mediocre, he has lots of potential and is still young, if he stays injury free and gets a good run he will be a top performer. I bet you were one of the many who was very optimistic about the 2 huge defensive talents, Varane/Jones. After a bad season and he is all of a sudden mediocre? There are mediocre players at the club, Young, Valencia, Evans, Fletcher, Ando but certainly not Jones.

289~~~
You really think we'll sell our only right back? And replace him with who, really..? Name one suitable replacement out there who's better than him. You can't.

290~~~
Jones, Smalling and Evans are all excellent. Problem is injuries...and Jones being played all over.

Evans is your perfect ball playing CB....but the poor lad gets injured so often. 

The pity is not all 3 when fit can play as CBs. But they are all top players.

Now that we have Rojos, we should be have sufficient cover in that area.

291~~~
Different players develop differently but you're dead certain Jones is 100% bang average and has no chance of making it despite being the only one of the back 3/5 we've used this season who has looked decent.

This last ditch tackle and passion nonsense is doing my head in too. Vidic built his reputation here on that, with the only difference being he'd had a full career at CB and once he settled in at United and got to play with a fellow experienced player in Rio Ferdinand he was able to stamp his authority and become a real leader.

One thing that Jones has clearly really improved on is his aerial ability and his general reading of the game. If people can't see that then they're just sticking to opinions generated from the shit time he and everyone else had last season.

What people have concluded so far this season: van Persie is finished. Mata flattered to deceive at Chelsea. Carrick won't play much and Phil Jones isn't good because of some old outdated tag that he only looks decent because he's 'passionate' and makes mad last ditch tackles.

292~~~
Evans perfect ball playing CB? Have you watched him recently? And I rather have a defender who can actually defend, Evans cant. He is just poor.

293~~~
think he has been rushed back. He was excellent when he played last season.

294~~~
I certainly wasn't. It's not all of a sudden either...he's always been mediocre.

Are you seriously suggesting that there are not better right backs than Rafael or are we losing something in translation here?

295~~~
IMO not, its the typical overrating of our youth academy, Welbeck is now some top class striker with the talent of Sturridge, Evans in form is world class according to some and Clev could be a good squad player while he is bang average. Evans is just an average defender, he has decent passing, but further than that he has nothing. Not the level we need at United, I am also sick and tired of his brainfarts, which he has literally every match although he is 27.

296~~~
He's looked half decent in piss poor performances against average opposition. 

I'll give you that he's getting better in the air. Anything at low altitude though and he's a mistake waiting to happen. I said in the old PJ thread he wouldn't make the end of the season a United player and I'm sticking to it. As for tyour other points I think RVP is far from finished, Mata is quality but Carrick is past his sell by date too and won't get past his contract expiry with us.

297~~~
He's had the advantage of playing alongside Rio or Vida for the entirety of his career though. Now mom and dad are gone and Jonny is the elder brother at United. Always thought Evans would wilt under pressure and is not a leader (even down in the newbies - where I got butchered for suggesting that he quite regularly blames De Gea, Rafael or other easy targets when we concede - the body language isn't healthy for someone a lot of people touted as the team captain) and so far he's proving me right. That said I 'd rather be proven 100 % wrong and Evans steps up for the sake of both United and his own career. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

298~~~
Well we'd most likely have been embarrassed badly against Burnley if he wasn't cleaning up for Jonny Evans all afternoon!

299~~~
I asked you to name a better right back than him who we'd be able to get.

300~~~
Evans is useless and it has nothing to do with injuries. He looked decent before but that was when he had Rio or Vidic to bail him out. Now that they are gone he is getting found out for the poor player he is. He's a mistake waiting to happen these days.

301~~~
Coleman. I'd even take someone like Clyne over Rafael as at least he isn't made of glass.

302~~~
So, one good season that doesn't even top Rafael's best season and you want to replace him? Says a lot when you can only think of two names, one of which is a shit player that you only mentioned because he plays a lot of games. Selling our only right back is a stupid idea, and I'm surprised you even thought otherwise.

303~~~
They're two just from this league, I'm sure someone more knowledgeable about other European leagues than me could name you a lot more too. It's not only one good season for Coleman either, he has been very good since been moved to RB by Moyes and Coleman last season was better than Rafael two seasons ago, IMO. Personally I wouldn't sell Rafael anyway as he is good when fit but I do think we should get in someone else as he isn't fit often enough.

304~~~
I do think we need another RB that isn't Valencia lol, but to sell Rafael would be foolish as he's very, very talented. I think we could do with another Buttner type player (Price range/age etc) just to add some competition for that spot, we don't want to force him out completely else we could come to regret it.

305~~~
Coleman was much better last season than Rafael in 2012 and I'm a huge fan of Rafael. Last season Coleman was the top scoring defender in the league and chipped in with plenty of assists too. He was also voted the best RB in the league (something Rafael wasn't in 2012). It's also incorrect to say it was Coleman's first "good" season as it was actually an excellent season and he has been one of the best RB's in the league for the last few years.

Edit: SS beat me too it.

306~~~
"Sometimes you look in a field and you see a cow and you think it's a better cow than the one you've got in your own field," Ferguson told reporters after the game. "It's a fact. Right? And it never really works out that way."

Typical attitude of most of our fans, our own players are always under-rated whilst opposition players are over-rated. Rafael is great, selling him would be criminal. Especially to replace him with an Everton player people only recognise after last year.

307~~~
It's hardly a typical attitude from our fans? That's complete and utter rubbish. What do you want fans to say? That we have the best 11 players in the world? Are opposition players not allowed to be considered better? Based on the last two seasons Coleman has been better. Simple as. 

As I said earlier I'm a huge fan of Rafael and he is one of my favourite at the club. That doesn't mean that I can't say that there is a better RB than him in the league.

308~~~
Id often take the opposite opinion personally that we look at a lot of our players with rose tinted glassed. I dont agree with Barca abotu Jones even though I dont think he has good as a lot of people in this thread for example seem to think but where I totally agree with him and it has been obvious to see for a while is we have had too many mediocre and under performing players for the club the last 3/4 years, we seem to have a squad with basically a lot of "squad" players in it and very few first eleven players..hence the summers activity. If you look at our transfer history inwards and outwards I would actually say it has been very poor for a long period of time. We arent in this mess purely because of Moyes. Ferguson made a lot of wonderful signings for the club but I dont think he has had a good window for seberal years and with the majority of our best players retiring or moving on and a fair few of our big signings not progressing, it all caught up with us last year when we had a manager who didn thave amazing man management skills, you only have to look at the season before it when we won the league, the attitude of the team and the magic of RVPs debut season won us the league, in reality the general standard, tempo and quality of the side and the players was piss poor. 
The likes of Welbeck, Young, Mata, Jones, Smalling, Evans, Valencia, Cleverly, Anderson, Nani are all good squad players but how many of them are first eleven players who would get anywhere near the 3 great sides Fergie built? It is subjective but Barca is right when he said we have a lot of mediocre players, I would suggest this summers activity has is because this is exactly what Van Gaal thinks, and I think it is only half of the job he wants to do rebuilding transfer wise, I fully expect several other big ins and outs in the summer even if I dont totally agree with Barca on some of the players he names

309~~~
Mata is an odd choice for that list. 

Based on rumors and early impressions you'd have to say a first-rate CB will be top of our shopping list.  And though it may be a bit unfair to him being young without a long run in that position, it may be a make or break year for Jones to establish himself before that big name signs for us.  Especially if like many suspect we revert to 4 at the back and Rojo kicks on at left CB.

310~~~
Hope his injury isn't too serious. Looks likely to miss QPR now atleast. 

Was pretty good today again and hitting very good form and now this.

311~~~
Of course he goes off injured!

312~~~
Substituted in the England game with a hamstring injury. Frustrating. You'd imagine he'll now face a spell on the sidelines. 

The pre-season fears about the fitness records of the senior centre halves have proved founded then. All three have picked up injuries within the first month of the season.

313~~~
Well typical. Has a good run of games and then gets injured. 

We really need a partnership at the back rather than chopping and changing. Our injury prone defenders don't allow us to build a partnership.

314~~~
I'm honestly losing faith in him becoming anything above average. He's always getting injured.

315~~~
May have been just cramp. He seemed to be stretching it.

316~~~
Oh he's injured. There's a massive surprise.

317~~~
The fact that he played on for 5-10 minutes after he picked up the injury makes me hopeful he could be be available on Sunday. Would be a huge loss as he is our only form defender at the minute.

318~~~
Yeah. Loads of potential and a very good defender at his best but he can't fulfill his potential or be part of a solid defensive partnership if he always gets injured. The main thing with center backs is being fit and forming an understanding, and he just can't get that as he's always injured, so frustrating.

319~~~
He stays most fit usually of our 3 main defenders. 

All are too injury prone though.

320~~~
That's not really high praise though is it, considering the others are constantly injured. I would have no worries about our current defence both in quality and depth if they never got injured, or rarely did. The problem is that you actually can't expect them to stay fit for more then a handful of games at one time.

321~~~
Thought he played really well, hopefully the injury is nothing major

322~~~
Urgh, caught the game late and as soon as I saw he wasn't on the pitch my first inkling was "injured".

323~~~
Same thing happened with Smalling against Sunderland, though. Lets just hope it's nothing bad enough to keep him out of this weeks game, because like you said, he's our only in form defender. Thankfully, we have Rojo to come in on Sunday. Hopefully he'll adjust to Premier League football pretty quick.

Injury aside, I thought Jones had yet another convincing game at centre back. Was unlucky not to score too.

324~~~
Really has great potential, hopefully in time he will gain some more composure and read the game better. He sometimes seems to rush his play and appear reckless, this is probably why he gets so many injuries.
In 2-3 years he could be something special.

325~~~
I really doubt he's going to make it as a top European level centre back.

Usually you expect a lot more composure from someone at that level. Far too rash.

326~~~
I'm sick of talking about potential regarding Jones and Smalling too. They're both at an age when they should be stepping up. Vidic and Rio are gone, no fecking excuses if they truly are up to it. We can't afford to wait three years on Jones, but can afford to buy a world class CB. 

The clock is ticking.

327~~~
Only thing missing from Phil Jones atm is composure. But since he's only 22...

328~~~
Sergio Ramos.

329~~~
Jones has been as good as anyone this season. There aren't many World Class CB's going around that we can afford to buy anyway.

330~~~
Jones had been doing some great last ditch defending for us, that's not in doubt. However I still don't get that sense of security that you should feel from a starting United CB. He's just too rash at times and you half expect him to go off the pitch with a self inflicted injury every game. We can't afford that right now. We need to start fielding a consistent partnership of some sort or our defensive issues will continue to hurt us.

331~~~
Agree on the injury front but Our CB's have had bad injury record for some reason for few years now including Rio/Vidic.  Also, you are still living in stereotype -



Don't think he has been more rash than he should be at all as a CB so far this season or even last season. When played CM/RB he was more rash but he is getting better positionally. Agree we need consistency and a partnership going but with this 3 at the back and our CB's injury records that ain't looking likely to happen soon. Need to revert to 2, pick Jones and a Partner and hope for a consistent run. Atleast that's what i would do.

Should have bought another experienced CB particularly if 3 at the back was a long term plan, but for whatever reason they weren't available/Van Gaal decided to spend elsewhere. There aren't that many real quality ones going around these days, particularly those good on the ball and with leadership skills.

332~~~
Didn't look too serious, I think he will probably miss the QPR game but I doubt he'll be out beyond that. He's started the season well but I can't help thinking he needs a calmer, more composed CB next to him to compliment his all action style.

333~~~
Exactly he is only 22. A CB can play well into his mid-30s. Composure will come with experience and proper guidance.

334~~~
Right, Phil jones is on the schedule. why the feck he just can't play straight for a half season...

335~~~
Because Phil Jones puts his head in places that you wouldn't put your hand. An absolute warrior in my opinion and I hope he's back soon.

336~~~
People on here seem to think he played well for England but I have seen elsewhere (BBC website included) saying he was pretty awful. So I am guessing it was somewhere in between? Or people on here are blinded by him...

337~~~
I didn't see the game but look how Welbeck is currently rated among other supporters now he has left United. Phil Jones plays for United and therefore will be criticised far more in an England shirt.

338~~~
Generally he was good. However, he made a good tackle but put the ball in the path of another forward for the JH save, and should have put a header out of reach from the keeper in the first half (to score, good Rooney corner). He grew into the game and the partnership seemed to work more as the clock ticked. Was concerned when he pulled up.

339~~~
I thought he did ok, certainly wasnt awful, did some good and some bad things but a decent performance. Think he has had a promisin gstart to the season. I cant help thinking watching him, he isnt so much rash but doesnt seem to be brilliant positioning wise or reading the game. I think he needs the right partner next to him, someone that reads the game well, I think he could be the Vidic and he needs a Rio to partner him to get the best out of him in terms of his strengths while covering his weaknesses. I dont see that type of partner with our current defenders, interesting to see what Rojo is like as a centre back for us

340~~~
I just don't get it, he's a player people love to bash. Yes there was one short pass that gifted Switzerland a chance but other than that he was absolutely solid, by far our best defender. He even started drilling the ball about a bit as the game went on and put a bit of tempo in our game when it was needed.
Very unlucky with a header, did everything right it was just an awesome save, if Neuer had saved that people would've been using it as an example of why hes a world class keeper.

341~~~
I thought he was poor, nearly cost us on  a couple of occasions, but also nearly scored. Definitely didnt think he had a good game in defence at all.

342~~~
One pass...

343~~~
He looked shaky other than that too, wasn't he at fault  when Cahill had to make that block to prevent a goal as well, or was that Baines? I will call a spade and a spade, it's not any agenda against him, he just wasn't great yesterday.

344~~~
No that that wasn't him. Thought he was pur best defender on the day, really grew into the game.

345~~~
Probably Baines...since I thought he was awful.

346~~~
That would be Cahill, however I  will say Jones wasn't the worst. Baines takes that accolade, he needs to be dropped, I would keep Jones as he can have good games, moreso that Baines anyway.

347~~~
Baines had his best game in an England shirt yesterday, he was very good.

Jones defended well but that 1 dodgy pass will stick in peoples minds, which automatically deletes all his good work.

In the first half Cahill made some shocking passes too, he tried to pass like Gerrard more than once and fecked it up. 

On the whole though, they looked a decent partnership. Considering I think that's the second time they've played together, it didn't seem too bad. Think they will improve in the future with an actual proper DM infront of them.

348~~~
I'll disagree there, but I do feel this is England's best partnership, with a bit of time and a consistent back line I can see us being a very hard team to beat.

349~~~
He was hamstrung and couldn't cover his man at that point, the Owl kept him on after he pulled up and it nearly cost the match.

350~~~
BBC ratings disagree. Worst player on the pitch, according to them. Worse than Wilshere and Stones, somehow.

I thought he was decent. As has been said, he grew into the game after a shaky start. Unlucky not to score. I'd have him over Jagielka any day.

351~~~
That was actually wilshere. The commentator thought it was jones then went on for the rest of the match saying he was poor. 

Saw the game,  had one balls up where he could have been sent off for bringing down the swiss striker after being caught out of position but that was it.  Other than that he was fine,  just as good as cahill

352~~~
Those BBC ratings are rubbish, gave Cahill an 8? the goal line clearance was his fault in the first place.
I thought Jones was Englands best defender on the night. He was unlucky not to score too.
Rooney probably had one of his best games in ages too. Delph was a highlight, really looked good and linked up well.

353~~~
Thought he was decent personally. Made a bucket load of clearances and barring one moment was solid. Better in distribution as well compared to Cahill.

354~~~
BBC ratings seem done by Phil Mcnulty with Danny Mills as expert comments.

355~~~
Jones will be our captain within 2 seasons, count on it

356~~~
I thought he did very well yesterday.  Himself and Cahill look a decent pairing and only an offside chance got the better of the two when both were fit.  When he picked up the strain he struggled but who wouldnt.  Also his movement on the corner and header were good.  He will score a few goals from set pieces this year.  Give him a good run and by 25 he'll be a very good centre back.

357~~~
Any update on his injury? He was injured, right?

358~~~
Hope he recovers quickly. I do see injuries at centre-half as having a bit of a silver-lining in the sense that it may mean we have to play only two of them! That said, Jones has started the season very well, and I'd like to see him and Smalling get a good run as a pair.

359~~~
If he stops getting injured for every 3-5 games played...yea.. but Sir Alex said from day one of his purchase that he'd end up being our future captain.

SS.. HQ..HD.. said earlier he's now a doubt for the QPR game, thats all I've heard.

360~~~
Doesn't sound promising . Thought it was a bit of cramp
<b>
Phil Jones will have injured hamstring assessed by Manchester United

</b>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/09/phil-jones-hamstring-manchester-united-england-switzerland" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...mstring-manchester-united-england-switzerland</a>

361~~~
Shame, he has had a very good start to the season IMO

362~~~
He does a lot of noticeable good work which tends to stick out, but his positioning needs an exceptional amount of work. He's all over the place.

363~~~
He's still mental. That reverse pass he tried which lead to their chance, what was he trying to do? Looked like he was going for a 1-2 to set himself up for a counter attack. He'd just made a nice interception as well, needs to calm down.

364~~~
Start to get some defenders back and another goes onto the injury table. Absolute joke our defensive injury record.

365~~~
He's forever going to get injured isn't he?

Has the IQ of a plank of wood which doesn't help.

366~~~
These injuries are really really frustrating. Hope he isn't out for long.

367~~~
Injured again.

Jesus Christ..

368~~~
5 decent games and then gets injured and out for about 2 months. the story of phil jones.

no doubt he got what it takes to be a great player. probably world class even. but if he keeps on getting injured after a few run of games, surely this would not help him progress much.

369~~~
Will be a real shame to see him miss out through injury, the timing of Rojo's addition is a good one though.

370~~~
2 months is it? Sorry to hear that for the lad, but this is becoming a joke if it hasn't already. What hope do we have at this rate? Wouldn't be surprised to see Evans and Smalling follow him soon and Rafa is only getting back..

371~~~
He was alright. Struggling to see a top quality centre back in him though. If he becomes as good as Cahill I'll be happy.

372~~~
How can we consistently have so many injury-plagued players for such a long time? This is beyond ridiculous. Are they not being taken care of properly or something? This long ago got to the point where it can't possibly be incidental.

373~~~
Gaaaaaaah! This is so frustrating. 

Been possibly our best player so far this season (not saying much I know) and now out for 2 months again?! 

Does this mean we're more likely to switch from a back 3 now?

374~~~
If Evans, Smalling and Rafael are fit to play the QPR game, then at least one will have become injured by Everton at the latest. The question really is how long until Rojo and Blind become part of the revolving door to the injury room <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

375~~~
It looks like Blackett will end up getting the most appearances out of our cbs this season. Don't think many would have predicted that at the beginning of the season. Great for his development, but terrible for Jones who's had a great start to the season. Any news if Smalling will be back for the QPR game?

376~~~
Where's this "two months" stuff coming from?

377~~~
It was definitely hamstring related, he stretched it when trying to volley that corner in the second half. 

I would be amazed if it was 2 months out though, he didn't tear his hamstring just over pulled it. I would think even if it was a small tear, he should be out for 1 month maximum. Pain in the ass that is though, With Smalling out too, I suppose a back 4 will be a must now.

378~~~
Could even be a cramp. Same thing Mata picked up in the last game and he's fine now.

"Pain in the ass" is right, by the way. That's the part of his anatomy he was holding immediately after he injured himself.

379~~~
I remember Gareth Bale going off injured once, hobbling a fair bit more than Jones, and his hamstring looked as good as new the week after. We'll just have to wait and see. Either way, I still hope we'll be reverting back to a four man defence and at least Rafa, Evans, Rojo and Shaw are now fit.

380~~~
Gutted to see he's injured again. Hope it's nothing too serious and was taken out as a precaution.

381~~~
Let's hope so, but I think he would have been trying to stretch it out more if it was cramp. I suppose it's a good sign though he didn't sub himself straight away, as most players know once you get a twinge you should stop ASAP.

382~~~
Same here. Great all-action type player, but I just don't see him being the heir to Vidic/Rio, especially as his action tends to result in injuries that didn't happen to the above. Honestly think he's better suited to being a CDM, since he tends to go far afield at times, plus he gets caught out vs. forwards with better or more cultured movement. Tend to think Smalling & Evans read the game better. TBF, I'm not even sure he'd be good enough to be a CDM for us. 

Still, hope he gets better soon. Shame about his fragility. Needs to kick on now, or he'll lose PT and the confidence of LVG. Honestly could see him get passed over & moved on within the next year or so, especially if someone like Hummels gets brought in.

383~~~
Two months?! Bloody hell Hodgson you muppet.

384~~~
Any latest news on his injury? How long he is going to be out? I mean concrete news, not random predictions.

385~~~
Probably have to wait until van Gaal speaks to the press before the QPR match.

386~~~
It's the way it's going to be. Jones, Smalling and Evans are all injury prone. We all know that. The situation won't improve as they get older and it's a waste of time persevering with the idea that any of them are long term starting XI prospects.

387~~~
One throw away comment by a poster and suddenly he's going to be out for 2 months. Amazing.

On the England game, McNulty is an ass who has had it in for Jones and Smalling for a couple of years. Jones had an excellent game overall - one misplaced pass at close quarters that led to a chance and the "caught out of position" incident which was nothing of the sort. In reality it was a very good piece of defending.

388~~~
two-three weeks according to the Dailymail. The boy doesn't seem to stay fit, he should have learned how to protect himself by now.

389~~~
It'd be a bad tendon damage hamstring if it is two months I would think? Hopefully LvG clarifies this soon though.

390~~~
To be fair it is his first injury in ages. He's had a decent run of games methinks.

391~~~
He was out for an age at the close of last season, and only just made it, over the summer, into the WC squad.  We've only had a couple of games at the beginning of this season and he's out again. 
He probably has a better record with injuries than our other two centre halves, but given their propensity for injury that really doesn't say much.

392~~~
3-4 weeks <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> fecking Hodgson

393~~~
Disappointing news. He's been our best defender so far and I was hoping he'd get a run of games at CB.

394~~~

395~~~
Me too. Such a shame. All the potential in the world isn't enough if you're sidelined on a regular basis. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Unfortunately with the way things are shaping up underperformers will be shifted out of Old Trafford. If Phil doesn't shape up soon, Van Gaal might bring a genuinely world-class alternative to supercede him.

396~~~
Nothing to do with Hodgson.

Jones has a history of being injured and he's been injured plenty of times playing for United as well.


Jones, Evans, Smalling and Rafael can not be relied upon to give you an injury free season. We already knew this.

397~~~
Unfortunately, even Luke Shaw has joined that list!

398~~~
Our defenders and Injuries are a constant for last few years now.

399~~~
If you ask Jones two questions, play like Thiago Silva for a match or three, or stay fit for a month or two he would have far far more problems with the latter, he's often really good but he cant keep that level simply because all his injuries, its frustrating and if it keeps on we should sell him.

400~~~
We can blame Hodgson for keeping him on for about 15 minutes after he first got injured mind you.

401~~~
He must be more pissed off than we are about this to be fair. But something needs to be done. Giggs needs to raise it up to LVG.

402~~~
Very hard for a manager to intervene when a player tries to run off a niggle.

403~~~
It's very easy really. The player can't do anything if his number is held up on the board. I don't think any manager would've done much different though. Manchester United are not his concern after all.

404~~~
I've seen Fergie let Manchester United players hobble round with obvious injuries for ages, though. From the sidelines looking on it's impossible to tell a touch of cramp, or a bit of a dead leg from a torn muscle. Immediately after it happened, I was wondering if maybe Jones had got a knee to the arse, the way he was holding it. You have to rely on the player being sensible enough to let them know he can't continue or at least sit down and get properly assessed by the physio. Typical of Jones to try and run off what was obviously a more serious injury than he thought. Too brave for his own good.

405~~~
Poor Jones.. just imagine how good him and Rafael could become if they weren't plagued by injuries.

406~~~
Our defenders injury records are appalling.

407~~~
Is jones actually awkward in his technique which causes injuries so often? Even if it's not always long term and fast recovery, he always seems to suffer from them.

408~~~
Just when he started to get a run of games and finding some form, he gets injured. Typical really. Just hope he can pick up where he left off when he gets back. 

Get well soon, Jonesy!

409~~~
I was thinking Jones was lasting too long without being injured.

410~~~
He needs to stop getting injured every 2-3 weeks so he can form an established partnership with one of our 3 cb's and iron out the defensive errors and poor positioning that plague his game. I'm just frustrated by how much his progress has stalled the last 18 months.

411~~~
Jones tended to injure himself after  2-3 good performances, this time he made it >1 months. Progression !!11

412~~~
I'm wondering, how many of our players have actually improved since SAF left? Besides de Gea? I even think Januzaj isnt much better at the moment than he was when he broke into the first team/

413~~~
He's really turning into a sick note. His hamstring probably contorts the same way as his face does whenever he goes into a tackle. He's doing something that isn't working...not sure what mind...but if it continues you can't put him down as a regular in the future..because he won't be regular...

414~~~
Wes Brown 2. Too hyped up and therefore too reckless when going into tackles and thus invariably gets injuries. It's even worse for Jones because his tackling technique is terrible.

415~~~
Clearly they are both very talented but something clearly needs to change in regards to Jones' and Rafael's injuries. Is it because they played so many games at a very young age at the highest level? 

Messi and Giggs were injury prone too when they were young. There are other examples like Varane, Thiago, Aguero and Wilshere. So it's not really necessarily limited to United, but really frustrating as everytime the players pick up form they seem to get injured again and are then not just ruled out for a week, but usually various months!

416~~~
What a massive surprise, Phil Jones being injured is as predictable as night turning into day.

417~~~
If he has to retire from too many concussions, I could really see him hosting a nature show in New Zealand. Phil Jones on safari fighting rhinos and provoking whales into confrontations, that sort of thing. It would be so easy to write the script and he would probably be safer amongst predators than in places like a crowded penalty box.

418~~~
It's really bad that he is out. Like really bad. I don't care about our 'new and improved' attack that much. They'll probably be great, but our defence (which was weak) has gotten a lot weaker with Jones out. We'll be conceding a few goals until we get the defence settled.

419~~~
We desperately need him back. If not for the only reason that he isn't soft as shit and won't get pushed around.

420~~~
yep. Need someone who has the guts to show some leadership.

421~~~
When will he be back. Our only defender with some leadership.

422~~~
If we start him next week then old Woy will pick him for England the next week.

423~~~
He is expected to be back for the Everton game in two weeks.

424~~~
So Evans aint up to it,Smalling as well. Surely not Jones as well. The other 2 are looking like back up at best.

425~~~
I hope they prove me very wrong, but there's no way Evans and Smalling will ever become the 'leader' of our defence in my opinion. Squad players capable of some very good games, yes, they've proven they can be that but they're just not capable of any more in my opinion.

At 22 I haven't given up on Jones being able to become that leader. Looking from a distance, he has far more skills in this area than the other two, but still is injury prone and capable of some poor decision making himself.

But at the moment, if he's fit, he plays. We really need him to fulfill his potential.

426~~~
I would have been a lot happier if it had been Phil Jones coming on for Evans than Smalling. At least he would have tried to organise the defence a bit more. He is more of a leader.

427~~~
The injuries are the only thing holding the lad back, he has the talent, but his progress is being held back. It's either injuries to himself or elsewhere in the team, so he get shunted out to RB or midfield.

428~~~
Most people talking about the lack of a leader in our back, but I honestly feel Jones can step up and be that guy for us. He had a great start to the season, it was just a pity he picked up an injury. 

Once he's back, I really hope he can stay fit, because like I said, I think he could really step up for us this season.

429~~~
I agree. I think he has stepped up alot this season already. Our best defender by a distance. I really want him to stay fit and establish himself for club and country. I don't doubt his ability one bit, but he just can't get a run of games, which is a shame.

430~~~
Good news at last

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11127883/Manchester-United-defensive-boost-as-Phil-Jones-returns-to-action-for-Premier-League-clash-against-Everton.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...for-Premier-League-clash-against-Everton.html</a>

431~~~
VG might be cagey about putting him in straight away. And also, if he plays he will have to play for England as well.

But generally we need Jones back, and staying fit for the season. He's easily our best CB. I'd want him in games like Everton and Chelsea. Hard to believe he's still just 22.

432~~~
Is he necessarily better than Smalling/Rojo/Evans?

I think the thing he has, that they don't is leadership, I see that bit extra from him, perhaps it's his Stamina but I do think if he sorts himself out this season, as he is a lot younger than Smalling, Rojo & Evans, he will become 1st choice still, it will be Jones & 1, it's just how long before that happens...

433~~~
He has been, so far this season.

434~~~
Unfortunately, I've coincidentally missed his apps this season, he hasn't been his position-less rash self?

435~~~
He's been really good. Lumbered with that crappy 352 formation, he was the only central defender to look in any way decent.

436~~~
Getting and keeping Jones fit should be our top priority atm. Him, next to Rojo, could work well.

437~~~
I think Jones and Rojo could be quite a decent pairing at the back eventually. Both are really combatitive and Jones played really well until his injury.

438~~~
His positioning is still very dodgy.

439~~~
If he's fit enough to train fully all week then I am sure he'll start against Everton, but LvG should have a word with Hodgson about not playing him for England as another 2 matches in quick succession is not ideal, and England can surely beat Estonia and San Marino without him.

440~~~
Good to know we've got another defender on the way back. I'd throw him straight in at the weekend.

441~~~
Nice to know he's back. We'll need someone to deal with the two beasts; Lukaku and Costa. 

Just hope he can stay fit now.

442~~~
Jones-Rojo is comfortably our best possible CB pairing IMO, great news this.

443~~~
Nice to know he is back soon. Hope van Gaal can turn him into the high class centre back we hoped for.

444~~~
Hard to say as we have yet to see these two play together even once. The hope we all have as United fans is that they will gel immediately, yet, it's almost impossible to say how it will all work out. 

At this point, my opinion is that Smalling-Jones is our best cb pairing. If only either of them could stay healthy at the same time that would be great as well.

445~~~
It's good that he will be back but I am not sure I'd rush him in against Everton. It's annoying because we need him against Lukaku who will try to monster Rojo and McNair. It'd be more frustrating if he re-injured himself though. But if he is 100% fully fit then I would probably play him.

446~~~
Jones is the only one of our CBs who looks like developing into a leader. The problem is that he currently looks like the kind of leader who'll lead all his charges into no man's land. Unless Rojo can help calm him down a bit (he doesn't look like the type so far), we'll need to buy someone else to get the best out of Jones.

447~~~
It's mixed news for me. Good that he's back against Everton, but sadly he'd get picked for England and get injured.

448~~~
You can't say that before even seeing them play together.

449~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gNjL0ZAMcE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

450~~~
I just hope he doesnt lose that yard of pace with all those injuries

451~~~
He looks furious when he scores!
Can't wait to have him back after watching that.

452~~~
He's a mad bastad, but he's our bastad.

453~~~
Can't wait until we can field a back 4 of Rafael - Jones - Rojo - Shaw

454~~~
He had no right to get that ball off Gomis. And people use the 'last ditch' nonsense as an argument as to why he isn't very good...

455~~~
When is he due back?  
This

456~~~
Love him, what a guy. Cant wait to see him on the field again.

457~~~
God, I love Phil Jones. Some of those last ditch tackles. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> How his pace is only 68 on Fifa, I will never know. Moreno is certainly no slouch. 

Can't wait to have him back. So far this season, he seems to have stepped up. Just hope his form before he got injured will continue when he's back.

458~~~
If you read the matchday forum, anyone would think he was match fit and ready to start, probably the newbile effect.  I can't see it myself, is he really good to go?

459~~~
Do we have any other choice?

Evans and Mcnair are out. So it's a straight choice between him and Smalling.

460~~~
What about Blackett, isn't he back from suspension?  Someone mentioned he uses the wrong foot though.

461~~~
Yeah, wrong foot. Blackett is competing with Rojo for the LCB spot. The other 3 are competing for the RCB spot.

462~~~
So he's pretty much our only option then, but is he fit?

463~~~
Blackett is fit.

464~~~
I know that, but he plays with the wrong foot, as has been previously stated, so does that mean he is, or isn't, in line to start?

465~~~
Didn't you ask weather or not he was fit? <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

As for the other part, I don't think he'll play - based on the fact that LvG took a gamble on McNair rather than to play two LCB's against West Ham. However, he might be forced to this time unless Jones or Smalling are ready. But then again, it seem like he is rather fond of nursing injured players back to fitness before throwing them in (which is a good thing, I think).

466~~~
No that was Jones I was talking about.  Is he fully fit to start?

I'm still umming & ahhing over my line up prediction  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

467~~~
Ah, right. I misread. I have no idea about Jones' fitness but I'm really hoping to see him. Although I suspect LvG will be careful with both him and Smalling. I got my line up - apart from that CB position! It's a bloody nightmare to guess <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

468~~~
If it helps <a class="username" data-user="48764, @Colin129" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48764/">@Colin129</a> I have Jones in my lineup prediction.

469~~~
Well if I put him in & lose points over it, I will hold you fully responsible!

I have Blackett in there at the moment with Jones as a sub.

470~~~
I have Rafael Jones Rojo Shaw as my back line. I hope to god I've gotten it right.

471~~~
I really hope he's back, especially since we're away from home. Since Vidic is gone, Jones is our only true warrior type of defender. Have a feeling we'll be under the cosh quite a bit tonight.

472~~~
This is my back four at the moment too, I'm bricking it over Jones <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

473~~~
What was that positioning? Useless

474~~~
David Luiz in disguise it seems.

475~~~
What's wrong with him tonight? Like seriously.

476~~~
Rafael will get all the stick for being too deep, but Jones is steaming into midfield and leaving the lone striker in 15 yards of space. Absolutely brainless

477~~~
Aye, I think Raf should have been more aware, but given he was at similar depth to Rojo I have to place the majority of the blame on Jones.

478~~~
That's Phil.

Excuses and excuses are made for him despite the fact that he's a joke figure. If he was with another team, there would be threads on here laughing at him.

Idiotic useless player.

479~~~
I'm convinced he's been paid for that second goal. There's no other reason a rational mind would do that.

480~~~
Looking forward to the excuses afforded to him once again. Average average centre half.

481~~~
He's nothing more then your average, physically strong, English centre back. See Shawcross.

482~~~
There was absolutely no excuse for not tracking back at that goal, surely he realised he was out of position

483~~~
Where the feck did he go for the second goal?

484~~~
Idiot tonight. Was the only defender who was poor too.

485~~~
Add to that - a penalty-giver waiting to happen in most games..

The new "Duncan Edwards" my arse..

486~~~
Disagree

Jones didn't do well, but Rafael was in no mans land playing Berahino on

487~~~
Coming back from injury. Give the lad a break. he's the future captain of England, you know.

488~~~
He's an impetuous defender prone to making a bad call. Its nothing that can't be ironed out over time and as he matures, but there are also no guarantees he will fix it. He's always attracted towards the ball thinking he can always nick it away and when it works, its good play. But its risky always going for it and he's committed and not won the ball plenty of times this season leaving us exposed at the back.

Probably the worst thing you can possibly do is put someone just like himself with that same issue next to him. Someone like Rojo...

489~~~
The goal was more Rafa's fault than anybody, but other than that Rafa was class.  Unlike Jones who was gash and gave away a penalty to boot.

Let's hope it was just rustiness, was very good before he was injured.

490~~~
I've made the point though that even if Rafael is holding the line, Berahino has a ridiculous amount of space in behind Jones. Essentially, no matter where Rafael stand Berahino has space once he stays onside.

491~~~
On the second goal ended up to enamored with the run of Sessegnon which left him out of position.

492~~~
When they replayed the second goal and highlighted him and Rojo, I just don't understand why Jones felt the need to rush out towards the ball. Left a huge gap behind and easy space for Beharinho. The gaps between our center halves and full backs on both sides is too big and was shown again tonight.

493~~~
And next week he'll be good again. He hasn't played in a red shirt for nearly two months. If it wasn't for injuries galore he wouldn't have played tonight.

He was poor, but under the circumstances you can see why.

494~~~
His defensive positioning (or lack thereof) often puts us in a lot of trouble. But it's not this part of his game that is infuriating. Why does he insist on hitting diagonal 40 yard long balls every time he has the ball? He isn't Scholes! There were so many times in the game where he hit it to an opposition or hoofed it out of play instead of playing the simple pass to one of our midfielders crying out for it!

495~~~
That 2nd goal was more on Rafael.

496~~~
How did I thought he can be proper replacement for Rio or Vidic is beyond my feckin mental reach right now.

Same shit over and over and over again.

497~~~
Can be cut some slack as he's just back from injury but he was really bad tonight. So slow on the ball compared to everyone else, and just being brainless when he could've gifted them a penalty.

498~~~
Because he's a brainless idiot who has all the subtlety of a rampaging rhino.

499~~~
Well he had to press their midfield as no one was, if anything i think Rojo should have moved over to cover him. Rafael clearly had an eye on their winger

500~~~
he was, but that was Jone's man ..... leaving him wide open to attack a player who already had 2 men on him.

501~~~
Hang on, so Rafael is in line with two of our three other defenders, gave or take a few feet, and he's mostly to blame according to some here? No chance.

If Jones stands his ground like any defender other than David Luiz would do then that goal doesn't happen. It was insanely stupid.

Unless people think that we should be playing such a high defensive line like that ordinarily.

502~~~
Another brainless performance from our brave English lion.

503~~~
The old injury excuse is well and truly in force it seems, Injured or not the fact he didn't even attempt to track back for that second goal is complete bad defending, simple as

504~~~
Berahino would be off if Rafael stepped up though. I agree Jones isn't blameless, but I think the majority of blame lays with Rafael.

505~~~
This is because he's been used as a utility player during his time here. He hasn't had the development a centre half should have and we saw that tonight.

506~~~
It wasn't Rafa's fault. It's the CBs job to take care of such a run Rafa was rather outside to prevent a winger coming into play

507~~~
Constant wreckless injuries and lack of fitness.

508~~~
Jones, Young, Valencia, the Pogba 'sale'... Fergie has had a mare.

Jones future England captain my arse.

509~~~
I couldn't believe what I was seeing when Jones just decided to go walkabout for that goal. I understand that there was a bit of a need for closing down the midfielder but he was the last person who should have taken up that task, considering he was marking the only bloody player they had ahead of the ball. It was utterly moronic.

510~~~
He's had one bad game after being our player of the month before getting injured and he's back to being shite again.

Good old Caf.

511~~~
No one person was to blame for that second goal. It pretty much sums up that we still aren't a cohesive unit at the back yet. There is no understanding between Rojo and Jones (how can there be when its their first match together!). It cost us 3 points today.

512~~~
This

513~~~
Not wanting to jump aboard the criticism of him on his first game back after injury but....

For a guy who is supposed to have the potential to be a world class CB he isn't really all that good, is he? I mean if you compare him to some like Varane, for example, and he looks far more likely to end up a decent squad player than an outstanding CB.

Still only 21 so might develop still but he has an awful lot of developing to do and we're sort of depending on him right now, so yeah...

Like I said, that's less about today's performance and more a general impression of him.

514~~~
It's also the fullback's responsibility to keep in line with the rest of the defence. If he was in line with Shaw and Rojo, Berahino is offside.

515~~~
Its his first game back, first game with rojo and he's shite? Out of the three of Smalling, Evans and him, he's been above them. That was his only mistake of the game, and you could assign equal blame to Rafael.

516~~~
Jones played well under Ferguson so did Valencia.

517~~~
Was very good before the injury. That was atrocious though.

518~~~
Rafael can be blamed for the second goal, but it was still brainless from Jones.

519~~~
Its a cover for hoofing. He's not confident enough to play it on the deck so he aims it far away in the air, that way if it goes wrong the ball aint close. It shows fear.

520~~~
Future captain my arse.

521~~~
The thing that drives me the craziest about Jones is his insistence on heading the ball back in to no mans land when he has time enough and space enough to settle it and pass it......over and over again.

522~~~
Evans is the best of that lot.

It's Evans





then Jones













then Smalling.

523~~~
Jones has gone ball-chasing into the midfield. Rafael was playing him on, but Jones shouldn't have gone charging about, leaving such a huge gap for Berahino to exploit. If Jones had have stayed in position, that ball wouldn't have been played. Or if it had, Jones would have been goal side. Jones created the gap. Ridiculous.

I still rate him, and he was great earlier in the season. That was a total brain fart though. I still think either Jones/Rojo or Jones and Smalling is our best pair, but he needs to reel it in a bit. No need to rush into the midfield like that.

524~~~
Doubt he will be here in the next few years if he keep playing like this.

525~~~
And the over reaction begins...

526~~~
What's with all the knee jerking tonight? Yes, Jones had a poor game and yes he was partly at fault for the 2nd goal, but keep in mind hes been sidelined for two months.

527~~~
Himself in how he clumsy and untidy he looked, but looks really out of shape, slow as feck, you could see his tits through his jersey.

528~~~
Been our best fecking defender this season, first mistake and he should be axed, fans in this forum are unbelievable.

529~~~
I'm talking about form. Evans and Smalling have been poor, Evans costing us with more mistakes. Jones has been the best.

530~~~
Brainless today

531~~~
Idiots, the lot of them.

532~~~
How did you manage to post upside down?

533~~~
It is amazing suddenly Jones and Januzaj are both crap even though Adnan is making his first league start and Jones is just back from injury.

534~~~
Brainless.

535~~~
I have generally been impressed with him this season. Can't be easy playing in a continuously rotating defence.

536~~~
Football fans are fickle.

537~~~
Evans, how can you say that? He has been piss poor so far.

538~~~
Smalling is considerably better at the basics of defending and always has been during their respective careers at the club. 

Jones has this strange reputation for having good distribution, too, which I'm wary of. He's more aesthetically pleasing, but I'd wager that he actually gives away possession more than the clumsy-looking Smalling.

I do like Jones, but he needs a partner that can read the game, as well as a kick up the arse.

539~~~
We understand he has been out and expected him to be a bit rusty but that positioning for the second goal is just bad defending, to be that high up and not even think that you may be putting your defence in trouble is just plain stupid, plus add to the fact once they got through he didn't even attempt to get back, I'm at the point with Jones, Smalling and Evans now that all 3 could happily go for my liking

540~~~
McNair says hi.

541~~~
It is staggering to be fair.

542~~~
He hasn't played in two months. Chill out.

543~~~
He's average. 

Mid-table player and we need better.

544~~~
I rate Jones over Evans or Smalling, but I don't think any of them are good enough for United. Don't see it at the moment.

545~~~
He's like David Luiz defensively. But not as good as Luiz attacking wise. Which is ver worrying considering that this is his fourth year here and he seems to haven't improved a bit. 

If only a world class centerback was available this summer who cost less than 25m.

546~~~
Jones may have made a poor choice trying to close Sessegnon down but you can see what he was thinking. What Rojo was thinking watching that happen and also watching a player run right past him I don't know.

547~~~
He's played well but Jones had been a rock. Our backline looks shaky because they've had no time to gel, the best defenses are settled defenses. Rafael, Shaw and Jones have all been injured at different times this season and Rojo can't even speak the bloody language yet!
Respectfully disagree.

548~~~
So let me get this straight. He made one mistake, ok it was for their goal but Rafael is to blame also, and people are slating him like this..

Madness..

549~~~
Yeah, aggressive defenders get caught out like that few times. Even Kompany or Terry do and even Vidic did.

Problem is we don't have organization defensively as a unit for someone getting caught up high once in transition. 

Rojo and Rafael could and should have dealt it with it easily either in 2nd phase.

550~~~
The problem is that his idiocy wasn't a result of rustiness. He looked fine otherwise, this was simply just another example of his inability to position himself on the field to a high standard. 

I think this kind of thing is innate, you either get positioning or you don't, and it's why I have lots of nagging doubt in my mind.

551~~~
And that makes it acceptable for some of his dire defending? C'mon he's been in training for weeks now, it's not as if he's just began kicking a ball again tonight.

552~~~
Yeah, you'd think so.  Looked a bit too far up the pitch to me - but were dominating so much at that stage, you could maybe understand a little bit.  I dunno, we just seem to concede so flipping easily <span style="text-decoration: line-through">sometimes</span>

553~~~
Sad that he's still rated higher than Smalling.

554~~~
He wasn't very good. He has missed a lot of time through injury and before that he looked our best CB for a mile.

555~~~
Interesting how divided opinion is with our center backs. You can ask 3 different fans and get 3 different opinions when it comes to Evans, Jones and Smalling.

556~~~
I do like Jones a lot but I wouldn't mind seeing a 30 year defensive moster being bought to bring some experience to the back for a couple of years unyil Jones is ready. He still looks about 2 years away from being in anyway comparable to the likes of Kompany, Cahill etc

557~~~
Our defense is the other team's 12th man (13th if you're Leicester)

Whoever was responsible for allowing Vidic, Evra and Ferdinand to leave together should be ashamed!

558~~~
What is wrong with some of you people? He was our best defender before getting injured, which probably wasn't that hard, but at least he stepped up when others didn't. Comes back after about 2 months, has a decent game, and if it wasn't for Rafael dropping deep, noone be saying feck all about Jones tonight. Granted he could have dropped off, he went to press the ball and others around that should have seen that and reacted. 

I suppose this is why I always say Jones needs a reader next to him, though. Jones is very much a front foot defender - he likes to try and win everything. Nothing wrong with that, though. You have a lot of centre partnerships like this. Rio/Vidic for example. Vidic being the front foot defender and Rio sweeping. 

This is why we should be looking at someone who will drop off and sniff out any danger, which is why I think Smalling, or maybe Evans, could potentially be Jones's best partner, until we maybe get someone in January or the Summer.

559~~~
I'm a big fan of Jones but he was shocking for the second goal. Headless chicken stuff. 

I'm going to assume you haven't seen Evans play so far this season. He has been our worst defender thus far and that is quiet an achievement. I want him gone out the door in January. The guy is an accident waiting to happen. Always has been and always will be.

560~~~
He was fine all night long but for that brainfart. What's disapointing is that it's such a basic error that you would expect from McNAIR or any other juice, Jones is still young himself but after four years here we should be expecting and getting better from him. But then he hasn't played in nearly two months....

561~~~
Our worst player today.

562~~~
He wasn't out with a brain injury, I don't care how little football he's played in the last few weeks, the mistakes were down to him playing like a crash test dummy, he is totally at fault for the 2nd goal, he needs to realize he's not Rio, just hold the line with your CB partner, it's basic shit.

563~~~
The story of all our defenders. All of them have a stupid error in them. Id excuse Shaw,Blackett and McNair but the rest are here too long to be making these mistakes over and over.

564~~~
The unfortunate part is that we had a new manager who wouldn't be expected to exactly what was wrong with us but in normal circumstances you'd expect two from those three to follow the rest out. Firstly we need defenders that can be relied upon to remain fit then we need substantially better quality than what we currently have. Those two goals were gifts tbh, opponents need to work harder to score against us.

565~~~
There was a moment a ball was running through down Rafas side and he was chasing after it, he was panicking way before got to the ball. By the time he got to the ball he didn't know what to do and it kind of just hit him and went out for a throw in. I have no idea, what that was all about. 

And Im still trying to understand his thinking for the second goal.

566~~~
he thought the ball was gonna go out but it didn't... so it kinda surprised him and end up kicking it out giving away a throw in.


As for the second goal... he went to close down a opposition player who was with so much free space. It was the right thing to do. Sadly, Rafael was really disconnected from what was going on and took an eternity to react (never did actually...). Concentration has never been his forte. he should have stayed in line with the rest of the defenders and be much more alert to cover Jones.

567~~~
hardly - Rojo loses his man completely and Rafael plays him onside.

568~~~
Jones is the one that steps forward for no reason and loses contact with the other 3 members of the back 4, Berahino ran into his space not Rojo's.

569~~~
Neither of which would have mattered if Jones had done his job and not charged out of defence to close down someone Fellaini already had covered.

Jones' was the most idiotic piece of defending in that goal both in terms of chronology and severity, he's entirely to blame.

You mean the one who Fellaini had already closed down?

570~~~
Jones was a bit hung ho but Rojo is marking Berahino and then loses him completely - to say the goal is completely Jones' fault is bollocks, it is a general defensive feck up with several to blame.

571~~~
Paddy McNair!!

572~~~
Rojo has to come across into Jones sector of the defense to go after a player running into the acres of grass left by Jones, if Jones stays in formation the danger never materializes.

573~~~
No he wasn't, watch it again. It's Jones marking him and he literally charges away from his man. Look at where Berahino actually starts running from <a class="externalLink" href="https://mtc.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/87CB38F8311136078858513195008_23d1d1c1a22.5.1.3303552480896451667.mp4?versionId=DN._IBoQj57eHHPHDg4niVgLGd2Mj0Uw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://mtc.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/87...p4?versionId=DN._IBoQj57eHHPHDg4niVgLGd2Mj0Uw</a>

I honestly think some people don't bother watching the things they comment on.

574~~~
Typical brain dead Jones defending. He's all brawn and no brain. 

He's developing into your standard average English centre back.

575~~~
Ive watched it several times thank you very much and the link you posted shows nothing of the build up at all which explains why you dont have a clue what is going on - Rojo has Berahino, Jones is not with him at any point.

576~~~
You don't seriously expect anyone to believe that nonsense do you? Look at where he starts running from when the pass is played, it's in the video.

577~~~
I have always liked Jones, I think he has a future in the game but this game just confirmed my thoughts that he is the dumbest footballer we have had for years. That's not to say he is bad, he just doesn't have the thought process of a footballer.

I mean, him and Rojo playing out from the back was like watching school boys who didn't know each other. He would constantly play Rojo's right foot, behind him, anywhere but where Rojo wanted it. Nothing big but those little things can sometimes set the tone and I felt it did with our build up play, slowed it down for no reason.

Again, not bashing him as I think he will have a future in the game but as many think, he just doesn't have a brain, well a football one.

578~~~
there is feck all in the video - 7 secs?! No wonder you havent a clue - find a decent video of the highlights and you will see

Not that I am saying Jones is blameless either - he is a bit rash but at that point he has no one to mark

579~~~
to be fair they havent played together before - you would hope an understanding would develop over time. That's the problem though, we cant manage to find 2 CBs who can stay fit long enough to form a partnership

580~~~
Only seen the highlights, but I'd put Jones down as a key reason for the second goal. Left a massive hole in the center for the striker to run freely into. At this level doing that will get punished more often than not.

Saying that Rojo probably could have covered a bit better. Though that is more showing a lack of understanding between the pair which is understandable due to how little they have played together.

581~~~
If that was David Luiz doing the same, he'd be crucified. Jones should expect the same, that was definitely a "10yr old playing FIFA" moment.  He chased the ball instead of keeping shape and it cost us.

I do expect him to learn from it though, it was a brainless moment but I thought he was otherwise decent

582~~~
I see he's receiving some criticism, and it's warranted, but don't forget his partner in crime... Rojo wasn't much better...

583~~~
Yeh, it's not something I would be worried about going forward as it's a new partnership and Rojo was given a tough time by their strikers, so he had a tough game (grew into it) but just simple things, like playing his right foot not his left (surely he would know Rojo is left footed) just isn't good enough at this level.

It's not something that wins or loses a match, just something that frustrates the hell out of me because the time it takes a player waiting for the ball, or getting it onto his preferred foot, we could already be on our way if the pass was the right one.

584~~~
In this day and age of football, it is a capital crime if one expects to play for a big club.

What were you thinking at times, Fergie?

585~~~
You don't need more, but feel free to go and get this mythical version where Rojo is marking him and not Jones, despite Jones very clearly running away from his man. 

Seriously, go get the video of the full move and prove your point categorically if you think mine doesn't show enough.

586~~~
He was out for a few weeks....not 8 months with a knee injury....that could be a excuse for him for that terrible performance

Every player can improve no doubt about that and he's still young and he probably needs games in a row

But he needs to improve a lot in the next weeks and stay fit or he wouldn't be even a squad player next season!!!!!

587~~~
The rate at which Jones and Evans are regressing is quite staggering. It's a major worry now.

588~~~
He's definitely suffered from not playing regularly as a CB. The most bizarre role he played for us was as the most advanced man in a midfield three against Reading in 12/13, while Rooney was on the right. Fergie had me in tears.

I think he's done well this season, but it's no surprise that he played poorly today given that he's only back from injury and we reverted to four at the back. In a three-man defence, he can afford to be aggressive because we're generally more compact and the players understand how to cover him when he presses the opposition aggressively. When he came out today, our defence just didn't look comfortable in dealing with his moment of exuberance and this isn't a problem associated mainly with him:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2at0BFJbf9k?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Same thing happened earlier this year when Ferdinand came out to press Bony but Evans was slow to cover. Our players aren't used to playing in a high line.

589~~~
Of course you need more to analyse - you think LvG will show the team a 7 second video to show them where the mistakes that lead to this goal came from? Obviously not - the problems start far earlier. 

Berahinho comes from next to Rojo and only moves in the space Jones leaves AFTER Jones has pushed on - at no point does Jones leave him.
Rojo has to follow the man or tell his CB partner to pick him up - he does neither. TBF to Rojo he may assume he is offside and then that is down to Rafael for not being in line.
But that is the general problem in the defence at the moment, no one is taking responsibility to organise and communicate.

I honestly think some people don't bother watching the things they comment on <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

590~~~
It really is. Attackers are constantly improving their technique and movement whilst defenders aren't allowed to be as physical as they were in previous decades. Therefore for a defender you need to be intelligent and Jones is lacking a bit in that regard.

591~~~
Jones, as far as I'm concerned, left the space for Berahino to run into and cost us.  Rojo could've certainly done better but if Jones doesn't wander off from the back, Berahino is forced wide and doesn't get an open run at goal.  Rafael did play him on but to give him most of the blame (which some people did) I just do not agree with.

This was a very disappointing game from Jones.  Yes, he was injured and was our best centre back this season before that happened, but his mistake tonight was a basic positioning decision.  People get on Evans's case (deservedly) for doing stupid things but Jones also has plenty of deficiencies in his game.  He is prone to making rash tackles when attackers come into the box, he throws himself around recklessly (has injured himself from it several times), and at times completely loses his awareness.  I am not saying that Jones is a poor player but when your club expects to compete in Europe a CB needs to be almost flawless in his technique and decision-making.  Jones simply makes too many mistakes and a lot are mental, not because of physical problems.

Believe me, I want all of Jones, Smalling, and Evans to excel, but I just don't see any of them reaching their potential.  Jones had two seasons when he first came to United where he didn't get enough time to develop as a CB.  He played a lot of time in midfield and as a fullback, largely because of injury and the absence of depth in MF.  He, Smalling, and Evans have also been constantly injured and that time out of the game has kept them from getting some kind of momentum in their careers.  I think in the next 2-3 years all three players will be down the road to another club.  Rojo, Blackett, and McNair might come good but I would not be surprised at all if in another couple of seasons our CBs look completely different.

592~~~
Jones always had poor positioning. While he is always lauded in here for his 'brave' tackles, most of you forget that he wouldnt have had to make them, if he kept the opposition player in check.

593~~~
This. Defending is all about positioning nowadays.

Jones has arrived into the wrong footballing era at United.

594~~~
The place he's coming back from at 2-1 reminds me of that fecking Leicester game. Same idiocy was done by Smalling there so it's either some shit instructions from LVG or our defenders having a same hole in their brain that causes the same problem. They're acting as if they were a CDM.

And absolutely agree with what <a class="username" data-user="10411, @girish" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/10411/">@girish</a> says above, he's got terrible positioning for a CB and is praised for his last ditch tackles that shouldn't have to happen in first place.

595~~~
Hopefully LVG can train his brain and not his legs - he needs that

596~~~
I've always had my doubts about him but now he looks even less convincing. He doesn't look like he's got the intelligence to play in a title winning defence, which is where we want to be. He's a million miles away.

597~~~
Poor man's David Luiz.

598~~~
Excellent in first few games of the season. Below par in his first game back after a longish spell out injured. What can we conclude? He's always been useless. Well done, redcafe. You've excelled yourself.

599~~~
Wasn't he also the next Duncan Edwards according to Ferguson or Charlton?

600~~~
How long are we going to wait for this guy to come good? All we ever hear is about his 'great potential', i hope i'm wrong but looks like he's hyped up just because he plays for United. He's playing a like a mid table defender, even the likes of Ryan Shawcross have been outperforming him on a regular basis. It's even more disappointing when his opposite number in the WBA defence played better than him. 

The same can be said about Chris Smalling too, i reserve judgement for Rojo and Shaw who need a chance to show what they can do.

601~~~
You could argue Ferguson stunted his development - by playing him in midfield / RB rather than letting him develop solely as a CB.

602~~~
That wouldn't have helped, but Jones was 19 when somebody made the Duncan Edwards comparison and it was just down right stupid.

603~~~
Jones needlessly left a gaping hole for Berahinho to run into. Rojo should have followed him, but the fact that our defensive shape was a shambles at that point was down to Jones. It was a crazy decision to go charging after the ball like that, and I say that as a fan of Jones.

604~~~
Yeah, Jones blatantly dropped a bollock for that goal. Although Rafael and Rojo might have defended it better too. 

Really don't get all the wailing and gnashing of teeth about the overall performance of him and Rojo though. We defended much better than we have in most games this season. West Brom only created two decent chances in 90 minutes. You'd usually take that as a decent defensive performance. The horrific defending for their second goal is distorting opinions IMO.

605~~~
Where was he going for the Berahinho goal? He seems to have lost his confidence, looks lost on the pitch at times and genuinely seems nervous with the ball at his feet.

He needs a beast of a game. Here's hoping he can keep Costa quiet on the weekend. That's what he needs, a dominant performance to build on.

606~~~
I know he was at fault for the second goal but he was our best centre defender before his injury and this was his first game with Rojo and I am sure they will form a great partnership. I would like to be in the camp that believes he will be an amazing player for us.

607~~~
I am not sure if I am the only one but my gut tells me his best position should be next to Blind as an enforcer just ahead of the defence. I personally feel he has played his best games for us in that position. Obviously not comparing him to Keane but Jones is one of those players who can take the game by the scruff and do the dirty work and drive the other players forward. I just feel he can do this job better in a slightly more advanced position. He is a natural born leader/enforcer.

608~~~
I like to think Jones will still come good because SAF was a notoriously good spotter of young British talent, although when he came out with 'he could be our best player ever' after a half decent goal in a half decent performance against a half decent team, I did start to wonder if the man had completely lost the plot and was just fascinated with the many layered facets of Jones' face. I mean, Jesus Christ, best ever? Right now he doesn't even look like he can see a football, let alone produce great things with one.

609~~~
Ferguson has a lot to answer for. He decimated the potential of Smalling and Jones when they were at their most promising in favour of playing crocked geriatrics every two games. Letting it happen to the midfield with Giggs, Scholes and Pogba was a mistake, allowing the very same to happen to the defence was plain pathetic. Watching Jones last night irritates me all the more for having watching how good he was in his first season. We stifled his development during the most important developmental phase. Rotation may have set us back years.

610~~~
I think you are right, but not only for the reasons you mention, but because he's a liability in defence. Last night highlighted that - his decision making and positioning are suspect. I think he could do a more effective job in the midfield and less damage to the team during a game and himself - less last ditch charging in type tackles. Thing is, I don't think there is room for him AND Blind in VGs system.

611~~~
Ye I have already said that Jones is rash there, was just arguing with the opinion that the goal is completely his fault as there are mistakes from Rojo and also maybe Rafael as well.

Anyway Jones was our best defender this season before getting injured - this was his first game back and he has never played with Rojo before, hopefully if they can get a run of games then we will see a better understanding.

612~~~
Did you honestly even watch the video? Berahino is casually jogging onto Jones' side of the pitch as he charges out and then simply rotates a little bit once he realises Jones is in no-mans land. How on earth do you expect Rojo to cover that? Even if for some reason he blindly charges over to the right side of the pitch a second before Jones goes awol the exact same thing happens on his side with Sessegnon(?) running through. 

Simply in utter disbelief you would try and pin it on Rojo when it's so clearly Jones making an absolute clusterfeck charging out and leaving a gap even RvP would have scored in. Very few goals are ever one persons fault alone, but Jones has to take the majority flak for this one. You can't unpredictably charge out of the backline like that, sure Rafael should have been pushed higher up but the damage had already been done by Jones.

613~~~
I was always a fan of Jones in midfield but I doubt we will see much of him there now as we are severely lacking in CBs

614~~~
You do realise he was constantly played in different positions throughout his first season at the club? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

615~~~
You obviously havent read a word Ive written and I cant be arsed to explain it to you again.

616~~~
Yeah, that's exactly what's happening <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

617~~~
Didn't have to push up for their second goal, was like one of those horrible FIFA glitches. We have serious communication/immaturity problem among our defence, and this will cost us time and time again this season until we sort it out. We should have 24 points on the board but do not due to our simple defensive errors across the whole back four. There is not one person we can count on.

618~~~
Well, people are certainly very precious over certain players in this team.

At the moment the opposition are delighted to see him on the team sheet. That says it all.

619~~~
I'd put the majority of the blame on Rafael for the second goal.

Jones was marking Sessegnon all match and you actually want your CB to close down his man in midfield every so often. Obviously, you also want them to win the ball, so there was an obvious feck up from Jones there. But WBA never should have scored from that position. It was 1 against 3 - Rafael should have been in line with his teammates, and Rojo should have been covering much better than he did.

You expect defenders to apply pressure in midfield and occasionally get caught out of position. It happens in every game. Although it was a particularly bad one from Jones, the rest of his defence did even worse on the basics of defensive shape.

620~~~
I'd rather just use him as a utility man.

621~~~
Yep, unsettled back 4, with Jones' first game back in, what,  month? Wasn't as bad an outing as most are making out - obviously not getting the 3 points doesn't help when we're reviewing the performance.

Some of our attackers should be getting way more stick - RvP, Mata....Herrera at least has an excuse. Januzaj hasn't had much minutes either.

622~~~
Agreed with this. I'm not particularly a fan of Jones either - I actually Smalling - but aside from the error for the second goal and a few other moments, he was alright and not as suspect as Rojo who looked uncomfortable dealing with high balls and into Berahino's feet. Plus, he could have done better for the second goal too.

My main gripe with Jones' performance was how he dawdled on the ball for too long and constantly gave the ball away rather than his actual defensive work over the course of the ninety minutes. He wasn't exceptional, but did some good things also and was better aerially than he usually is. However, I still agree with others who have noted his positioning and reading of the game which is sorely lacking, particularly the former, and even if he showcases that on just the one occasion in a match he is punished for it.

623~~~
Yes, absolutely 100%. If the little idiot had stepped up, like you would expect from a senior defender, then the WBA forward would have been played offside. No goal.

624~~~
He cant just randomly step up. when Jones decided to push up, he should have let the whole defence know and scream at them to push up with him. 

There are four errors for me in that goal and I will number them in order of how bad they were.

1. Jones decides to push up which catches everyone off guard. There was only ONE dangerous pass that could have been played in that situation and Jones did nothing but help that situation become even more dangerous. If he holds his position the guy on the ball has to execute a super pass to get it to Berahino. 
2. Rafael could have seen Jones push up and pushed up with him.
3. Rojo could have realised that Berahino is free and told Jones to hold his position.
4.De Gea could have rushed out a bit more instead of staying back and allowing Berahino a bit more time to pick his spot.

625~~~
I might need to watch it again, but from memory I think the others were in line, it was just Rafael that didn't pay attention?

626~~~
Jones was in line with him, Jones pushes up alone and leaves Rafa behind.

627~~~
What about Shaw?

628~~~
Rafael didnt need to push up with Jones, he just needed to be in line with Rojo and Berahinho would be offiside - but I do agree that it is a collective feck up with blame due to all 3 of them

629~~~
Shaw was behind Jones and Rojo, not sure how in line he was with Rafa though.

630~~~
Fair enough. I don't think think I'll rewatch that shower of shite to analyze it though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

631~~~
Jones looked knackered after an hour, should have been subbed.
But I still think Rafael should have been checking his line.

632~~~
Yeah, lest people forget Jones looked really good for us up until his injury, albeit mostly in a back 3 <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

What's holding him back more then anything is the constant injuries tbf. He gets a run in the side and starts showing his undoubted talent, only to get a stupid injury to put him out for a couple of months again....rinse repeat. I had high hopes for both Jones and Smalling (I really thought he was going to become Rio MkII).

That hopes starting to fade by the injury though.

633~~~
That 2nd goal was solely down to Jones. There is no way the other defenders could cover him when he jumped in for that ball. When you are playing such a high line, the central defenders simply cannot allow that much space to an attacking player. If they get the ball right, there is no way to provide cover through the middle.

634~~~
Shaw and Rojo were more or less in line, with Rafael 2 or 3 yards too deep. Jones started off in line with Rojo/Shaw, then pushed up to try and make a tackle.

I know this because I spent a few minutes earlier on today freezeframing a clip on youtube, because of a discussion in a different thread.

635~~~
What were his passing stats like? He seemed sloppy to me. I just feel nervy with him in the backline, I miss the calm authority of Rio and presence of Vidic.

636~~~
Not bad but not great either. Him and Rojo were both in the low 80s, %wise. You'd usually expect a central defender to be 90%+, especially in a game where spent so much time passing it round the back.

Thought he carried the ball forward very well though. Something we haven't really seen enough of this season.

EDIT: Just looking at those stats, Rojo won 6/6 tackles while Phil won 0/0! (5 interceptions vs 3)

637~~~
He was, but it should have ended there. His performances were generally impressive and then took a nosedive the more we continued to use him like a utility man. Had Smalling and Jones played more games at centre half following on from their first seasons then they'd be better players. Injury has played its part too, in Ferguson's defence.

638~~~
I'm surprised that Rojo's percentage was so low as his passing seemed good to me, just shows how you miss things in the heat of the game. Just noticed the edit, Rojo did very well in his one on one's, it's his biggest strength, it is balls over his head he has to concentrate on as he's fine with actual aerial duels.

I like a CB to bring the ball out but I worry a bit when Jones does it because his positioning to get back into shape is not always good, plus with all of our players pushing on so high up I think we'd be better with him and Rojo just sitting in behind Blind for most games until LvG gets a proper CM partner for Blind who'll help with the covering when Jones brings the ball out.

639~~~
That's fair enough. I'd say the situation was mostly of Jones' making, with Rafael possibly being culpable for playing them onside. Both Rafael and Rojo could have reacted better. I agree on the second paragraph. I'm hopeful they can form a decent partnership.

640~~~
Maybe so, but given his 'senior' position, one would think he should be more aware that his main job is to be the last line of defense, not haring off to midfield. Sure, you can say communication & the cohesiveness of the back four still hasn't developed, but Jones just doesn't seem to know or understand what is expected of him. Maybe it's the shuffling around to midfield & defense plus an unsettled formation, but he just does not seem to be positionally aware or fully grasp what is needed from him in certain positions/formations. He could've done what he did on the 2nd goal with a back 3, but he sure didn't marshal the back 4 in that particular situation. He's more an all-action box-to-box midfielder for me than a full-time center back, but he doesn't have enough of the skills & awareness at this time to play in midfield all the time. He'd fit the Fletcher-sized hole that is used when we need a bit more defensive bite. 

Honestly, I can't really rate any of our current cb's. They each have their positives, but too many holes & inconsistencies to rely on them when we get back to a full-time schedule with Champions League & other cup commitments. I'm sure no one back there has LVG's full backing yet.

641~~~
Like a janitor?

642~~~
As would I. He can start by cleaning the mildew and moss off my deck. A few lights need installing as well.

643~~~
I don't see him ever becoming a top CB.

644~~~
I wonder why people keep saying this. What was that three games? Its not like we even kept clean sheets or anything. I guess your response may be that it wasn't his fault or that we would've conceded more if not for him. His early performances are nothing to shout about.

645~~~
Yes it was 3 games and he was voted MOTM in 2 of them plus 2nd only to Di Maria in the other - that's pretty bloody good in my book!

646~~~
Indeed it would be. So why did you even need to ask the question?

More to the point, did you not watch the games yourself?

647~~~
I did watch the games. He wasn't by any means great. We looked very lethargic in those early games. I don't trust Jones in that CB main role long term, the lad has a lot of improving to do. Physically he has everything you'd want in a top CB, but in reality he doesn't have much of a clue.  His positional sense is usually off, highlighted recently by how he charged forward before we conceded our second goal against West Brom. In most cases he's usually able to make up for his poor positioning by tracking back and making a last ditch tackle, winning a lot of praise and getting a lot of MOTM votes.

In reality a lot of situations he gets in can be avoided if he had a better reading of the game. He is clueless and acts purely on instinct, needlessly throwing himself into dangerous positions that often get him injured, perhaps others will say he has heart and is brave. There's a difference with being brave and using your head. Jones doesn't use his head. We've had no nonsense tackling CBs in the past like Stam and Vidic for instance (or Terry and Keown outside United), but on top of that those players were  also tactically astute and that's what set them aside, what made them flourish for years playing in big teams. This is LVG's challenge with Jones, to mold him into that type of CB who uses his head more.

648~~~
Needs to lay off the steroids or Human Growth Hormones.

649~~~
He's a bit thick.

650~~~
I dont think anyone claimed he was 'great', I simply said he was our best defender at the start of the season (which he was by a long way), arguably he was our best player full stop over those first 3 games.
Worth noting that we were playing the 3-5-2 before he got injured so he comes back into a different system with a new partner (Rojo) so it will surely take a bit of time to settle.

It is true that his reading of the game needs to improve and sometimes he can make a rash decision, but the ability is there for all to see. I have in past argued that I actually prefer him in the defensive midfield role but I was usually in the minority on that and now that we have Blind plus a complete lack of CBs (well ones that can stay fit anyway) I doubt we will see him there.

The biggest issue for Jones is that his constant injuries have massively hindered his progress, if he could just stay fit for a few months then I have no doubt that he can settle and iron out the issues in his game to become a top class player.

651~~~
This is the key point for me. I'm not totally convinced by Jones, and have reservations about his long-term future at United, but until he gets a prolonged run of games, he'll never get the chance to be a mainstay in our defence. I guess the same would go for Smalling.

652~~~
That's my issue too, for both Smalling and Jones. I don't doubt their ability and potential. I think they both have it in them to be colossal defenders, but their injury records are dismal. Smalling seems to get little knocks and tweaks and is out for ages. Jones usually gets injured by being over-zealous. The way he challenges for the ball, or the way he lands. I really like him as a defender, and he reminds me of Vidic in the way he commits himself, but he's just a little too clumsy with how he puts himself about. He wouldn't be so injury prone if he was just a little more careful.

653~~~
Honestly think we need Phill Jones in CDM, our lack of mobility in that area of the pitch is going to hurt us against the likes of Silva, Sterling and Oscar. Obviously he wants to try and cement his position at CB but this guy was class for us in the CDM role in the big games (Madrid away). Agains the big teams if we can have Carrick or Blind next to him then I think it would be the perfect mix between athleticism and technical ability.

654~~~
Jones's defensive stats in those games were out of this world, astounding even.

Just saying.

655~~~
What are the chances of him having a stormer against Chelsea?

656~~~
I'm counting on him and Rafael to be beasts. It is the sort of game that they could thrive in.

657~~~
It would rather be the sort of game they'll have a brainfart and costs us the points.

658~~~
Care to post them?

659~~~
First three PL matches (defensive stats + overall rating):

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi61.tinypic.com/2z7pjr9.jpg" src="http://oi61.tinypic.com/2z7pjr9.jpg"/>

660~~~
Jones will be a top top centre back. His only major complaint as of now are his rash, impulsive decisions that go wrong from time to time. People forget he is 22!

661~~~
Yeah all the ingredients are there. He just needs to make sure that he can remove the poor decision making from his game, which he still can at 22 as you said.

662~~~
I'm not convinced Jones will become a top centre back at all. In fact, I'd say Smalling has better raw attributes in his favour to become a superior defender.

663~~~
He's got worse with each game that he's played this season. He showed real promise In Sir Alex's final year but has been on a decline ever since. I trust Blackett and McNair in our defence more than I trust him.

664~~~
I know what your saying but is that not over exaggerating?

665~~~
Of course it is. McNair who started two games and looked competent, at best, over Jones? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

666~~~
Not for me personally it's not. That's just my opinion. I trust them - Blackett more so - than him.

667~~~
I don't agree with this. Pre-injury, Jones was our best defender and put in some very good numbers. He was one of the few players who benefited off Van Gaal's 3-5-2 because it allowed him to come out of defence and press aggressively. He came back against West Brom and was poor, but I don't think that should alter anyone's perception of the way he played before that this season.

FWIW, I don't rate Jones as highly as some members on here. He was guilty of making one big mistake every other game when he played at the back last season. His positioning needs to improve, but he's currently better than both Blackett and McNair.

668~~~
It seems to be a trend on here nowadays, a player has one bad game and they are classed as not good enough, or so and so is better etc. It seems a player isn’t allowed to make a mistake, and if they do they are deemed not good enough. Our defenders seem to be getting it harder than most, mostly because they aren’t Rio, Vidic or Stam.

I’ve read the same type of posts for more or less every player this season with Di Maria being the only exception, saying that I’m sure it won’t be long until some are calling for him to be dumped as well.

669~~~
His age has nothing to do with anything. He's been a first team player since 18. Thats five years experience which is a big chunk in a career. He really should be better than he is at this stage.

670~~~
How many games has he played at centre back? He has had to play right back and centre mid while also being injured for a substantial amount of time so that 'five years' statement doesn't tell the full story.

671~~~
It tells you all you need to know, though. He's far too injury prone to ever make it as a top defender.

672~~~
RVP

673~~~
Good point. 

I still harbour a great hope for Jones.

674~~~
We don't have the luxury of waiting that long on him. van Persie also only really had two seasons of top, top performances before being struck by injuries again and then declining.

675~~~
Berahino wouldn't have to be played offside if Jones had stuck to his man instead of charging forward, creating space to pass and run into. While Rafael should be keeping with the line, his position is largely irrelevant in that a decent defender would let the two midfielders ahead of him mark the player with the ball.

676~~~
He’s 22 so has plenty of time on his hands, further, we don’t have to wait on him, he is already a good player and will only get better as time goes on. I’ve never understood this notion some fans have that we have to get rid of a player when we have absolutely no idea if his replacement will be not only good enough but be a better player than the one we got rid of.

The same argument can be made for the majority of our team, Rooney, RVP, Smalling, Jones, Evans, Rafael, Fellaini, Falcao, Carrick, De Gea, Mata have all come in for unjust criticism this season for one reason or another. Fans seem to be impatient these days, maybe it’s because we are struggling in the league that fans are becoming impatient with the players.

677~~~
It's a bit much to be writing off a 22 year old due to injuries. Quite a few players suffer them when they're young but grow out of them. If anything, Smalling is the bigger concern, as he's a few years older and doesn't look to have improved since he joined.

678~~~
How did you drag my post up from page 13?!

Anyway, I still feel the same way. To me, entirely blaming Jones there is like going back to when the ball was lost 30seconds earlier and blaming that player for conceding. Once Jones has made his error then it's up to the players around him to react. Rafael doesn't do that quickly enough and plays Berahino onside as a result. 

Jones obviously made an error and I'm not saying otherwise. Rafael should have stepped up though.

679~~~
Sorry but it's basic 101 of playing centre back. You let the players ahead of you pressure the ball unless there are none, in which case you stand him up until support arrives. The last thing you do is charge the player and allow him to pass to another player to go through on goal.

680~~~
This happens all the time, though. Jones is a front foot defender, and he was doing his job pressing the player. Kompany does this all the time for City. As Jones pressed, either Rafael should have recognised that and stepped up with him, or Rojo should have slightly dropped off 5 yards.

Personally, I think this comes from a lack of understanding, and it showed it was the first time that back four played together, which I think people are completely forgetting.

I think when the centre backs get to know each others play style, they'll know what to do in certain situations. Having said that, I do think Rojo is the wrong type of centre back to partner Jones. He needs someone like Rio next to him, in my opinion. Someone who reads the game exceptionally well.

681~~~
No that's not an excuse, there are two midfielders ahead of him. Jones should be holding a line and preventing the pass and if Jones holds his position and the pass is played, all he has to do is step forward and intercept it.

682~~~
Where were they then? You can talk about ifs and buts all day, but that's football. That's like me saying, if Blind pressed then maybe Jones would have held the line, which meant no goal. Or maybe, had Jones not pressed and somehow West Brom still scored, some of you lot still be blaming him for not pressing.

683~~~
Whether they press or not is irrelevant. Marking the striker behind him is Jones' priority in that situation regardless.

684~~~
Like I said, I don't think Jones is blameless. I agree with what you're saying.

Where we differ is that I blame Rafael for not reacting and adapting to Jones' movement. Jones going rambo is no excuse for switching off.

685~~~
It's not like there was a significant amount of time for Rafael to make that decision, for him to play the striker off-side they would have to move out together. Jones moves up, the pass is played and bang, Rafael should probably have anticipated better but Jones' movement was unnecessary and I guess none of his fellow defenders expected him to charge out like that.

686~~~
No, the striker, as they were playing with one uptop, is both the centre backs priority, therefore, if one defender presses (Jones), then the other one drops (Rojo).

687~~~
man, Phil Jones fulfills almost every single feature of the stereotypical English footballer

688~~~
How did you get this?

689~~~
It tells the majority of the story. Jones has played more times as a CB than RB and CM. He still has more game experience than the average 22 year old defender. Its a short career, and with his early initiation he should realistically be hitting his prime in about 2-3 years.

690~~~
I'd like to know too. Could you provide the source <a class="username" data-user="69303, @Chesterlestreet" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69303/">@Chesterlestreet</a>

691~~~
It's from whoscored - in other words Opta stats.

If you mean specifically how did I get it in that particular format, the answer is that I pasted it together myself for the sake of saving space.

692~~~
So it seems that Jones is injured <b>again</b>.

Who would've thought.

693~~~
He will never fulfil his potential unless he starts treating his body like Giggs. Yoga and random sex with your in-laws every other day.

694~~~
Seriously, feck him. Honestly had enough.

695~~~
This is beyond a joke now.

696~~~
Extremely worrying that someone so young is so prone to injury. Needs to take some advice from Giggs and somehow find a way to stay fit. I wonder how much time he spends in the gym or doing something similar (e.g. Yoga) to keep himself in top shape.

Its beyond ridiculous at this point though.

697~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> if true.

698~~~
Agreed. Just sell him. He has the potential to be a world class defender, but he's more trouble than he is worth now. We can't rely on him or Smalling to even play, let alone fulfill their potential.

LVG should buy like 3 new defenders and sell these two.

699~~~
I'm losing so much hope of him becoming a future starter for us. At this rate all he'll be is squad depth. 

Get a new CB or two ASAP. Just can't trust these fecking brittle players to get a decent run of games any more.

700~~~
You can only laugh<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

701~~~
He can't stay fit, and when he plays his lack of positional awareness is a worry.

702~~~
Wage thief should be sold in the summer. He's an absolute joke.

703~~~
With every injury that goes by, his alleged potential seems to grow.

704~~~
On one training video I've seen he does squats totally wrong, maybe that's one of the problems and he's injuring himself constantly.

705~~~
I've been a Jones defender -- that is, defending Jones from his critics -- but I've run out of defenses for him.  The man can injure himself even watching film of next week's opponent.

706~~~
Any news on what type of injury before we start crucifying him?

707~~~
I'm really sick of him <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

It isn't funny anymore with him!!!!!!

708~~~
No time for that!

709~~~
We have Hargo back...in a way

710~~~
To think we could have had Varane <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

711~~~
Apparently injured himself and Falcao in training, get him out the club, his recklessness is costing us now, when it comes to injuring other players from our team I think that's his signal to leave

712~~~
No we couldn't, he rejected us for Madrid and said some very disparaging things about us afterwards.

713~~~
And Saha !

Jone SahaGreaves

714~~~
just feck him off already - what's the point in keeping him if he's always bloody injured!

715~~~
All 3 of our first choice RCB's  are crocks.

716~~~
Source?

717~~~
Well then will have to feck off SMalling, Evans too and Rafael maybe as well.

718~~~
I should probably know better but seen it posted a couple of times on twitter earlier, around dinner time

719~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9516589/transfer-news-raphael-varane-says-he-rejected-move-to-man-utd-after-they-signed-phil-jones" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...-move-to-man-utd-after-they-signed-phil-jones</a>

One of the reasons was us signing Jones.

720~~~
His arse most likely.

721~~~
smalling and evans, yes I agree. 

Rafael, bar last year, was available for most games.

722~~~
Well then we should maybe consider signing fit defenders rather than sticking to injury prone defenders.

723~~~
Don't think any of them had injury records when we signed them tbf. See Herrera. Barely injured last 2/3 seasons and has missed half of our games so far. Same with Shaw.

Some is down to injury proneness, training regime and style of play. Some down to luck really.

724~~~
What? And how do you know that? Pretty sure Jones had a serious injury at Blackburn. Smelling didn't play enough games to get injured.

725~~~
Injury prone to say the least, Im getting tired of the whole back 4 constantly missing games its ridiculous.

726~~~
So, took a look at transfermarkt and his injury breakdown and since 12/13 season ( including it that is ) he's been out injured ( not adding cards absences ) for about 240 days. Not sure whether they've noted all the injuries and so on.

727~~~
It would be classic if Jones ran into Falcao in training and that's why both are out.

728~~~
This. It's utterly pathetic and WAY too frequent, either players or physios need to start being replaced.

729~~~
Smalling has said in a interview during the week that Jones plays in training like in a match

730~~~
What's the injury this time?

731~~~
How did he get injured? for such a big lad he's brittle.

732~~~
How many games was he back for then? One? Stupid

733~~~
No i was wrong.....it wasn't Smalling.....W.Keane has said that

<b>Who is the most competitive in training?</b>
One of them has to be Phil Jones. He doesn't hold back – he just puts his head where it hurts all the time. He definitely flies into every tackle. All the lads are determined, to be honest, but he sometimes looks even more determined because he puts his foot in where some people would hesitate. He's my pick.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2014/Oct/will-keane-training-talk-interview.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...e=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

734~~~
Hm. Fine line between "determined" and "out of control", I guess.

No idea how he got himself injured this time, be it said - but it's hard not to see Phil's undeniable injury proneness as wholly unrelated to his gung-ho style.

735~~~
I say this as an Anglophile-love British understatement. As a Yank I'll put it this way-he's a moron.

736~~~
Something we will have to learn is to STOP training that hard. FFS, there are managers out there who don't mind taking training sessions with not that much intensity and yet provide a good preparation for matches.

Seriously, go feck yourself, Jones. How can anybody be so stupid as a footballer?

737~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ...... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

738~~~
Yeah it's a bit worrying at this point.  He's young etc. and all that but "if I put in 100% then more often than not everything'll be okay" only takes you so far.

739~~~
Or that - yes.

Still, he is the greatest moron ever - let's never forget that.

740~~~
Injured again? He could become a top centreback if he didnt spent so much time being injured. It such a shame.

741~~~
Jones injured again? Really?

What the actual feck..

742~~~
Wouldn't be surprised. Wouldn't be the first time he injured one of our own. Really needs to start remodeling his game a bit and realize not everything needs to be a two footed last ditch tackle.

743~~~
Shin Splints then.

744~~~
The more it goes, the more I hope Louis will give him enough serious warnings and then not even have him among the subs for a few games whenever he's fit if Jones doesn't heed those warnings.

It's time he either gets the memo or prepares to pack his bags away for good.

KeninDC said it best: he's a moron.

745~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Truth.

746~~~
Not sure you can do much about shin splints, they just seem to happen. Unfortunate for him, but its way too soon to write him off. He's only 22 and is a good player, just so far injury prone.

747~~~
Maybe he came back too quickly. Who knows?   I worry about his body if he can't stay healthy at 22.

748~~~
Do you honestly believe any single top manager, that is not Fergie, would allow himself to carry on with that kind of walking wounded for that long while he appears to be also a risk for his teammates in training? There are managers out there who would have no qualms at selling that kind of player simply because of too many injuries or they are simply not intelligent.

749~~~
There are plenty of injury prone players playing for top clubs... You just have to have faith that they'll get over the injuries. He's only 22, a good 5 years away from his prime probably, so he has plenty of time on his side. Van Persie was injury prone for years and then became one of the best strikers in the world. You don't just give up on someone because they have poor injury luck. There is a point where its fair to say the injury problems won't change (like being well past that point for Anderson) but definitely not when Jones is only 22.

750~~~
James Ducker summed it up pretty well in a tweet today. It really is becoming a joke now. He was injured yet again today. I'm sorry but he's got to go. He's made out of glass, we can't rely on him and it's the same story with Smalling and Evans. Get rid of all of them.

751~~~
Rafael has had a good injury record? Thats your claim? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

752~~~
The exact opposite actually. With every injury more and more people write him off altogether.

753~~~
If the training stuff is true then he should consider toning it down a bit. Surely after the fifth or sixth time you got injured in a relatively short space you'd change your approach to training.

754~~~
He's got shin splints. You don't get shin splints from being too enthusiastic in the tackle.

755~~~
Yeah, people are on auto-pilot in this thread with the reasoning about this latest "injury", though I suppose that's understandable given his track record.

I think it's the first time I've heard a professional footballer being out because of shin splints.

I absolutely hate shin splints.

756~~~
It's an odd one alright. And yes, they suck.

757~~~
It's pretty weird to be fair.

Of course everyone hates them but I've also only ever known overweight unfit people after their first time running in years to get them lol.

758~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Perfectly put. It's people like me who goes running twice a year who you expect to get shin splints. Not Manchester United players.

759~~~
Kieron Dyer used to struggle with shin splints <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

760~~~
I shall repeat for you my dear child.

"Rafael, bar last year, was available for most games."

Comprende?

761~~~
During Fergie's last year Rafael was available most matches.

762~~~
Be good to see a poll of how many people will think he will make it here or in what capacity. The replacement to Rio/Vidic when he came is becoming less likely. Not once in his time here have people been confident that he will start at the weekend or put a run of games together. Now Rio/Vidic have gone, he does have that chance but he's always getting injured. 

IMO, Smalling is the better of the two defenders and something I have always thought. In a static aerial battle, he does lose the majority which is a worry, if he has a run on the striker, then's he fine most of the time but any balls into the six yard box he is going to struggle unless DDG helps him out. His positioning can be a problem as well, as he can get brought into areas that he shouldn't be in. 

His main problem is his desire to win the ball. Instead of letting the striker just shield the ball or keep it away from him, he will try win it and clatter into the striker giving away silly fouls or free kicks.

763~~~
Even if he was injury free I still don't think he's a centre back to dominate at a European level. The fact he's constantly injured just takes the piss.

I said at the start of the season, I think he's likely to be sold by Van Gaal unless he improves massively and stays injury free but as far as I'm concerned, this season he's been a poor defender, a really dumb footballer generally and if he can't stay fit, then he must be sold.

Him and Smalling to me are genuinely examples of the English vastly overrating their own.

764~~~
Exactly. This is why I'm against any form of favoritism towards local talent.

If the Englishman can prove he's as good or better than a foreigner on how to play the game intelligently, then he will have his chance and not otherwise. Seriously, if McNair, Blackett and possibly Thorpe can make the jump under Van Gaal while being a lot more intelligent than Jones ever is, then I see no reason for keeping Jones at all.

765~~~
Smalling is not rated even nearly as high as Jones. The general consensus is that he's a decent defender who lacks a footballing brain.

766~~~
I think Jones and Smalling complement each other well, much like Rio and Vidic did.

For both, the problem has been injuries and inconsistent gametime at CB. I would like to see Smalling/Jones lining up together for a few games and get them to forge an understanding.

767~~~
We've been saying that for 3 years. There's no chance in hell you could play both of them consistently, they won't get over the injuries to an extent where you could rely on them playing 35-40 games a season together.

768~~~
You may be right, I do think that being played out of position has hampered both players development regardless of injuries however.

Basically if I was LVG this season I would be playing Smalling/Jones at CB when fit. At the end of the season if we can review it and if they haven't been able to stay fit, look at moving them on and replacing next summer.

769~~~
Cut our loss with him sooner than later - it may end up being a bad move but, even if we get a player in with maybe a little less potential but, can give us a consistent foundation - that will be so much better than the hope Jones can be available for selection for more than 3-4 games in a row. 

We've been too nice for too long to injury prone players, Saha, Hargreaves, Anderson, Owen.

770~~~
Don't shoot the messenger, but apparently he's out for 3 months. Could be bollocks though

771~~~
With shin splints?!

772~~~
Jones and Smalling were highly rated at young ages and for good reason. They were excelling in a Manchester United team fighting for titles, their nationality has naff all to do with that. What has prevented them from improving on that promise has been a mixture of terrible luck with injury and wank management from Ferguson. They were two of the best centre half prospects in world football then and what has since transpired doesn't change that.

773~~~
Andy Cole used to suffer from them in his first few years here, I believe after he came back from his big injury around 96(7)?
not to defend Jones as when I heard he was out after 1 game back wanted to connect my fist with the door, but I suppose they can happen... particuarly after injury layoffs it would appear.

774~~~
How long do they usually keep players out?

EDIT: He could be out for 2 and a half months give or take. I just read that shin splints can take up to 72 days to fully recover

<a class="username" data-user="18153, @SATA" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/18153/">@SATA</a> your intel is realistic.

775~~~
They weren't much rated outside of United fans. In fact, I never got the Jones hype at all. He gives it all, but that's it so far. Not very intelligient, only average technically and perma-injured. Smalling was fantastic on his first season but since then he has actually regressed. His inability to pass is also disturbing.

Obviously, both can improve, but I am not sure how much we can wait for it. If we want to win the title next season, we should have a good defense, something that I don't feel our center backs can provide.

776~~~
Source?

777~~~
Up to 72 days = 3 months?

Ok.

778~~~
Any opposition supporter who had watched them at the 2011 European U21 Championship's will have rated them highly. There were two of, if not the best, defenders there. It wasn't hype that urged Ferguson to buy them, it was their talent. Like I said, they were right up there with the cream of their age bracket. What has happened since just doesn't reflect so kindly in hindsight.

779~~~
I think Robbie Fowler used get them back in the day during his Liverpool. days.

780~~~
I agree on Jones. He seems to be highly rated by quite a lot for presumably his 'lionheart' character. Smalling on the other hand, I don't know many fans of other teams that rate him. I watched the game on Sunday with a Chelsea fan and he was laughing at our defence, saying how shit Smalling is.

781~~~
Not really. England couldn't even pass the group stage so no idea where does it come that they were the best defenders there.

Anyway, that is a lower level football. On United, Smalling had a single promising season, while Jones a few promising games. Usually on midfield doing the marking job.

782~~~
And? 72 days is 2 and a half months. People usually round off to the next whole number, not the last or one previous. Therefore three months is realistic.

783~~~
We're splitting hairs here but you're wrong. 72 days is two and one third months. You round a third down, not up. Also the phrase you used was "up to 72 days" which clearly excludes the 90+ plays you get in 3 months. 

Doesn't matter though. I'm calling bollox on both the (weirdly exact) "up to 72 days" timeframe for shin splint recovery and this (unsubstantiated) three months that Jones is out for.

784~~~
I don't know who his sources are, but if they guessed 3 months then they are not far from the truth. The article I read in fact said an average of 72 days, so I was wrong in saying 'up to'. The article was written with professional runners in mind, not footballers, but I expect it to be similar. 

<i>Healing time varied widely among the injured runners. Those with calf strains were back to normal running in an average of 30 to 40 days, <b>while those with shin splints needed an average of 72 days to fully recover</b></i>

<i><b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-prevention-recovery/shin-splints-are-most-common-new-runner-injury" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-...hin-splints-are-most-common-new-runner-injury</a></b></i>

785~~~
Fair enough. If it's an average, then that would explain the exact 72 days figure. 

Don't think that data is transferable though. Big difference between recovery times for professional athletes and Joe Schmoes who've just taken up jogging.

786~~~
I don't think Jones and Smalling are overrated. I'd happily make those deals again for younger versions of both and for the same money. The talent is there, but if you don't progress then you're not going to be good enough.

787~~~
The way hes going, it seems he`ll be at best remembered for his myriad of funny faces

788~~~
So is this 3 month thing from a legit source? Or just pure speculation?

789~~~
They were decent at the 2011 Euro's but feck me, talk about hyperbole.

Smalling was excellent against Chelsea, hopefully he's not injured sometime next week in training and actually get's a run of games, Jones I've completely lost my faith in, you just knew it was a matter of time before he got injured again, completely made of glass.

790~~~
There's no concrete info yet.

791~~~
Surely it’s time we started giving serious consideration to off loading Jones or view him as a backup utility player, if we are to keep him then probably one of Smalling and Evans needs to go. It’s no longer relevant how good or how much potential these guys have because they just can’t stay fit even when we are only playing once a week and CB is one of the most important areas in terms of being able to play the same players regularly. Chelsea have used 1 combination at CB compared to our 7 so it isn’t really surprising they defend a lot better, the manager to needs to be looking to bring in at least 1 new player there or maybe even 2 because this is costing us points and this problem has been around for a few seasons now.

792~~~
When fit he's the best out of the three. I honestly believe if he wasn't as injury prone he would have been one of the first names on our team sheet and a fans favourite. Fact is though if there's any position you can't afford to have an injury prone player its centre half. And we have three of them! 

Out of interest what was his injury record like at Blackburn?

793~~~
He took a torn knee cartilage injury in his first full season at Blackburn (right before he signed at United) and was sidelined for 3 months for that.

794~~~
We signed Jones after he tore knee cartilage but we wouldn't sign Jordan Henderson because he ran funny.

Makes sense.

795~~~
Makes no sense to sign players who've recently had a serious knee injury, right?

<span style="color: #ffffff">Ruud, Falcao...</span>

796~~~
Almost ridiculous when you think about it. I hope Van Gaal will ship him off when possible; Jones has been a waste of time and money after almost 4 years with such injury record and a total lack of self-awareness during that time. By now, he should be finding ways to play a safer approach in matches as well as in training, but no. That's too much for someone with such a low IQ.

797~~~
Bit rich to accuse someone of having a low IQ in a post where you use "ergonomic" in that context.

798~~~
Anyway, that doesn't take away the fact that it's stupid that Jones has not adopted a safer approach by now for his own career's sake, and regardless of how many injuries he sustained so far. Are players too thick to listen to doctors at times?

Gambling everything like he does, I would not be surprised if he retires by age 27 because of injuries.

799~~~
It's not really surprising that a 22 years old centerback is not mature. The question is should we nurture him ? Does he worth it ?

800~~~
I've no idea if the club doctors have been telling him how to play the game or not. I've definitely heard coaches say that you're more likely to get injured in a half-hearted tackle than a committed one though.

I think he has to take some responsibility for his own safety but it's his committed approach to the game that is a big part of what makes him such a prospect. He might find a better balance in time. He's still young.

801~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

802~~~
Sounds like John Terry. Maybe that's why Jones is so highly rated in the UK, but do we actually want a John Terry-type of CB? Some may say a better comparison would be Vidic, but I never thought Vidic was of the barnstorming, bringing the ball forward type, which you see Jones do a bit too much for my taste. If you're a CB, defense first, otherwise become a DM. 

It's obvious Jones has talent, but I wonder if there are enough brains there to get the most out of him for a full season or two. If only we could transfer Rio's brain into his body, LOL.

803~~~
John Terry's had a great career and is very highly rated outside England too. Being captain and one of the best players for a team that made two CL finals and dominated domestically will do that. 

I don't get this redcafe trope that John Terry is crap because he makes a lot of last-ditch tackles. And that's as someone who thinks Ferdinand was a better player. More than one way to skin a cat though.

804~~~
Evans has shown more in his time at United to be clearly <i>the best when on form</i>.

805~~~
The comparison starts and ends with their no nonsense approach to tackling and putting their bodies where others would not. Terry is way better than Jones, even at 18 Terry was exceptional, he made his debut at 17 just short of his 18th. Terry is technically and positionally better than Jones. He is also more tactically astute. English fans hope Jones will be the next Terry but he won't at this rate.

806~~~
If Jones ends up like Terry i'd be ecstatic. I know a few on here think Terry is overrated but he's a quality CB.

807~~~
Yeah, Terry was one of the very best English centre backs and he has the medals and awards to prove it. There wasn't much between him, Campbell and Rio Ferdinand.

808~~~
Philistine's latest affliction doesn't seem to be healing too well:

LvG said from the start shin splints were a hard one to predict as far as return date goes.

810~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> What the hell is going on?

811~~~
Surely we're always concerned about him re-injuring himself.

812~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

813~~~
What a waste of wages him, Evans and Smalling are.. no matter their potential.

814~~~
We are paying Nani's wages to play for another club!

815~~~
Feel for him. Shin splints suck ass

816~~~
Shop window loan that's gonna pay off judging by the current form.

817~~~
Strange story considering the story he references actually says Jones is back in training

818~~~
As much as I love Evans, I think his time is up here. Will turn 27 early next year, faced long spells out with injury and when fit was underwhelming at best and disaster at worst. Can't see Van Gaal having too much time for him. Philistine on the other hand is only 21 and a player with his physical attributes is worth waiting for and hoping that he grows out of his injury issues.

819~~~
He'll be fighting fit soon enough, getting back to the top of his game and making us all speculate as to whether or not he's our greatest ever.

Then injure himself flying off a bouncy castle or something.

820~~~
*sigh*

821~~~
BAAAAAHAHAHAHAH. Phil Jones. Our greatest ever! That's absolutely fabulous.

What is it about English players that makes people overrate them so spectacularly. So far he has been very, very average at United. Prone to mistakes and also prone to injury. Makes some good last ditch challenges, due to in fairness to him absolutely giving it his all, and having great physical ability to get back ... but most of these clean ups come after his own mistakes.

Greatest ever. Good God. That's brilliant.

822~~~

823~~~
<a class="username" data-user="65160, @iBoss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65160/">@iBoss</a> Fergie gets it wrong too.

824~~~
Too right. Fergie absolutely got it wrong about a lot of players. He also praised Liam Miller and Djemba-Djemba very highly

825~~~
I said that in reference only to something SAF said, and to be fair, English or not he has had some outstanding performances.

826~~~
I dont agree with that in the slightest - clearly he is an injury liability but the talent is there for all to see, he just doesnt manage to stay fit.

And it wasnt just Fergie showering him with praise either, other managers he worked with like Capello and Allardyce went out of their way to talk up his potential as well - a massive shame that injuries has stopped him from progressing from that early form.

827~~~
What are his own managers going to do? Talk him down?

828~~~
Is that the only alternative?

829~~~
That's not the point - they have a full squad of players and he was regularly picked out for particular praise by a whole raft of managers.
IIRC Allardyce compared him to Essien and Capello said the only similar players he ever worked with were Baresi and Hierro - it doesnt get much better than that.

830~~~
High praise indeed. Hopefully they are proved right. Haven't seen anything in him to suggest he'll be one of our greats myself, hence why I found original comment so funny, but God knows I've been wrong before

831~~~
Philistine, our best ever. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a clanger from SAF.

832~~~
Well if he cant stay fit then he never will be - even now he has not really progressed enough from the days that his managers were raving about his future, but that is due to injury and not ability.

833~~~
Won't be here next season never mind being one of our greats.

834~~~
Either him or Smalling (most likely) will probably be off, yeah.
I don't see a huge future for either as a centre back here, but I'd keep Jones as a utility player.

835~~~
I'd personally disagree with that. I don't really think it's only injury, when he has been fit I think his performances have been completely and utterly overblown by most fans. Just my own opinion mind you.

836~~~
An opinion we share. 
That's not me saying <i>"He's been utter rubbish"</i>, before anyone gets angry.

837~~~
I do feel it's the "English barnstorming player" bias. He used run around a lot, so you'd see a lot of him, so people would constantly be talking about what a great performance he had. What I was seeing, was a player routinely out of position, flying back to make last ditch challenges (albeit great ones at times) which left him even more likely to get injured. Every decent game he played was lauded as outstanding.

838~~~
I think it's a bit of:

a) Looking good at Blackburn - in a 6-18 yard box centre back role.
b) Having a big, strong physique, and being pretty quick and strong.
c) Being 'fearless' etc.

So you can understand why he was a relatively big deal at the time.
But, to me, he's always been a 6-18 box defender. Good at the getting something on it, getting in front of shots, sliding in to block shots.
But I still don't see a truly natural defender. 30 odd games of Phil Jones would 100 mph most of the time. And that's not what being a defender is all about.

He has enough qualities to stay here as a utility player, but not to be a long term centre back, in my opinion.
I'm already seeing more in McNair.

839~~~
I used to be a "Phil Jones could be the next Bobby Charlton mini-me" man, but I've given up all hope on him as anything more than a solid squad player.

If you don't have the football brain to avoid ridiculous tackles that lead to self-inflicted injuries, you don't have the football brain to become a United legend.

840~~~
Jones is only 22. People seem to forget that when discussing tranfers. He has struggled with injuries but if that stops we have a talent on our hands!

841~~~
Isn't he also a bit slow to be a top class centre back in today's game?

Mind you, Fergie certainly seemed to rate him.

842~~~
No. Both he and Smalling are fast for CBs

843~~~
He played about 50% (or maybe more) of his games at Blackburn in midfield so I don't buy that he's a "6-18 yard box centre back", whatever that is.

844~~~
Oh yes, Jones is no slouch and I would say that Smalling is pretty fecking fast - not just for a CB.

845~~~
I think Jones is being underated here a bit. I think he has the capability to be a superb centre back. Injuries have hampered his progress but even as it stands he's still very young and has loads of time to develop and mature. Like Smalling and Rafael he has all the ability in the world but needs to stop getting injured.

846~~~
Fair enough if he did. Though he made his biggest impression as a centre back in the bigger games. And when he played midfield it was in a holding role, in a 'backs to the wall' style Blackburn side. Playing as a holding midfielder for them hardly showcases an array of skills.
I'm pretty sure he was effectively a third centre back in their set up. 

What I mean by '6-18 yard box defender' is that he's the type usually playing for a mid table team - one who is best when he 'gets his head on it' and blocks shots almost all game, due to his committed/guns blazing style.
But I'm not convinced he's a well rounded centre back for a more forward thinking team.

And usually when he's played in midfield (even under Sir Alex), he's there to 'do a job'.
I like him, and think he has good qualities - I'd keep him as a utility player for sure. And he can play plenty of games with that role.

847~~~
Sorry, I don't understand how you can be pretty sure he was a "3rd centre back" when he played in midfield yet you clearly don't really remember him playing there. And he's played a number of games for us in midfield under Fergie where he was (inexplicably) our most advanced midfielder. He's a very decent footballer, albeit a bit like a giant terrifying, retarded doberman puppy at times.

848~~~
At Blackburn, he made his name as an all action defensive midfielder sitting in front of, and protecting, the back four.

849~~~
Who said I don't remember him playing there? I didn't realise it was more than 50% (if that is the case) but then again, I didn't go out of my way to watch Blackburn unless they were playing the better sides/us.

I agree he's a "decent" footballer, but I don't think he's intelligent/good enough to play as a centre back for a forward thinking team. A good utility player here, or a centre back for a team who do more 'relentless heading and blocking shots' where anywhere will do.

Some think he has all the potential in the world. I happen not to.

850~~~
Those debating Jones' pace; He is quick when in full sprint and in fact over the first 10 yards or so for a CB, but where he falls a bit short is his sluggishness when turning on his heels and that is why he always has to commit to a last ditch challenge or looks like he's been easily beaten. If he can train his turn of pace, i.e work on snap strength in his thighs, hips whatever, he can still become a top CB. And of course one would expect his positioning to improve with age and experience. There are rarely young CB's who display Maldiniesque intelligence and positioning under the age of 30, don't forget how many feck ups Rio got himself into in his early career with us.

851~~~
Nah. Lets write him off at 22. He will be forever injuring himself and his team mates. We can all be certain he won't realise his potential. <span style="color: #ffffff">right?</span>

852~~~
Bryan Robson will be disappointed to read that.

853~~~
Since joining United. 

2011-12 - 41 games
2012-13 -  24 games
2013-14 - 39 games

Playing 40 games in a season is very respectable(Rafael played 40, once, in his best season), that doesn't include the matches he wasn't played in too so he was probably available another couple of games. So people are overplaying his injury problems, he completed two out three seasons so far.

854~~~
The problem with that is those games came with breaks. He should now be playing every week, which takes it's toll.

I've not given up on him unlike the other two. He's still young enough to get over these silly injuries.

855~~~
an "all action defensive midfielder" in a defensive teams is a different job compared to be a CB in an attacking team. He is lacking tactical awareness. As a CB its not about flying into tackles, but about positioning yourself in a way so you dont need to take unnecessary risks. Good CBs only commit themselves into 1v1, when they have to or when there is cover. Its the problem that Kompany has sometimes.

856~~~
I think even that part has been largely overplayed and only applies on 12-13. Rio Ferdinand played roughly 40 games per season in average in 8 out of his 11 seasons here(the other 3 he played "all" 50). After three seasons at United Rio had pretty much identical stats as Jones had after his first three seasons.

857~~~
Agreed, and that was basically my point about "essentially a third centre back".
A defensive midfielder in a Blackburn side does less with the ball than a centre back in a top/forward-thinking side.

Blackburn spent half their games blocking shots and heading the ball out. So playing in midfield for Blackburn doesn't really prove to me that he's not a 'get blocks on it' type defender.

He played in midfield for us whenever we expected to not have much of the ball, and needed an extra blocker and physical presence.
He's decent with the ball, but I'm not yet convinced he's more than a Blackburn style defender.

858~~~
He was our best CB at the start of the season and is still young. He frustrates everyone, me included, but I can't see him leaving in the short term future.

859~~~
If LVG decides otherwise from the moment reinforcements arrive, I sure wouldn't be weeping on Jones' fate because the big guy would have dug his own grave himself. I just don't see him becoming a genuine talent if he doesn't develop the most important a footballer needs nowadays: bloody fecking brains! I'm sure many people already mentioned how many times he throws himself into rash challenges instead of looking for another solution in the play; in today's football, it is unacceptable.

860~~~
Slow? Really? He's easily our quickest centre back...

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.abload.de/img/jones8kg9.gif" src="http://www.abload.de/img/jones8kg9.gif"/>

861~~~
Some of his injuries though are self inflicted in the way he plays and they come at really bad times. He needs to play smarter especially now that we are wanting him to be a every game starter. Like the way he injured himself prior to the 2nd leg against Madrid a couple seasons ago. He can't be going down every few games, even if it means missing just a game or two as it hurts and chance of having a settled back line.

862~~~
Is he fit yet?

863~~~
Nope.

864~~~
Philosophy says No

865~~~
Smalling is faster than Jones and he's the fastest CB in the PL. Well at least he's the only United CB that is on record with hitting a top speed that put him among the fastest players in the PL. In 2012 Smalling was joint third fasted player in the league and top 5 in the world.  He even outpaced Ronaldo and Rooney's records for that year.

866~~~
There are lots of issues with Jones but pace isn't one of them.

867~~~
Which one is fitter? That's the pertinent question. 

It would be a shame if neither of Jones, Smalling and Evans can make it here because of their fragile bodies.

868~~~
He's a maniac that needs to settle down. He also has poor positional awareness. 

I actually thought his midfield performances were pretty good. I don't trust him at the back yet.

869~~~
I can't believe anyone thinks Smalling is quicker. Look at the difference in pace between him and Rooney in whatever goal it was against Leicester...you really believe these "records"?

870~~~
You just know that the moment they sign for other teams they will post exemplary fitness records. I'm starting to believe that we are cursed.c.

871~~~
Interesting post. Could be more down to desire? Rooney was really busting a gut there, Smalling was probably lazy.

872~~~
Also a bit deceptive as Rooney's path to the ball & player is considerably less.

873~~~
Agree with this. Smalling has a greater distance to cover and actually starts/finishes running later/earlier than Rooney does.

874~~~
I don't think Nani has even had a niggle at Sporting. fecker couldn't keep fit for more than 3 games in the last few years here.

875~~~
If you look at the angles of the runs there's no basis for comparison. Look where Smalling starts from. Personally I very much doubt if Rooney could keep pace with Smalling in a straight sprint. 

Also any suggestion that either one of Jones or Smalling are anything less the rapid is pretty laughable. I don't get how a United fan could even think that. They're both extremely quick. It reminds me of the "is Welbeck the slowest striker thread" from a few years ago. Madness.

876~~~
I don't think so.  What will hold him back from being a top class CB is his recklessness.  Phil has very good athleticism, can read the game well and has no fear of the ball at his feet, but the man suffers from momentary bouts of madness where all he does is injure himself.  If we can somehow fix his heads gone moments we've suddenly got a very good CB.  And he's still pretty young.

877~~~
You clearly don't understand how top speed works. I can easily pull another video with Smalling running much quicker than that.

878~~~
Well said.

879~~~
One would expects those brain farts to have gone down over the years of working alongside some of the best defenders of their own generation, but this isn't the case so far. When it comes to having a good footballing brain, it's usually either you have it or you don't. The more it goes, the more I'm inclined to put Jones into the second category. Knowing how the game is evolving, top clubs are less and less inclined to have defenders who have consistent brain farts in them.

Jones would have done well in the 1990s or even in the 1980s, but top clubs don't play that kind of football anymore.

880~~~
They actually have and he hasn't really had a consistent run at CB due to being needed everywhere else, his own injuries and competiions. He was very good  and our best player for first few games in a back 3 this season before got injured for England and then returned with a error vs West Brom with a new partner in Rojo before getting injured again.

Infact even last season amidst the shambles at a personal level he improved even though wasn't consistent. Had some good big game performances as well in different positions in a struggling team.

Also, he is only 22 still eligible for U21 euros next year.  Some of the slack he is given as a roving looney and what not is way over the top at times.

881~~~
The angles are misleading in that though i agree that Jones is quicker than Smalling especially in full sprint. He gave good competition to likes of Ronaldo and Bale previously.

Rooney when he gets going is probably quicker than Smalling too though dependson the distance.

882~~~
I don't think his recent hamstring and shin splint problems arose out of reckless challenges. Those were just bad luck injuries.  He may still have a few bonehead mistakes left in him but if he can ever get a run of 10-12 matches at CB I have no doubt whatsoever he'll prove his critics wrong.  But can he e re stay fit for that long?

883~~~
An hamstring injury with England like two months ago, no? What's the deal here?

884~~~
Shin splints was the last reported issue.

885~~~
Is he ever coming back? What's going on?

886~~~
I had shin splints once. Cleared up in about a week. Are Phil Jones shins made of dog biscuits?

887~~~
It can be quite tricky tbf. But often it's over in a few days.

888~~~
Is it possible that he will play for us again in this decade?

889~~~
Where the f is he ?

890~~~
I have to admit, I'm not overly bothered. OK, be good to get him back from a squad depth perspective, but I don't want him in ahead of anyone at the minute.

891~~~
Philosophy says he has to play for the 2nd team first and there isn't another reserve game till Sunday I think, so that's when we may first see him. LVG said he's one that's back training

892~~~
Let's rush him back from the shin splints so he can hurt his lower back or his hip <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

893~~~
Sounds an efficient approach at any rate - he can finish recovering from the shin splints whilst recovering from the inevitable injury picked-up when rushed back too early from shin splints. 2-for-1 recovery time?

894~~~
This is already his 3rd longest spell on the sidelines in his career so far (and there's been a lot of them), for shin splints! A quick read about shin splints suggests 1-3 weeks with a combination of ice, heat and anti-inflammatory. It's been 2 months. 9 games. He just defies logic.

Transfermarkt predicts he's due back on Saturday 20th December.

895~~~
Smalling is injured so Evans came back. Evans will get injured in the next couple of weeks at which point Jones will return. Obviously Jones will injured himself by going into a ridiculous tackle within a couple of weeks of return and hence Smalling will get fit.

The cycle shall continue until everyone realizes that Jones, Smalling and Evans are Infact the same person.

896~~~
This my friend, seems the only plausible explanation

897~~~
the true story. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

898~~~
I am bothered. I want him ahead of everyone bar Smalling. Yes, that includes Rojo (he scares me) and must certainly Evans, McNair and Blackett.

Jones was very good at the start of the season but his mistake at WBA seems to be what people choose to remember now.

899~~~
Over hyped player. Position ally clueless, rash as feck and not really good with the ball. He has so much to learn as a defender. 

I thought he was better in midfield where he can have a simple task to stick to.

900~~~
Now that you mention it, I can't remember when I last saw Jones, Smalling and Evans at the same time.

901~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

902~~~
As it is, philosophy says that two right footers cannot play center back together.

903~~~
I agree that Rojo scares me ... but I think he's better than Jones. I'm not remembering that mistake against WBA to be honest, I just don't think he's a particularly good defender. I think his positional sense is poor, and it's his athleticism that then lets him get back at times to make last ditch challenges, that he needs to make due to being out of position. Because of this, he then gets injured more often, the nature of his challenges. Caused by his lack of positional sense.

Granted, he's whole hearted, I just don't think he's a good enough defender. Personal opinion. I also feel on account of his 100mph approach, people love him, and his abilities were initially massively overblown. I never had that great love for him that many United fans did.

All just my own opinion. I really hope he comes along and proves me wrong though, would be great.

904~~~
He'll probably never be fit enough to play 10 games in a row again.

905~~~
He's done it before? For us?

906~~~
You forget he is even a United player as he is always injured.  I rarely even think about him any more.  If he is playing I just assume he will pick up an injury and then I won't think about him for another 2 months.

907~~~
Yep. Which is absurd. 

Arguably our best player in all our opening fixtures and a hugely talented young CB. Obviously frustrating how often he gets injured (him and almost every other fecking player on our books!) but it's crazy the way people let this cloud their opinion of him as a footballer. He's not the finished article but he's a bloody good defender and we're badly in need of some more of those.

908~~~
I remember Andy Cole was out for 2-3 months with shin splints. My shin splints plagued me for a year. I did everything under the sun, including complete layoff from sports for 3 months. They came right back. They can be tricky and when they are bad it feels like you are being stabbed.

909~~~
Disagree quite a lot. Don't think he's a bloody good defender at all. Rash, terrible positioning. Uses his physical ability to get himself out of trouble ... which then also causes him trouble by helping him get more injuries. 

Don't think it's remotely absurd. I think the fact he's English and runs around a lot makes people overrate him. The Welbeck effect.

910~~~
Yup. We definitely disagree. There's a whole lot of wrong in this post IMO. 

My only caveat would be that he's not the finished article yet. His potential is obvious though and impressive.

911~~~
so any news on when he's likely to be back?

912~~~
Fact: Since retiring, Paul Scholes has played in a United shirt more times than Phil Jones.

Well I made that up, but it's plausible.

913~~~
See it's funny, most clubs' players become world class when injured (see Sturridge, Wilshere, Walcott etc). Ours become utter dogshit.

914~~~
I agree if you mean a CB, but as FB he is really good at defending.

915~~~
Please God you're right in the long run.

916~~~
Intriguing. I actually think he's an even worse fb

917~~~
I love the guy and think he's our best central defender when fit but that's the problem, isn't it?! He's never fit.

He's also one of our defenders this season that actually did step up and take some responsibility after Rio and Vidic left but he got crocked again soon after.

918~~~
Hes and accident waiting to happen tbh, lacks positional disciplne, and always looks like hes going to give away a penalty.

919~~~
I don't agree with that. I mean, sure, he looks rash and wild in the challenge and his style of play is a bit cavemanish, similar to how Rafael used to be, but he was actually a titan at the back for us earlier on in the season. I don't know, it might be a case of me having a tad of selective memory, but there's not a lot to criticise about him this season apart from his injury woes.

920~~~
I actually rate him as a FB (defense, his attacking play is quite bad). The games against Bayern were brilliant.

921~~~
Jones has been good for the most part when he' played this season, although I definitely agree that he lacks positional discipline.

922~~~
I agree about this season, but then he hasn't played many games. I think Smalling is a better CB than him tbh, but he also is always injured *sigh*

923~~~

924~~~
Finally <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

925~~~
Injury or brainless challenge imminent.

926~~~
Right so, who do we reckon will come off injured first?!

Jones or Evans?! 

I'm going with Jones

927~~~
Jones straight in for Rojo who isn't even in the squad.

Has he gotten injured too?

928~~~
Hope he doesn't rush in with his tackling.

929~~~
Maybe him and Smalling can start playing some games together from next week then, just maybe if they don't get crocked up again.

930~~~
He's got errors in him in every game. Fresh off an injury and in his first game back against a side set up to run at him. Let's pray for a miraculous performance!

931~~~
Jones v Liverpool ? This seasons Vidic <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> , they will be pushing his buttons ( at least for the ten minutes he is on the pitch , before injuring himself in a pointless sliding tackle on the advertising boards )

932~~~
He'll prove all you doubters wrong. MOTM performance today!

933~~~
I hope I eat a big slice of humble pie I really do.

934~~~
Our bulldozer.

935~~~
The rash boy, he'll do something stupid.

936~~~
Hes done well tbh

937~~~
Yes he has, for some reason he isnt appreciated here, he doesn't make anywhere near the amount of mistakes as people here make out.

938~~~
Yep.

939~~~
Very good performance from him. If only he and Smalling could just stay fit already.

940~~~
Was being really over cautious in the first 15 minutes never passing the ball forward and you could tell the crowd were picking up on it, give him the benefit of the doubt though after being out so long, made a couple of mistakes but he was decent.

941~~~
For someone who was out for two months, I felt he did really well. Looked a bit rusty in the first half, but really grew into the game. The amount of times he got in front of his man to make the interception was excellent, in my opinion. Just hope he can stay fit.

942~~~
I thought he did well, I'd feel very comfortable with a match fit Smalling and Jones at CB.

943~~~
Started off Rusty first 30 minutes, but after he settled he was very good.

Best performance at RCB or LCB in a back 3 so far this season. Even his distribution when pressed was good which has been a problem for the 2 wide CB's throughout the season and was Today with Evans as well. Plus he got through most defensive work of all our defenders and was aggressive.

944~~~
In my mind there is no question that he could be a very good center back for us. However, like Smalling, unless he can stay fit for prolonged periods then nothing else matters.

945~~~
I thought he looked rusty and struggled with Sterling in the first half. Slightly better in the second.

946~~~
He was ok (considering that he just returned from an injury). Sterling toyed with him at times, but Sterling is really good.

Would prefer Smalling instead of him in our defense though (and Rojo as the second CB).

947~~~
Smalling + Jones could be best partnership.

As rash as Jones can be, Rojo actually comes out worse in that comparison.

948~~~
Always have thought Smalling and Jones have very good potential as a partnership.

Haven't gotten too many games together and fecking cannot stay fit.

949~~~
He got better and better as the game went on. Inevitably rusty but great to have him back.

950~~~
Considering it was his first game for ages Jones put in a very good performance.

951~~~
I wanted to slap him in the first half after he passed it backwards every time time he got the ball, but he seemed to improve over the course of the game.

952~~~
Did really well after taking a yellow for the team to stop the counter attack. Would like to see when hes played in a back three, to sometimes get the ball and come out and run into the space available.

He didnt look fit to begin with and I wasnt sure how long he would last but got better as the game went on.

953~~~
Nice to see him back. Now he needs to stay fit and cut out the erratic challenges otherwise he'll have a very short career in the game.

954~~~
Still a wild man, but looked fast, strong and confident. Passing was a bit erratic but forgivable.

955~~~
Good game. Now stay fit Phil ffs!

956~~~
I thought he was great today. Strong, fast and composed. Only made a few errors but was mostly consistent. Having Carrick beside him seemed to give him confidence. Evans on the other hand looked scared shitless, despite Carrick being near enough him to calm him down.
Naturally he was a little error prone near the start, but improved as the game went on. His second half was fantastic.

958~~~
feck, I thought that was Evans at the time <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

959~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Don't think Evans be able to keep up with Sterling. There was a moment late in the second half when Balotelli got in behind Evans like he wasn't there.

960~~~
Given the run around by Sterling, improved after half time.

961~~~
That was both crazy and beautiful

962~~~

963~~~
Must have been taking the advice of Ryan Giggs.

964~~~
That was a world class bit of defending. His talent is just so obvious. All the potential in the world.

965~~~
...and a body made of glass.

966~~~
Was the better of the two CB's, needs to realize his passing limitations.

967~~~
The way Evans was playing any one of us would've been the better centre back. 

Needs more games to build his confidence, preferably with a more competent partner and Rafael to his right and Carrick / Blind ahead of him.

968~~~
Personally i think our best pairing will be Jones and Smalling. If we can keep them fit we should be fine... Big if that is

969~~~
Fair point which is why I kpet my compliment basic lol. I think Smalling will come back in when his injury clears personally, he had a good run of games bar the City screw up.

Not going to happen as LvG insists on one right footer and one left footer in his CB pairings.

970~~~
Granted but today we had Rooney and Fletcher playing in midfield with Mata behind RvP and Falcao. So anything is possible!

971~~~
Surprised by the lack of activity in this thread, I thought he did pretty well today.

972~~~
Indeed. I actually thought he was our man of the match today. Made a couple or even three very important tackles in dangerous situations.

973~~~
Felt Jones had a solid game yesterday, making some nice blocks and tackles. Certainly doesn't look like someone who's been out for three months.

974~~~
Yeah he was ok today, still the king of the pointless and unnecessary challenge to give a free kick away and allow the opposition to get the ball in our box.

975~~~
He did ok, got out muscled by Benteke at one point in the match. Although I'm probably being harsh on the lad as Benteke is a brick shithouse.

976~~~
Yeah he was decent, and equally importantly avoided injury! Can't understand why anyone would want Rojo ahead of him.

977~~~
that's what I saw too.

he rarely has a poor game.

978~~~
He had a good game defending. However, his passing abilities are very limited

979~~~
Definitely better than the current Rojo. He just needs to stop thinking that he's a midfielder with his passing.

980~~~
It would be better to be back with 4 behind. And I don't really think that he's suited to a 3 ma defence.

To much to think for him. Jones and Evans can be good in a 4 man defence, but in a 3 man, when they have to give forward the first ball, clean, proper and fast, they're struggling. 

Jones ability is much on the physical side, and in a 4 man defence when he needs to cover 2 sides (the other CB and the RWB) he has more protection we saiy and his main ability is down nothing

For example in a 3 man defence, I think that Rojo is better. He can't defend properly but know how to pass the ball, and how to cover from this position.

Maybe I'm wrong, and our defenders will need more time with this horrendous 3-5-2.

Anyway it's better to have Jones with us than injured

981~~~
They're not each others competition, one is right the other is left footed CB so they would probably play together if Rojo would be fit.

982~~~
Not sure that would work. I don't think they'd complement each other well at all. Too similar IMO.

983~~~
Well Jones/Smalling in right CB position and Rojo in left CB is the current ideal CB pairings in my opinion. Carrick needs to be playing in the DM position so Rooney can be freed for the AM(10) role. Playing Rooney as a 6 is just painful to watch.

984~~~
I'm kind of surprised noone has mentioned the most typical Jones moment of all from the other day. Makes a complete balls of a routine piece of defending to gift them the ball in a very dangerous position.... Then gets back to make a block himself.

985~~~
I'm surprised by Jones' performances on the ball, when SAF played him in midfield it was great, and not only defensively, had some nice runs and distributed the ball well. It will probably come back with a decent run, he'll never get.

986~~~
That part was an utter calamity. He just hesitated and waited so long for the bounce that Benteke ended up just thinking, "Ok, if you don't want it I will just nick it". Indecision like that is what costs goals. Between him and Evans I would hate to be behind them in the lunch queue.

987~~~
Really? 

For me at no stage has he displayed significant composure and confidence on the ball with any level of consistency. He simply doesn't have the physical and mental attributes to be a ball playing centre back decent run or not.

988~~~
That's a little harsh don't you think?

989~~~
Not really no. He's clumsy in all respects I feel ie physically he's the opposite of graceful a la a Rio or a Hansen or a Blanc. He's a work horse like Cahill in that he's always ready and willing but there's zero refinement and technical ability. He is all brawn over brain.

990~~~
But thats not always a bad thing.

991~~~
People really do see what they want to with certain players no matter how they play. For the record his passing accuracy this season is 89% he has the highest number of defensive actions in our squad and the highest percentage of duels won with 61%

992~~~
Absolute tosh.

993~~~
He's not really clumsy, he just looks disorganized because he's big, English and makes funny faces when he goes in for a tackle. He's the best we have at recovering and making a tackle through his sheer pace and anticipation, which is kind of really important when you encounter someone like Sterling running at the defense from the #10 role. His ability to change direction at split second pace is also pretty good for a center back. He still needs to play himself into composure but he's really never let anyone down when he's healthy and playing.

994~~~
December last year was probably the best month under Moyes... a lot of wins. 

And Phil Jones was our best player (his displays in midfield vs Shakhtar and Stoke away... perfection). I want him back.

Now we are at the best moment of Van Gaal (in terms of results), and Jones has been pretty much injured big part of the time. I can only think that once Jones is back to his 100% and a permanent in the starting 11, we are gonna be looking so much better.

please stay fit Philip! Namaste

995~~~
That may be how van Gaal sees it, I'd much rather have two good right footed CB's than 1 good right footed cb and an average left footed one. Not saying Rojo is average mind.

996~~~
I agree, we need an established CB pair weather it is Smalling and Jones or Smalling and Rojo or Jones and Rojo. 

Just take thet yoga regularty Phil! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

997~~~
It's funny to think how hyped he was when he was younger, to an extent I think it was incredibly unfair. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/aUNukum.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/aUNukum.jpg"/>

998~~~
Excellent turnout for Philip today, largely aware of whatever little danger Newcastle posed and composed in possession. Has really picked from where he left off in September and was our best central defender by some distance. Still a little rusty but that'll come with regular minutes on the pitch. Gotta love some of those marauding runs through the center too, shame the end-product was lacking today but it seemed reminiscent of a fearless young Jonah driving through the opposition midfield circa 2012.

Hope he stays healthy through the next few weeks and cements a position in the starting XI.

999~~~
Except for his predictable brainless moment which cost us another goal. He still needs a lot of work before he's a top class starting CB for us.

1000~~~
Goal-costing brainfart aside, he played well.

You can nearly always say that about Phil.

1001~~~
Exactly what I came in to say.

1002~~~
Played well. SHame he is a bit retarded. Good defender but his mindfecks are astonishing.

1003~~~
Meaningless penalty aside, he was great today. One of our best players alongside Rooney, Mata and Falcao.

1004~~~
Good game, glad he's getting some more minutes.
Hopefully Smalling returns next match to partner him instead of Evans

1005~~~
Well yes, but let's also bear in mind that this is only his third start after a layoff of about 3-4 months. It takes time to find peak rhythm and mental sharpness. Van Gaal is an expert at minimizing errors through repetitive training and automatism. Jones will only improve, as long as he can stay fit for an extended period.

1006~~~
Better one not so critical match mistake than being injured all the time.

1007~~~
That is LVG in a nutshell really. He's really really repetitive for a manager which benefits people like Jones a lot. It is why I still have faith in Evans being capable of doing a job for us, not necessarily as a first team starter, but still an important job.

1008~~~
Played well. Made one brilliant header with the back of his head in the first half.

Then went and ruined it by giving away such a cheap penalty. Frustrating.

1009~~~
I hope you're right. Despite his brainfarts, constant injuries and even injuring his own teammates there is a very good player in there.

1010~~~
Good game despite his mistake.

1011~~~
Any gifs of the penalty?

1012~~~
Played well, he looked tired at the end which may have resulted in the lazy penalty kick he gave away.

1013~~~
Played well for the most part, but definitely loses some points for the penalty.

1014~~~
Played well but then had a brain fart

1015~~~
Was thinking a moment before the conceding of the penalty that he was up there with Wayne for man of the match. Had a very good game.

1016~~~
Thick as a brick but a decent performance, he really is like a live action Mr. Potato Head running around out there. If we are sticking with the back 3 none of the 3 CB's that played today did enough to keep Smalling out though IMO.

1017~~~
Good game from him save the penalty concession. Loved the couple of juggernaut runs through the middle.

1018~~~
Apart from the penalty he give away, I thought he was very good again, both on and off the ball.

1019~~~
Could have taken his shots off the runs he made. Even if the rebound falls in the box, we have 2 very good strikers in there to pounce on it.

1020~~~
agree. But he has given away a number of penalties unnecessarily.

Needs to be calmer....

1021~~~
3-0 up on Boxing Day. The penalty might be what his performance is remembered for but he can be let off on this occasion.

1022~~~
Wish he would shoot or do something more decisive after running past three or four players. Its like he thinks, he will get in trouble for it, but when 3-0 after taking on three men and getting to the edge of the opposition box, stopping to pass it safely kills any chance of creating a chance.

1023~~~
He's been our best CB in a back 3.

1024~~~
Odiferous emanation of the mental kind aside, Jonesey played very well today.  Of all our central defenders, he above all has taken well to a back 3. 

Very interesting decision by Louis to entrust McNair with the central duty of the back 3.  Has the boy even shaven once in his life?

1025~~~
Kept getting skinned, caught out of position and jumping needlessly into tackles, poor performance. Threw away our well earned clean sheet too.

1026~~~
Such bollocks. Played well apart from the pen.

1027~~~
Agenda driven posters, ignore them.

1028~~~
Shocking post, he played really well today.

1029~~~
First time in ages he's been running directly forward with the ball. He did it a lot in his first season, but hasn't done it so much recently. Maybe a sign that confidence is coming back?

I still have my doubts about his longer term future, but today was decent

1030~~~
Decent game and didn't get injured - Huzzah!

1031~~~
Phil Jones - penalty machine.

Thought he played well today, but he doesn't half have a habit of giving away stupid penalties.

1032~~~
Not quite sure if you were watching the same game.

Penalty brain lapse aside, was clearly the best of our CBs.

1033~~~
Thought he did well and was praising him....and then the penalty. It was typical Jones and frustrating. He's got to cut that out of his game, it was unnecessary. He did show good stuff other than that though so I'd like to see him and Smalling get a run together.

1034~~~
Behave! He did well, penalty aside.

1035~~~
Personally, I thought Evans looked the most composed CB, he lead the defence well and did what was asked of him. Jones was too rash at times and got turned too easily for my liking. Think once Smalling and Rojo are back fit and on form, he'll struggle to retain his place.

1036~~~
Would rather think Evans will find it tougher to retain his place. Jones was superior at his defensive duties, got a lot of crucial headers and interceptions in. Covered for Evans/McNair when they decided to step forward too.

1037~~~
Played well but is never going to be the talent we all hoped he would and might struggle if by some miracle we have all defenders fit simultaneously.

1038~~~
He's 22, at least wait until he's peaked to judge. 


That clearing headed was world class.

1039~~~
What game were u watchin?!

1040~~~
I'm starting to think some of our 'fans' watch the games with their eyes shut.

1041~~~
His third consecutive match, tomorrow will be his fourth? Surely he'll get injured in the train/warming-up/in the match.

1042~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> please don't jinx this bro..

anyway he is taking yoga these days. hope that could help his body from getting to injury prone.

1043~~~
Depends on how he does his Yoga. If he goes all in/out like he does on the pitch and in training he is in trouble.

1044~~~
I'm a season ticket holder of 9 years, so you can shove that 'fans' right up your arse, sonny. Jones was good in the air but poor on the ground against Newcastle, that's my opinion.

1045~~~
Are you watching the games from a restricted view seat?

1046~~~
I'm sure we were told to go long more often than usual but even with that taken into account, Jones' passing was atrocious. More misplaced passes than anyone on the pitch. If we're going to play the 352 I think only one of Jones or Smalling can play and they have to play in the middle. On either side their options are obviously a lot more restricted and they just can't see a pass. Rojo's fine for the left but we need someone new on the right.

1047~~~
The best of the back 3 today for me, looked more composed than his partners and read things pretty well.

1048~~~
He defended well today. Distribution is not something that hugely concerns me, moreso the ability to not position oneself like a retard and to successfully header the ball in the 18 yard box. He managed both today which is a good thing.

1049~~~
He's a limited defender, good in a last ditch slide tackle and in the air but on the floor he's dreadful. Every time he attempted a long punt to the strikers Spurs just mopped it up.

1050~~~
Very frustrating that he kept running into players. It is hardly a surprise that he keeps getting injured.

1051~~~
Evans actually had a slightly lower pass completion rate than Jones today at 65%. Personally I reasoned that they had both been instructed to hit the channels or the strikers when in doubt and not to pass infield to midfield or defence.

I think that Jones supports quite well in that position, better than Evans does on the other side and can use his pace and strength when he is in trouble. Not that  I would like to see this formation as a permanent fixture.

1052~~~
He was pretty good today.

Distribution of the side CB's in a 3 looks weak when pressed.

1053~~~
I thought he looked solid enough. There's definitely a really top player in there to be found but we might not see that imposing player free of mistakes for another couple of seasons. Hopefully he keeps progressing slowly and remains injury free as he could be a really great player if that happens

1054~~~
Phil Jones, still only 22 years old mind you, was more than adequate today.  There's still room for improvement but one would have to acknowledge he's one of the better 22 year defenders around.

1055~~~
Thought he was excellent defensively.

He is obviously being told to hoof it to down the wings at times.

1056~~~
He's been our best defender this season and if he could put the injury problems behind him I think he could become a very good defender.

1057~~~
He was fine today, just hope he can stay fit for the rest of the season now!

1058~~~
It's easy to forget his age, for me he is our best defender at this current time.

1059~~~
All them last ditch challenges because he's always out of pos...wait no, he cleaned up because he was bang in position pretty much all throughout the game. He can be clumsy, but 9 times out of 10, if he wants the ball, he gets the ball. 

Looked a bit nervous with the ball at his feet which is my only real concern.

1060~~~
I agree
In regards to having the ball at his feet it again comes down to formation, it’s a completely different way of playing and will take time for all the players to get used to. Im starting to feel comfortable with Jones in the team.

1061~~~
Good defensively. Been impressed with him this season.

1062~~~
He was more reactive today than he's been the last few matches.  His concentration just wasn't as good today.

1063~~~
Pretty good but uses the ball like a typical burly British defender.

1064~~~
Looked very good. The only problem was that in the second half, when it was obvious that the Spurs front three were pressing our center backs, Carrick had to go back to help them and receive the ball - it didn't happen. As good as Phil Jones is, he is not a ball playing center half. Our supposed ball playing center half (Evans) is actually shit at distribution (or atleast has been this season) and Paddy McNair was nervy throughout the game.

1065~~~
Defended really well today, I thought.

1066~~~
I'm not the biggest fan of Jones since he's joined us.  He doesn't have the positional awareness nor the brain to remain in control enough for me.  Seems to be always rushing into tackles and giving up stupid fouls in dangerous areas, not what I'm looking for in a centre half.  There are so many times when he can just sit back and jockey but gets enticed to fly into a tackle to knick the ball instead.

I'd like to see him back off players more and give up less fouls.  Thought he'd learn that as when he first came in he was flying all over the place and getting injured, but he still seems to do something rash in every match.  Just haven't seen the development in him, from my perspective.

1067~~~
Chris Smalling has.

1068~~~
Maybe he has broken Fellaini's ribs on the dancefloor

1069~~~
I just had me a fresh looksee at the disallowed goal due to Jones being offside.

Jones was not offside, though the linesman can be forgiven for missing it.  Jones was initially in an offside position but was back in an onside position when #25 for Spurs (not sure who that is) got a piece of the ball before Jones headed it.  Falcao never did interfere with the play, though he was in close proximity to it.

Shit happens.

1070~~~
Doesn't matter if a pass gets deflected by a defender when making a decision about offside. Only relevant if the ball is deliberately played by the defender. Which didn't happen here.

1071~~~
He is still young.
Its not an Evans situation with him, he joined us as a teenager and is really only getting to the part of his career when things should start clicking.
If he is still as dozy in a couple of years time then he should be rightly being criticised.

1072~~~
Looking increasingly uncomfortable on the ball - far too many aimless hoofs and just couldn't deal with any kind of pressing in the second half. 

Comfortable in a defensive situation but if we're going to average 60% possession and have large swathes of the ball, he'll let us down.

Carrick faded a bit but largely the 3 at the back were why we lost all control in the second half, none of them showed the quality to keep the ball and work it, defaulting to 2/3 poor passes then a poor hoof.

Always annoys me that they can't even get it near Falcao or RVP but merely a hoist out for a throwin 9 times out of 10.

Not good enough with the ball at his feet for me, hard to say if that will really improve much more.

1073~~~
That's incredibly harsh. Not to mention ignoring the fact he's put in a number of decent performances in central midfield. That just wouldn't happen with a central defender as hapless in possession as you just described.

1074~~~
Different roles - in midfield his role was to harass and break up the play, when he did so he had options around him for simple passes, or more freedom to carry it, which he's good at. Equally, I don't recall being tremendously impressed with his passing in any of those games.

It probably is a bit harsh but it's also evident - we got much, much worse in the 2nd half due to more pressing by their forwards and generally their step up the pitch. Most of our possession was then in our own half and we never built beyond it...

The difference between that and a midfield role is obvious. Less options, more danger and more onus to have the ball and pick passes to other cbs, wbs or midfielders. A deep lying midfielder will operate totally differently on and off the ball than a cb and doesn't have 1,2 or even 3 forwards pressing very intently (in the pl the pressing tends to be done by forwards and then a half court press for the rest, not necessarily carried on by the rest of the team)

Maybe it's just the 3 that makes him more uncertain but again, it was never a strong suit of his, I don't think? Despite midfield appearances.

1075~~~
Well that's definitely what I've put down as the main reason behind Evans going from an extremely accomplished passer to someone who's been all over the place, so makes sense that Jones might be struggling for the same reason. 

Plus we have Smalling getting plaudits for his passing this season, after previously being the worst of the bunch. I don't think it's a coincidence that he's played mainly in a back four, while the other two have played almost exclusively in a back five this season.

1076~~~
Difficult to really understand that, though it does seem to be the case. 3/5 at the back with 2 CMs creates about as many options for a CB as is really possible.

2 cbs either side, wingbacks wide, 2 Cms dropping into the hole or what have you.

I think our CBs pick the wrong pass far too often, even when playing it across the back its behind the player or a more difficult ball to take, that's a gift for pressing teams (every PL team should be pressing us fiercely at the back) because it makes the strikers job easier without him having to do anything.

So many balls that are on that get turned away as too 'dangerous' then delay, delay and attempt to play the pass that now isn't on, hoof it, or play a poor ball to a CB partner shifting the difficult situation to them.

Carrick, Rooney, mata, falcao, rvp and to a lesser extent young and valencia can all handle the ball on tight spaces and are more likely to retain it, or advance our play with something quick or cute than lose it.

Really think many of our issues, including our slow buildup and methodical manner of creating chances stem from the back.

Would you sign CBs in Jan, Pogue?

1077~~~
And if I'm being harsh on him, it's only because I expect so much and desperately want him to be fit for more than 5 minutes at a time.

1078~~~
I just think when you've been playing one formation your entire career most of  the passes you play are almost on instinct. You expect your fullback to be in position A, the deepest midfielder in position B and the other centre-half in position C. Three options and you pick the best available, almost without any conscious thought.

With a re-shuffle there needs to be more thought behind each pass, which can delay things to a point where the eventual pass is hurried and executed poorly. Having more options is working against them, paradoxically.

Just a theory, mind you. There has to be some explanation for a calm and competent passer like Evans looking so hassled and slap-dash with his passing this season so it's the one I'm going with.

Re your last question, I would have signed another CB in the summer. Mind you that would have been instead of Rojo. I wanted a bullet-proof old school stopper in our squad. Someone who could start 30+ games and inspire and organise everyone around him. Not sure Rojo's that player, so I'm not entirely sure why we signed him. I'm not quite ready to give up on Smalling, Jones or Evans and McNair looks a prospect so signing one more CB would make our squad look a bit bloated. Especially if we're keen on Strootman, which allows Carrick to rest his legs with an occasional game in defence.

1079~~~
People need to realise that he's not going to be anywhere close to the finished article for another 2-3 years. He has time on his side to improve all areas of his game.

1080~~~
Indeed, I think people tend to forget his age as he's been around for some time now, he has the ability to become a fantastic player, he has it all IMO and in time may well be the first choice CB for years to come (as long as the injuries stay away)

1081~~~
Every time someone gets injured in training, I imagine it's after a Jones tackle.

1082~~~
Not convinced by Jones at all. Not even sure he has improved since joining United. Perhaps unfortunate to have been used in a variety of roles but doesn't look a potential top central defender to me at this stage. I don't see what he is particularly good at. No better than acceptable in the air, questionable positional play, distribution ordinary, a few good tackles and interceptions. Reasonable 3rd choice perhaps.

It wouldn't bother me in the slightest if we sold him in the summer and promoted M.Keane or McNair to 2nd choice right-sided centre back. Having said that, if his financial demands are reasonable, I'd be willing to give him a few more seasons, in case he improves.

1083~~~
...and one of the training teams gets a penalty.

As long as he's not injured, I'm happy.

1084~~~
His face probably scares more opponents than his tackles. It's at the point now where I get nervous when I see Jones charging after an opponent anywhere near our 18-yard box. He's got a knack of losing concentration at the vital moment. He was one of the players I thought Van Gaal might sell before this season started.

1085~~~
Nice of him to leave shawcross when he reached 6 yard line.

1086~~~
Sick and tired of people rating Jones because of his physicality or getting forward. He is a defender simple as that and he is simply not good enough at the bare basic job he is being paid to do. Ball watching inside our own box what bollocks.

1087~~~
he lost Shawcoss, Smalling lost Crouch too

1088~~~
Yep. Terrible defending. All 3 of our centre backs are showing why there will be reinforcements, most likely in the summer. Would not be remotely bothered to see any of them sold.

1089~~~
Other than the mistake he has been decent. Not sure where his ability to bomb forwards has gone, but when we had him in our first season he was a terrific right back who could carry the ball into the last third.

1090~~~
"Other than being directly responsible, once again, for a goal, he was decent." I never really understand these kind of comments come from. Basic defending, and he can't do it. Again he was giving away needless fouls near the box too. 
Totally overrated player.

1091~~~
He's a good defender but he's dumb, some of the fouls he makes are just beyond me. he acts on impulse only.

1092~~~
He had a good game under difficult conditions. Him and smalling were our best players today

1093~~~
Unbelievably stupid.

1094~~~
He's fine. The only problems on his game are:

- being unable to read the game
- hoof the ball under pressure
- never away from making mistakes that cost goals
- making fouls in dangerous position
- at times looking brainless and
- always eager to injure himself or his teammates.

Don't count these little flaws, and he's great.

1095~~~
But Jones is the best player to play for us since Duncan Edwards!

1096~~~
Good defender but a bit dumb. Which is expected from a 22 y.o. CB.

1097~~~
He's very thick, it's painful. You just know he'll keep giving away silly freekicks and corners kicks, and then he does just that over and over and over again.

1098~~~
Agree bar the last sentence, don't think he's that highly rated to be fair. It's always 'bar that one mistake'. Good bar that retarded foul against Newcastle, today good bar losing his man on the corner, etc.

1099~~~
He's the Biff Tannen of CB's.

1100~~~
He barges into players, they know it and they let him do it.

1101~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Right on.

1102~~~
He is unbelievably thick, and I'm not sure we can do very much with a player like that. Has a tendency to put in quite a lot of last-ditch tackles/clearances, mainly because he is positionally absolutely awful.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1103~~~
That's no way to talk about our future best player ever.

1104~~~
Rio was 24 when he joined us and came with a reputation for poor concentration. I think that Jones is a top class defender and the flaws in his game, namely rashness and concentration are two that can improve with maturity and experience. I still think that he can kick on, unlike Evans, he isn't afraid to take responsibility.

1105~~~
Exactly.

1106~~~
Never been convinced by him at all. I think there's a good defender in there somewhere but I have serious doubts about him.

1107~~~
Not heard anyone call him a future England captain for a while.

1108~~~
He makes so many stupid fouls and just never learns. Good player, but don't think he will ever reach the level needed for him to be a starter for us.

1109~~~
True enough. He hasn't kicked on as expected but he is still 22, it is not a good idea to discard him now I don't think.

1110~~~
My over-riding feeling when watching Phil Jones play football is that he doesn't think a few steps ahead.  Maybe I am trying to be too polite but he doesn't seem like the brightest bear in the park.

1111~~~
I suppose we just have to hope he has the common sense to angrily shout a racial epithet at someone of another race in an attempt to discover if they were accusing him of having used that racial epithet in the first place. 

That should give him the armband for a year or two at least.

1112~~~
Considering that a bunch of idiots at the FA were fine with John Terry as captain. I would not be surprised if others will continue thinking the same thing.

How long we can tolerate someone who doesn't learn, I dunno. I hope he's given enough rope by now and is near hanging himself with it as the saying says.

1113~~~
FFS he's 22 and he’s playing for one of the biggest teams in the World, according to posters he tends to go from shit to brilliant on here every few weeks . His and others mistakes are highlighted to such a level that people now wait for them to happen so they can come on here and post about it with a tint of ‘I told you so’ The same can be said for Evans, Smalling, McNair, Rojo and Blackett, it’s getting tedious now.
Very few on here seem to take aboard anything other than the one performance when talking about a player, injuries, lack of game time, formation, understanding of partners, weather, brilliance from the opposition or any other factors don’t come into it, when they should be the main talking point.

I’ve said it before but the amount of abuse our defence is getting is ridiculous, all this despite the conditions they have had to play under.

1114~~~
You can say that about Rafael and Smalling.

I'm referring about giving stupid fouls away. Jones isn't only one guilty of doing it.

1115~~~
Yes, but we don't have many options do we ??

1116~~~
I have time for both Jones and Smalling as i think they will only improve. Injuries have really affected them and they need time. 

Evans on the other hand....

1117~~~
What are the conditions though? Only thing that can be helping their case is that we're playing that 352 shit, other than that, come on. They've got one of the very best keepers behind them, if we didn't have David in goal their shitness would've been so painfully exposed they'd end up taking antidepressants. They've got Carrick in front of them who seems to be doing a lot of job for them, they're playing in a possession-based system, usually it's the teams that lock themselves for us and not the other way around so they aren't tested as much as they could be. Quite often it's our strikers that can bail them out after conceding an idiotic goal too. Not to mention that once Carrick joins their circus at the back he's the best player there because his anticipation, game reading and ball playing skills are head and shoulders above theirs.

They're just piss poor. You can't really fault anybody when it comes down to injuries, or if anybody, then it's themselves unless it's Fergie, Moyes and now LVG who tire them to death during trainings so they are injured so often.

1118~~~
He hasn't had a really good performance in a while. A few decent games where he wasn't troubled much but he was so much better in his first 2 years here. Looks pretty weak at times for us these days, not as quick as before, and a lot worse aerially. Still only 22 though, plenty of time to come good.

1119~~~
One bonehead mistake, which cost us dearly, but otherwise was ok today. Not great, as it seemed everyone had the blue flu today, but apart from his moment of dubious usefulness he wasn't as dreadful of Evans.

1120~~~
The fact they have barely played a handful off, if any of games together, especially in a new formation which none seems to be comfortable with, then you have the fact they have all suffered from injuries this season which has hindered their performances, or that we have had to introduce not one but two young and inexperienced players to the back line.

To say the attackers have got them out of a hole is laughable, they have been as poor if not worse than our defence and if it wasn’t for our defensive players being under so much scrutiny I’m sure this would be highlighted so much more.

1121~~~
Thing is though that it's not like Evans, Jones and Smalling are strangers to each other, they're playing together for what, 3 seasons now? As said, the only factor helping them is the 352 bullshit. Other than that, you've had those three players who are at our club for a long time looking like clowns again. 

And yea, our attackers have been poor, absolutely agree but they still managed to bail them out, just like today, we don't score and it's a 0-1 loss after clown defending, there have been numerous matches like that.

1122~~~
Phil really needs to sort out his positioning. Quite a few times he was caught out, and had to make a last ditch tackle as a result. Its great that he puts his body on the line to stop the shots or make a tackle no matter what. But half the time it is his own lack of awareness and positioning that has allowed the chance in the first place.

1123~~~
I get what you’re saying and in an ideal World that would be the case, but it’s far from it and players need time to regain match fitness and an understanding of who they are playing with, especially in a new formation. In truth, not one of Smalling, Jones or Evans have had a chance to build a solid relationship with one another, and we all know the reasons why, Injuries.

Our defence is under such pressure from outside sources at the moment and I simply find it baffling that fans who watch and follow the Club can’t look outside the box when discussing performances, especially with the injury record we have had.

As for the forwards bailing us out I could give you examples of the defence doing the same, De Gea and Young against stoke at home, McNair against West Ham, Evans against QPR, most of the defence against Everton. Defence, midfield and attack are all failing us at the moment, however, it seems like the midfield and attack are getting away with it.

1124~~~
Because he didn't play a lot as a CB. Even under Moyes, last season he had brilliant games as DFM and FB.

1125~~~
I can't speak for others, but for me, in the context of Jones, I've never thought much of him. I think he's positionally daft, he is rash, and he's going to constantly cost us goals. I don't think the formation has anything to do with it, I think he'll do it in any formation. 

I hope I'm wrong, long term, but I just don't see it. It's nothing to do with wanting to come in and "I told you so". I like to come in here and discuss things, and when I see such brainless defending, I'll come in and discuss it. 

The amount of abuse our defence is getting is in line with the amount of mistakes they're making. The amount of mistakes they're making is absolutely ridiculous, therefore the amount of abuse they'll get is going to be up there with it.

1126~~~
His positioning wasn't the best at times today but he was a damn sight better than the other two at the back.

1127~~~
Strange nobody has commented on him today. I don't think he looked great (I think it was Elia he skipped around him far too easily on one play.) He's still young, but I do kind of wonder what it is we paid for with him (at least why we paid so much.)

1128~~~
Watching him reminds me of this 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.qwop.co/wp-content/thumbs/custom/Q/qwop2.jpg" src="http://www.qwop.co/wp-content/thumbs/custom/Q/qwop2.jpg"/>

1129~~~
He was awful - beaten all over so easily because he constantly jumps in too close and early, and his passing was a sight to behold - Shin high blasts regularly. That said he's still been better than Blackett and Evans!

1130~~~
He is not a footballer.

1131~~~
I used to be a believer in Jones, but now I just see him as nothing more than a decent prospect as a squad man.

1132~~~
I thought he was decent in the first half but dropped away. Got beaten a few times and his passing was probably the worst of the defenders, he gave the ball away on a few occasions.

1133~~~
Hes bizarre. Hes like a lesser John O Shea but more mobile.
When playing in a three at the back, he really needs to drive forward more and be the extra man.

1134~~~
He wasn't great today, i reckon mostly because he just doesn't look comfortable in a back 3 (along with everyone else). I really hoped he would have kicked on by now and started to live up to the hype of future United/England captain and the new Duncan Edwards that was swirling around when we signed him.

He's still young so he's got time but i think his biggest obstacle to becoming a top player is that he seems to be brainless in almost everything he does in a game. Just doesn't strike me as an intelligent footballer.

1135~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Apparently he thinks we can catch Chelsea hahaha

1136~~~
Just read this:

<b>United have won 20% of PL games this season with Jones starting, compared with 72.7% without him in the starting XI.</b>

I have no idea if it means anything, but thought it's interesting.

1137~~~
I think we've won all but two of the games McNair has played in, and we've won all but one of the games Young has played. Doesn't mean much, or maybe it does.

1138~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Young has started six games we haven't won. The opening three games plus Villa, Spurs and Stoke.

1139~~~
Have been disappointed with Jones' decision making this season. Something I thought might improve under van Gaal but in my opinion has gotten worse.

Still willing to give him time, he is still very young (something many forget) but I just don't see that career that many thought he would have happening at the moment.

1140~~~
Give me a German Shepard any day over him

1141~~~
Said it here two years ago, he's a stronger version of Scott Parker

His lack of intelligence is a problem.....Same old mistakes, same old problems

For all his faults, Smalling is a more composed defender then he is

1142~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1143~~~
True though <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

They're both brave and strong

1144~~~
German Shepherds are pretty smart though. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1145~~~
Stats are pointless. Whether people like it or not, Jones was our best centre back earlier on in the season, and rightfully got player of the month. Apart from his eagerness to win the ball back, and sometimes concede a fouls, he's been fine. The lads 22, and has never had a consistent season at centre back, with a settled partner, for crying out loud. Name me any other centre back at 22 that's played RB, CDM and CM for the last three years, yet gives you great performances week in week out at centre back for their club?

Jones is a good defender. He likes to defend. Yes, he's still prone to mistakes, but what young CB isn't? Ramos and Luiz do it weekly and they get into World XI.

I just think that, providing he stays fit, he needs to have a full season as a centre back; preferably in a back four. He's shown time and time again how good he can be when he's on it, and will gain a vast amount of experience and learn from his mistakes if played there constantly.

1146~~~
Excellent post. We seem to be overly critical of Jones and Smalling, hopefully they'll stay fit now and actually form a partnership, something that is HUGELY important when it comes to defenders. If we were to put Jones up for sale I reckon they'll be plenty of big clubs interested.

1147~~~
Exactly this. I've been so frustrated that they haven't been able to stay fit, especially as this was the season for them to step up and show the fans they can replace Vidic and Ferdinand. I don't doubt their ability, but if they can't say fit then unfortunately they won't have a future at the club.

1148~~~
He's only 22, if he was still at Blackburn he would cost us Mangala money. Nees more time.

1149~~~
Our new corner kick taker.

Plot officially lost

1150~~~
Plays with delusions of grandeur, needs to keep it simple and he'd be less of a liability.

1151~~~
Give the ball away a few times (although his passing accuracy 71.2% was better than Rojo's 69.6%), but also made some good driving runs with the ball. Defensively, I felt he was good. Don't think he gave away any fouls and in general looked pretty solid.

1152~~~
Good defensively. Not sure what LVG is thinking putting him on corner duties.

1153~~~
Defensively he has been good every time he has played this season IMO

1154~~~
Still makes some mistakes but definitely looks to be improving as a centre back this season imo.

1155~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/AhsktdQ.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/AhsktdQ.jpg"/> 

The hack of him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1156~~~
I'd be quite happy to see him sold this summer. Take his physicality away, and he's just not a very good footballer.

1157~~~
I'm so sick of this player. I wouldn't mind if people acknowledged his limited ability but to hear this idiot get labelled a future star is just mind-boggling.

Absolutely shite tonight and really making the backline look vulnerable as hell.

Needs sold and we can do much much better.

1158~~~
I agree, he looks very nervous all the time. Always having to make last ditch tackles from his own mistakes too.

1159~~~
He can't handle simple passes ... and we have him taking corners. Utterly bizarre.

1160~~~
OMFG what a waste of skin.

1161~~~
"The next Duncan Edwards" he exclaimed with not a hint of irony. 

"Time to go into a home"we all said.

The signs were there.

Paul Pogba nodded in the background.

1162~~~
He's just horrible, game after game.

1163~~~
Having an absolute shocker. One of the worst individual performances from a United player in recent memory, given the opposition.

1164~~~
never seen such a dumb footballer in united shirt, I always rated him as a player but as a person he looks really dumb barely passes over 90IQ.. SAF also overated him a lot by saying he is going to be the best united player ever. Never with this "intelligence"

1165~~~
He's simply not very good.

1166~~~
"Duncan Edwards...."

1167~~~
Good defender but awful awful footballer.

1168~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This guy.

1169~~~
His worth is as a utility player. Always has been. 
Nothing new at all.

1170~~~
He could do with a bit of practice on passing the ball forwards I guess.

1171~~~
I'd sell him tbh.

Don't think he's even that good a defender. Utterly useless when it comes to a possession game too.

1172~~~
Would do a job as a rugby player. No way in hell is he a football player though.

1173~~~
Would fit right in at Cambridge judging by that performance.

1174~~~
I love it when he pretends to make a ferocious run just to make full stop and engage his usual derp mode.

His passing was brilliant today. What a player.

1175~~~
Struggling to think of a worse performance on the ball by a defender. Smalling I rate and Rojo was impressive, but him and Evans have been woeful.

1176~~~
Did he pass to the opposition every time he had the ball, or was it just every other time?

Hilariously bad performance. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1177~~~
I really don't like this dude

1178~~~
Can we send him and Evans a combo to some club? 10m for both.

1179~~~
He's just gormless and hasn't developed since we bought him. The comparisons with the likes of Terry are laughable.

1180~~~
Which isn't good enough for Manchester United

1181~~~
An awful display tonight. Made McNair's look decent.

If anyone gives him more than a 2/10 please explain why. He hit a good corner. That was it. Nothing else was positive.

Probably to be dropped next time out. Sold? Not yet. Too knee-jerk. Give him till the end of the season.

1182~~~
He was our best player today...

Do people seriously think us not scoring is down to our central defenders rather than our midfield and forwards?

1183~~~
That was the sort of performance that might seal his fate with LVG. His use of the ball was quite something.

1184~~~
That was hilariously bad performance today. In possession games like this his best position is on the bench.

1185~~~
Maybe a United team managed under Fergie but this United team now, he's not good enough.

1186~~~
I'm presuming this was some kind of joke.

1187~~~
He has not got any better. If anything he has regressed.

1188~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> is the only way to respond to that performance on the ball.

1189~~~
He looks a mindless boy in a mans body just sprinting head first into any ill advised situation imaginable.  Far more likely to injury himself or get a red card than actually help the squad.

1190~~~
Smalling gets stick for his ability on the ball but in terms of passing to a team mate he's fairly reliable compared to our other centre backs. Evans and Jones just love a square pass right to the opposition, leaving us completely exposed.

1191~~~
Very bad performance why he's taking corners as well a complete joke

1192~~~
He was so fecking good under SAF, in every area. Better passer, tackler, defender. What the feck is wrong with him?

1193~~~
Yeah, shit when a defender makes loads of blocks and tackles and covers in behind his defensive partner when he loses his man. Silly me. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1194~~~
Priceless. Utterly priceless. We were definitely watching different games. I guess I want more from a "top class" defender. Someone who can pass to teammates. I guess I ask for too much.

1195~~~
I swear if he had wass lug holes the ball could travel straight out the other side when he tried to head it. He really needs to just keep it simple on the ball.

1196~~~
He was good for a few games as a destroyer in midfield. And that was it.

Arguably, he was the most overrated player in this forum. Which says something considering that we had Cleverley and Welbeck back then.

1197~~~
Like a lot of the Sir Alex squad, he needs more spoon feeding than we imagined.
Shows how great Sir Alex's squad building was. Not a great bunch of footballers overall, but the right mentalities and blend of skill-sets.

Remove Sir Alex and the flaws are revealed.

1198~~~
He's obviously struggling with the <i>Phil</i>osophy … which is ironic really

1199~~~
Rojo kept passing the ball to him to take forward so who's the idiot there?

1200~~~
So, Rojo manages to find a teammate? True, maybe Rojo should say to himself "You know what, this useless lump beside me keeps giving the ball away, I should stop passing to him" but he obviously thought, "Hey, he's a professional footballer, playing for Manchester United. I'm sure he'll put it together eventually". Hopefully, Rojo will learn from this and simply stop passing to him. Why bother wasting the energy?

1201~~~
I want to watch training  actually just to see what happens to make us think Jones on corner duty is a good idea.

1202~~~
Bullshit. Absolute horseshit

1203~~~
I actually think he is really improving as a DEFENDER. But why did LVG give him a job he can't do. Our defenders should give the ball to midfielders and if there is space to forwards, but they should not the whole game lead the attacks, while no one is getting into position where they can pass and so leave them without much choice but to hoof the ball.

I know he was horrible today with his passing, but he shouldn't be doing it at all.... It's like putting Fellaini on the wing and di Maria in the middle, so that Fellaini can cross to di Maria, I mean, WTF.

1204~~~
As time goes on, it becomes more and more obvious that he's just your standard British centre back who relies on his physical attributes, rather then any real footballing ability or tactical nous. See Shawcoss, Upson, Caulker etc etc.

1205~~~
OK. I must have imagined Rojo hitting loads of shit long balls in the first half and then largely passing it to Jones in the 2nd. In fairness he also had a really good run forward and then passed it to their keeper.

Just to be clear, I'm not getting at Rojo either. He was decent today, but Jones was better. It's nether of their fault that the midfielders and forwards in front of them can't make any space for themselves or pass to each other in the opposition half.

1206~~~
Christ his passing was God-awful tonight. Absolutely Shocking. His defending was decent enough though. He seriously needs to go back to focusing on becoming a defensive midfielder as he is too shaky to be a central defender. His chances of making it at Man Utd look slimer with every game that goes by

1207~~~
For a professional footballer his touch and passing is just not good enough even for a league 1 club....I can see him being shipped out with Evans this summer.

1208~~~
You also must have missed Jones' atrocious 5 yard attempted pass which I think was aimed at Rojo (shows how bad it was that I can't even be sure this is who he was passing to) giving the Cambridge forward a chance to go past Rojo. Luckily, his touch was so bad that it came back to the ... scrambling Jones. Or how about when we had a chance to attack in the 2nd half, Fellaini out wide, in a decent position to whip in a cross, and he managed to pass it out of play from 10 yards away, under no pressure? Or also in the 2nd half, when he gave the ball away, again, under absolutely no pressure in the middle of the field, allowing Cambridge to break?

1209~~~
You've seriously been imagining some things. Have you checked your temperature? Honestly though I think you must have missed the numerous times he gave the ball directly away to an opposition striker. It happened at least 3 times I think.

1210~~~
It happened three times. Rojo did it once. Jones actually finished with a higher pass completion because Rojo was poorer with his long passing. I thought that Jones was better in the second half a did quite well at bringing the ball out but those slack passes are unacceptable. I think that both him and Smalling are old school British defenders trying to adapt to a game that has left them behind a little. It isn't their fault as such, it is how they will have been coached as youngsters.

1211~~~
As poor a match as he's ever had for us. Except now he has a new wrinkle of shitness with the corner duty.

1212~~~
I've always thought there was something about Jones, that he would go on to be top player, and I have said as much many times, but in one fell swoop he has just knocked all of that out of me tonight, he was just awful.

And people wonder what the problem is when in reality our best current CB is probably Smalling, a guy who wouldn't get a kick at any other top club.

1213~~~
Yeah the rest of his defending was actually good standard, but with the ball at his feet he genuinely had me laughing. If he is ever going to make it as a key senior defender here then that side of his game simply has to improve. Unfortunately from the years he's been here so far and the lack of improvement on the technical side I won't be holding out much hope.

1214~~~
Apart from being completely beaten for the best chance of the game, from the corner? In fairness, other than that, his actual defending wasn't terrible. But once again, giving up the best chance to the opposition .. not good enough.

1215~~~
Didn't watch the game but as per stats his long ball accuracy seems better than Rojo too.

Jones isn't a great passer but he can carry the ball from the back. After that needs someone available to pass too.

1216~~~
You need to watch the game.  He was shite.

1217~~~
This might be the moment we look back on in years to come. The game where he was exposed as being a awful player. He just looked like a player who shouldn't be playing for Manchester United.

Seriously, we've got to up our standards here. For the people who will defend him, we arent West Ham or Sunderland. That should not be happening to a Man United centre half. Have standards at this club fallen so far that we have to defend that?

What saddens me is, I am Phil Jones more or less. When I was younger I was a centre half, who was good at getting stuck in and dog shite at everything else. I even pulled funny faces (but mostly because I was out of shape and in agony). Phil and me should be sitting side by side in Royal Mail call centre on Monday.

1218~~~
His passing is awful. And you want him to be a DM? Ok.

1219~~~
He made three suicidal passes. Add that to his recent reputation on here and that is where the hysteria comes from. Apart from those passes he was solid. He has to cut out those poor moments, however, it can't happen at a top club.

Rojo displayed some awful passing as well, including one suicide ball that led to a dangerous attack, he also gave away a couple of brainless fouls. But he made a really nice and really aggressive tackle in the first half that seems to have coloured most peoples view on his performance to an unbelievably rosey one.

1220~~~
He's just a dumb footballer. That tackle where he went flying sums his type of defending up. It's still crazy how you'll get fans United and non-United fans thinking this guy will be something, but then call Smalling shit.

1221~~~
They still do this, to be fair. It's ridiculous.

1222~~~
I remember when Fergie said he could be the best player in teh history of the club... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Diabolical performance tonight. One of the worst I saw from any of our payers this season and that says a lot.

1223~~~
"Edwards?!" exclaimed Rooney, aghast. 

He raised an eyebrow and motioned a response but just then his phone rang. It was his best friend, David Moyes.

1224~~~
In my opinion Jones is being told how to play, instructed to move forward with the ball, to be that ball playing centre back who takes control of the defence and instigate attacks. Maybe he's even being put under pressure to create chances as were being marked out of the game in other positions. If Jones fails to impress then LVG buys a new CB in the summer.

Im not too worried by his performances to be honest, the guy is too young to write off as hopeless. 

He has a very long career ahead of him and i hope (HOPE) his career doesn't stagnate the way Smallings and Evans has but he has the potential to be a massive presence in the box, John Terry like, and i think at his peak he will be a world class centre back. But not for a few years. He's still learning the game and settling as a first team centre back. Needs a settled team infront of him too.

1225~~~
For all the grief he gets, John Terry has far more to his game then just being physically strong. Ala Jones.

Jones has the tactical nous of a moose.

1226~~~
With the consensus after that, at risk of being shown the door with Evans if he doesn't get over his injuries and play better. 23 soon and he's in his fourth season now, not good enough.

1227~~~
Fergie has made some shocking signings in his final years.

1228~~~
If Jones wasn't asked to be a box to box centre back, I think he'd be fine. Yes, he give the ball away a few times (wasn't the only one), but we're asking him to get into positions you'd very rarely see centre back in. As I defender, in my opinion, he's very good, and would be a lot better tonight if he was asked to just give the ball to our midfielders, instead of being asked to do otherwise.

I think under Van Gaal, our defenders ball playing abilities are over analysed. Under SAF, they were asked to get the ball and give it to our more reliable players on the ball, whilst they did what they were asked to do - defend, which is why we saw better performances from them.

In yesterday's game, our midfielders for some reason (obviously tactical) were asked to play high up, which meant our defenders often had to run out with it. This is not to cover for Jones, he did give the ball away carelessly, but he's not the only one in our back four that lost it.

EDIT:

Yesterday, Jones made the highest amount of passes out of our back four <b>(80)</b> and had the second best pass accuracy percentage <b>(86.3%)</b> behind Valencia who made 30 passes less.

I guess Jones's misplaced passes stood out more because they were in more dangerous positions or led to Cambridge attacks.

1229~~~
Don't agree with this at all. Jones at Blackburn was one of the brightest centre backs in English football. Had he been played at centre back, and only centre back since joining United, I personally think we'd have a much better centre back on our hands now. As it is, Jones has constantly been asked to play at of position (and done a good job too), which has no doubt disrupted his progression as a centre back.

1230~~~
18 million for this sack of shit and some of you still defend him?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Yeah forget Bruce, Pally, Stam, Johnson, Berg, Brown, Rio, Vida, even bloody O Shea.....Jones is the future <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

And I love how people say, "Oh he's a future England CB"......Really?! Remind me how well England do in these tournament again?! It's usually the defence that's their problem 

Jones is a lost cause.....He ain't gonna make it here

1231~~~
He plays like a caveman. All brawn, no brains.

1232~~~
Duncan Edwards he is though.....<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1233~~~
Usually defense is the least of England's problems.

1234~~~
Funny that as it's usually the worst of their problems.

1235~~~
There is a vast difference in what it takes to be a good centerback at a club like Big Sam's Blackburn and Manchester United.  Jones has little trouble when defending from deeper positions with last ditch interceptions and tackles.  He has a tougher time when being asked to quickly recycle possession and defend from a much higher position on the pitch.

1236~~~
The defense only completely come apart in 2010 and they weren't great in 2004. But, in 2002 Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand were two of the best players of the tournament. In 2006 the defense held a strong Portugal side before losing on penalties and did the same to Italy in 2012.

1237~~~
I think this is the root cause of a lot of our current problems. Too many promising players that haven't panned out, or have been given too much rope, all happening around the same time.

1238~~~
Jones was a rotting maggot tonight, but he wasn't alone in failing to deliver a credible performance.

1239~~~
Regardless, I'd rather a German Shepard over this cnut right now.

Rubbish!!

1240~~~
If we had not signed him, we could have had Varane. Now that annoys me.

1241~~~
Put it like that and all I can do is <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1242~~~
Can Varane play in midfield or at RB because that is where he would have played if he joined when Vidic and Ferdinand were still here.

1243~~~
Or the bench, till we sold him to Madrid <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

We're such a mess right now ha

1244~~~
He's always trying to play at 100% of his speed, always in a rush. I think thats another reason why Smalling has struggled with his passing in the past (he's doing better now) because he's trying to run at full speed into space and that makes it harder to be accurate. Jones right now is the opposite of a composed CB

1245~~~
Phil Jones is one of the players that highlights the problems that bothe Moyes and LVG face. Over rated and limited. Bought for big money, England international but never really been consistently good.
Looks a flapper, looks like he is always trying too hard to impress and that makes him look uncomfortable.
His passing is shockingly bad and, whilst his defending is ok, there is nothing else about him as a footballer that makes him any better than a very an average defender.
I very much doubt both managers would play him if there was better available but there isn't.
Add to this list Evans, Smalling, Fellaini, Valencia who are all very average at their roles and we can see the problem.

1246~~~
Genuine question, was Duncan Edwards this shit? I mean, this guy plays like he doesn't have a brain cell, Christ!

1247~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> brilliant

If we had better options, the guy would be shoved out the door.....It was reported in September, in the papers, fanzines etc that LVG doesn't rate him very much.

He's awful

1248~~~
The other problem is we spent massive £££ on some of these players so its harder to let them go knowing we make a massive loss on them, Zaha and Powell are other examples. Anderson too.

The only other point id make is it's chelsea's policy to only judge a player once he reaches 23 so he has a month left til his time is up <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1249~~~
You're not Falcao....

1250~~~
He was still being heavily defended here by some up until this latest debacle. Anyone left now?

1251~~~
I've heard him called "future captain" many times too, here and on twitter, seriously people?

1252~~~
He was horrible yesterday. But some of the reaction in this thread is way OTT. Reading past few pages makes Jones sound like he's some kind of pub footballer. People forget he was our best defender since the start of the season until he got injured. I still think if he can stay clear of injuries he can cement himself as a first choice CB at United.

1253~~~
Damning with faint praise there.

Not good enough, never was, and the only thing OTT about opinions of Jones is that he was <i>ever</i> spoken of in terms of Dundan Edwards style potential greatness. If he survives until next year it will only be because we sell 2 of our other really very shit centre backs. Dead man walking.

1254~~~
He's an utter clown, who shouldn't be here.
Rio was dodgy for his first season or two here but, he still showed the class that made him into a great defender.
Jones?!.....Said it years ago on here and I'll say it again, he's our version of Scott Parker.

Apart from Froggie, I've never heard anyone compare him to Duncan Edwards.....Granted, it means shag all to me since I never seen Edwards but, I've never heard anyone else say it.....Unless Edwards took a shit corner

1255~~~
Even in his first season goodness, there was that general thickness about him, positionally unaware, prone to giving away silly freekicks in dangerous areas, prone to lunging in [and getting injured in the process]. His problem is not a lack of effort or ability, it's lack of a brain. In simple terms, he's a bit thick.

1256~~~
Can somebody make him smoke a spliff before a game or something, as he always seems like he's just popped an ecstacy pill. Like others have stated he is on full throttle all the time, I wish he could take some of Blacketts relaxed/composed nature, as his natural defending is very good. He does play like he is nervous all game which is a worry really.

1257~~~
Duncan Edwards style potential comment is as OTT as the comments that are made in this thread. Both just at the opposite end of spectrum. I don't know why its given much importance as Fergie had habit of coming out with some weird shit at times like 'Young is a replacement of Giggs' and 'Rvp getting killed'

1258~~~
I still find it unfair that hes still 22, and has had NOBODY to guide him through games past 2 seasons. Vidic was terrible last season, had a long injury another time. He's expected to have the head of a 28 year old martialling the defence for the biggest club in the world whilst being forced to play in a system and style of play hes probably never played in. And people are writing him off. 

Id wait at least this season and next before id start to judge him properly. We'll buy hummels in summer, then one season next to him to get used to the partnership and click. Then if he doesnt improve, ill accept his fate then.

1259~~~
General thickness ? He was 18 when we signed him. Positional awareness and maturity comes with experience and playing games. So to expect such a young player to be positionally perfect and mentally mature is asking way too much or having too much expectation. 
I don't disagree with a fact that he hasn't developed as much as most of us expected to because of injuries or being played out of positions but that doesn't make him an awful footballer as its being pointed out in this thread.

1260~~~
I agree with you there, and just want to add - or not being good enough maybe?

1261~~~
Composure, confidence and ability are inextricably linked. If you are lacking in ability I would suggest it's hard to have confidence in your game and as a result you play with a lack of composure. Jones is not blessed with abundant ability and it appears to me he overcompensates for that. If he has a way forward I would suggest its by keeping things simple and simply getting the basics right. There is clearly no point in trying to turn Jones into some Rolls Royce of a ball playing defender - he is almost the antithesis of this and, as such, is going to struggle at the top level because that is what it is all about these days. In summary his days are numbered.

1262~~~
This.

in this day and age, a lack of footballing brain doesn't forgive. He's a lost cause as far as playing for a club that aspires to the top is concerned.

1263~~~
I just don't see him here for much longer. Maybe this summer, maybe next. He's a reactive defender who is genuinely rash (rather than Rafael rash), his on the ball ability is pretty basic, his idea of bring the ball out is a weird kick and chase that usually ends up with him having to tackle someone and he's not improved since the first day he got here. The fact he's masochistic doesn't help either. Flog him to Arsenal and bring in some actual talent.

1264~~~
Not really. Jones joined just as Vidic started getting injury problems. 

When he joined us he was in the starting 11. And only reason he didn't displace Vidic and Ferdinand was because the three amigos get injured every two weeks.

1265~~~
That's a very fair description of what he is bringing to the table. I have had this problem with him for a while. The way he keeps hoofing the ball forward as if he is Beckebauer and the way he keeps giving away silly and completely avoidable freekicks in dangerous areas. It's as if he thinks that's how the game should be played.

1266~~~
It's getting past the point where he could be excused for being young or playing out of position too. He doesn't have the basics to become a good defender at this level, I fear.

1267~~~
Reactive part of his game is very good. Proactive part of his game is the reason I don't think he's going to make it here.

Age is on his side though, I think he would do well beside an experienced CB. It's a shame we let them all go with no ready replacement.

IMO his development has been handled extremely bad.

1268~~~
He was awful yesterday. Poor crosses, giving the ball away and WHAT IS WITH HIM TAKING CORNERS? He should be in the box trying to get his head on the flipping ball. 
However I think he is being expected to ball play too much. Vidic was never expected to do this.

1269~~~
Do people still think he's more "talented" than Smalling?

21 year old Smalling in his first season for us was a much more impressive defender, yet Jones for some reason got all the hype. Future United, England captain while Smalling was performing better on the pitch for us and when they played together for the England U-21s.

1270~~~
A good defender but limited as soon as the ball is at his feet. Reads game well but can't pass for toffee. He still looks shocked to be playing, like he is relly nervous - how long as he been at the club? If we really are to start playing out from the back then Phil Jones needs to nowhere near the first team.

1271~~~
Just watched a replay of the match and he was poor. Oh, and is there an explanation as to why he takes our corners now? I am truly confused by this.

1272~~~
He is only 22 though, got 10 years at the highest level, i feel there is room for him to develop still. Provided we play him at CB that is.

1273~~~
Surprised he didn't get injured the way he was flinging himself into every challenge with his blood and thunder style in the first half. Thankfully he didn't. Jones and Rojo (who is fast becoming a favourite of mine) are far and away my first choice centre half pairing.

Also the pundits whinging that he should be in the box for our corners... He's never been particularly prolific at scoring from corners, so I'm not too concerned about that it's just that he is a poor corner taker, so no-one else is going to have any chance scoring from them either.

1274~~~
I'd agree if I thought he had developed at all in the last 3 years. But he hasn't, other than developing an uncanny knack of injuring himself or someone else. 

He's genuinely brainless. You see some players who lack technical ability and they make up for it in brains. They learn the game, they find the tricks of the trade and then they work within their capabilities. 

Jones on the other hand doesn't learn, he goes head first into 50/50s, he charges  forward with absolutely no idea what he will do with it with the next touch let alone the final ball and he tries firing 50 yard balls across the park but instead of passing in a way that can be controlled he opts for the knuckle ball approach which sees it fizzing across the pitch in a manner even the great Fellaini couldn't chest down. 

He's enthusiastic, he's not talented. He's a physical beast that can time a tackle occasionally. Not what we need going forward.

1275~~~
Yup. You only need to look at where the likes of Cahill or Mertesacker were playing at that age to see how stupid it would be to write him off completely right now. I do wonder if he could do with a stint out on loan though. His learning curve could easily start hindering us.

1276~~~
Yes he does come across as over eager and often looks like a clumsy  teenager that hasnt grown into his body yet. I think it would be crazy to let him go though. We signed him very early he should have been loaned out for a few years to learn his trade.

1277~~~
Both of whom have been pretty poor this season. I see your point though, but I think that semi-late burst is more likely to come from Smalling than Jones. I see very little potential in Jones, and I think many are starting to agree.

1278~~~
It was a media myth and always has been. Smalling has always been the better defender and I think that will remain the case from here out. Apparently Jones is better on the ball, too, but he's not. Smalling isn't aesthetically pleasing on the eye but he's a lot more reliable in possession.

I like Jones, or I try to, at least. But last night you just had to laugh. People talk of age and just expect inherent traits like positioning and awareness to improve. They don't, not drastically. He'll not read the game like Rio Ferdinand did whether he is 22 or 32. It's simply not there.

1279~~~
Jones is a class centre half lol. Good in the air, strong, quick, fantastic at getting tight, great at covering in behind, good in 1v1 situations and good at recovering. Defensively he didn't do anything wrong last night, infact he made one brilliant header near the end to put it behind. Gave the ball away a couple of times, one from a dodgy bounce and won the ball back straight away. Apart from that, people are going on about his crossing as if that's what makes centre halves, it baffles me. There's not many 22 year olds that could seemlessly fit into playing on the side of a back 3, he's not as thick as people make out.

1280~~~
Totally agree. He also made a great tackle in the box. He had a good game apart from those careless passes. And in that is the problem. Phil Jones made 80 passes for United last night, only second to Carrick. He is not the player who should be dictating our play, but that seems to be the Van Gaal system. He wasn't help by having a gutless full back in Valencia offering him little effective out ball either.

1281~~~
He's average I think. Decent in the air, definitely strong and quick, great at covering but a lot of the time that is because he has messed up in the first place (positionally or giving the ball away) and average at 1v1s because has has a tendency to be rash and dive in.

1282~~~
He just needs to calm down. He seems to be high on the pitch most of the time.

1283~~~
not if he continues to run around without thinking. all the physical tools , lacks a footballing brain. the peno this season when he just stuck out a leg without any intention of winning the ball is a prime example. he is young but i don't think he'll be here or at any top club when he's 25.

1284~~~
So bad I dont even want to comment.

1285~~~
That is the philosophy though. Play from the back. Problem is that in England the lesser and pragmatic teams just sit in on Van Gaal's philosophy and nail us on the break. It means that Jones has no one to pass to because everyone is marked. It is big a problem for us and why we play more backwards passes than any other team in the league.

1286~~~
I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that most people on this forum could take a better corner than Philberto Carlos. 

That's not really a dig at him as he shouldn't be anywhere near the conversation of corner-takers anyway. Maybe his name was drawn out of a hat or something...?

1287~~~
How so?

And Fergie never actually compared him to Edwards, Paddy Crerand said it was Sir Bobby who saw similarities between them.

That's unfair, he's definitely after getting a lot better at defending since his arrival imo. You used to really worry with him in the side as a centre back and that's not really the case anymore I feel, now it's just his on the ball ability that really lets him down.

1288~~~
Exactly. How many times was he allowed to storm forward with the ball last night? Quite a few as I recall and each time there was no end product because Cambridge had sealed all avenues off. So the ball goes back and we rinse and repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>.

1289~~~
Rojo's improvements in just 6 months really do put to shame how little (if at all) Jones has improved in 3 years.

1290~~~
Stop with this logic. Phil Jones is just shit and can't pass 5 yards.

1291~~~
I didn't think I could reduce the analysis any further but there you go.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> Taking corners too. FFS.

1292~~~
Midfielders need to make themselves available. Its what causes the likes of Jones to look shite. There were numerous occasions yesterday when he had no option but to punt it. Our lack of movement is baffling, one of the things I expected Van Gaal to correct.

1293~~~
Seems to be cementing his place as 3rd in the CB pecking order which, given what can be safely assumed as to our summer transfer plans, is not an ideal place to be.

1294~~~
Why did he try hoof ball so many times when an easier pass to Carrick was available ...

1295~~~
Because he's the thickest person to have ever played professional football.

He makes Rooney look like the brain of Britain.

1296~~~
On one hand, he looks a bit afraid to pick another injury and engage more in risky runs in the opponent's half which were quite effective in the Fergie era, on the other, injuries already stopped his development and it may take whole season to get him into shape and perhaps find him a nominal role in the system.

1297~~~
Some defend him, some like myserlf think he lacks the intelligence to be a top player, regardless though LvG likes his CB's to play a certain way and I don't think Jones can play that way and is nearing the end of his contract.

1298~~~
Im baffled as to why Phil Jones is being made a scapegoat all of a sudden - our defence has actually been much more solid than earlier in the season, we are conceeding very few goals lately. 

The problem is lack of chances and goals

1299~~~
No one is debating his defending abilities from what i'm reading, and certainly from what i'm saying, but with the ball at his feet he is totally limited when playing the ball out.  If we wanted him just to stay back and defend then he'd be great, but modern football and the 'philosophy' require more from our CB's and that is were big Phil falls down - spectacularly. 
If your build up play from the back and midfield was more fluid and crisper, then we may start creating chances.  Kind of fecked if our CB can't even pass 10 yards correctly.

1300~~~
I think we need to play both Carrick-Blind on top of our defence.. to be effective..  Have we ever played this ?

This has to be the fulcrum on which we build on..

----Demaria--
Blind--Carrick--
---Back4---

1301~~~
It's refreshing to see an opposition fan actually get it correct. I hear so many hail Jones (a lot say he's shit too) as the far greater player between him and Smalling, but it couldn't be further from the truth. Smalling and Rojo both have a future here, even in just a squad capacity, but Jones and Evans are just simply not very good players and not good enough here.

1302~~~
No, the problem is how our defenders' limitations force a change of approach that is hindering the whole team instead of moving forward into a more exciting style of football. Jones is part of the problem, not the solution.

1303~~~
That's just a lame excuse. We haven't exactly leaked goals in any formation except Leicester game really where there was all sort of in game chopping changing. Actually that has been a theme too.'

Exactly.

Actually it's a theme with our defenders. They are almost as good as their last or last 2 games on here.

Jones is just 22 still and overall from the start of the season on average of each game been probably our best CB when he's played this season in all sorts of different formations with all sort of different partners. Also i think he and Rojo don't complement each other well in a partnership.

1304~~~
taking corners? no problem I bought him luckily to my fantasy premier league side and he will make points! watch out, two assists from corners and clean sheet. I also made him my captain so may he double that up.. I would bench him in real life, hopefully Smalling missing last match was due to the knock as the performances before were the best I ve seen this season from our Center back. Unlike Jones who started quite well but after injury he looks even more hopelesss in terms of using his brain than before, watch some interviews with him he is so dumb.. I am not sure if such brainless player can make it to the top but surely Smalling-Rojo should be considered our first option now

1305~~~
He is strong, he is fast, he can tackle, he is a good header of the ball. Sounds like a top CB when you put it that way, but all his qualities are negated sometimes by him being a headless chicken. Half of his interceptions this season were necessary only because he fecked up and gave the ball away in the first place.

How can you trust him in big games when he is a mistake waiting to happen? I honestly believe that if he can be more composed he will be one of the best around.

1306~~~
I wasn't able to post the last couple of days but I knew he would be destroyed in this thread. He had a rotton game

Still think he is our best defender. LVG is asking him to do things he is not comfortable with. Just get him to do what he does best..,defend and then if he has the ball play it simple.

1307~~~
He tried to play it simple and still have the ball away.

1308~~~
He is being forced outside his comfort zone and it is affecting his performance 

I don't get why he cannot play to each players strengths

1309~~~
Except Varane wasn't ever going to choose us over Madrid.

1310~~~
So can about 90% of PL standard defenders. Being a top defender is about so much more then physical qualities. Its about reading of the game, positional awareness, tactical nous, decision making etc etc Phil Jones lacks any of that, and sadly hasn't improved in 3 years.

1311~~~
A sideways pass to Carrick should not be out of his comfort zone.

1312~~~
His confidence with that ball is being affected, so even easy passes are not so easy. That was my point

We know he is a lot better than what we saw last night.

I'd say that was his worst ever game. It happens

1313~~~
He's definitely better than the Cambridge match performance, but he doesn't seem to be at the point everyone thought/hoped he would be. I think he still has a little bit of time but he has to be consistently better.

1314~~~
We tried to sign Varane after we had signed Jones, and previously Smalling.

The Caf of course said we didnt need him now we have Jones. He wasnt wanted here at the time

1315~~~
Because then you're limiting the collective performance to the inadequacies of your weakest link.

1316~~~
It is interesting that Gerrard Pique used to get derided by Man Utd fans for not being able to 'defend', but the while he fitted into Guardiola's Van Gaal inspired philosophy, and now Phil Jones is being derided for not being able to fit into Van Gaal's ball playing philosophy, but he is an excellent defender.

1317~~~
How can anybody watch Jones' positioning and awareness and come to the conclusion he's an excellent defender? He's not.

1318~~~
He does those last ditch dick hard tackles that are great for highlights and all that. He wouldn't have to do 90% of those tackles if he didn't position himself weirdly or feck something up while playing the ball (just like he did against Cambridge, fecked up pass to Rojo just to do a sliding tackle in the box, it's classic Jones basically). Great reactionary defender but with very poor awareness.

1319~~~
I think he has near the top on average interceptions per game this season in the prem or at least did few games back.

1320~~~
He'd be the first man I'd pick to man-mark someone in a big game. A game against a better side that'd back us in the corner, a game that needs heroes at the back. In those other 90% of matches though, games that we need to dominate and play in the opponent's half and just have a bit of security and calm at the back, he wouldn't be anywhere near my line-up.

I just hope that with time and game experience he'll mature and <span style="text-decoration: underline">learn.</span> He's got all the qualities to be a world class defender. Physicality and instincts are superb, just has to learn when to rely on them and when to use his head.

1321~~~
I'd love to see how many goals we concede down the right hand side with Jones there, I bet it's not many at all. When Sterling moved over to left wing he didn't get a touch cos of Jones (apart from Evans playing him through). Also, when Rojo and Carrick collided vs QPR, he was 3v1 and he cut out the pass across, whilst then positioning himself to close down the striker and allowed players to get back and Valencia got a tackle in, without Jones touching the ball. His positioning and awareness is quite underrated and if he was playing vs Leicester instead of Blackett, who just put himself in no mans land in a similar situation, we probably wouldn't have lost.

1322~~~
Another horrible load of knee jerking in this thread. He's been decent this season for the most part. He was our best defender for the first few games before he got injured. His distribution was awful the other night but defensively he's been decent overall.

1323~~~
Yes he's been good defensively and distribution has never been his strong point. But then, if his skill on the ball and distribution matched his defensive quailities then he'd be a £50m defender.

1324~~~
Jesus Christ <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1325~~~
I can't understand why Jones has regressed so drastically. I mean, he was always a rash bastard, but under Fergie he did show genuine promise. I never really bought into the whole Reincarnation of Edwards thing, but he looked to have great potential. Shame. It seems he's gone the way of Evans and become a confidence player.

1326~~~
But making ridiculous, lazy cross-field passes that lead to a direct scoring opportunity for the opposition is part of his defensive work as far as I'm concerned. Of course, in typical Phil Jones fashion,  he moved quickly to rectify the error (and that's a good thing,) but he always seems to have this kind of mistake in him (much like Evans,) and it's going to cost us against more clinical opposition.

1327~~~
But they don't so he's not.

1328~~~
no no he hasn't. and when is decent good enough? because he's not. he can't defend nor pass it. we'd be pis5ing overselves if he played for cska london or siddy. absolutely a reason why we look mid table at the back and struggle to get things going from back to front. a peno waiting to happen in our end and a give away when going forward.

1329~~~
Dear god, we've finally hit RAWK level

1330~~~
Nether do his defensive qualities.

Running around a lot and charging into tackles does not make you a top centre back. In fact, those kind of defenders are ten a penny.

1331~~~
I thought he was or most positive player on Friday, not saying that much due to the opposition and his teammates who were woeful. Two crucial interceptions and the constant desire to bring the ball out from the back made him the standout IMO.

His rash attitude and constant injuries have blighted his progress, I still believe that if he can go on a run with no injuries til the end of the season, he will be far more composed and mature moving to the next campaign.

1332~~~
This is exactly the type of OTT nonsense I was referring to.

1333~~~
I tend to agree with this. He made a couple of awful unforced errors in possession on Friday and can be a bit rash but I still think he's got a lot of ability. People forget how young he is. With the right guidance he still has time to become an excellent CB.

1334~~~
would he start if he played for Chelsea or Citeh?

1335~~~
City's CB's have all been no worse than Jones this season.

1336~~~
Ahead of Gary Cahill? Definitely, lad is the biggest fraud going.

1337~~~
Indeed. Not only is he young for a centreback he's probably played fewer games in central defence than most other players his age who play the same position. Injuries aside, he's victim of his own versatility having played a lot of games in fulback and central midfield. People are slating him for not progressing but you can't expect any player to progress without playing football. In the long term he might benefit from the experience he gained in different positions but what he really needs now is a long run of games playing in central defence. If he can somehow manage that between now and the end of the season he'll be a much better player come the summer.

1338~~~
Cahill is twice the player Jones is.

1339~~~
Cahill has been fairly dodgy this season.

City are starting Mangala, Demechilis, Boyata and a declined this season Kompany.


Anyway, I'd love to see Terry and Cahill for example and their distribution in the fecking systems and structures we are playing. Infact them as side CB's in a 3 man high line would be quite interesting as well.

1340~~~
Cahill is fecking shit lol. He's a fraud of a defender that has Terry to guide him through games in the most protected back four in the league. Any time Chelsea are left even slightly exposed they struggle, he's completely average and there's much, much more to Jones' game.

1341~~~
Jones strikes me as the kind of defender who is at his best when his team are pinned back in their own box, under constant pressure, and fielding wave after wave of attack. His fearless attitude and commitment are assets when things are happening thick and fast. But when there is time and space and he has to keep disciplined in his positioning while events are taking place elsewhere, he just seems to lack the concentration that the top defenders have. He plays better on instinct than when he has too much time to think about things.

1342~~~
wow. that's a load of shite of the highest order.

absolutely no manager would take jones over cahill. get a grip.

1343~~~
It's not shite at all. Have you noticed that people have only started to rate Cahill since Mourinho came? Why? Because Chelsea's back line now that have the best protection in the league and the responsibilities placed on the CBs is completely limited. When they aren't protected or have to come out at teams, they are all over the place - look at Tottenham, look at Atletico Madrid, look at all the points they dropped last year vs weaker opposition.

Jones is a defender is much better. He's better at getting tight and at sweeping, he's faster, he's better in 1v1 situations and he reads the game better. Cahills strengths are that he's good in the air and he's brave, which is why he suits Chelsea system because he does most of his defending inside his own box, but he's severely limited.

Jones makes sloppy mistakes, I'm not disputing that. He's 22 years old though and they are the mistakes of an inexperienced centre half. Cahill is 29, and actually makes just as many mistakes but it's because he's an average defender, you'd be mad not to swap him for Jones. Could Cahill play on the side of a 3 at the back? No. Could he play a high line? No. He's limited, and one thing that people do underrate massively is Jones' positioning in an around the box; it's impeccable, especially on balls whipped in. He is more than capable of doing what Cahill does week in week out, that's not the case vice versa.

1344~~~
As a neutral - lol

1345~~~
Cahill is most definitely a fraud, but he's far better than Jones. If it was Smalling v Cahill, I'd take Smalling.

1346~~~
But Jones is 6 years younger than Cahill, right ?

1347~~~
If Jones continues on his current trajectory he should reach Cahill's level by the time he's 44.

1348~~~
All top players reached their peak at age 22. You never get any better after that. It's a football law.

1349~~~
I can see that, a little bit like Dante, Miranda or even Fletcher.

1350~~~
There is really not much of a gap at all between Jones and Smalling so not sure how that statement makes sense.

And neither of them is that far behind Cahill either as is made out. Cahill with lesser protection vis a vis last season this season has dropped a level too.


Jones and Smalling in a structured team given a good regular run in a settled partnership and formation would do decently well even now and their reputation would automatically grow if that were to happen. But problem is due to injury our defenders cannot get a regular run and also we don't have any sort of settled team as of now.

1351~~~
Cahill himself at the same age was being loaned out to Sheffield United by Aston Villa.....

1352~~~
Never really understood what knee-jerk was until this thread, so similar with the Smalling thread after the match vs City, people completely writing him off, and putting him as an amateur. Guess what, if that's how we rate players everyone bar ddg is an amateur at this club as all the players have had some shockers, in his defence, he has been been quite good this season.

1353~~~
There quite clearly is. Smalling is one of the best CBs in the league.

1354~~~
Shhh, don't ruin it for them!

1355~~~
I think you're underestimating the importance of comfort on the ball and distribution for modern day defenders. Refer to David Luiz valuation.

1356~~~
I think many were just waiting for him to have a bit of a shocker so they could go nuts at him

1357~~~
Yeah, it's been happening a lot in here recently.

1358~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> oh that is so rich.

1359~~~
Playing him at right back has stunted his progress as much as his ridiculous injury record. Saf and Moyes share the blame in this respect.

I still think he's young enough to become a very good CB for us. I feel half of his injuries are caused by his stupidness in going for crazy challenges. If he can mature in this aspect I think he will become far more consistent.

That comment by Saf about him becoming our greatest ever player will possibly be used as a stick to beat him with over his career. In hindsight it was a really stupid comment to make. He won't come anywhere close to that but he can still become a great player for us.

1360~~~
I really like Jones. He's been a little off recently but he was our best defender before he got injured. Unlike a lot of you, I can still see him making it here if he rids himself of his injury troubles and stops being such an idiot at times. I don't think he's better than Smalling and Rojo but he's much better than Evans who is 5 years older than him and regressing every season. 

Bringing in Laporte and maybe another established defender with Smalling, Jones and Rojo as competition would be as strong a defence we could possibly line up with for the foreseeable future.

1361~~~
No. He's only had one poor game since his return.

1362~~~
Not really the issue though. Like it or not a centreback in Van Gaal's system has got to be composed with excellent distribution skills adept at carrying the ball out from the back. Jones just doesn't possess that skill set. 

It's the defensive equivalent of trying to play a system with wingers and having Young and Valencia as those wingers. The system doesn't work because you are relying on players who are ineffective at playing the role the system asks of them. Weakest link breaks the chain and all that.

1363~~~
Eh?

1364~~~
I know, I wasn't criticising Jones, just agreeing that some posters are looking at every opportunity to jump on a players back.

1365~~~
Fair enough but Vidic was a top notch defender without being the most comfortable on the ball.  That's why we have Carrick and Blind dropping back to get the ball and supposedly move it forward.

1366~~~
Like you and Van Gaal.

1367~~~
Me and van Gaal?
Where have I said that LVG should get sacked? Or that he isn’t good enough for United? You do realise that you can criticise someone yet still back them?

Some of our players are being written off every time they lose the ball or make a bad pass, players like Jones (22) Wilson (19) McNair (19) Blackett (20) Shaw (19) have all been written off this season as ‘not United quality and should be sold’. Even senior players like Mata, Falcao and Herrera have been written off after one or two bad games or have the nerve to give away the ball.

1368~~~
So you back Van Gaal?

1369~~~
At the moment yes, however, I still feel that he to prove his worth to the Club. At the moment he is struggling to do that but I feel he will turn it around given time. However, that doesn’t mean that he shouldn’t be criticised when things go horribly wrong or results are poor, the honeymoon period forLVG is over IMO.
I stated in another post that I fear we won’t get top four this season and LVG will get sacked, it would be hard to argue against it given the money he has spent, but it could be disastrous for us in the long term. Unlike last season the Club is moving in a direction that could end up being very successful, but that doesn’t mean poor results can simply be written off.

Further, I hate the way we play at the moment, I’m finding us very boring to watch and I know I’m far from the only one. Saying that, I don’t think that’s the way LVG wants us to play, that’s my hope anyway.

1370~~~
Managers love Jones. Like, they really, really love him.

They put him in the side whenever he's fit. Whether that be at centreback, rightback, defensive midfield or attacking midfield. Allardyce did it, Fergie did it, Moyes did it, Capello all did it, Hodgson does it and now LvG does it.

He obviously offers something on the pitch that fans don't see, because there seems to be a ridiculous amount of faith placed in him to do things on the pitch that many don't to think he's capable of.

1371~~~
Remember <a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/8666649/premier-league-sir-alex-ferguson-praises-manchester-uniteds-phil-jones" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a>?

1372~~~
I actually prefer Jones in midfield, great drive and physicality. However he wouldn't really fit a LVG midfield, not comfortable enough on the ball and in posession.
Don't really rate him as a CB tbh hes good but not sure he'll be good enough to be a regular starter for United, hes more a Spurs level CB imo, he is only 22 though I guess.

1373~~~
People bring up what Ferguson said and the whole Duncan Edwards thing but, Big Sam called him the next John Terry... right after his professional debut and Capello compared him to Franco Baresi. Managers rate him highly.

1374~~~
would he pay 17m for him? west ham need defenders.

1375~~~
Actually no. LVG has used him purely as a CB in his starting 11. Both in a back 3 or back 2 he's always been used as a CB. I can't remember if his position has been changed during a match after substitutions but if it has it has been kept to a minimum.

It's clear LVG sees him as a CB and has used him as such rather than dicking around with his position constantly.

1376~~~
I think he means LVG always picks him when hes fit.

1377~~~
Ah fair enough. :/

1378~~~
He might be limited in terms of his technical ability but he is a hard worker and no one can question his commitment, every team needs one or two of these players and I think Jones could actually be among the best in that category if, and that's unfortunately a big if, he can stay fit and progress a due to getting a good amount of football. Unfortunately that's also the thing I have my biggest doubts about, his fitness, as long as he can't stay fit for a season or two without missing too many games he is no use for us the same as Smalling, Evans and Rafael really.

1379~~~
Me too, he could be a really good player as the DM in a 3-man-midfield, but certainly not the way we play with LVG now.

1380~~~
He is doing Yoga classes now, so don't worry about his fitness anymore, mate.

1381~~~
two massive hurdles for him. 1) needs to read the game better then he doesn't have to run around like a nutter. and 2) if he does get better at reading the game he won't get hurt. by the way he needs to learn how to tackle without killing himself. he needs to start using his head or he'll be at stoke or west brom.



i always thought it would be his place in the team as well but i don't think he has the game for it.

1382~~~
All we see is potential and stagnation with dose of U-21 type of mistakes on the pitch. He won't get far on that kind of reputation... certainly not under Van Gaal who in the past made already huge system changes in clubs like Bayern Munich.

Somebody needs to work hard on him to unlock his potential and get rid the fear of being constantly injured (I think that's the case, too)... Jones himself would be a good start. The process must start from him.

1383~~~
The point was more to do with the fact that LvG always picks him when he's fit, rather than the position he plays. He's never started a game on the bench this season despite being injured several times. He's pretty much always on the pitch for the full 90 minutes too (other than when he got subbed after 89 minutes against Liverpool at 3-0 to waste time).

In 4 seasons at United, he's only been an unused substitute for 4 games whilst playing in all the other 115 he's been fit for! And that run stretches all the way back to when he was only 18 year old.

When he's fit, he plays. I'll say it again: managers LOVE him. People who think he's gonna be a part of the clearout are crazy.

1384~~~
He just got done off David Nugent there. Could have cost us a goal out of absolutely nothing. Christ.

1385~~~
Its mistakes like that that make me think he's not going to make it here. That 'pass' to De Gea was Sunday league standard.

1386~~~
Calamity Jones <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1387~~~
Been good again besides the mistake imo.

1388~~~
That back pass to DDG was shocking

1389~~~
Yeah but that's the problem, he seems to be making way too many of them. If he wants to be first choice CB here, he can't be doing that.

1390~~~
His fifteen yard sprints which then suddenly stop and end in a side pass are hilarious. Such a funny footballer.

1391~~~
Yeah, I do agree with that. He is still very young for a CB though, I have confidence that he can cut them out with more experience.

1392~~~
He's got his pricetag against him, though. I think he'll grow into a decent enough defender, although I doubt he'll ever be good enough to really be relied upon but it's just depressing to think that we paid 16.5 million for such an ordinary footballer. Not unlike Smalling. We've wasted so much money on transfers it's unbelievable.

1393~~~
McNair and Jones going for the same ball ...

1394~~~
not his biggesr fan but he did ok. not as much running around. needs to throttle back a bit and use his head.

1395~~~
Had a good game until that mistake

Needs to cut that shit out and it's all good

1396~~~
Mistakes plague ALL young defenders.

There is no doubting that he has the potential to be a top class defender. If he can stay injury free that is.

1397~~~
Incredible how easily he switches off, today's pass and our game against, uhm, Newcastle? Same situation, 3-0, he switches off, penalty and bam.

No major complaints apart from that I think.

1398~~~
Thick as two planks.

1399~~~
Nugent was beginning to expose his positional issues with his pace near the end. A lot of solid defending but if he can't get himself in the right positions it's just a waste of time. Nothing new then.

1400~~~
He was ok except the one mistake that was more about poor decision making than the pass IMO.

1401~~~
Wow! The way people analyse Jones nowadays. Anyway, apart from his sloppy pass to De Gea today, I thought he was solid, as usual. He was also very good on the ball today, which I see no has decided to mention. Constantly running out with the ball and starting attacks. Hopefully he can continue. At 22, he will only improve, providing he's given regular games.

1402~~~
Exactly, every time I watch him it is so evident that he is not very smart.

1403~~~
What makes you say that?

1404~~~
I hope other clubs see what you see, he's not up to united standard. I would be very disappointed to see him as first choice next season.

1405~~~
He wears glasses offside the pitch right? There's something wrong with his eye vision. One time Van Persie headed the ball on our own half, Jones lumped into him randomly, very absurd. With his backpass on De Gea, he almost kicked De Gea in his face after he had saved the situation. Another moment where he jumped into one of our players when it was obvious they would get the ball. He is a genius of football <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He is an excellent prospect though. Go and look where Jaap Stam played when he was 22. And then you're forgetting that Jones has already put in his fair share of excellent performances for us, but obviously that doesn't count on here.

1406~~~
Tell me what was wrong with his performance today, apart from his sloppy mistake? Bare in mind, the comments should be based off today's game.

1407~~~
Because he constantly does stupid things. He's your typical British defender who relies on pace and strength rather then any real footballing nous.

1408~~~
He is always the one mopping up at the back too.

1409~~~
Some harsh comments in here. He was pretty decent today overall bar the mishap pass to De Gea. Much better than his last outing.

1410~~~
He looked decent from the bits I saw if the game.

Still, he's nowhere near the outstanding prospect I thought he might be when we signed him.

1411~~~
Steady. If this one thing this country can produce it's proper defenders. A slight lull right now, perhaps, but England generally gets it right at the back. Jones' stupidity is of his own accord.

1412~~~
The lads 22, for God's sake. He's bound to make mistakes. Hopefully with experience and playing time as a centre back, he'll improve.

1413~~~
It seems to me like Phil is one of those guys who cant get away with anything around here. One or two mistakes and out goes all the good things he has done and his performance is rendered dodgy.

1414~~~
Thought he did alright.

1415~~~
The new Rooney.

1416~~~
The thread title is "Phil Jones - 2014/15 performances" and I believe he been either injured or very poor. His performance today was "meh" and my original point is that he should not be first choice for us next season.

1417~~~
He hasn't been very poor at all, he's been good in most games he's played. I don't think he should be first choice next season either but he's definitely good enough to be part of the squad and it's likely that he'll continue to get better.

1418~~~
I honestly think this is why he will never develop into a real top class defender. He is just not intelligent enough.

1419~~~
CB back pecking order next season -

New commanding CB
Rojo
Smalling
Jones
Evans

Not sure what Fergie was sniffing when he said Jones could be Uniteds greatest ever players.

1420~~~
I have been hoping Jones comes good because the athletic traits are there - quickness, strength, and drive.

What Jones is seriously missing, at least at the moment, is a footballing brain, the kind that stops you from bad decisions and rash decisions.  Plenty more of those today.

What was he playing at with the backpass to De Gea?  Even a man on the street who has only watched football knows that when a back is being pursued by someone on the side of goal, he should stop and pivot away to the touchline.  Instead, he almost hands Leicester a goal when nothing was happening.

And why does he keep trying to outhead our own players?  I could understand him wanting the ball RVP headed because he's the CB, but what business does he have trying to knock McNair out of the way, who also has played as a CB and also knows how to play that type of ball?

I think he had a 'good' game today because he wasn't tested all that much.  He's still young and could improve but I don't see the mental traits that a good back needs.

1421~~~
Shouldn't start over Smalling but maybe Chris's not 100% fit to play.. Jones did well tonight. Still can't help myself but dislike brainless players. If he plays and stays fit he can clear away some of his stupid mistakes from his game and can be useful player

1422~~~
Looked nervous on the ball and THAT mistake to give Nugent a scoring chance.

1423~~~
The thread is indeed called "Phil Jones - 2014/15 performances", therefore, it baffles me when people like you start talking about next season, as opposed to what he was like in today's game. 

If Jones can stay fit and put a run of very good performances together for us, there's no reason why he can't be first choice for us next season. This season, Jones, when fit, has been constantly playing as a centre back, whereas previous seasons has seen him playing at RB, CDM and CM, which has arguably stunted his growth at centre back.

1424~~~
He was pretty solid today except for one moment which was somewhat dodgy.

1425~~~
Seriously? He's so slow he may as well be trying to text the recipient in advance of passing the ball. He's the slowest 22 year old on most pitches. Movement slow, passing slow, actual speed of the ball slow. Caught in possession more times than any other player.

If this guy was in anything other than a United shirt we'd enjoy laughing at him. I'm wondering what he has to do to get dropped at this point. I'm genuinely afraid whenever the ball comes near him.

1426~~~
Keeps challenging his teammates for headers...very strange!

1427~~~
You're completely exaggerating but people do that regarding Jones often unfortunately.

1428~~~
Its because he's stupid. All blood and thunder, but no brains.

1429~~~
Its amazing to think hes only 22, feels like hes been around for ages. 

Its also amazing how quick fans on here are to write him off given how good he has been for us in the past. Granted last season was bad (show me a player who wasnt?) and injuries this season have derailed him. Sure he has a few WTF moments but so do a lot of young defenders, its just apart of the position he plays. If a midfielder loses the ball its not a huge deal, if a defender does it he could very well cost his side a goal.

1430~~~
It is amazing because Michael Keane is the same age and only just starting to make a name for himself.

He is struggling to come to terms with a style of continental football that is totally alien to how he has been brought up yet so many fans want to crucify him for it. He still <i>defends</i> very well. I actually think that he get better at advancing the ball from the back. There is someone earlier in thread slagging him off for running 40 yards forward and then making a sideways pass, in that situation he has made an important territorial gain, what do they expect him to do?

He needs to cut out the brain farts but today I think that he was in the mindset of not wasting possession or playing rudimentary football, as is Van Gaal's philosophy, but sometimes he has to play it safe, regardless of the philosophy.

1431~~~
Worth remembering that at the age of 22, Rio Ferdinand (one of the great defenders of his generation) was something of a clearly talented but also deeply flawed liability at Leeds. He was a mistake waiting to happen and people were quite stunned when Fergie forked out whatever he paid for him.

Jones is still young. Keep in mind that he's not been played primarily as a CB up until this season - this is his first season as a specialist CB without having to fill in as an RB/DM, without being benched because Rio/Vidic must play at all cost, and he's playing in a constantly changing back four with no stability.

If, and I acknowledge this is a big if, he can stay fit I can see him becoming an absolute rock at the back. He's quite clearly quite a refined footballer as well, not just brute force and physicality. Need to work on his decision making but a 22 year old Rio most certainly had to and did.

1432~~~
Yeah. His only saving grace is, like others said, he's only 22 and can play in midfield also.

1433~~~
Sorry i didn't conform to your opinion, I still think Jones is very average footballer and should not be first choice at Utd today or next season.

1434~~~
his physical skills are there his head needs work. if united go for another cb he'll be 4th choice next yr. up to him if he wants that. 

would any club come in for him in the summer for what united paid 4 yrs ago?

1435~~~
Seems that he is either first or second choice at the moment so I am not sure how you figure that?

1436~~~
think that smalling (when 100%) and rojo are first choice. my hope would we'd buy someone better than all 3 in the summer.

i'd sell him if a club offered 16m for him double quick.

1437~~~
Well, you assume that, based on no evidence.

1438~~~
Rio Ferdinand was like Bobby Moore and Alessandro Nesta's more talented love child compared to Phil Jones at the same age. Ferdinand had flaws, but he was a sure fire hit when he was 22. You'd have had to be mental to see he wasnt going to be a top centre half eventually. "Deeply flawed" is a massive overstatement. Especially comparing him to Phil Jones. They arent even in the same level of class if you took 22 year old Rio and 22 year old Phil Jones. For one when Ferdinand made strides forward, he wouldnt suddenly pass the ball to the centre half who was standing in the place where he originally started his run.

And it was far from surprising when we paid 30 million for him. He was our best player 2002 world cup. His performance against Argentina was excellent.

1439~~~
Rio Ferdinand at his best though was the best CB in the world. Even if Jones never reaches that level he can be a great, great United player.

Where was Vidic at 22 though? At Spartak Moscow? All I'm saying is for a cb experience is vital - and Phil Jones is 22 years old having never been played consistantly in the position. Is it too much to expect him to improve, when he's quite clearly got all the tools for the job physically and technically?

1440~~~
Still think he can make it here, his main problem is staying fit imo. Same as Smalling, just a shame we can never rely on either consistently. Hopefully we sign a top partner for Rojo and have Smalling and Jones for back up. Evans future here probably depends as much on whether we'll be playing with a back 4 for the long term as injuries, but either way it doesn't look good for him.

1441~~~
With how they have been used this season clearly Jones and Rojo are the first choice CBs(atleast when we play with two CBs). Jones and Rojo have both started every match they have been fit for and have never been on the bench. While Smalling has been an unused substitute 4 times and came off the bench two times.

1442~~~
Is the done thing now. Win lose or draw, some people come on here to pick at every little lapse in certain players performances! 
I do wonder where the enjoyment in watching a game is for them? As they just seem to need to find something to bitch about every week. 
Phil was fine today, bar 1 lapse.

1443~~~
He's obviously going to be a lot better than Smalling when he gets to Smalling's age in 3 seasons time.

1444~~~
3-4 years ago when Smalling first came to us he was better than Jones is now.

1445~~~
Criticism of him was over the top last game and same again.  Is he going to make it who knows, but it is too early to write him off and the witch hunt is unnecessary.

1446~~~
Phil saw Den Perry have a suspected heart attack on stage tonight. Cant be good for his head, that.

1447~~~
Likewise, however I think it is wishful thinking unfortunately.

1448~~~
Saw it? I'm 99% sure he caused it.

1449~~~
Well you said it yourself. However, you've still failed to give an opinion on how Jones played today.

1450~~~
He's going to be class lol, it's evident. You've got Kompany who's been making mistakes for a solid 3 seasons, Gary Cahill who has now actually been dropped because people are starting to realise he's bang average, and Koscielny who is probably the most error prone CB in the league whilst arguably being the best one as well. 3 first choice, experienced CBs for the best sides in the country this season, but god forbid if a Phil Jones makes a mistake at the age of 22 in the first season he's actually had a proper run at centre half.

Get some perspective, he's going to be class and he's most certainly United standard.

1451~~~
People writing him off are ridiculous. 

Gary Cahill is having a successful top level career and Jones is miles ahead of him in terms of development when you factor in age.

1452~~~
Still 3 weeks away from turning 23. I've got hope for him, he can be a good player for us.

1453~~~
Him and Rojo could form a solid CB partnership and need to play all the league games. Against Cambridge I'd rest one or two of them, but for the big daddy games they should partner up.

Was Smalling on the bench yesterday? Maybe he should start v. Cambridge.

1454~~~
Strange he is only a year older than Thorpe. Still time to develop but hasn't done this over the last 2 seasons

1455~~~
Probably because he hasn't been always playing as a centre back. Hopefully he will get the opportunity to do so, where we should see him develop more.

1456~~~
Yes. If fit, I think it's a cert that Smalling will start against a very tall Cambridge side. That said, we seemed to handle the aerial threat of Cambridge pretty well with Rojo and Jones, but like you said, I think we should rest at least one of them for that game.

1457~~~
Smalling is the better fit with Rojo, you can't have Rojo as the reserved one in a CB partnership. I can see the lines have been drawn in here but come the summer they will most likely all be trying to get a start alongside Hummels anyway.

1458~~~
He's absolutly useless.

Crap in the air, constantly out of position, and throwing himself into ridiculous tackles. I honestly don't think he has a clue what positional awareness is.

1459~~~
I don't think he's been bad so far.

1460~~~
He's been fine today bar giving away one stupid free kick on the edge of the box.

1461~~~
Just watch him, he's constantly out of position, charging across the pitch like an idiot.

1462~~~
He's been fine.

1463~~~
Seems some people have an agenda against Jones. He definitely hasn't been our worst centre back today.

1464~~~
I'm not his greatest fan by a long shot, but today he has been fine. All our problems have come through our shocking midfield which has done absolutely nothing, and from free kicks and corners. I do realise he's generally bad with his positioning, but today I think he has done OK.

1465~~~
Behave yourself. He hasn't been any worse than Rojo, who's been all over the place today.

1466~~~
Some people genuinely have agendas for / against certain players. I don't like Jones much myself, but he really hasn't been that bad today. Probably one of our top 5 players to be honest, given that the entire midfield and attack has been dismal.

1467~~~
why did he chest that?

1468~~~
He is the one who should take most of the blame for that goal....

1469~~~
Created the space by recklessly throwing himself about.

1470~~~
Can't understand why would he go for that failed header for the goal, looked like a dog who just freed himself from a leash.

1471~~~
To attack the ball and take control of the situation? I think that is why managers like him because he takes responsibility, he just needs to tidy up his work a bit.

1472~~~
But he didn't control the situation, he brought in more chaos which resulted in goal. Rooney had his man marked, Jones should have marked his. It's not like we do the man-marking assignments prior to the match to throw ourselves around the box like he did.

1473~~~
But Rooney had a clear view of the ball - it's not like there was no one there. Completely reckless of him to go in for that.

1474~~~
I didn't say that it wasn't a mistake.

1475~~~
The definition of an employee who'd like to be seen looking busy while doing average job. Still better than just being average, though.

1476~~~
Exactly, it's the opposite of what a defender should do. Imagine if Phil Jones drove a bus for a living. There would be dead bodies littering the streets.

1477~~~
Him and Rojo are a partnership made in hell.

1478~~~
Thought he played fine today. Brought the ball out of defence much better and was one of only a few up for the fight. Made a number of good tackles, blocks and  headers. The problems we had today were further forward

1479~~~
This. A million times this.

1480~~~
Thought he and Rojo handled themselves pretty well today considering the amount of pressure they were under. Unfortunate for them that there's no one in front of them relieving the pressure for a substantial amount of time until we conceded, made them look worse than they are - been happening all season.

1481~~~
He had some good last minute tackles/blocks but he still has too many errors in him. I don't think his style works well with Rojo either, Smalling should play instead.

1482~~~
I thought he wasn't bad. He still very young for a defender and if he stays fit (and if he gets a little bit smarter while playing football by getting more experience) he can become a very good centre back. 

Buying a top class centreback would be prefered but i think we should keep Jones around. Just get rid of Evans.

1483~~~
Nothing wrong with Jones's performance today. Yes, he was often dragged out of position into the wide areas, as was Rojo, but that was due the incredible movement of Sakho and Valencia. I actually thought he grew into the game as it went on.

I've always said it though, Jones, as with Rojo, need centre backs next to them who will sweep, because they're front foot defenders.

1484~~~
not his biggest fan but he did ok. needs to figure out a few things and use his head , both literally (chest , really? , not on phil) , figuratively.

1485~~~
He's not been nearly as bad as some people on here make out. I won't deny his passing is shit, that horrible ball he made in the 1st half after doing well to dribble it out sticks in my mind. Weird player.

1486~~~
He was quite good today, given the midfield offered little or no support.

1487~~~
Was our best player today, according to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/829868/LiveStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015-West-Ham-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">whoscored.com.</a>

1488~~~
I thought he was fine. I like him and Rojo together.

1489~~~
Did lots of good defending tonight. One of our best players.

1490~~~
He was good today, bit clumsy at times but still good.

1491~~~
This. Whether he is 22 or otherwise doesn't matter when his lack of brains for this kind of discipline is unacceptable.

1492~~~
Exactly what I was saying at HT. He's an idiot.

1493~~~
I actually thought he was decent <i>but </i>he was reckless on the goal which ultimately cost us. There were other times where he was a bit all over the place too. Typical Jones game.

1494~~~
He was at his brainless best today... So mostly good but with a sprinkling of wtf is he doing moments. Rojo had to clear up after him far too many times for my liking when he got himself caught up the pitch.

A top striker will also soon cotton on to the show it to the RB then dribble inside move he does every single time without fail.

1495~~~
The goal was mostly his fault imo, other than that he was okay. I feel like I'm always saying "other than that" with him though. I agree with the people that think him and Rojo aren't suited as a partnership.

1496~~~
Thought he had a good game

But maybe should have done better on their goal.

1497~~~
Good game, could have done better for the goal but it was a stupid free kick to give away that led to the goal.

1498~~~
I just think he's dreadful.

I fear the worse everytime i see him play centre back.  How many more times does he have to run 10 yards out of position to head a ball which isnt his to win.  He does it so often and nearly always presents the opposition with a chance, either directly or through on ensuing free kick which he gives away.

You cant fault his commitment and endevour.  But we should have more than commitment and endevour.

I have never rated him, i dont see him as a top level centre back and the most worrying thing is.......i dont see the slightest bit of improvement in his ability to defend, read the game or make decisions.

1499~~~
This.

I wish someone in the coaching staff can tell straight into Jones' face that he can shove his commitment and endeavour up where the sun doesn't shine if he doesn't grow any brains at all, of which the odds are standing next to (if not straight on) nil.

1500~~~
I thought he was pretty decent at West Ham. He made several crucial interceptions when the rest of the defence went walkabout.

1501~~~
He was pretty decent vs West Ham.

Bailed Rojo out on few occasions as well.

1502~~~
But so did Rojo as well, and not just Jones but also Valencia

1503~~~
Rojo is quickly establishing himself as the number 1 centre back.

1504~~~
Also due to the fact that he can stay fit more or less (touching wood)

1505~~~
Always a bonus.

1506~~~
Also a rarity when it comes to our defenders

1507~~~
He's definitely got a a mistake or 2 in him, but there are very few CB's in the Premier League who put in 100% flawless performances week in week out. 

Probably a hangover from last season - the spotlight is on our defenders and we're making too much out of the odd chance given away I think. In a 90 minute football match against decent strikers the odds are against defenders, it's what makes football great to watch at the end of the day. Even Kompany looks more shakey than both Rojo and Jones lately and we all know he'll pick it up and average out another top season.  

I still think we need a leader back there and Jones on the bench for Hummels would probably be about right, but If our attackers had anything about them yesterday nobody would be talking about Phil Jones' performance.

1508~~~
Best centre back in the Premier League according to Whoscored

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2</a>

1509~~~
Actually best defender with his 7.6 even.

1510~~~
Sell him.

1511~~~
Christ on a bike

1512~~~
I missed the first 5 min, so also his injury. Was it bad? and what kind of injury was it?

1513~~~
This guy properly pulled a hamstring coming out he's mothers womb.

1514~~~
So how long has he actually been fit inbetween injuries this time?

I still have hopes for him. He's still very young for a defender and quite capable at his young age... however he does need to stay fit and thats become quite a big problem.

1515~~~
Is it just an ankle sprain? FFS.

1516~~~
Impressive performance from Jones. 5 minutes played, 2 mistakes and an injury.

1517~~~
Does he get an assist for his injury?

1518~~~
Lost Michael Keane at a corner and in trying to get back to him seemed to land awkwardly on his ankle

1519~~~
Not exactly looked better without him.

1520~~~
what happened this time?

edit nvm

Glue factory for him Im afraid

1521~~~
He sneezed

1522~~~
LVG said it was a knee injury. He could be out for a long time.

1523~~~
Pity he got injured .. but he's no loss to the team in my opinion.

1524~~~
It's a shame he got injured because he is a decent back-up, certainly better than Evans.

1525~~~
I've decided he's shit.

1526~~~
Agreed.

1527~~~
I really want whatever Fergie was smoking when he said he'd be our best ever player.

1528~~~
It was obviously said to piss Rooney off, as at the time he had a beef with him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1529~~~
He played well during the back end of that season.

1530~~~
Oh well in <i>that</i> case..

1531~~~
He is the next Woodgate

1532~~~
It is, he was getting to some form but if this is a way how to get Chris SmallKing to the play then be it. Wonder if we see Thorpe on the bench at least any time soon..

1533~~~
Woodgate was actually a good defender though.

1534~~~
<i>Tabarnak! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/></i> (I had to say that, sorry)

Seriously, he's a lost cause by any stretch when it comes to grow some brains in any future. Even players who get injured often in their early career find ways to be more cautious about themselves, but you just can't see that with Jones. Ship him out in the summer before he finishes his course onto retirement by age 25, please.

1535~~~
??

1536~~~
Lost cause. Whatever qualities or potential he had/has are secondary to his inability to stay fit.

On his way out in the summer. Probably with Evans and Rafael for company.

1537~~~
Van Gaal seems to trust him. I do not think he gets sold this summer.

1538~~~
Most likely Smalling will get injured again when Jones is about to get fit...

1539~~~
hope not I don't want to see McNair playing as CB, rather Thorpe..

1540~~~
Please tell them to save room for rvp and falcao. They all need to go.

1541~~~
If Van Gaal's objective is to have more intelligent players in his squad, then Jones should be among the first ones to be sold.

1542~~~
For me it's already clear since months that he can go in the summer. Really average and so feckin injury-prone.
He and Evans can go.

2 new defenders + Smalling, Rojo and McNair for next season

1543~~~
Interesting, I actually think he's a brilliant prospect. Hope it's not a really serious knee injury, poor fella.

1544~~~
I think there is talent there but Christ on a bike he hasn't progressed at all. He's on borrowed time, get back soon beaker.

1545~~~
In the 3 minutes he played, he managed to feck up twice and get injured. Pretty impressive, even by his standards.

1546~~~
I hope we bought the extended warranty on him.

1547~~~
Marginally more useful than Evans but they've both regressed / stagnated and hopefully will be sold in the summer.

1548~~~
Injuries will be the lads downfall.  I'm sure that given a run in the side and to remain injury free, he would be a very solid CB for us.  Unfortunately, this is never going to happen. Another huge problem with our defence that needs addressing in the summer.

1549~~~
He is completely and utterly woeful and a thorough liability. His injury record is no accident either and last night was a perfect example ie he lost his man and busting a gut to atone he injured himself. There's nothing unlucky about this he is fecking shit end of.

1550~~~
That's stretching the point slightly, don't you think? He's a professional athlete. 'Busting a gut' is in his job description. Him getting injured has nothing to do with his prowess as a defender. It was just one of those things. Hopefully it's not ligament damage.

1551~~~
I don't even understand how he got injured. He was running in a straight line then somehow his leg just buckled underneath him?. That just screams to me muscle fatigue, I don't think his body is fit enough to play at this level unfortunately. His legs/arms must not have any coordination as he always looks unbalanced.

1552~~~
Trouble is he doesn't really run. It's more of an unorthodox gallop, and that combined with a lack of balance makes him highly injury prone.

1553~~~
I could only imagine how this guy would walk out a bar when he is drunk.

1554~~~
I take your point. But my long term issue with Jones is what I would call avoidable injury. Last night he lost his man and quite how I don't know. But it was because he'd lost his man and because he knew that he'd fecked up that in a desperate attempt to make amends he injured himself. I see a a direct correlation between his constant inability to play within himself and with some composure and his propensity for injury. I think we're watching an admittedly hard working footballer who is attempting to play the game at a level above his ability. He is permanently out of his comfort zone and that incident last night was a microcosm of where he is as a footballer and what his level is. If he'd been switched on he wouldn't have lost Keane and he wouldn't have been injured trying to prevent a clear goal scoring opportunity. It's going to happen time and time again because he isn't good enough.

1555~~~
Strange injury. I could have sworn he got injured when he hit his head on the goal post after his duel with Michael Keane.

1556~~~
I very much doubt he will be sold. If anything he's ahead of Smalling in the pecking order

1557~~~
There was this replay that showed that his ankle/foot/whatever bent in an unnatural way and he was limping after that. He can't walk like a human being sadly.

Type of a guy that will slip 9 out of 10 times on a slippery pavement in winter.

1558~~~
Yeah on watching replays of the incident, you could see his foot bend. Still, it looks like he did fall onto the goal post after the ball went out. Glad to know he didn't get a head injury in the end.

1559~~~
Oh dear "car crash" Jones could be out for a while. Might help him get his positioning right for the future instead of getting there just in time.

1560~~~
a if that would be a bother

1561~~~
Definitely turned his ankle on the replay. Which is why it's strange that Van Gaal is talking about a knee injury.

1562~~~
I dont have anything else to say that hasnt been said before.
But this guy is made of glass and his body is not suited to playing football.
At this age, to be getting injured without any contact, shows that his body is not built or suited for football.

Yep. He just doesnt know how to handle/manoeuvre his body.

1563~~~
I think it would be a mistake to keep him and sell Smalling.

1564~~~
After hearing he had a knee injury, I feared the worst, but Van Gaal has confirmed he's back tomorrow which is good news.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Feb/manchester-united-team-news-for-swansea-away-match.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...-united-team-news-for-swansea-away-match.aspx</a>

1565~~~
Great news, massive bonus for us.

1566~~~
I think it would be a big mistake to sell either.

Its not like we're going to have a million English players in the coming seasons - Carrick in his final years, Rooney hitting 30.

And the biggest question mark is whether Jones can stay fit, and Smalling has had his own fitness problems this season.

The obvious solution is to keep both of them so one is likely to be available if the other isnt fit.

Maybe they wont be the CB pairing we hoped for, but between them they can obviously, clearly fill 1 spot.

1567~~~
That's great news.

1568~~~
I personally barely trust either of them fitness-wise and Jones just seems to be learning nothing as regards using his brains. I'd be fine with 2 new CB's in to compete with Smalling and Rojo. If we want an English CB then we should monitor the progression of John Stones, who I know you aren't sold on but I think will become the next top English CB.

1569~~~
Wonder how long he will last this aft?

1570~~~

1571~~~
He does not deserve to start over Smalling or Rojo. Bench him.

1572~~~
Still young, he has to cut out his rashness, brainfarts and positioning sense (not 3 minor things) but other than that he's class.

1573~~~
Well Smalling, nor Rojo, have exactly that convincing since Jones got injured, but I guess they escape the criticism Jones gets. 

With Jones back, it should hopefully boost up Smalling's performances, as he'll know Jones will be waiting in the wings, if his form drops. 

Good to have healthy competition.

1574~~~
at what? i can't see class in any of our cb's. rojo is good , possibly good enough but i wouldn't say class at anything yet and he's the class of the bunch. rojo might be the only one left at the start of the season if LVG wants to compete.

1575~~~
Very strong, very fast, good in the air, good in the tackle, positive on the ball and wins most of his 1 vs 1, dont think Rojo is any better.

1576~~~
Rojo should be the first centre back on the teamsheet. Jones/Smalling are much of a muchness. Both have some ability, including an ability to balls things up for us.

1577~~~
Starting today, which is a surprise, although like I said, Smalling wasn't very convincing in his absence, despite his two goals vs Burnley. 

Maybe Van Gaal does prefer Jones over Smalling.

1578~~~
Starts ahead of Smalling which surprises me. Hope he does well.

1579~~~
so we are looking at mostly his physical side which is a plus. none of which measures class for a defender. those are characteristics in most cb's (well evans is a big girls blouse). the other things you mentioned are what we need across the board with all of them. rojo is better IMO and in his first season in a new league is doing ok not great.

1580~~~
Thank Christ someone has said this. This is my major issue when I hear people 'bigging' up Jones. People do realise Ryan Shawcross can do all that 'diving in' shite too?

1581~~~
wait till i walk (or wan4) on water - it's only a few inches deep but no fuc4er ever notices.

1582~~~
I think it's clear he does.

1583~~~
Looks like LVG rates him highly. Every time he was fit he came straight in the team, even if the others have done well playing in his place.

1584~~~
The guy has no brain what so ever, stupid yellow. Also for their goal, if you watch it, its actually down to his error. He is standing in no mans land doing nothing, he is supposed to be a central defender. You either close down the cross, which admittedly was difficult to do from his position or you actually defend, he did neither. He has to either take a better position from the start to stop the cross, which isn't really his role, or as a central defender he has to be in the 6 yard to penalty spot area looking to cut out whatever is coming in.

Instead he stands in no mans land doing nothing and leaves a 3 vs 2 situation in the 6 yard area. And yes Shaw should have been goal side of his man, but it should never have got to that stage to begin with.

And just oh my god, he always has to pass it backwards or an aimless hoof! WHY!!!!!

1585~~~
Supposed to be a great passer of the ball. I'd rather keep Smalling than Jones.

1586~~~
He had a couple of good interceptions but was overall a bit clumsy, he just doesn't inspire any confidence.

1587~~~
Rojo was a disaster today, yet people will go through the slightest of detail to try and scapegoat Jones - again. Pathetic!

1588~~~
Tell you what, go back watch their goal, and then come back and honestly tell me thats where you want your central defender to be, who also happens to be one of your tallest players on the pitch.

1589~~~
We have so many poor central defenders, it's laughable really.

1590~~~
You are having a laugh Bojan

1591~~~
Oafish today.

1592~~~
Tell you what, go to the Rojo thread and tell me why there's only one comment, in regards to his performance when he was poorer than Jones today, and should have most likely been tucked in a lot more for their first goal.

Also, my last post wasn't just basing off one game, Jones has been fecking scapegoated all fecking season, whilst others get off lightly. See Rojo thread. Its BS!

1593~~~
Sorry, I meant I'd rather have Smalling than Jones. The game has fecked with my head.

1594~~~
Surprised he started over Smalling. Not liek he made any extravagant passes that puts him in the side over Smalling today.

1595~~~
Thought that was strange as your usually sensible

1596~~~
When the ball comes within 10 metres of him, either in possession or not, this is all I see inside his head.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://media.giphy.com/media/k5cnWfaRTPgze/giphy.gif" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/k5cnWfaRTPgze/giphy.gif"/> 
I'm sorry, I really want him to make it here but he just doesn't have a football brain. He is one step away from doing his ACL too.

1597~~~
This is the sort of thing that Smalling (rightly) has been criticised for in the past and yet Jones isn't any better in my opinion. Also, Smalling is quicker, better in the air and is less prone to making rash decisions. Him and Rojo should be first choice.

1598~~~
Smalling will see a player, weigh up the option and decide accordingly, same with Evans. Obviously ability and execution then come into play which is another story. But with Jones, he will look up, see two options, one is a player in space, the other is a player with 3 defenders around him and he will dink him a ball.

He has the tools but he just isn't getting smarter. He is young (I think a lot forget just how young he is) and I'll give him time but sadly my patience is running out.

1599~~~
I agree, sad to say that it's got to the stage with him that pretty much everything he does puts me on edge.

Blasting the ball into touch, giving away pointless freekicks when the player is going nowhere, rashly diving into challenges, hoofing the ball forward or nearly worse constantly playing it back to put us under pressure, oh I don't know sadly the guy seems to be completely clueless as a footballer.

1600~~~
Scott Parker

I'd struggle to trust the guy to tell me the right time of day, let alone be a defender for Manchester United

Prefer Smalling....And that ain't saying much

1601~~~
Jones just isn't up to it...He's like a young Evans coming through -  a very handy squad player to have in the team but nothing more than ...Van Gaal must be kicking himself for failing to land an experienced central defender in the summer and it's about to cost us a top 4 spot

1602~~~
Embarrassing that when he first signed people were comparing him to Duncan Edwards and Bryan Robson. This lad will never reach those qualities because he's not up for it. His marking on corners is terrible and his positional awareness is horrible.

1603~~~
He's a liability in my opinion. I think some of us think he's new, learning still etc etc, but he's been with us for a while now - he should be far more reliable than he is.  He's positioning is terrible, he has no thought process when with the ball and he seems to the person most likely to give away a pen each game. 

He may go in the summer - and I think he should. Rojo has shown more this season than jones has for the past 2. Even Smalling has gotten better during this season. 

Jones just hasn't reached the heights we all once thought. The risk of building a player up before they've delivered. I think another season will be generous to him.

1604~~~
Both Jones and Rojo have been as bad each other.

Yeah, people like Sir Bobby. How dare he!

1605~~~
Young player struggling to reach his gargantuan expectations at one of the biggest clubs in the world. Shock horror.

Give him a fecking break.

1606~~~
He's a long way from the ball for the first goal.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/21/25E8D78900000578-2962915-image-a-105_1424533912557.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/21/25E8D78900000578-2962915-image-a-105_1424533912557.jpg"/>

1607~~~
I agree with the fact that after 2 years here, he doesn't seem to have developed.

If you're good enough, your old enough. Varane is 21 and plays at Madrid and is constantly linked with us. If he came, presumably he'd replace 23 yr old Phil Jones.

1608~~~
I've said this in previous threads, he and Smalling had the best two CB to learn from for years. It now looks like neither of them paid enough attention to rio and Vidic - or they did but they aren't half the defenders they were. Either way we need to rectify that problem far sooner than spending 100+ million on a flash MF or forward. 

Whether it's 3-5-2 or 4-4-2, if you don't have the defenders in the team no formation will properly work.

1609~~~
He has seriously stagnated, if not regressed. We need an upgrade on Jones in the summer. I don't mind keeping him as a squad player as he's still young but he can't be a starter. He just seems so utterly clueless and cumbersome.

1610~~~
They didn't develop as expected because they played only a handful of games at centre half under Ferguson's catalogue of mismanagement in his later years. 

They don't learn from Rio and Vidic by simply watching, they learn the game by getting time on the pitch. I'm critical of Jones as I don't think he has the innate positioning great centre halves inherently have, but he was woefully managed at the most crucial stage of his development and he pays the price for that now. Smalling, to a degree, has too.

1611~~~
It'd be incredibly naive to think that Jones hasn't improved since he came here. He may not have improved in the areas posters wanted or even in the best areas for a CB, but he clearly improved how often he wins the ball and he improved on the ball in a midfield role.

He still needs to improve his concentration and cut out the mistakes on and off the ball. Thats what will make or break him as a CB, but he's still got a bit more time to show he can do it. Its frustrating that he hasnt rectified that and it may turn out that he never does, but it doesn't mean he hasnt improved. Thats a silly thought.

1612~~~
He's only 23. Easy to forget seeing as we signed him so young.

I'd say he's a couple of years off being properly consistent.

1613~~~
The same Sir Bobby who didn't want us to appoint mourinho. Ex players do have a habit of talking nonsense.

1614~~~
Hes just turned 23, thats no age for a CB.

1615~~~
Maybe so but I'd say on the whole, the majority of the posters on here aren't old enough to know whether the said comparison is valid or not.

1616~~~
He just has this knack of knocking into his own team mates during games.

1617~~~
Yeah but

A) He's too injury-prone. How many times was he subbed of due injury in the first 60 minutes??? I don't know but my feeling is it's too often!!!

B) Has he really improved so much since we've signed him???

Only one of Jones or Smalling can stay. One must go with Evans.

1618~~~
Agree with you, but for what they produce this season, I'm not sure that in term of quality and production this season, Rojo was far better than one of Smalling and Jones. 

I agree that we have to get rid of Evans and one of Jones/Smalling, but I can't trust Rojo to be first choice CB.

1619~~~
I would sign two new CB's + Jones/Smalling + Rojo + McNair

On Jones and Smalling.....it depends who plays better and can stay fit til the end of the season

1620~~~
If we don't have CL next year I guess that only Evans will leave

1621~~~
The new two CB's then wouldn't be for sure Hummels and Laporte.......instead Mexes and Reid <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1622~~~
um , here's one for you. titus bramble was once 23 and never got rid of the mental mistakes. had speed and heading ability and could clear a ball. but at 25 and older he was still thick!

1623~~~
Is 23 the new 30?

1624~~~
no but stupid is as stupid does. he needs to get smart until then age means fuc4all. rather a smart 30 yr old than a thick 23 yr old.

1625~~~
This post is odd. How do you gain experience?

1626~~~
by playing. how do you get smart? that is by thinking. if he just plays then he'll be titus bramble if he plays and starts to use his head he may be a player until then he is a mistake waiting to happen.

1627~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> wtf are you talking about. It's as if Jones chooses to be stupid and not smart.

1628~~~
by learning to position himself on the pitch like a cb. he has all the physical traits needed for a cb. i don't think it's a choice , i hope it's because he's 23. but as i posted titus bramble was 23 once and was never smart enough to play up to his physical ability/potential.

1629~~~
I'm struggling to understand what you mean. You become smart by thinking? Do you think a player knows everything by the age of 23?

1630~~~
The only way to get smart for a player is to get a good coach with the right words to help him during training and matches and experience too. Every player has a limit when it comes to footballing intelligence, maybe Jones will never be the type of player we want him to be or maybe he will. The only thing I am sure of is that he tries his best (to think) and at times it's just not good enough. It's not as if he chooses deliberately to position himself badly or have these off moments.

1631~~~
TBF the club doesn't have a decent Centre Back, Smalling is probably the best.

1632~~~
never meant to have it come across as he's thinking to himself " I think I'll fuc4 up a header here". it's my fear  he'll be titus bramble.

1633~~~
I've always liked Bramble, in some matches he was a real beast but in others ...

1634~~~
Jones has stagnated.  He actually started out the season looking the part, but since he returned from his injury he's looked woeful, if not dire.

I'm torn on who between Smalling and Jones I would let go, assuming the obvious acquisition of a top CB this summer.  The case for either being retained as a squad man is actually pretty strong.  I'd give the edge to Smalling.  

And, without any question, Evans is done as a United man.  Enough is enough.

1635~~~
a mentalist

always could count on him to hang a leg for a peno.

1636~~~
Are we sure it Sir Bobby who nixed the appointment of Mourinho?  I've read it here on the caf before but have never seen it anywhere else.

Someone obviously nixed it, as it is well known Mourinho was desperate to manage United.  WE caftards were desperate for Mourinho to manage United.  But instead someone on the board authorized the appointment of Moyes.

If that's not an occasion for a Picardian facepalm I don't know what is!

1637~~~
But was he better than Zidane?

1638~~~
I don't know if this is genuine criticism at Jones for the goal, but it really wasn't Jones at fault. The shape of the entire team from that throw in is an absolute mess. Jones (or anyone) had to be in that channel incase the throw in was played short and Routledge got in behind McNair, which was very possible as McNair was having a mare. Instead, Shelvey was given all the time in the world to play in a cross. Blind has dropped in whilst Jones covers the channel.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i60.tinypic.com/2zsbf5x.jpg" src="http://i60.tinypic.com/2zsbf5x.jpg"/> 

Herrera really should have been closer to Shelvey, and perhaps Fellaini should have dropped in to that channel as well, as it's wide open. After that, it's Shaw at fault for losing Ki so easily.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i58.tinypic.com/kew6ip.jpg" src="http://i58.tinypic.com/kew6ip.jpg"/> 
From being marked and Shaw being goal side...
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i61.tinypic.com/qnticj.jpg" src="http://i61.tinypic.com/qnticj.jpg"/> 
...to Ki getting the right side of Shaw and finishing nicely.

To be fair, it's a great cross, and Ki's run and finish were superb. Herrera and Shaw should have done better though. The cross was avoidable if Shelvey wasn't given a fortnight to pick out his ball. Ki's run could have tracked better. Shaw should be first to that all day long to smash it out for a throw or even a corner.

1639~~~
in every photo he's out of position. marking what channel for whom to run into , our keeper? you keep mentioning other players getting tight he's a cb and he tight on the stuff growing under his feet that's about all. he has moved a total of 3 feet from purple head getting the ball and the cross coming in. if he ran and hadn't walked maybe he blocks that channel the ball went through.

1640~~~
Someone needs to be in the channel. If that throw in is played to Routledge and he knocks it past McNair, he's got an enormous space to run into with the ball. A defender being in that space makes that option less viable. If it's not Jones in that channel then it needs to be someone else. Blind has dropped in for Jones, as you'd expect a defensive midfielder to be alert to. That happens all the time. The spaces between central players and full backs have to be manned, or the space needs to be reduced by players dropping in. It's just basic.

Herrera gets nowhere near his man, Shaw was goal side and then lets his man waltz right by. Jones' fault?

1641~~~
The ideal thing to happen in that situation (and it would have with better communication <b>earlier) </b>was for Jones to pick up McNair's man and tell McNair to pressure the thrower and Herrera to get tight to Shelvy. 

As it was, most of the blame can be attributed to Herrera there who went to the thrower and left Shelvy with acres of time and space to cross. If Herrera closes down Shelvy both Shelvy and McNair's man either have to try and get the ball back to the thrower under pressure or hold up the ball which gives the central defence vital seconds to organise themselves.

1642~~~
He definitely was at certain things.

1643~~~
I hadn't watched the game and came into the thread post match and expected some sort of horror performance from this reaction. Having just watched it, I can only think of one thing he actually did bad and that was a poor back pass that went for a corner.

To blame him for the goal is moronic, anyone who gets into the space Jones is in has a far better chance of creating a scoring opportunity than Jonjo whipping one in from deep. It was slack from Herrera, but the cross was telegraphed and everyone in the middle was marked up. If Smalling was where Jones was, would we seriously be having any debate? The amount of biased, agenda driven half wits in this thread is completely absurd, I really am genuinely surprised that no one had blamed him for the 2nd goal either, the lengths some posters go to in order to perceive his performance as poor. 

Honestly, the amount of drivel in this section of the forum astounds me with each passing game.

1644~~~
This. Unfortunately, it looks like Jones is the scapegoat this season.

1645~~~
Jones is young but he has plenty of experience, over 150 games for Blackburn and United, which is an average of over 30 games a season with premier league clubs since he was 18. At this point he should be coming into his prime. He looked special when he first arrived at United as a 19-year-old and I would have predicted him to be one of the mainstays of the team by now. Hope he can emerge soon as the first choice player and leader that we expected.

1646~~~
Don't think he was to blame for the smash and grab Swansea had against us but I still think he's behind Smalling.

1647~~~
This. I don't rate Jones that highly, but some are overly critical in their analysis of him. He's still behind Smalling (and should be dropped for him) but I don't think the Swansea match was that bad of a performance.

1648~~~
I think Rojo plays much better alongside Smalling. He's a calming influence. Jones and Rojo are too similar.

1649~~~
Without wanting to start a whole debate about it, I feel some are criticising Jones simply because he is playing ahead of Smalling. I'm not saying that's the right or wrong choice just that he us getting criticised for not actually doing much wrong.

1650~~~
To be clear, I posted the photo merely as a discussion point. I wasn't criticising him, merely pointing out that the CB is a long way away from where it's all happening.

I take 2DaSilvas point though - thanks for posting up the other photos. It does seem like as a team, defensively, they seem to suffer from the odd huge collective brain fart. That said, we have a decent enough defensive record over the past couple of months and I'd say our creativity and scoring is probably more of a problem. However, my view that Jones hasn't progressed as one would hope remains. Whether that's Ferguson's fault as one poster suggested, is open for debate. The fact is that to date he hasn't lived up to his potential.

We do need a leader in defence though - all our defenders would benefit from having an experienced CB to marshal them. I am not sure Hummels is that guy though.

1651~~~
I'd agree with you if they were all 21 year olds which is not the case. Evans in 27, Jones is 23, Smalling is 25 and Rafael is 24. All these defenders have been at United for a number of years, they have played with some of the best defenders in the world and have CL experience. In football terms they are veterans. Let put things into perspective. Rio was merely 24 when he singlehandedly sorted our defense, Gaz was around 21 years of age when he became first teamer with us while Stam was around Smalling age when we won the treble. Mind I am avoiding the child prodigies, players like Maldini or Baresi who were absolutely brilliant at a very young age.

Now if we're aiming for a world class defender capable of carrying the rest (just as Rio did with Mickey and Wes Brown) then yeah that's the right strategy to use. However I believe that United deserves better then that.

1652~~~
He's absolutely awful. A defender who brings nothing but panic and confusion to a defence. Constantly out of position, poor in the air, consistent lapses of concentration, no organisational skills...average average average.

Him and Rojo are a defensive partnership made in hell.

1653~~~
He's a brainless player who's simply too impulsive. After watching him against Swansea I wonder if now he's in a different phase, from over impulsive to the point of being an injury threat to himself to over timid because he really played within himself.

1654~~~
Never got the massive Jones overrating on here. When we bought him from Blackburn I wasn't particularly happy as I didn't rate him when he was there. He just looks constantly clueless and I've completely lost faith in him. His only saving grave is the fact that he's only 23. On that basis alone, I would keep him on as a squad player for another season, anyway. He can't be a starter here next season.

1655~~~
Problem is for me a centre back needs to have one of several attributes to work in a partnership at the top level (preferrably alongside a player with the other attributes): 
- Incredible positional sense and organisational skills: The stereotyped Italian-style defender. Always in the right place, barely have to make tackles. Own the offside line, and make others better with good communications. 
- Physical monster: The 'Vidic' model of player - wins 90% of balls in the air, attackers are terrified of him and he can clatter players fairly and without breaking himself. 
- Speed merchant: Can make up for mistakes with outrageous pace, more of a requirement for full backs but never hurts for a CB
- Mr Reliable: Maybe not an 8/10 player, but delivers 40 7/10 performances in a season. Can build around him because you know he'll be there. 

We've had all types of defenders over the years, but they've always pretty much fallen into one of those categories (or more, like Rio). Jones just isn't that good at anything. He's short, disorganised, rash and can't play 3 matches in a row. 

It sucks but we'd do well to get rid if someone is after him. I just don't see the potential for him to 'become' world class. He's not that young anymore, has been in the same setup for almost 5 years and really hasn't improved at all.

1656~~~
Jones is strong in the air, has great pace, intercepts a lot of passes and is physically strong. Completely unfair to say he is not good at anything.

1657~~~
I'm not a huge Jones fan but I agree with some of this. He is definitely quick, fast enough to recover from bad positioning anyway. Not sure I'd classify him as "strong in the air" IMO he is weak for a CB at that. He is physically strong though.

1658~~~
He's crap in the air. He also spends 90% of the match out of position. 

He's fast, and strong, I'll give him that.

1659~~~
In terms of winning headers he's not fantastic but you'll rarely see his man have a free header, he's incredibly good at dealing with crosses into our box. Also, it's his awareness of diagonal runners in behind him that's the problem regarding positioning, apart from that it is usually spot on. He never gets credit for how good he is in 1v1 situations either, very rarely gets skinned.

1660~~~
He really, really isn't. Infact, I'd say that is the main issue with a Jones/Rojo partnership. Neither are particularity good at dealing with crosses. The Swansea match showed that up quite considerably. Thats why Smalling should be in there for now, he's far from perfect himself, but he's generally very good at dealing with high balls.

As for being 'spot on' with his positioning, I couldn't disagree more. He's constantly running out of position chasing the ball, or switching off. He plays like a 12 year old playing Sunday league just running aimlessly around the pitch. Go and watch a video of Rio/Vidic/Terry etc etc, they very rarely get dragged around the pitch towards the ball, in the way Jones does.

1661~~~
Those are arguably the three best CBs in the history of the PL. Of course Jones positioning is not as strong as those three.

1662~~~
Obviously I'm not expecting it to be as good as that ilk of player, but constantly getting dragged around the pitch or drawn towards the ball is so amateurish, and something that top defenders don't do.

1663~~~
His age shouldnt even matter. He's been a first team player since he was 18. Thats 5 years,  155 games and he still hasn't learned much. Varane, Laporte and Marquinhos are younger and much better.

1664~~~
Better than all our defenders.

1665~~~
Yeah it's really the only defence I can find for him. I was talking about keeping him on as a squad player but I certainly wouldn't care if he left.

1667~~~
You'll very very rarely see Jones lose his man in the box, some of his diving headers when he's facing his own goal and his tracking of runners towards the front post is brilliant. It's fine to say Smalling is better because he's tall and wins aerial duels, but it was only the other game where he lost Danny Ings. I understand what you're saying, that we don't get the ball clear effectively when balls are floated into the box from deep, but my point was more towards dangerous whipped in crosses from the wings.

Let's not exaggerate, and let's give him credit because in terms of getting tight to his man and winning the ball he's very, very good. The problem is that his decision making in that situation is sometimes poor because he believes he can win every ball and that's also where his awareness of what's behind him comes into play. That's something that he'll have to learn through experience, and he's got plenty of time yet.

1668~~~
It worries me that he is seen undroppable by LVG.

1669~~~
He will need to stay fit though... all those injuries didnt help his development. 

I like Phil Jones, as a foreigner he looks like a typical English guy to me. He's big, strong, and he doesnt look that smart (most English people of his age i see are from the MTV program Geordie Shore though...) I dont want him to leave the club but if he cant stay fit he may have to leave. Hopefully he can overcome his injury problems because i still think he has what it takes to be a good central defender. People forget he's still young for a central defender.

1670~~~
in his defense, he played a lot of those matches in midfield or at right back.

1671~~~
That's a poor excuse. He played more games in his natural position.

1672~~~
Stat's don't tell the whole story but.......

1673~~~
The stat is probably a bit misleading. He was playing a lot early on when we really struggled and I don't think that was down to him necessarily. Having said that, clearly the team performs better with Smalling. Hopefully he is back against Sunderland but I think it will be Jones.

1674~~~
In this case tells the whole story

We have a pub team defence

1675~~~
I think that you have been spending too much time in the pib!

1676~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1677~~~
The 31% will include the Burnley home game as well when he went off after five minutes!

1678~~~
For me, it says more than enough to me. He is the kind of player who plays a style that is totally inappropriate for a team that aspires to be at the top in a specific era.

1679~~~
Am I the only one who thinks he was the better player in his first two seasons? I think the majority genuinely tought he could become one of the greatest defenders in the PL, 19 year and putting in such performances. Playing him out of position, injuries have really had a negative effect.

1680~~~
At best, he's stagnated, at worst, he's regressed.

1681~~~
I'd go as far as to say just his first season. Right at the beginning, I think it was against Bolton away, where he looked so so good at right back. Set up at least one goal.

The early period of that season was so exciting. Felt like we had some serious serious potential.

1682~~~
I still think his performances in midfield have been far better then in central defence. Heck, I think even his performances at right back have been better.

In midfield he gets to do the things he's good as, use his pace and strength to run around like a mad man to get into the opposition, winning back the ball, and generally just being a pain in the ass for opponents. He also gets to utilise those driving runs he occasionally does (we've seen less and less of them in recent times). Plus it (somewhat) masks his problem areas too, i.e lack of positional sense, lapses of concentration, vulnerability to high balls. Obviously for games at home against weaker opposition thats not really going to be needed, but for the tougher games I'd much rather see Jones playing that 'destroyer' role in a midfield 3, then marshaling the defence at the heart of a back 4.

1683~~~
There's an interview up where he talks about enjoying the partnership with Rojo, but I just can't see that having any long term potential, you can't have two loose cannon style CB's together.

1684~~~
Pepe-Ramos?

1685~~~
It's not a good partnership IMO. Give me Smalling next to Rojo any day.

1686~~~
Pepe is similar to both but Ramos is not, yes he picks up a lot of cards because he's got a dirty streak, but he's commanding and positionally very good, he's not prone to lapses in concentration or flat out brainfarts.

1687~~~
I think we need some fresh blood at CB but for the rest of this season the Smojo partnership would definitely be my first choice.

1688~~~
I'd like to see a run in off Smalling and Rojo. Evans can go and Jones looks more and more like a poor mans John O'shea. Good squad player but nothing more but the difference being O'shea could play equally well in left or right side so was such a specialist squad player and a great fall back sub.

1689~~~
The difference was that O'Shea might not have been as psychically gifted as Jones but he was consistent and reliable, not prone to stupid brain farts that coughed up dangerous chances every match.

1690~~~
Hard to disagree with any that Devil

1691~~~
He's worse than Silvestre and Blanc.

1692~~~
He is a joke, pub team footballer

1693~~~
I liked when he brought the ball forward to get the handball. Moments like that are why managers tend to rate him.

1694~~~
Shit for brains, there's no way we can continue with both this guy and Smalling, we need a boss for that back 4 no matter what in the summer.

1695~~~
He's so reckless in his defending. He charges out to make interceptions (which work sometimes) but the other half the time he gets caught out and leaves space in behind. An all-or-nothing type defender.

1696~~~
Bombscare of a player

1697~~~
The next Prunier

1698~~~
There was a moment he was thinking of charging out or running back. Did neither and Sanchez was through.

He's a joke of a footballer.

1699~~~
Anyone know why he decided to give it to Valencia?

1700~~~
Did fine when he come on today, but I can't say I'm surprised at the comments.

1701~~~
Because Van Gaal encourages his defenders to take it down if they can, which allow us to keep possession, as opposed to heading it back out and possibly losing it.

Jones did nothing wrong. Valencia was at fault.

1702~~~
Thought he was fine today. Had a pretty good game going forward in fact.

1703~~~
He was fairly good today after he came on.

This.

And Maybe De Gea should have risked sacrificing himself.

1704~~~
He wasn't bad today and I'm not saying it's his fault, but it looks like every time he plays our other defenders play like shit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1705~~~
Our win percentage when he's in the team is awful.

1706~~~
I'm not sure giving it to Valencia would help us keep possession when de Gea would have just kicked it back out. It was just a dumb decision from him and a really shite pass from Valencia. Valencia probably panicked because it was such an odd decision to do that with an Arsenal player right behind him.

1707~~~
One of our few players who played with urgency. Showed a bit of leadership too.

1708~~~
Why should De Gea get a red? I rather lose a goal than a red card. Even though we got a red later on. Plus we need DDG in the next month, I'm chuffed he did nothing crazy.

1709~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/david-de-gea-2014-2015-performances.394335/page-79#post-17208745">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/david-de-gea-2014-2015-performances.394335/page-79#post-17208745</a>

Elaborated here.

1710~~~
Did well, fairly puzzled by the comments in here.

1711~~~
If Valencia played a better ball back to De Gea and our centre backs split, we probably would have played it out from the back. We were doing it all game. If not, then it would have been kicked out by De Gea, but more in a controlled manner than if Jones headed it out.

1712~~~
SAF's quotes about Phil seem laughable reading them back now.

1713~~~
In the last two games he's played, he's been blamed for a perfectly reasonable decision to control the ball to Valencia, and for not bounding into the middle to cut out a cross whipped in to the other side of the goal. I wonder if people actually watch the games, or it just registered that Phil Jones has played again so they need to repeat the same inaccurate comments from the last game he played. The more advanced managed to catch the highlights and go out of their way to find a way to portray a goal we've conceded as his fault.

1714~~~
He was more than in his right to control the ball and pass it to Valencia.

1715~~~
He's a bombscare waiting to happen. He should of just cleared that rather than try to give it to Valencia.

Phil Jones previously looked alright for us when partnered with someone like Vidic or Ferdinand, which is slowly becoming obvious that all our current Cbs only looked good because of this

1716~~~
Which is an almighty cluster-feck that has ruined our last two seasons.

1717~~~
It is ridiculous. Van Gaal's philosophy and Guardiola's philosophy that evolved out of that involves the defenders playing ball, even under a high press, this isn't a secret.

Jones put Valencia in a position where he had to make a simple pass and Valencia failed to do that. I am not sure why Jones is being blamed for that. It is entirely Valencia's fault in this system. If the team is under instructions to clear their lines or 'if in doubt, play it out' then fair enough but that is not how we play football under Van Gaal, besides should Jones even be in doubt that Valencia could make that pass?

It was interesting to see the much lauded Varane play a suicidal back pass under little pressure last night, a worse mistake than I have seen Jones make all season. I am sure that Varane did this earlier in the season too. He is also supposed to have been atrocious in the 4-0 defeat against A Madrid.

I think the game is a lot harder for defenders these days and we are so quick to write them off if they don't play the perfect game. I think that we are guilty of a lack of perspective. The non contact, high pressing and faster game that is evolving does not benefit defenders at all. Highly critical and statistic armed fans compound that too.

1718~~~
Just brings complete frenzy and chaos to the defence. Which is a shame because he does have some good attributes, quick, strong in tackle and decent in the air. But has managed to not improve or actually get worse since his first season.

1719~~~

1720~~~
God I hope he's got rid of.....I never even rolled my eyes at Bebe this much.

When he came on against Arsenal, Smalling went from being calm and composed to being a complete donkey.......The guy just cannot be trusted at all

1721~~~
How is it Jones' fault that Smalling started to play like crap?

1722~~~
You telling me that you haven't noticed how much more nervous our defence is when Jones is there?! 

If not, watch the next time he starts

1723~~~
Smalling looked like a donkey from minute one lol, stop making excuses for him.

1724~~~
I'm not really a fan of Jones, and think Smalling is the better defender, but Smalling was clearly just off his game against Arsenal. It's games like this that he needs to cut out if he's to be a long-term fixture. As for Jones, the positive to take away at this point is that he's still young. I'm not optimistic, but you never know.

1725~~~
This boy can't play a simple pass <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1726~~~
Seriously. Can we sell him yet?! This is fecking embarrassing watching this lad play for us.

1727~~~
Imagine if that went in after Valencia's bungle in the last match,  would have been absurd

1728~~~
I don't understand, McNair or Blackett are 100 times better than him.

1729~~~
Shush, don't be silly mate. McNair is terrible compared to the mighty Jones. How could a lad from N.Ireland match England's great hope?

1730~~~
Idiot

1731~~~
There must be somebody who can make a video of all the suicidal passes we've tried this season. Evans, Jones, Blind and Smalling must've done half a dozen each. Not to mention McNair and Valencia.

1732~~~
To be fair he's improved as the game has went on. Still can't be forgotten he could have cost us a goal early on quite easily. Liability but thankfully he's doing a better job now.

1733~~~
Started like a bundle of nerves but has been fine since

1734~~~
He's been one of our best players today you gimps.

1735~~~
Since the backpass he has not let Spurs get a sniff. Great match for all of the defense so far.

1736~~~
Take it you missed his whoppers early on?

1737~~~
Looked nervy being pressed on his weaker foot but had grown into the game well.

1738~~~
Looks a lot better next to Smalling than he does with Rojo imo.

1739~~~
You really think many would give him a chance to recover after a nervous opening 90 secounds.

1740~~~
Yeah but if you forget them and only focus on the good bits....

1741~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/75vph68v9og?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Phil Jonesesque on  55 seconds.

1742~~~
I think Smalling Jones is our best partnership still.

1743~~~
Yup and I always have done

1744~~~
He's been pretty good overall today except that 1 backpass.

1745~~~
His passing seems to have regressed but he clearly has potential to be great. Still plenty of time for him to improve although it might be better if we swapped Smalling to the left and Jones to his preferred right side.

1746~~~
2 minutes > 44 minutes

1747~~~
And I am, hence my post towards the end of the first half saying he had improved.

Still can't be having a centre back playing like that at the start of matches though.

1748~~~
Isn't that basically the case for every single one of Jones, Rojo and Evans?

1749~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Some short memories. Blackett has legitimately been awful after his first couple of games and not long ago, McNair was getting hauled off before HT vs Soton.

1750~~~
He is the biggest worry in the back IMO.

1751~~~
I still think Smalling / Rojo is our best partnership

1752~~~
Definitely is for the first two anyway imo, mainly because they're too similar to be a great partnership.

1753~~~
Been decent since his errors. 

But still don't think he's good enough though.

1754~~~
Apart from his sloppy pass back to De Gea, he's been solid.

1755~~~
Means feck all if he cost us a goal in those two minutes (Valencia against Arsenal comes to mind). Don't even try to suggest to me it's irrelevant. He'll be a liability until he stops that nonsense.

1756~~~
Every time he gets the ball in our own final third, he immediately looks to De Gea to see if the back pass is on.

1757~~~
Very impressive 2nd half. Well done Jones and Smalling today

Stay fit

1758~~~
Dominated the match after the brain fart early on.

1759~~~
Wonder what the kneejerkers will say? He was very good, and is probably our best CB after Smalling.

1760~~~
Agreed. Made some very decisive tackles, especially towards the end when Spurs were pressing for a consolation goal. I thought he and Smalling dealt with Kane very well.

1761~~~
While he did get his shit together after that early brain fart, he's never going to be the centreback we need. He's rash, reactive and isn't consistently comfortable on the ball. He just doesn't instill any confidence in the players ahead of him.

1762~~~
After a shaky first five minutes, he grew into the game and showed great composure.

1763~~~
They will keep quiet and then destroy him again next time he gives the ball away

1764~~~
Doesnt matter if we're a goal down in the first 5 minutes because of him. A good 85 minutes changes nothing.

1765~~~
Better in the second half, still a big question mark for me though.

1766~~~
Indeed. He was better today but I'm inclined to agree on the whole.

Still, deserves credit for his defending second half.

1767~~~
Solid. Bullied Kane and co.

1768~~~
He obviously still has mistakes in him but, matches like this show the talent and potential he has as a defender.

1769~~~
Bar his early error he was good today. Still just 22, plenty of time to come good.

1770~~~
He defended impressively in all of his 1v1s.

1771~~~
First three minutes, he was abysmal. The next 87, he was a beast.

1772~~~
It's an overhit backpass. "Young defender who hasn't played much recently in lack of confidence early in game" shocker. It's not like he was all over the show positionally, or anything fundamentally wrong with his play.

1773~~~
Its not like it makes a difference how often he plays. He does things like that most games. It doesnt matter if he plays like Franco Baresi for 89 minutes if hes gifting goals in the other minute.

1774~~~
Impressive in the 2nd half. Those opening few mins were comically inept. Did well to recover.

1775~~~
Played well after shocking start to the game. Still, I've rated him 10 for the game. Didn't have the heart to give anything less to anyone.

1776~~~
He's young and has played half his games in his career in other positions. The odd brainfart can be ironed out of games. It would be interesting if you could give examples of similar, if he does this every game. In fact, I've seen more dodgy stuff from Rojo and Evans this season.

1777~~~
Name he really can't play with a football can he.. But other than that he defended well.. Credit for that. 

Think him and Evans will have a nervous summer though.

1778~~~
Come on man... Every time he plays he ball distribution is rubbish.

1779~~~
Evans will. Van Gaal seems to rate Jones I do not think he is going anywhere.

1780~~~
I missed the first 5 mins (ie. his two mistakes,) so I thought he was very good today. Composed on the ball and generally sound defensively. I can't ask for more.

1781~~~
Best performance in a long while

1782~~~
He played very, very well. Might not be a starter but would make a very capable back up.

1783~~~
Smalling-Evans

1784~~~
Gave us quite a scare with the early back pass but never looked back since and supported Blind with slide tackles that ruined the momentum of their wingers.

1785~~~
That's why I don't want to give up on him. He's made from the right stuff. The opening few minutes were woeful but he dug in and clawed his way back into the game. A lesser man (looking at you, Kyle Walker) would have either hidden or lost his confidence completely and carried on being crap for the rest of the game.

1786~~~
Started watching the match after about ten minutes and I thought he was in beast mode. He certainly needs to iron out the occasional brainfart and he will be well on his way- at 22 he is worth keeping and reassess after eighteen months.

1787~~~
Today apart from the obvious back pass, he was outstanding.  He never pulled out of a challenge, he was strong into every tackle and even read situations well.  He also kept things simple in terms of distribution, which was more than could be said for Smalling, who after running 10 yards with the ball either fell over the ball or couldn't find a red shirt.  An absolute rock today Jones

1788~~~
I'm not his biggest fan, but apart from a few dodgy passes he was on top form tonight. He and Smalling really bossed anything Tottenham had. He read the game well and made some vital 1v1 interceptions, a very good performance.

1789~~~
With the exception of the first couple of minutes he was fantastic today, will rightfully keep his place next week.

1790~~~
I'll let him off those first few minutes because he responded brilliantly and was very solid. Not a huge Phil Jones fan but he did very well.

1791~~~
I think people are seriously under-estimating phils age here. Should give him at least 3 more seasons before we Really give a verdict on him. He has some great qualities about him he just needs to mature in his decision making and be abit more intelligent onthe ball perhaps.

1792~~~
How about the last game he played in? His weird chest pass to Valencia that forced him into an error that cost us a goal and the game.

1793~~~
That early dodgy pass aside, I thought he played well today.

1794~~~
He was decent, but I just dont get the same vibe or confidence watching Jones as I do with Smalling. I wasnt even surprised when he nearly scored an OG in the opening minutes - it just felt like "christ, Jones is at it again...".

I like Jones as a player, but at this point I am not convinced if CB is going to be his best position. I actually thought he did quite well at RB and at DM and personally would not object to seeing him tried in either of those positions again this season.

I think in the summer we should get rid of Evans and buy in a new CB, keeping Jones and Smalling.

1795~~~
Well then it will be Smalling that has to go with Evans, we cannot sit around 3 seasons while two error prone CB's complete on the job training, we need better in place to cover up for one of them while they learn.

1796~~~
Weird chest pass?! Forced him into an error?! Do you think if you received the ball you'd have been able to divert it back to De Gea? I know I could, Valencia is a footballer at the highest level.

1797~~~
I didnt say Valencia wasnt at fault, but it was a hospital pass in the first place by Jones.

1798~~~
I would give Jones and Smalling a run as a pair now.

1799~~~
Still don’t get why so many (<i>on here</i>) underrate Jones but overrate Smalling. Both are good players, but if any player will stay out of the two I feel it will be Jones.

1800~~~
The reason our defenders have looked so bad over the last 18 months or so is due to the non-existent midfield, in front of them. Yesterday, we attacked and defended like a team, and never allowed any of our defenders to be isolated against an opposition player. Both Smalling and Jones are good defenders with a different set of attributes which compliment each other and have suffered, at times, from the lack of a midfield. Put a competent pair of midfielders, with a leader, in front of them, and they're able to dominate the most in-form striker in the league.

1801~~~
well in that first 2:45 jones was headless. the downside is that he does that in almost every game. TBF after that they both played very well. just think that united could let evans (ffs lets hope) , jones and/or smalling go without fear of hurting the team this summer with 2 better cb's coming in..

1802~~~
I agree. I think the thing that would have concerned Van Gaal about the defensive performance was some of the absurdly bad passing that Smalling did. It was reminiscent of that infamous Bebe performance. I mean one pass missed target by about 20 yards!

I am not sure that Smalling can overcome that level of deficiency. 

Jones's issues are much more correctable and should improve naturally with age and experience anyway.

1803~~~
I thought he defended really well after the first few minutes.

1804~~~
Jones is not composed but rather hot headed. He plays purely by instict which is all action on one hand but also headless on the other. Not sure that can be overcome so easily

1805~~~
It is natural for most men to become calmer and more considered with age and experience. Footballers are no different. 

If you really believe that Phil Jones is some sort of wild animal playing on 'instinct', then fair play to you.

1806~~~
I think some people are putting too much focus on that backpass. Yeah, it was a terrible pass, but comparing it to Valencia's against Arsenal is kinda stupid. It was never going to go in (De Gea had to stretch for it, but he comfortably got there), so all he really did was give away possession and a cheap corner. Big deal. He recovered very well from it and played a great match afterwards.

I also think that a lot of people forget that he just turned 23. Remember Rio as a young player?

1807~~~
He's very rash and a headless chicken most of the time. It's part of his game and I'm not sure if he can change. Time will tell. But so far he hasnt developed as we all wished he could

1808~~~
Really?

He plays really well most of the time and has a few, but too many, suicidal moments. 

I am not sure if he will prove to be good enough either but I do feel that he is unfairly criticised and deserves at <i>least </i>one more season.

1809~~~
Too many or not too many?
This season, he didnt really play well overall. I doubt anyone wants to sell him already but he really needs to make a step up now

1810~~~
Thought Jones did a great job after the initial 3 minutes of the game. Both him and Smalling looked class against Spurs, and kept Kane in their pocket until the last couple of minutes.

1811~~~
Despite nearly handing the ball to Kane on a plate, then nearly scoring an own goal, all inside the first two minutes...I thought he had a good game. Kind of standard Jones really.

Interesting that the commentator mentioned that the Smalling/Jones partnership has only played something like 3 times together in the PL, and is yet to concede a goal...surely that can't be true? On both counts.

1812~~~
A hospital pass would suggest he put him in a near impossible situation. Valencia had time to steady himself and play a first time ball under no pressure, that's a fairly basic thing to do for any footballer, let alone a professional one. Situations like that happen numerous times a game and no one mentions it because the receiver isn't troubled and the situation is dealt with. No one would have dreamt to have comment on Jones' pass had Valencia made the most basic of passes.

1813~~~
Your talking about Smallings passes being absurdly bad? Did you not see Jones nearly score into his own net with a back pass and or nearly trip over the ball/his own legs, which he looks like doing nearly every time he is on the ball. Smallings passing is bad a lot of the time I wont deny that but that's usually when he is driving forward and making an attacking pass, plus his other attributes overall make up for that 1 weakness IMO. Smallings issues are the ones that are more correctable. Jones is just down right clumsy and that is not something that can be fixed.

1814~~~
The so called "ball retention" philosophy has worked to the detriment of both Jones and Smalling. There comes a time when you need to get the ball away from your area and we seem to be under instruction to NEVER hoof the ball even under great pressure.

LVG needs to realize this isn't la liga. There is no time on the ball especially when most teams press us away from home.

1815~~~
Completely agree. They dwell on the ball looking for the simple short pass to keep possession and if thats not on it can get them in trouble when they get closed down quickly. Sometimes you just have to GET RID and smash it up field or into row Z.

1816~~~
Simple question - do you think Vidic would have done that?

1817~~~
I was ready to jump through my TV screen the first few minutes of the game, just so I could smack him upside the head.   But he did settle down, soon enough.     Would not mind seeing us keep him, but I think Evans has seen his last season here, if we can not sell him right away a loan will be an option.

1818~~~
Jones bottled it early on playing on his weak side but he then grew in to the game and was playing the ball around nicely by the end. Against Arsenal Smalling's arse fell out for the whole game playing on the same unnatural side.

I disagree on Smalling. I can't see him going from that level of poor passing to being a good ball playing centre half in the Van Gaal mode.

FWIIW I think that both Jones and Smalling will still be here next season and given another chance to impress.

I think that Vidic, even in his prime, would struggle in a Van Gaal team.

1819~~~
The mistake was entirely Valencia's there was very little wrong with the chest pass and if another player had done it and Valencia had actually played the ball properly people would be saying it showed good composure but because its Jones people look to blame him

1820~~~
Do you think Vidic didn't make mistakes in his career?

1821~~~
Doubt it, but that's a matter of playing style, and contrary to popular belief Vidic isn't the model framework on what to do in every defensive situation. There are plenty of defenders that would try to bring it down, ball playing defenders, that are becoming more and more essential in the modern game and ones that are important for van Gaals style of play.

1822~~~
young player learn from their mistakes or they don't make it with a big club. jones still flies around like he did a couple years ago. has all the toos below the neck - he has to sort out his head. if he does that i'd keep him.

1823~~~
sounds unlikely. you never know though.

If you include the cups, I can remember one goal from Monday when they were the partnership!

1824~~~
Perfectly demonstrates the over the top criticism about Jones. Valencia f's up and he gets blamed. If anything as well, he was better than Rojo was at CB in that much (who was very lucky not to give away a penalty, and lost Welbeck in behind him a couple of times).

1825~~~

1826~~~
Hilarious.

1827~~~
Can't defend this guy anymore, he is an absolute maniac.

1828~~~
When he stays on his feet and defend in a direct 1V1, he's very good. It's just he switches off way too often and uses crazy tackles.

1829~~~
He has to sort out his rashness. He is a very good player aside from that weakness but he was lucky to stay on the pitch today.

1830~~~
Monster, love him. He just needs to stop seeing red and making rash decisions.

1831~~~
I thought the referee was going to send him off after that tackle but beside that he was good. Enjoyed seeing him boss the air with Smalling.

1832~~~
Some decent interceptions but the rash aspect remains.

1833~~~
Loved the intensity from Phil today. The kick was a bit over the top but I'd rather have this mildly insane Phil Jones than the more recent tamer version.

1834~~~
He had a very good game, some silly challenges, some misplaced passes, but overall a good performance. Showed passion which everyone wanted. Goes a bit over the top, not good enough. I though he did well.

1835~~~
He was one of our best players. The yellow card was a foul he had to make. Blind put him in an uncomfortable position and he had to take one for the team. Maybe he should not have fouled it that manner but, it is a foul he had to make to stop the attack.

1836~~~
Just like when Rooney was sent off earlier in the season, if you wanna take one for the team because you have to, there is no need to be extra violent. A push or a shirt pull would do.

1837~~~
He's so rash, but was brilliant.

1838~~~
He wasnt one of our best players. He looked shaky, and it was his side of the pitch (along with Blind of course) that all Liverpools chances came from.

I just cant shake the feeling of worry whenever Jones has the ball that he is going to do something stupid, or when they have the ball that he is....going to do something stupid.

1839~~~
The foul Jones did was never a red. It only seemed like that because the Liverpool supporters overreacted because the Gerrard incident just happened.

1840~~~
I don't know but still it is taking unnecessary risks anyway.

1841~~~
To say he played with reckless abandon would be being kind...

1842~~~
Other than the yellow where Blind had already messed up, was fine.

1843~~~
Man of the match for putting Henderson in the stands. A wonderful moment. Does his 1 v 1 defending very smartly and was generally very good when pulled out wide.

1844~~~
Thought he played well, still too rash but that's just his game.
There were two crucial interceptions he made  within quick succession of each other when we were 1-0 up in the first half while Liverpool were growing into the game that were dry crucial.

1845~~~
Don't know why people are calling him rash. He did very well today and even the yellow was Blind's fault.

Seems to me that the word "rash" is now associated with him even though he defended fairly calmly today.

1846~~~
Absolute beast. I love him.

1847~~~
He tried to kill himself and a Liverpool player (Lallana?) at the same time on the beginning of the match.

I get scared very much when the ball is near him.

1848~~~
There's something hilarious about watching him completely poleaxe someone. He doesn't do anything in half measures.

1849~~~
He won the header, how are you going to complain about that? We need some more people like that who aren't pussies and afraid to win a 50/50.

1850~~~
He should have been a boxer. He is fiercely competitive and has no regard for his own safety.

1851~~~
It was a reckless challenge, which could have injured him and Liverpool player. It resulted in a foul which could have been a yellow.

He also could have been sent off on Henderson's case.

1852~~~
Warrior like defending today. Still looks uncomfortable playing on the left side of the central defence

1853~~~
Fairly good game from him today but he really needs to take a bit more care with his challenges. No wonder he is always injured the way he keeps flying into some of these challenges.

1854~~~
Love you Phil <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> What a man, what a player <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> At least someone jumping around and not pussying, absolutely loved it, at least today.

1855~~~
Thought he was very good today, made some key interceptions, was difficult to beat on the deck and aerially. In some cases though, the gap between him and Smalling was too large and Liverpool players were threatening to get in behind.

1856~~~
Thought he was very good today, and I loved the way he smashed "Hendo" <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1857~~~
Agreed, first half especially he was magnificent imo.

1858~~~
That tackle wasn't the cleverest thing to do, on another day a ref may have acted differently.

1859~~~
I can see where it comes from, but he gets stereotyped too much.

Didn't see people moaning constantly at Vidic being rash? Or even Rojo?

1860~~~
Once again I do not think it was ever a red. It only looked questionable because of the crowd's reaction(who were still riled up from Gerrard being sent off).

1861~~~
I was worried he would get a second yellow. He's not easy on the nerves.

1862~~~
I was scared when I saw he was starting today, but he did good.

1863~~~
Was fine today, though lucky enough to only get a yellow given the circumstances.

I've come to realise I really don't trust him though. Today he was the player I felt was most likely to screw up in defence (or injure himself tackling someone). This has nothing to do with what he actually did on the pitch today but rather the impression that has formed over the course of the season.

Don't think he's going to make it here and if we sell more than one CB in the summer then he'll be one of them imo.

1864~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/UVVNHV4.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/UVVNHV4.jpg"/> 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1865~~~
For all the moaning people do about Jones on here Van Gaal seems to trust him.

1866~~~
Cause they weren't near as much rash as Jones. Rojo made a crazt challenge a few weeks ago, but otherwise has been quite calm. Vidic lost his head several times.

Jones on the other side is just weird. It isn't that he is malicious or anything like that, just that he looks to have no controll at all on his body. When he sees the ball he just goes to clear it regardless of consequences (both on the possibility of injuring himself or someone else and the possibility of being booked/sent off). And he does that pretty much every game.

1867~~~
I agree.

1868~~~
I'd have thought that's hard to judge at this point, no? The injuries we've had in defence have meant that all our CBs have been given a chance to shine at various points. Not sure why we'd think that he trust Jones more than Smalling and Rojo is certainly not going to be going anywhere either.

1869~~~
I think he started our season as our second CB (after Rojo) but on the last few weeks I think that LVG preferred Smalling. Now that Rojo is back, it would be interesting to see who will partner Rojo. I guess it will be Smalling consideiring how good he has been this season.

1870~~~
He let Sturridge get away from him for the goal.

1871~~~
Vidic used to take out people running at him out wide or on the edge of the box routinely. Throwing himself many a times at players and he similarly also didn't take any prisoners while heading the ball.

Infact Jones probably gives out less fouls and has less red cards. 

I mean sometimes he can definitely be too rash and aggressive and even look stupid but it gets stereotyped too much. Infact his whole game does due to past set reputation and few errors he might make.

1872~~~
I'm glad to see that bit of recklessness back in him. He became far too passive and safe and that actually created unnecessary errors.

He's not had a red card in a United shirt (think this is right) as far as I know. Absolute beast at the last ditch stuff. And he's just hilarious.

1873~~~
Aye, rashness and clumsiness is a bad mix in a centre back.

1874~~~
Henderson put Llana through on goal right through the middle, neither Jones nor Smalling reacted to him at all.

1875~~~
He has not had a red card in his career yet.

1876~~~
No such thing as a perfect game at Anfield. Will take one or two chances for the other team as long as they're not slaughtering us.

He sniffed out plenty of attacks at the earliest opportunity.

1877~~~
Was pretty funny when he murdered Lallana (or was it Allen?)... surprised he didn't get a first booking for that!

1878~~~
I don't think that it means much, to be honest. Suarez didn't had a red card for Liverpool. I haven't seen Costa ever being sent off.

Anyway, Jones fouls aren't red cards (I think that today wasn't a red card too) and he definitely doesn't have any intention to harm players. Just that he doesn't have any security measures in his tackles. Which could be a reason (similarily to Rafael) why he gets injured this much.

1879~~~
That goal was Carrick's fault, put him in a terrible position dwelling on the ball.

1880~~~
He sure does has an affinity for those full blooded tackles, trouble is, you look pretty daft if you don't pull them off. Oh well, I'll live with it.

1881~~~
It was Blinds fault he had to make that tackle or risk another Liverpool chance via counter.

1882~~~
He's hard as nails is Jones. Love him, needs to chill though, nearly killed himself during his attempt at killing Lallana.

1883~~~
In the context of last man challenges and stuff though, it shows his capability. He's had countless risky moments as the last man, but he always seems to get the ball.

Today's was never a red, but the crowd and Tyler were gunning for it because of Stevie G. It was clumsy and late, not reckless.

I said earlier, I'm glad to see this side of his game come back. He was making more mistakes trying to be safe and clever. He's far better off throwing himself about because that is what he is naturally good at. Vidic did it for years and obviously got some unfortunate injuries in the end, but his performances are always in the memory. Jones is that type of defender, and hopefully he can get a clean run without injury to make his mark.

1884~~~
Great game again from him. Then again, he always makes me nervous, since he always looks like he has atleast one moment of insanity in him each game

That challenge on Henderson today could easily been a red on another day

1885~~~
Only from a poor referee.

1886~~~
I'm always nervous when he's on the pitch, he's a dodgy bastard to be honest. Decent game but he's still not good enough to be a regular in my opinion. Much prefer Smalling and Rojo. Having said that he and Smalling have done very well the past two games.

1887~~~
Just lacks the brain for the highest level. Absolutely no reason to give Atkinson a decision. Could well have been red, given the atmosphere and situation - and as a player he should know that.

1888~~~
Jones had to make a foul in that situation no ways around it. Liverpool would have been n a great position to counter if he did not make that foul.

1889~~~
Definitely, make the foul, but don't kick through like that.

1890~~~
Decent performance overall but he still worries me at times. 

He also goes in for things with his head that are completely brainless, see today on Lallana. 

He'd try and head the ball a foot off the floor.

1891~~~
Only if the ref is an idiot.

1892~~~
Never a red card

1893~~~
Feel exactly the same buddy

1894~~~
I think he had a great game tbh. I absolutely loved how he took down Lallana, cleanly

1895~~~
Plus Blind got sucked in to narrow.

1896~~~
This.

1897~~~
I don't think any of his challenges today were reds. Football is still a contact sport, you can't go giving out straight reds for every "strong challenge". It wasn't reckless, his studs weren't up etc.

1898~~~
I don't get why we're so adverse to fouling and aggression here, its part of the modern game and the best teams know how to do it intelligently. I liked the challenge on Lallana, Lallana would've been a little sheepish going for his next 50/50. The Henderson foul was a smart one, he spoiled what was looking like a very dangerous attack and if you're going to foul someone, you might as well do it properly!

1899~~~
Only an idiot would have said his challenge on Henderson was a red, you see tackles like that every game. It would barely be classed as a dreadful tackle which I suppose it was and deserved a yellow. 

Overall on Jones, I still remain unconvinced by Jones. Probably the weakest of the centre halves we have but then he is still only just 23.

1900~~~
still a bit dodgy but as long as he charges into opposing players and not united's.

1901~~~
That's a pertinent comparison for me, I was thinking while watching the game that he was playing that role for us, you need a bit of it in your team for games like this. He did walk a fine line at times but I also think it played it's part in getting our result. Great performance from him. Might have been my man of the match were it not for Mata.

1902~~~
I was mad at him during the game because I felt that he was going too close to giving the ref an excuse to even things up. Smalling actually gave away the most stupid foul by giving them a free kick in a good position near the box.

1903~~~
I can understand that. He can't play that way week in week out that's for sure. He certainly needs to mature a bit in how he uses his aggression. But in the heat of this particular battle I think it was justified.

1904~~~
He is utterly fearless, a bit like Brian Robson was. There is something to admire in that.

1905~~~
I thought he had broken Lallana in half <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Just smashed into him. Jones never does anything less than 100%. A good performance though I thought, well done Phil.

1906~~~
We aren't for the most part, it just depends who's committing the fouls as to which agenda we decide to use.

1907~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/22/17/26E5717300000578-3006550-image-m-7_1427045391769.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/22/17/26E5717300000578-3006550-image-m-7_1427045391769.jpg"/>

fecking love you guys! its obvious Phil has a man-crush for Juan (football ability wise of course... he was in awe of him by the end of the game (hugging/lifting him). So good to see that type of relation between our players. 


Jones had a pretty good game as well imo. a fecking beast. keep it up Phil!

1908~~~
that tackle was never a red card. careless yes, but that is what you are going to get at least once in a game from phil jones.

hope we'll see more of this smalling-jones combo.

1909~~~
Is he in the England squad?

I just hope to feck he doesn't get injured again. Want to see what him and Smalling are capable of with a run of games.

1910~~~
He came in late, it was a counter (so professional foul) and he just absolutely poleaxed him. Yes, a red would have been harsh, but in a heated derby like this refs can make some stupid decisions. 

Not saying it <i>should </i>have been, saying it <i>could </i>have been and that's the problem with Jones. He makes these dumb decisions regularly and he needs to calm the feck down

1911~~~
Too much has been made of his challenge on Henderson. Just a mistimed challenge that was never a red.

I thought he had a pretty decent game. Our midfield today did a good job of closing players down and letting our defense breathe.

1912~~~
I thought the Henderson tackle was a little too close to the edge. Don't think it deserved a red, but it was probably more than a yellow (which makes no sense, I know). Was just too reckless, but that is Phil Jones.

1913~~~
If a Liverpool player had fouled in the same manner as the Jones on Henderson one. You guys would have been shouting for a red card.

1914~~~
No we wouldn't because it wasn't a red

1915~~~
Bollocks we would.

1916~~~
lol

1917~~~
Sure, ref's make mistakes all the time. I mean a ref could have made a mistake and sent off Balotelli for mistiming his tackle and kicking Jones too, but those challenges happen all the time and refs tend not to make mistakes like that often. 

I think poleaxed is a bit much to describe it, having said that I do agree Jones does need to calm the heck down and it's the main reason why I remain unconvinced by him.

1918~~~
Can be rash and he could have got sent off by a weaker official but is committed to the cause. It's hard to not like him as a player. He just needs to tone it down on occasion.

1919~~~
I think the way he came rushing in made it look worse than actual contact with Henderson. Actually kind of similar to Gerrard's tackle on Mata before his red.

Never a red though.

1920~~~
Maybe for 10 minutes afterwards during the heat of the game, particularly after Gerrard's red card. Once you take a deep breath and look at it though, it's clearly a yellow.

1921~~~
I thought the tackle was borderline yellow/red and he got the benefit of the doubt.

Collision with Lallana might have been a yellow at another time. (harshly perhaps, not quite sure what to make of that one).

So, he was a little bit lucky.

1922~~~
If nothing else, you've got to admire his complete lack of any sense of self preservation. The bloke must have balls as big as coconuts.

1923~~~
Or a brain as small as a peanut.

1924~~~
There's a lot of stupid cowards out there. Being dumb doesn't necessarily make you brave.

1925~~~
Get a grip would you. It was a mistimed tackle, not a malicious stamp. In no world was it a red.

1926~~~
Exactly.

I'm not very pleased with this whole "Jones is dumb as a sack of shite" narrative - he's hard as nails and tackles like a mad man. I love it - as long as he doesn't hurt himself seriously. It's not a bad thing to have one or two players who can scare the crap out of opposition players by going gung ho once in a while as long as he doesn't do it in an area where it might cost us. I bet oppositions players are dreading going up against him.

1927~~~
It was a mistimed, rash challenge - it could easily have been given a red.

1928~~~
It could have. But it didnt deserve to be.

1929~~~
The only way it was a red was if the ref bowed to home support and evened it up to ten men apiece. In normal circumstances, it was a yellow. A red wasn't warranted. Jones is rash as feck though, I do know that. It was a stupid challenge and I cursed him at the time but not a red.

1930~~~
I don't think the challenge on Henderson was any more than a booking.

I do however think he should have been booked for absolutely pole-axing Lallana - so this could have been a second yellow, though obviously he might not have made it had he been on a booking already.

1931~~~
I pissed myself when he clattered the lama. It was so Phil Jones. Nothing malicious in it but he's a health hazard to anyone in the stadium tbh. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1932~~~
Im not so sure about that. I think it was more than about winning that ball there and then. I think he had every intention of clattering Lallana, letting Liverpool know we werent going to be pushed around. Not that I think he wanted to hospitalise him or anything, but Im sure he wanted him to feel it. So I would say it was mildly malicious. And bless him for that.

1933~~~
If it was any other player I would agree <a class="username" data-user="23783, @Adebesi" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23783/">@Adebesi</a> but I think he would have done the same thing if one of our own players was there. He just throws his body around like a maniac.

1934~~~
Needs to get this rashness out of his game if he's ever going to develop into a top quality centre half. Played well yesterday though. I always forget how young he is as well; plenty of learning to do. Hopefully he can stay relatively injury-free for a few years.

1935~~~
That challenge on Lallana was magnificent. I thought he concussed himself when he got up looking dazed, but then I remembered that's just his face. I thought he had a very good game yesterday. A couple of brilliant interceptions at key moments when the game could've flipped just before half time.

1936~~~
This is correct, I've seen him do the same to our players this season. More than once actually <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Thought Phil and Chris had a great match yesterday. I would not want to play against them, at all. They  strike me as a Pepe & Ramos combo, which has worked out very well for Madrid.

Both Ramos and Pepe are or were known for their wild moments too, and I remember John Terry getting himself sent off against Barca when he kicked Sanchez for no reason. Vidic has had his wild moments, a lot of great defenders are very rash at times, even later on in their careers. So I don't think Jones will lose this behaviour, but I also don't think it will prevent him from becoming at world class defender.

1937~~~
It was a yellow dont know why theres even a question about it. Clutching at straws I thought Liverpool fans were until I read some on here debating it. Completely confused. Mistimed definite yellow nothing more.

1938~~~
He's genuinely terrible. Just runs around the pitch throwing himself into everything, with no regards to positional sense or the safety of himself/other players. 

He's easily the stupidest player I've ever seen play for United.

1939~~~
no white text?

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1940~~~
Nope. He's as average a defender as you'll get in the PL. 

Uses his physical capabilities to make up for a lack of skill or footballing brain.

1941~~~
Its every game. As good as he might have been for 89 minutes, again he has that one minute where he does his best to cost us the game.

It was a definite yellow but could easily have been given as a red, especially with Atkinson around. 

Then there was his best effort at injuring himself.

Smalling is improving but i just dont see it from Jones.

1942~~~
Well that's just nonsense.

Why are you so constantly negative? You've become like <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a>, without the wit and humour.

1943~~~
He's mid table quality. Has great physical assets, but doesn't have the technique or brain to be a top level defender. Would probably be great at a club like Everton (if Martinez doesn't get them relegated, mind)

Bit of the pot calling the kettle black there don't you think?

1944~~~
Guys look at the tackle again everyone it was not that bad. And sometimes defenders need to make a foul. Not every CB can be Rio and Rio got to play like Rio because Vidic was there to do the dirty work.

1945~~~
On any normal day that Henderson tackle was nothing but, a yellow. Only reason a red comes into the picture is because of the thug Gerrard getting sent off and playing at Anfield. So yeah maybe he should have just taken the normal yellow versus going full blooded under the circumstances.

He does need to perhaps pick and choose when he goes in like a maniac but, then again I like that we have that in our squad at times where we have a no nonsense defender willing to put his body on the line for the cause.

1946~~~
People complaining about that tackle understand shit about football.

You see that exact same foul in every football game. Jones took one for the team with that necessary foul. Blind fecked it up and Jones fixed it.

1947~~~
He's has been a consistent starter (when fit) under three different managers, for one of the best teams in the country, since he was 19 years old. And is still only 23. He's clearly not "<i>as average a defender as you'll get</i>" in the PL.

He's obviously got some developing to do but he's a very talented young CB. Genuinely surprised at how many people are making such confident predictions about him never being good enough for United.

1948~~~
Yeah, I think that Lallana is perceived as being a bit soft and flaky so he is a good player to erase with a challenge like that. Personally I think that Jones should have been booked for it as he was no where near winning the ball.

1949~~~
I think they were both bookable offences. Having got away with the first one, though, no harm getting his money's worth with number two!

1950~~~
It's really hard to imagine that the pretty-looking guy in that picture can make such mad faces.

1951~~~
He's never been a 'consistent starter' for us, under any manager. This season has been the closest to that, and even then you couldn't say with absolute certainty that he's first choice. From an outside perspective I'd say the Smalling/Rojo partnership has looked our best. 

If he'd shown significant improvement in the 4 years he's already been here, then I'm sure there would be more confidence in him improving further and developing into a top player, but he hasn't. At best, he's improved marginally, at worst, he's actually regressed.

1952~~~
The problem is he is your typical "English defender". He is a brave John Terry throw your head infront of a bus type, who while it looks great and brave is actually a bad way of defending. I much prefer Smalling's way of intercepting and winning the ball cleaner. Jones nearly gives himself an injury every match, and as pointed out could quite easily have seen red against Liverpool. 

The header was just poorly timed, but sometimes you can't always win the ball. It was dangerous and he could have hurt Lallana badly. Timing of his tackles is something he really needs to improve on, but apart from that it was a really good performance.

1953~~~
Terry has won a lot of medals and collected a lot of accolades defending like that.

1954~~~
Terry was also twice the player Jones currently is. 

Let's be honest he was lucky to stay on the pitch yesterday, and the amount of injuries he has given himself through stupid challenges is almost on 2 hands!.

I do love his enthusiasm though, he just needs to learn to be a bit more patient and realise not every tackle has to be won at whatever the cost. (especially if it's near the halfway line <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>)

1956~~~
Pretty much this. I've been quite surprised that so many people think his tackle on Henderson was worthy of a straight red though.

1957~~~
Check out my location to see what I think of his style.  He is a good athlete and has a fairly good read on the game but he seems capable of making reckless plays like this once or twice a match.  He either injures himself or puts himself in a bad spot to be booked.

I actually place him with Evans in the unpredictability level.  The reason I rate him much higher than Evans nowadays is because he clearly doesn't shy away from opponents and is much more consistent.

1958~~~
Yes he has. The only thing stopping him playing more games has been his injury record. He's spent little or no time sat on the bench in his United career so far. When fit, he's been consistently picked by all of our last three United managers.

1959~~~
Interesting that he has the higher number of interceptions in the league per game for a defender this season. And 2nd highest for any player.

1960~~~
And I think that stat shows he is better at reading the game than some think he is.

1961~~~
Being a Terry type defender isn't a problem at all, Terry has managed to be an outstanding centre-back for years with that style.

Jones' problems are that 1) his style of play is much clumsier than someone like Terry's, 2) he isn't anywhere near being as good as someone like Terry atm and 3) he isn't developing quickly enough to suggest he's likely to ever reach that standard.

1962~~~
The attitude towards Jones is ridiculous on here at times. Even when he plays well people refuse to acknowledge things he's done well and base their judgement on past games. People say he's not good enough defensively yet he does more defensive work than any of our other players. People praise Carrick and Blind's reading of the game for making interceptions but call Jones stupid despite him making more interceptions per game than either. People give out about his passing yet his average pass percentage is 86 percent and for all the talk about him constantly throwing himself around the place recklessly he only concedes just over 1 foul per game and only has 3 yellow cards this season. He has only turned 23 and has spent the past few years playing in various positions in a team in transition and obviously hasnt been helped by his injury problems. At his age Stam was playing in the Dutch 2nd division with Cambuur, Ronnei Johnsen was playing as a striker a lot of the time, Thiago Silva was on the verge of retiring from football, Benatia was playing in Ligue 2 with Clermont and Koscielny was playing in Ligue 2. Many on here seem to think that he should be the finished article at an age when most players and central defenders in particular are still learning the game and ignore the fact that our 2 best central defenders in recent times in Ferdinand and Vidic both joined when they were older than Jones is now and both had some very shaky times and plenty of mistakes in their early days at the club. Yes he has mistakes in him but so does every young defender including the likes of Varane and Laporte who most on here would gladly spend huge money on and both have actually made more mistakes this season than Jones has

1963~~~

1964~~~
Amen.

1965~~~
Great post. It's easy to overlook the fact that he's quite an accomplished reader of the game, because of his physical qualities and his tendencies to go into reckless challenges.
He needs to tone down on that recklessness for his own good, though(as well as other players.) His biggest problems so far have been injuries, and I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of those are directly caused by his own clumsiness

1966~~~
23 years old.

Been said numerous times, but I feel like it needs repeating.

He's a baby in defender terms.

1967~~~
great post!

1968~~~
you watch loads of football to see them make mistakes let alone play week in and week out. so they aren't better than jones?

1969~~~
This sentence doesn't really make sense. 

I have seen Varane put in a few horrible performances this season and I don't even watch Madrid that much, if that is what you are getting at?

1970~~~
no i'm looking at someone who watches these two play so much that he or she has seen them make more mistakes than phil jones. that's a lot of football. hence why i wrote "you watch loads of football to see them make mistakes let alone play week in and week out."
i watch mostly the prem.
the last question is are they better than jones or not? that seems pretty easy to understand.

1971~~~
I think it was dark yellow or close to orange-red but never a proper red. But as it was said refs can get carried away easily in this kind of games especially to compensate but Mr. Bean did well apart not sending off the feckwit Skrtel

1972~~~
Yeah I watch most Real Madrid games and a good few Atletic Bilbao games. Im not saying that they aren't or don't have the potential to be better than Jones as its hard to compare players from different leagues and there's 2 years between Jones and Laporte but I don't think either have significantly outperformed him this season and definitely not to the extent that Jones is basically seen as a joke on here to certain people while they would gladly pay 30-40 million for Laporte or Varane. Varane has been brilliant the past few seasons and is better on the ball but doesn't do anywhere near as much defensively as Jones and when he has had to defend this season he hasn't done well. Laporte iis strong in the air and reads the game well to nip in and take the ball away from attackers but can be caught out positionally at times and despite having a reputation as a ball playing defender actually gives the ball away quite a lot and throws himself into some very reckless tackles. Of the young central defenders playing in La Liga the one who's impressed me most this season has been Jose Gimenez who reminds me of Vidic. Anyway my original post wasnt to compare these players but more to point out that even the highest rated young defenders make mistakes but these get ignored while Jones often gets vilified on here for things which arent even his fault such as the Valencia back pass.

1973~~~
so is it hyperbole on your part saying that they've made more mistakes than jones? you really don't know that for certain do you? varane looks quality to me but not 30-40m worth. and they are both younger than phil and rio was about a year older than he is now. phil needs to use his head more , he has always had the physical side of the game but to those who say he reads the game well , i'm not sold on that yet. he is only 23 so maybe. laporte looks a bit out of control in the few games i've seen - one in which he was sent off.

1974~~~
I've noticed him intercepting/blocking a lot of through balls these last couple of matches. I think he is a way smarter player than he is given credit for.

Great post.

Criticism of Jones is always way of the top, he makes 1 mistake and he is a bumbling moron without a brain whereas some other flavour of the month defender or even our own Smalling will make the same mistake and it will be swept under the rug. The amount of shit he got for Valencia's feck up was ridiculous, somehow it is Jones' fault that Valencia can't kick a ball.

1975~~~
He never said they have made more mistakes than Jones. He said they make mistakes like Jones.

1976~~~
no read it again it's in english , hold on here you go i'll make it simple -  Varane and Laporte who most on here would gladly spend huge money on and both have actually made more mistakes this season than Jones has. reading the whole post is fundamental to a/the reply. ffs you even copied his post in which i quoted him.

1977~~~
Alright, relax to feck buddy. I missed the more in the last sentence.

1978~~~
When I read that sentence, I immediately thought of Zat Knight. Now he was a defender who overly relied on his physical qualities. However, I've kept track of Jones since his Blackburn days, and since the beginning, he never really looked like someone who overly relied on recoveries in his defending. He was always quick on his feet and very good at reading the opposing ball holder. Positionally, and in terms of reading the game, he wasn't as refined as J.M. Gimenez is at a similar age, but he showed very good anticipation. Combined with his aggressive defending style, I immediately starting making comparisons with John Terry at his best, and I'm somewhat surprised that I'm not the only one who sees that.

It's not bad if you do it at a calculated approach. Under Mourinho in the past, yes, he may have been given a platform to defend like that, but he wasn't as gung-ho and loose as he, Cahill, and Kompany are now. Even Vidic was quite aggressive in his defending, but he was very calculated. Certainly, in the past few matches, and even in many moments this season, we've seen Jones show a better reading of the game that allows him to defend with controlled aggression. Compare that to his first season here when he was quite reckless but great at recovering himself. van Gaal has certainly done a great job at controlling Jones, and I do believe that he'll start to show the promise he initially showed at Blackburn. His reading of the game has massively improved, and whilst he still has some recklessness in him, I'm sure that will be coached out of him as there's already progress being made in that department. Look at how often he's filled in excellently for Blind. He's been a great supporting defender for Blind on that left side, and I sometimes wonder if we'd have fared as well on that side if Rojo was there instead of Jones.

Definitely. Young defenders do make mistakes quite often, but they're often brushed under the carpet unless you actually pay attention to their defending. Certainly, people have been very watchful of Jones, and I doubt most would have kept a close eye on other young defenders like Varane, Laporte, Sule, etc.

However, J.M. Gimenez has been a very refined defender for someone of his age. I'm sure that he'll be the best defender in the world when he develops and refines his game even more.

1979~~~
He's actually quite good defender. He takes no prisoners though, just wants them without the ball- dead or alive.

1980~~~
People critiquing Jones and Smalling really needs to take a step back and compare them to current defenders rather than old legends. Ramos and Pique are more error-prone than Smalling/Jones. Luiz/Mangala who cost damn near a 100 mill together aren't better defenders nor less error prone either. 

Boateng was considered a joke for City - Bayern brought him in and they gave him time and confidence. Dante as well isn't some kind of world class centre back. 

The quality these days is low but Smalling and Jones, with Rojo as rotation and Evans as a back up is probably the best about these days after PSG and Atletico. 

Smalling, Jones and Shaw are our only British players for the future as well and replacing those with international names would be a shame and a mistake.

1981~~~
Especially if there's no one better available to obtain at the moment who can offer us many years of good service.

1982~~~
Phil Jones is the best CB this season with Tomkins according to WhoScored ratings. He has the third highest amount of interceptions in the league(Blind is fourth) and actually a very low amount of tackles. 

Smalling has roughly half the tackles and interceptions of Jones. What stands out for Smalling is how rarely he gets dribbled past, 0.2 per game is incredible - Thiago Silva has 0.3.

1983~~~
With Young being very likely to lose his starting place in this summer(or even earlier if Di Maria and Mata stays fits and plays well) and Carrick's age - it does seem a bit disturbing. Even Rooney is very soon 30. 

Would be sad to go the route of Madrid/Chelsea/City of not playing hardly any players from their nation.

1984~~~
This just proves what I've observed from Jones for much of this season: he hasn't been as reckless as he used to be. I find it strange how so many still see him like he was in his first season with us when he was actually quite reckless. Now, though, he's much more calculated in his defending and demonstrates much better awareness and anticipation than he used to.

1985~~~
Although his anticipation has improved this season, I still think he's pretty reckless with his tackles.

1986~~~
He had plenty of very good and crucial interceptions which implies that he can actually read the game

1987~~~
How exactly does that make what I said hyperbole did you want an actual list of mistakes or something? Never mind the entire season they've both probably made more mistakes in the past month or so than Jones has all season with Laporte directly responsible for goals against Torino in the home and away games and Almeria at the weekend and looking clueless against Barcelona and Varane making multiple mistakes in the games against Atletico and Schalke. You seem to be doubting how much I've seen of them for some reason. You initially said "you watch loads of football to see them make mistakes let alone play week in and week out" and now you're saying "you really don't know that for certain do you?" Why ask for my opinion on them at all if you doubt how much I've seen of them. Anybody that's watched them a lot this season can tell you that they have both made plenty of mistakes some of which have been punished and some haven't, of course there is no way of actually proving this other than by actually watching their games which you clearly haven't done so I don't really see why you're questioning my opinions on them based on your own lack of knowledge of them

1988~~~
I don't think anybody here is saying Jones is a rubbish defender, that is clearly not true. I rate him a lot when he is on form. He is quick, strong, brave and does usually read the game really well. He is just over zealous sometimes and feels a little out of control, which I think gives a bit of confusion in our defense. 

He will learn that with age though and won't go diving headfirst into every loose ball available, and will become better for it.

1989~~~
Jones has been around for so long that people still forget that a "young talent" like Mangala is a year older than him. When you compare him to Ramos, Pique, Kompany, Luiz, Dante, Pepe etc who are all in their peak - he actually looks pretty damn good.

I wouldn't make a 1:1 trade between Jones and any of those defenders, just based on current abilities alone. Then you add to the fact that Jones has 4-5 years until he will reach his absolute peak.

I appreciate him. He's still slightly rash but he's improved <i><b>a lot</b></i> though every season so far and this year he looks much less likely to cause a yellow or red with his challenges.

He still has that feeling of rashness about him, but in reality he's got three yellows which is a damn good turn out for "an aggressive ball winner who averages the most interceptions and has the best statistics in the league overall of the CB's.".

Rojo has 6 yellows in 17 games which is very rash and risky.
Young and RVP has 5 yellows
Rooney 5 and 1 red
Fellaini has 4 yellows
He has the shared 8th-12th most yellows with Herrera, Wilson and Blind.

1990~~~
I've been a huge critic of Jones and remain unconvinced but one of his major problems is that when he gets it wrong he gets it horribly fecking wrong. The Courtney Lawes style takeout of Lallana and the clattering of Henderson were so clumsy, reckless and with potential for serious injury that they overshadowed all the good work he did in the game. LVG has spoken of "controlling emotion" as key and if he can somehow get Jones to do just that, to slow things down a bit, compose himself, he'll be a far, far better player and he'll be spending far less time in treatment room.

1991~~~
Rojo is similar to Vidic in that when he gets done he commits a professional foul. Jones has the advantage in that area with his recovery pace.

I think it is worth pointing out that Jones challenge on Lallana riled Gerrard up somewhat. He came on with the attitude of bullying a few players as he had seen us playing more aggressive and dominating Liverpool in the first half.

1992~~~
I actually really enjoyed his take outs of Lallana and Henderson. It was a derby after all and that passion is good to see imo. 

The only worry is that he got himself in a situation with both where he'd left his man to come forward and make that tackle/interception. If he'd been skinned either time we'd have been fecked. And that wouldn't be the first time it'd have cost us a goal this season with his preference for coming and getting stuck in rather than holding back patiently.

1993~~~
He's been much better of late. The advantage of playing a few games in the one position. I still don't think you can disagree that he's a massive idiot, though. He always seems on the verge of doing something inexplicable.

1994~~~
The second time he was saving Blind's ass as he lost the ball in a dangerous area! Gary Neville pointed out against Spurs that he had bail Blind out a few times in that game too. Jones is actually very good at covering his full back, it is part of a centre backs job.

1995~~~
I like Rojo but I think 5 yellows in his last 7 games is too much. Taking a tactical yellow card offense against top teams is a great thing but resorting to it against every opponent you face isn't. 

His fouls came after 60~ minutes in average so in that regard it isn't a huge problem as he hasn't been sent off once.

1996~~~
I was mainly referring to the Lallana incident there to be honest. I'd have to see the Henderson one again, but I'm sure there was an opportunity to hold him up rather than wipe him out. 

Anyway like I said originally I enjoyed Jones smashing him so I'm not really complaining. It just worries me that the writing is on the wall that he won't quite get there in time, or will get himself sent off, in future games.

1997~~~
I love the bloke. Gone up in my estimations after Sunday. Just hope he stays fit with Smalling now or he'll never develop fully.

1998~~~
The criticism of him is mostly fair but it does need to be put into the context that he's been shifted around for his entire career. At Blackburn he didn't really get to learn the skill of defending as they just utilised his physicality.

He's a young defender who just needs a long run of games as a CB. Still prefer Rojo at this time mind.

1999~~~
because you wrote it as gospel , I actually agree with you spending 40m on someone else doesn't interest me. i did ask if they were better because i want to know. IMO and i'm not LVG , but smalling and jones play until the end of the year as united's cb's. no faffin' around unless they get hurt. it will give us a good look at next yr. the last few matches have been quite good and things look bright if they keep this up. 40m could be used more wisely IMO on a WC striker if these two guys can work as a pair.

2000~~~
I honestly feel we might have cracked it with Jones and Smalling now. Just really, really hope neither gets injured.

2001~~~
A lot of people have already said it but kudos for this great post.

My concern about Jones has nothing to do with his ability and everything to do with his ability to stay fit. If he can overcome his injury problems Id be confident he could go on to be CB for us for years to come. But until he does that I definitely think we need to bring at least one more CB in. We've had crippling injury crises centred around our defense every year for quite some time now, the same will surely happen next year unless we act.

2002~~~
Idiot is harsh, as it reinforces the widely held stereotype of him being a stupid defender. Always out of position and running around like a headless chicken to try and catch up with play. The fact he has made so many interceptions implies his reading of the game is much better than he's given credit for.

What he is, though, is impetuous. Impetuous and completely lacking in any sense of self-preservation. A dangerous combination which he'll hopefully grow out of over time. Most youngsters think they're indestructible. He just happens to think <i>and</i> act like he is. With a bit of luck the penny will drop eventually. It usually does.

2003~~~
No doubt. He is still a bit wild with his tackles, but there's noticeable, significant progress and development this season. He is still being refined as a player, and soon, hopefully, we should see him be more refined.

2004~~~
The amazing thing is that, despite the massively negative view of him from the Caf, he's the top-rated centerback in the Prem on the whoscored.com ratings (and also our top rated player). Of course we all know that ratings are meaningless (at least when they go against our prejudices) but, to get a high rating you do have to consistently tick the boxes in their system, so he must be doing something right.

2005~~~
No bump?

Was excellent tonight. Finally gets a run without injury and getting better with every game he plays. Who'd have thunk it?

2006~~~
Wasn't exactly tested much but looked to force positive movement in the team, striding forwards and not many side passes. Still think Smalling has done more than Jones to warrant a place (based on United performances that is)

2007~~~
I've never ever been convinced by Jones and can't say I'm fully sold. But credit where credit is due, he has done well lately and impressed me. Done his international prospects no harm tonight. Ok, the opposition was absolutely woeful but nevertheless he done well.

2008~~~
Didn't have much defending to do but was solid when he had to be. Got on the ball a lot and used it well. 

In theory, that's exactly what we want from him in a United shirt.

2009~~~
He looks better as the left-sided CB.

2010~~~
I agree he's looked better on the left side, but disagree that it's because he's playing on the left. Smalling as a defender complements Jones a lot better than Rojo I feel, and tonight I for think he really had much to do bar a great interception in the box in the first half. It's very difficult for a player on the left hand side to be comfortable in possession if they aren't comfortable using their left foot, which Jones isn't. I've said it before - I think buying a left sided centre halves (Hummels the obvious target) and having Jones and Smalling competing for a place on the right would put us in a good position in my opinion.

2011~~~
Vidic's was never that good with his left foot.

2012~~~
Vidic never played in a system that required him to be good on the ball. He was actually very poor on the ball, especially in his last two seasons.

2013~~~
Vidic was actually pretty decent on the ball, not quite sure about his last 2 seasons but before that injury against Basel, he wasn't bad on the ball at all.

2014~~~
Insisting on only ever playing one right and one left-footed CB is utter madness, which is why I'm relieved that Van Gaal hasn't been too dogmatic to play Smalling and Jones together in recent weeks. Even after Rojo got fit again.

2015~~~
Good to hear!

2016~~~
It's not a case of only playing a left footed CB there, but if you play someone there that hasn't got a left foot at all then they're going to struggle if they're pressed. If he receives it from the RCB then he has to take a inside if he wants to use his stronger foot, rather than letting it run across their body. If you receive it from the LB then again, you've got to deal with it by playing the ball across your body which isn't as natural as using your nearer foot. The reason why this present different problems than the former is that play is more likely to condensed on the wing so the centre half will be under more intense pressure.

2017~~~
I get the theory. In practice it's a non-issue, as we've seen from all the world class right-footed CBs who've excelled in that position over the years.

2018~~~
They haven't all been asked to play in a system where retention of the ball is key though. In our system, our players assume possession will be retained when the defenders have it and position themselves accordingly. The fullbacks drop wide and deep, the wingers or LCM/RCM in a diamond midfield get wide and everyone gets ready to receive the ball and make themselves availiable for the pre-meditated phase of play. What you don't want is a CB you can't trust to play the ball properly. If he just lumps it out of play or boots it aimlessly up field the whole team has to get their shit together, reshape and look to mark players and cover space rather than find space. 

All that because someone can't pick out a good pass with their opposite foot. We saw it with Smalling the other week when he was moved to LCB. He knew what he was supposed to do but found it very difficult with the ball under his feet and the correct pass with his good foot very difficult with a man bearing down on him.

2019~~~
A lot of them have. 

Look at Barca under Guardiola. The epitomy of a system where possession is everything and arguably the best team of the past 20 years. Did they insist on playing a left-footed LCB? Did they feck.

2020~~~
Of course, but I think it's rare for you to see a team that makes a point of keeping possession not having a player on the left that isn't comfortable playing with their left. Look at the two most renounced possession sides in the world at the moment. Bayern have Dante and Badstuber, and Barcelona bought Mathieu I'd speculate to have an actual defender comfortable on their left, instead of playing midfielders there.

I'm happy with Jones and Smalling combination atm and I hope it continues for the rest of the season. I doubt van Gaal has his principles for no reason though so I'd expect us to sign a left sided CB who's comfortable on his left, because I think it's clear Jones isn't comfortable when pressed. Smalling had a half there vs Arsenal and had an absolute nightmare.

2021~~~
It's not like they struggled when Puyol played there. And while you could make an argument for someone like Hummels being relatively two-footed - and even then that's a bit of a stretch - you can't say the same for Puyol. He wasn't much more comfortable on his left than Jones is. Competent at using it to make simple passes and clear it but nothing beyond that.

2022~~~
Puyol used to play predominantly on the right side though didn't he? Even then, he was often moved to full back under Guardiola and either Busquets, Toure or Mascherano were moved to CB - the CL final in 09 being an example. Guardiola also bought Chygrynskiy because they needed cover on the left hand side and he was left footed.

2023~~~
At their peak it was Pique on the right and Puyol on the left for the vast majority of games. The CL final was an exceptional circumstance because of Alves' injury and the Chygrynskiy point seems neither here nor there because he never played, which shows that even when they did have a left-footed player they didn't choose their centre backs based on which foot they use but how good they are. Just as van Gaal is doing now. 

I've no doubt in an ideal world they'd have a top class, left footed centre back for an extra bit of balance but it's obviously not essential and Barca at their peak are the perfect example of that. Ajax and Holland in the 70s didn't have a left-footed player in their entire back four, from what I remember. Nor did Bayern or Germany at the same time actually - although Beckenbauer obviously made up for that with a right foot that could do anything he wanted.

2024~~~
IMO this left footed centre back stuff is nonsense. No-one <b>ever</b> talked about this when Rio and Vidic were playing - and I've seen a suggestion that between 2007 and 2013 we played systems that didn't need our CBs to play out from the back, which is complete nonsense too.

CBs should be able to whack it 60 yards with their weaker foot and make simple 20-30 yard passes on it. I can sort of understand why LvG wanted a left footer in the summer (Rojo) because we were playing 3 at the back and when the opposition sit back, it's the wide centre backs who become the free man and have to surge forward/offer an overlap to the wing back. But in a back four it's completely unnecessary. It's cost us goals too with the Blackett experiment.

2025~~~
Seems like he will be first choice for Club and Country, easy to see why.

2026~~~
And for over half a season Rio and Vidic actually <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/vidic-and-rio.343846/">swapped sides</a>, which shows how little Sir Alex cared about it all.

2027~~~
I don't have a lot of understanding about the earlier sides so I couldn't possibly comment.

On the Chygrynskiy point, i used him as an example of why they bought him, and I did mention he was only a cover player. I'm not suggesting that a side should play someone should play if they're shite just because they're left footed, I wasn't suggesting that that they have to be left footed either, just that they should at least be comfortable with using it.

On the Puyol point you do have me, because of course he was never known for his ball playing abilities and it goes without saying how immense Barcelona were on the ball. I guess the only explanation I could put forward is how comfortable the rest of the team was around him, made it a little easier as you could play the ball into Busquets, Iniesta or Xavi under any pressure knowing they'd keep it. 

To refer back to United, I still would rather have Jones back on the right next season because I think it's clear he isn't comfortable when he gets it on the left under pressure. As I say though, there's no need to break the partnership for the remainder of this season.

2028~~~
I feel like saying a right footed CB can not play on the left is like saying a right footed midfielder can not play on the left side of central midfield.

2029~~~
Jones actually played a couple of really good passes against Liverpool and Spurs with his left foot including a brilliant clipped pass to Fellaini which lead to the goal and has looked very comfortable on the left. Against Liverpool and Spurs hes had 83% and 89% passing accuracy which is better than Blind in both games and last night he had 94% so he's obviously not having too much of an issue in possession. I completely understand the theory behind what you're saying but it hasnt actually been shown in relation to Jones and there are countless other examples of players playing in some of the best possession based teams in history that are right footed and prefer to play on the left. It only really becomes an issue if the player is extremely awkward on their weaker foot

2030~~~
So apparently Woy is going to be playing him as a holding midfielder. Didn't think we'd see that again and can't say I'm too pleased about it. Was getting better and better as a CB with the more games he played. Would have much rather he got another game under his belt in his preferred position.

2031~~~
We're down to the bare bones in midfield so I can see why Woy is doing it. Smalling can take his place at the back and there won't be any drop in quality there.

2032~~~
Yeah same here. Him and Smalling have moved around too much, especially Jones. Just play them at CB every damn game.

That said, being a friendly, it could be to simply give other CBs a game. Would have quite liked him not to be involved and be fresh for the game on Sat.

2033~~~
Is Mathias Ginter or Kurt Zouma's development being stalled because they occasionally play in midfield? I really hate the caf theory that Smalling and Jones were being ruined by them being played in different positions.

2034~~~
feck off Woy. Play Beckham there ffs, I'm sure he'd be up for playing another game. It is worrying how we don't have any decent midfielders who can play deep though.

2035~~~
Jones spent a good 2/3 seasons playing in midfield as one of his main positions, a bit different from occasionally putting Zouma there because Matic isn't available.

2036~~~
before Brazil WC i said:

The only way for England to get out of their group is playing Jones in midfield.



Of course dinosaur Woy didn't listened... until now. I see a brighter future for England chances to be competitive again with Jones in midfield.

2037~~~
I'm going to go against the grain and say I prefer him as a midfielder then a defender. Not as a holding mid though, that requires too much tactical nous and ability on the ball. But as a sort of 'destroyer' I think he's got all the attributes needed.

2038~~~
But the theory is true. Smalling's confidence, and reputation, was decimated by his attempts to play at right back.

He and Jones have yet to play ten games at centre half together at United in their whole time at the club. That's just ridiculous.

During this time we had an ageing Ferdinand, who could no longer contest a corner at the other end of the field because of his back, and Vidic, who spent about two cumulative years of that period out injured. It's been a mismanagement of potential.

Injures have been a decisive factor in their stall, too. But players will not develop to be central defenders if they're not playing in that position regularly. Game time breeds confidence and repetition, which in turn brings about learned behaviours that make for positive growth. 

Central defenders, perhaps moreso than any position, need experiences, good or bad, to get better. 

The reality of the situation is that both Smalling and Jones played much of their developmental years out of position. When the time came to throw them in, many then expected them to suddenly turn out like the superstars we thought we had bought. It was silly, to be honest, and they probably deserve more credit than they get for their recent form in our back four.

2039~~~
Absolutely destroyed by...Chiellini of all people...dear me.

2040~~~
That first half in central midfield will have done a lot for his development as a centre half, clearly.

2041~~~
Not working with him at the base of that diamond is it.  He can break up play but when we have the ball he didn't have a job basically - because he's so technically poor.  His only role was to fill in to form a back 3 so as to give the midfielder an easy escape ball.  Big lad and a big heart.  He's a centre half though.

2042~~~
Let bonnuci have a free header at goal then made Chiellini look like Messi...  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2043~~~
Doesnt have the qualities needed to play in midfield. Average technique, predictable touch, poor movement when his team is in possesion and is a limited passer. Basically doesnt have the football brains for it.

This was all true 3 years ago and is still true today, yet here he is still playing there. Am I missing someting?

2044~~~
I don't get it either mate.  He's a defender really and that's about it.

2045~~~
Looks a bag of nerves on the ball

2046~~~
Every United fan knew this. feck knows what Hodgson does with his time, but he obviously doesn't watch us.

2047~~~
He isn't good enough technically to play in midfield. Needs to keep developing at CB.

2048~~~
Keown has a great article up about how Jones is not a patch on Pirlo as a holding CM......no shit. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

He is awful in midfield though, needs to stay as a CB, thankfully LvG seems to realize this.

2049~~~
Hodgson was daft playing him in midfield, but to be honest I am not sure he is good enough as a defender yet either.
It just shows the lack of international quality we have at the back at the moment.

2050~~~
Don't understand why he was played there. England had better options to play that role.

2051~~~
I think he can have a role in specific games in midfield, just like how for example Real Madrid have used Pepe as a DM in the past. I'm sure Hodgson was just trying it out and isnt looking to play that way every game, but if England were going to play a huge game against a top side he might want to try it in the future and Jones might be the best fit for the role - even though he's definitely not perfect for it as there are midfielders who read the game defensively better than he does, but physically he's a good fit.

You would also need to balance the team around having that defender there - Delph on the left and Henderson on the right would seem to help him a lot defensively but it pretty much left all the responsibility for creating something on Rooney, and when you just have to deal with 1 player its a lot easier to do.

2052~~~
Yeah, SAF played him there vs Real and he was pretty decent. Moyes also played him in that role vs Arsenal last season and he was MOTM IIRC.

But thing is if you play him as a destroyer need better passers next to him than Delph and Henderson so he can just keep it simple.

2053~~~
Because it was Hodgson? 

Simple answer!

2054~~~
Me either, but he has more potential there than as a CM so when he does get games they should be in his best position.

2055~~~
He's going to need to realise this potential pretty sharpish.

2056~~~
He's 23 years old FFS. Do I really need to go through a long list of where other top CBs were playing at the same age?

2057~~~
I agree, but the way the game's progressing, it's becoming harder and harder for young players to develop at top sides.

2058~~~

2059~~~
I kind of agree but he's getting plenty of games at United, under three different managers now. The main hindrance to his development has been his susceptibility to injury.

Being played in so many different positions is arguably also a hindrance but I actually think it might make him a better CB in the long-term.

2060~~~
yes, because he's the new Duncan Edwards you know

2061~~~
I think that Roy really feed him to the wolves last night. After a commanding display last Friday now all everyone is talking about is how badly he played last night and the negative Jones narrative continues.

2062~~~
I think I am actually one of the few who think that Jones could be a damn good DM (destroyer style), but he would need to play there often to settle into the position - throwing him in there after he hasnt played that role for months (years?) was never going to end well

2063~~~
I was waiting for the obligatory refrence to his age and nobody's asking for lists of anything. The fact remains that a sizeable number of people remain unconvinced of this possible <i>potential </i>and for well documented reasons including his injury record.

He's been at United for 4 seasons now and <i>for whatever reasons</i> he hasn't kicked on. My point stands ie he needs to realise this potential sharpish or there'll be no place in a side that has designs on a rapid reascent to the top. He's looked a little more assured of late but, frankly, he couldn't have looked any less so and you simply cannot argue that his game has progressed. He is no closer to realising this so called potential than when he first joined us. Whether all of this is his entirely due to some lack of innate ability is another argument. Personally I don't think he'll ever be good enough and have been saying so for fecking ever it seems.

2064~~~
His game clearly has progressed. He's blatantly a better CB now than he was when we signed him. Sounds like you made your mind up about him ages ago, though, so whatever.

2065~~~
Maybe, but not for us. The way van Gaal plays means the GK can't be shit on the ball, let alone the DM.

2066~~~
Hodgson said in the post match interview that this is exactly why he wanted to try him there. The reaction in some of the press is ridiculous. I mean if Keown was seriously comparing him to Pirlo ffs... 

That said, I'm not sure the Italians were the ideal opponents to try this little experiment.

2067~~~
We used to do with with P Neville sometimes as well.  Just use him as a destroyer but it makes it very difficult to keep hold of possession.  Almost entirely a defensive or counter attacking strategy (if he's got a quick out ball - or a pacy striker playing on the shoulder to feed it in behind).

2068~~~
He's the one player at the club I cant defend.....Young, Valencia, fellaini I see the positives with them all but Jones I think is just winging it and doesnt belong.

2069~~~
He has a poor game playing in midfield for England and we are back to over the top criticism of him I see.

2070~~~
See i dont get this, granted last season he stagnated somewhat but his previous two seasons were great for us. In his first season most wanted him to replace Rio in the starting 11. In his second he played mainly as a midfielder but even then was better than what we had. 

This season injuries have played their part but there are signs of improvement and at 22/23 hes got time on his side... Unlike Evans

2071~~~
Classic isn't it? He had a poor game in midfield, in a system he's never played in. If he's playing in midfield it has to be alongside a ball player, as a destroyer. Case in point - he had a great game vs Real in 2013 doing that alongside Carrick. Of course playing him with fecking Delph and Henderson is going to expose him.

Meanwhile muppets like Phil McNulty think Cahill should be undroppable despite being average as feck and making numerous mistakes this season.

2072~~~
And I actually think he's looked a lot better recently for United. Give him and Smalling time together (without injuries of course,) and I think we'll be looking at a great partnership.

2073~~~
That's because those 3 have very identifiable positives. For what it's worth, I think Jones has considerable upside as well. He just needs a run of games to realize it.

2074~~~
Some of his game has developed, there's no point denying that.

The trouble is, the things he really isn't good enough with and isn't improving on make him the wrong type of player for us.

2075~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zzLB0zAgu8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2076~~~
I didnt think he was fantastically good against Spurs and Liverpool to be honest. He did well, but Smalling looked far more comfortable in basically every way for me.

2077~~~
Got to say that I think we'll always be able to use a rock solid defender with a good passing range. Exactly what you're looking for in a defender i don't know, but you're not going to find many with a better all round performance than Jones.

2078~~~
His defensive positioning was atrocious at the start of his United career but he has improved alot. I think when we had Vidic, the likes of Smalling and Jones and to a degree Evans were relying on him to get them out of trouble but now he has gone they've have to walk on their two feet. My only concern is his confidence on the ball, I just don't think he has that presence yet,to let strikers know,'your not having a sniff on goal' which is what Vidic and Stam had. But hopefully in time LVG can bring that out of him and then I believe we are looking at a future United Captain.

2079~~~
Got out jumped by Benteke a few times today, but apart from that I felt it was another solid performance by Jones.

2080~~~
I saw a couple of times where he was caught up the pitch or out of position.

Definitely needs to be Smalling ** at the back for me, whether the ** is Jones or Rojo I dont really know though.

2081~~~
His positional awareness is definitely suspect. 

Can't help but feel it'd be better by now if he hadn't been played all over the bloody pitch so often.

2082~~~
Rojo lost Benteke on the corner for the goal and gave away his obligatory stupid free kick in a dangerous area. Jones would getting panned on here if he had done that today.

2083~~~
Not a fan of him and Rojo together. Both charge up too much.

2084~~~
Everyone will keep saying we need Smalling, and don't get me wrong, Smalling is our best centre back, in my opinion, but Rojo and Jones were fine today.

2085~~~
One of his calmer games today, I actually thought he'd gotten hurt at one point as he looked pretty disorientated.

2086~~~
He does that at least once every game

2087~~~
Phil Jones has one gear, its always 5th.

2088~~~
I thought he was better today and handled both Benteke and Agbonlahor well. Both of those players are a handful but Jones stood up well and made some very good and timely tackles. I agree with your second point though. He's best at centre half and that's where he should stay.

2089~~~
There was one time in the first half where he came flying out to the right side to head the ball away, completely missed it and allowed Villa into a very dangerous position. Otherwise he had a pretty good match.

2090~~~
Jones and Smalling is our best partnership. And they could develop into something really good if they stay injury free and keep playing together.

Always thought that.

2091~~~
I thought he was alright. There was one or two iffy moments with his positioning that didn't cost us. Would prefer he and Smalling were the CBs against City though, they had just begun developing a good partnership.

2092~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/tag/phil-jones/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Phil Jones</a> has been named in WhoScored.com’s statistical Premier League Team of the Year so far.

The team is made up of players who are ranked top in their positions according to the website’s stat-based system. 

On average, Jones has the second-most interceptions per game (3.6) in the whole league while he has also notched up 2.1 tackles and 6.9 clearances.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://thepeoplespersonimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/01215039/jones.jpg" src="http://thepeoplespersonimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/01215039/jones.jpg"/>

2093~~~
His positional awareness is absolutely horrendous. He runs around like a 10 years old playing Sunday league.

Him and Rojo are just not a good partnership.

2094~~~
He and Rojo are too instinctive to make a good partnership.

2095~~~
Couldn't believe the amount of times he went to challenge Benteke out on the sideline for a header. It never caused us too many problems but it just lacked any sense of footballing knowledge. I thought he was good in those battles overall but there was no need to be anywhere near it.

Has done well in recent weeks though.

2096~~~
Looked off the pace for me at the weekend. Probably didn't help being on England duty but he was struggling to beat Gabby and Benteke to the ball like he usually would do.

2097~~~
I initially thought that Benteke and Agbonlahor would cause Jones lots of problems with their pace and strength, but Jones handled them well even if he wasn't at his best. He won a number of aerial battles against Benteke, and he did a good job in suppressing Agbonlahor's influence. There were several instances where I was quite surprised at how he'd challenge Benteke when it wasn't really warranted, but for that aggressive approach, he did an okay job recovering his position.

Still, though, I agree with what ChrisG11 said. Jones did look as fresh as he was before as he was getting caught out more often, but given that, he still did a decent job at the back, and him being not as good as he was before didn't really hurt us as much.

2098~~~

2099~~~
Remember when Phil Jones took corners?

2100~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2101~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That was genius

2102~~~
I love how the strangely hypnotic music in no way matches the video<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2103~~~
Wait until his debut as striker.

2104~~~
I'd love one day to know the reasoning behind Jones on corners.

2105~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2106~~~
I doubt there's much to it. We didnt have that many obvious right footed options beyond Rooney in the games he took them, and its not an unreasonable view to want your best goalscorer in the box. I guess they tried out corners in training and he was alright. Simple as that I reckon.

2107~~~
Probably to keep him from hurting the opposition, or himself

2108~~~
Thought he was phenomenal today.

Snuffed out everything. Some great challenges and interceptions. And some of those charges up the field he was famed for when he first came here.

Hopefully him being subbed was a precaution?

2109~~~

2110~~~
Yep, after a very dodgy start by the back line I thought he played very well.

2111~~~
Reaffirms what I saw.

One of the most accomplished individual defensive displays I've seen in the league this season.

Bodes well.

2112~~~
He seems to have tendency to start sluggish and also is sluggish when he comes on sub at first.

2113~~~
I liked his performance to. LVG clearly wants them to be aggressive and stick on their opponent when they drop to collect balls. It has worked really well, even when our defenders aren't capable of winning the ball back or taking a clean challenge it means that the opponents never get to receive balls without being in heavy pressure. 

The 1 vs 1 against Aguero is world class stuff from a centre back, even the best full backs would have a hard time in a 1 vs 1 against Aguero.

2114~~~
He wasnt injured or sthing?

2115~~~
Had a very shaky start, but improved massively. Great game overall.

2116~~~
He's a good defender in 1v1 situations, tough to beat. He scares me with his back passes to DDG.

2117~~~
He was great today. Hopefully he stays fit so <i>Phil Jones becomes one of Manchester United's greatest ever players </i>like Fergie wanted/predicted

2118~~~
Only thing is his play with a ball,think that will improve a lot just at the moment,he looks for easy way.

2119~~~
Am I the only one that thought he was good but looked like he was about to make a massive mistake almost every time he was on the ball?
Only thing I thought was really good was that one tackle near the edge of the box, which was perfect to be fair.

2120~~~
That tackle in the first half was magnificent. Smalling + Jones please. Stick with it.

2121~~~

2122~~~
Carrick is rocking some nice sideburns.

2123~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> wtf, is that just the picture or was he actually rocking sideburns today?

2124~~~
I'd say probably his best game this season, some very good tackles, he still makes me antsy though.

2125~~~
Bar the first goal where he (and everyone else) was asleep, he was very, very good today. If he can develop his tactical awareness and calm the feck down, he will become a tremendous CB

2126~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/09/article-0-192F111A000005DC-556_634x430.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/09/article-0-192F111A000005DC-556_634x430.jpg"/> 

Can't believe that some magazine didn't invite those two for a co-session to be fair.

2127~~~
Still can't believe how much stick he gets. He's definitely a bit of a headcase at times, but he's actually a good defender - you can see that he reads the game (hence the interceptions) and is very good 1 vs 1. He's only just turned 23, which when you consider that Mangala is older and cost £40m and doesn't understand what's even going on the football pitch, plus all the messing around with injuries and positions there is a serious player in there for us. 
By all accounts a leader too and forming a good partnership with Smalling.

2128~~~
Played very well today, one of the best matches I can remember him having.

2129~~~
I thought the same. He just doesn't inspire any confidence in me whatsoever. He always looks like he's on the verge of making a horrendous mistake defensively, a horrific tackle, or hurting himself.

2130~~~
Yup. Good game. Really hope he's ok for Chelsea. Would be a big loss.

2131~~~
Its the same every match. He can play perfectly and people will just say he doesn't inspire confidence and is on the verge of a mistake because there is nothing to actually complain about so they'll complain about what looked like could have happened but didn't actually happen. He's been on the verge of getting sent off his whole career but magically has never actually been sent off. He is really good at being on the verge of stuff. May as well just call him The Verge.

2132~~~
He's been good lately and I hope that continues. I'm still not convinced or fully sold on him, far from it to be honest. Nevertheless he was good today after a pretty poor start.

2133~~~
Agree I have very little confidence in him.

2134~~~
I far less confidence in him than I do Smalling now. I wish he would cut out the stupid back passes, some of them are totally unnecessary and just put De Gea under pressure to clear.

2135~~~
Solid. Average rating in today's game really baffles me.

2136~~~
Very good. Our 2nd best CB. No more Rojo please. Smalling + Jones all the way.

2137~~~
Come on, Aguero is not even in the same league as Phil Jones here.

2138~~~
On the axis of the evolution of footballers since the game was invented, he is right there at the Neanderthaler era.

Turned out okay-ish today, but I do not trust him.

2139~~~
Awful first half, was getting torn a new one in the first 15 mins, decent second half.

2140~~~
So true. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Imagine applying the same logic on the other players. "Rooney was a 10/10 because he really looked like he'd score two or three times. I mean he didn't but I felt pretty certain he would."

2141~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> funny 'cos it's true.

2142~~~
I think for the first time we are seeing the benefit of having Jones/Smalling play in central defense for the majority of the season.

2143~~~
Great post. Totally spot on.

2144~~~
He's far from great on the ball, sometimes awful.   Don't think I've seen him play 'perfectly' more than a couple of times.  Gets caught out of position, is slow to react on the ball, can't pass for shit.  BUT when those things aren't glaringly obvious he does look reasonably solid-ish and only looks like he is on the verge of doing those things, rather than actually doing them.  Like today.

2145~~~
Played pretty well today but I'm always nervous with him at the back. That said, I'm not totally convinced by any of our options as a long term partnership

2146~~~
Take out the first ten minutes, where the whole team were pretty bad and looked nervous, but after that untidy start, he was great.

You have aguero, we have jones Indeed. Loved some of his tackles today. And him venturing forward at times was great too.

2147~~~
I don't think he's LVG's ideal type of full back because of this. Smalling seems to have grown in confidence as the season has gone on, and as a result he regularly runs the ball out of defence beating a man and plays the ball off. Jones seems nervous to run the ball out and when he does, regularly panics, turns around and passes it back. I noticed a few chipped balls up field by him today which resulted in losing possession, where a more confident player who's more competent on the ball would have no doubt retained possession.

2148~~~
His lobbed balls are one of the worst parts of his game.  I can't remember which game it was but I remember one in particular where we were attempting to counter multiple times with Jones being the key man involved and every time he way overhit the pass.  
He also dilly dallys on the ball, as if he isn't paying attention to what is going on, then gets forced into a rushed pass, often to the keeper.
I don't even mind his wild challenges, as at least it puts the opposition on edge a bit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> but most of his game isn't good enough for United and we need someone of genuine quality.  I would like to see him stay as backup though.

2149~~~
Seems the antithesis of what Louis wants from a centre-half. Seat of the pants stuff at times again today. You can see why he gets the crowd going in a way that a calm, composed, ball-playing replacement never could but in the long term, you can't see him being the answer. I'm rooting for him but I can't see it.

2150~~~
That's mad. Jones' use of the ball is clearly much better which is why he's the preferred choice when both are fit, and that was as evident today as it ever was. Smalling tried to dribble out with the ball once and got tackled in his own half, while Jones dribbled past players with ease in both halves. The one time he lost possession he won it back in their defensive third and started off another attack.

According to Opta the relevant stats are...

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Dribbles</span>
Smalling - 0
Jones - 2 (2nd only to Herrera)

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Accurate long balls</span>
Smalling - 1/6
Jones - 5/10

Stats can't tell you everything but if you compared their two performances side by side you'd see exactly what limerickcitykid is saying - people see what they want to see when it comes to Jones/Smalling, for some reason. It's like you're describing a performance of Jones' from 2 months ago, because Jones today was terrific against Aguero and used the ball well. It's only a couple of "dangerous" backpasses - that De Gea was in completely control of - that give the impression he somehow lacked composure.

2151~~~
There was nothing wrong with the back passes either. Some people are just a bit twitchy and like to blame it on Jones.

2152~~~
I thought him an Smalling were very nervy early in the game, especially Smalling, but they both improved and had decent games.

2153~~~
Jones and Smalling are starting to look very good together now.

2154~~~
Do people still feel unsafe with Jones in the side? I don't think he did much wrong in this match. The fact that van Gaal chose Jones to play over Rojo at the left central defensive spot (a right-footed player on the left side when a left-footed player was available?! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>) shows that Jones isn't some defensive mug that many make him out to be.

He was (surprisingly?) composed in his defensive game and handled the threat on our left side very well. In 1-on-1 situations, he bettered anyone he faced, and he never strayed too far out of position. He was also, as usual, good on the ball and was comfortable bringing it forward. My only gripe with him in this match was that he looked to play a long pass to the left side far too often when it wasn't always available, but other than that, I don't think he did much wrong.

Comparing this Jones to Jones when he first came here, you can really see how far he's developed, overall. He's more composed and calculated, and he reads situations better than he did back then when he was just basically playing purely on his instincts.

2155~~~
The whole team was to be fair.

First fifteen we were awful defensively.

2156~~~
He had a good game today, but i thought his positioning for the first goal was poor.

2157~~~
slightly underhit pass to de gea before our goal but aart that and maybe first 10 minutes when all team looked shaky he was great. Very good defending for Aguero counter and other good tackles and used the ball well too.. I was little bit worried with citeh's counters as Aguero and Navas are speedy feckers but we did well and god that Valencia sprint to Aguero was brilliant it looked like certain goal if he had a better touch on it and passed the baal infront of goal.. but We did well to stop them overall even Aguero scored two goals in the end. It was crazy game and it happens..

2158~~~
He's better on the ball than Sol Campbell ever was, imo. Jones has all the potential to be a world class centreback. Smalling, too.

2159~~~
Phil Jones is the perfect example of how Redcafe reacts almost on a match by match basis.
If he isn't one of the weaker players (not literally, obviously with him being a bulldozer) in the team then I guess we don't need to bother with any transfers this summer.  When you think about who should be improved upon, I don't think anyone is any worse than him, and yet most people want to see an improved squad?

2160~~~
Have to say I was nervous watching him today, we weren't troubled that much at the back yet he seemed to be stretching and lunging a lot of the time, the team as a whole looked composed for most of the game but he looked out of place with and without the ball.

2161~~~
Great post mate.

2162~~~
He still has a few dodgy moments in him, but he really has come on in the last month or so. I remember it used to drive me crazy how indecisive he was bringing the ball out - he'd come to about the half-way line, put his foot on top of the ball, think about it for a second and then pass back. Now he's driving forward, skipping past would-be tacklers and basically showing the same kind of promise he did in his first season here. Jones and Smalling has the making of an excellent partnership. I'd even be tempted to pass on the likes of Hummels and go with these two, with Rojo, and dare I say it, Evans as back up.

2163~~~
Put it this way - if there were a 23 year-old defender from Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, etc. who was displaying the promise that Phil Jones is currently showing, we'd be desperate for United to sign him. If he can stay healthy, things are really starting to look up for Jones (and Smalling.)

2164~~~
Two months ago, I would have completely agreed with you, but that's not the Jones that has been on display since the Tottenham game.

2165~~~
Valencia is the most glaring example to me (although I love how versatile he has been.) I think a top-notch RB would make a huge difference.

2166~~~
Was impressed with Jones. He was a bit nervy early on, and dodgy on the ball at times, but was an absolute monster defensively. Hope we stick with this partnership for a while.

2167~~~
I think in terms of performance he's pretty similar, in my opinion (obviously completely different in the way he plays) . 
Does the job, makes mistakes, sometimes doesn't, occasionally does something decent (when he sprinted back and guided the attacker (Silva was it?) out for a goalkick in the box today).

2168~~~
Super post

2169~~~
Don't get me wrong, I'm quite happy with the job Valencia has done. However, I think we could clearly use an upgrade, especially when you consider it isn't his natural position and he isn't that young anymore. Jones, on the other hand, is still young and is finally getting a proper run in the position that best suits him (rather than being shunted out to RB or into a DM role.) He's still rough around the edges, but the potential is there for all to see.

2170~~~
Yeah I agree, Valencia isn't ideal but he does enough of a job that it puts the priority of signing a RB down a peg for me, although we definitely need one sooner rather than later.  
I'm quite happy with Jones being given the proper chance too.  I just don't agree with those that are saying everyone is undeservedly having a go at him.  He's been poor prior and has had a couple of ok games where he still fannys about a bit but gets away with it.  People were crying out for 2 new CBs not that long ago.  While I think Jones is one of the weaker links in the team at the moment, given his age it'd be worthwhile seeing what he's like paired with a genuinely decent CB and how he progresses.

2171~~~
I was nervous about him but he had a good game. Credit where its due.

2172~~~
He's a significantly better footballer than Smalling, how anyone can think differently is beyond me. He actually looks like he has some fundamentals while smalling looks like he's having a constant battle with the ball. We can't play both of them at the same time in the long run imo, just not good enough with the ball at their feet which is crucial in todays game as most of the heavy hitters in europe press defenders. 

Rojo and Evans just aren't good enough for the level we aspire to, so we pretty much have to hit the market for a center half. The only reason I'd have him as back up to smalling is because I think smalling is a better more dominant center half(reminds me of chiellini) than him, but he'd be a more than able second choice imo. Neither stays fit for too long so its good to have both at the club.

2173~~~
Its fairly obvious why. Jones needs plenty of space on the ball. If hes closed down he has a habit of running himself into trouble and then punting it long in panic. His ball play is looking better at the moment because he is learning to aim his long balls at Fellaini, but hes definitely not better on the ball than Smalling right now, or Rojo.

Hes a reactionary blood and guts defender. Smalling is not.

2174~~~
I was impressed with him today. I thought he had a very good game, bar the first 15 mins where most of the team seemed to have fallen asleep.

2175~~~
The poor passing tells a wrong story. The times Jones and Smalling misplaced long balls - was because they were under heavy pressure from City and we still insisted on using them to play our way out of defense. If anything - they did brilliantly for not getting into dangerous positions after the break

2176~~~
I think some want every defender to be a Rio, Nesta type who is elegant on the ball and rarely go to ground. Because of that some will be overly critical of a CB like Phil Jones.

2177~~~
Was he injured?

2178~~~
No. van Gaal explained that he wanted to give Rojo some minutes, so he took off Jones for that. Plus, at that point, we were already in control, so it was better to get Rojo in to sustain possession at the back.

2179~~~
Said it before and I'll say it again, Jones will always look nervy on the ball when he's playing at left centre half. Imagine being pressed by your biggest rivals in arguably the biggest game of the season yet and the ball is constantly on your weaker foot. Whilst looking uncomfortable, I thought he did well on the ball all things considered.

2180~~~
Seriously, Smalling is terrible with the ball at his feet...did you see him when he tried to bring the ball out? Smalling is just terrible on the ball by any measure.

2181~~~
Neither of them are particularly good at bringing the ball out (although both are getting better). What Smalling is far better at is keeping the ball safe at the back. Jones gets himself into trouble far too easily. Smalling knows to play it to a teammate before it gets to that stage.

2182~~~
Always said the only thing stopping Jones from being a top player is his injury problems. He's brilliant.

2183~~~
Really I'd say his lack of a brain is the main thing! Always looks like he's concussed in games, he fills me with dread like an accident waiting to happen.

2184~~~
If that's the way he seems to you, maybe he's not the one who's concussed.

2185~~~
Don't think a player without a brain gets into this LvG team right now. Especially not a 23 year old centre back.

He's clearly more switched on than people give him credit for.

2186~~~

2187~~~
from that vid you can clearly see that smalling has the responsibility of marking the little argie. which gives jones more of the ball and more time which is perfect.  they have both looked sharper in the past 4 weeks. keep them as a pairing and don't faff with it.

2188~~~
He's 'raw' still but he's been a good buy. You hope he will keep on improving but I've no complaints. We can talk about them being beaten by aguero but he's world class. He's got a good record against us so Jones and Smalling need to watch his movement and learn from it.

2189~~~
i've not been his biggest fan but he's playing better let's hope he doesn't do an evans and back slide. but for me those two are first choice cb's until the end of the season. they've played some good strikers lately and they can get better.

2190~~~
Its official that this lad has no luck. He's had a run of games where he's played really well, and he's injured for the Chelsea match. Sadly sums up his career thus far. I'm gutted.

2191~~~
Hopefully it's just a week and no more. Fingers crossed.

2192~~~
Ye, well Van Gaal said in his press conference that Jones was close for the Chelsea game, which hopefully means he'll definitely be fit for Everton.

2193~~~
And that is why I think it might just be best to cut ties in the Summer, We cannot possibly carry on preserving with the 3 injury amigos next season.

2194~~~
Is it simply case of luck again because at times something tells me football is bad for his health.

2195~~~
We've got 75 starts in 38 games from the 4 senior CBs (Smalling, Jones, Rojo and Evans) - that's one short of 2 per game. It would be nice if Smalling and Jones stayed healthy enough to start significantly more than half the games but, when it comes down to it, that's why you carry 4 senior CBs. In the current situation there would be a whole lot less gnashing of teeth if Evans hadn't got himself the 6 game suspension. Then we wouldn't be dipping into the junior ranks again (although we would be starting Evans - which, to my mind, might be worse than dipping into the juniors).

2196~~~
The problem is we have also turned players who weren't injured much at all in Shaw and Rojo into injury prone as well somehow.  So who do we even buy ?

And people want a already quite Injury prone Hummels.<img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

2197~~~
I thought he was actually getting somewhere. I remember reading, when he was injured at some point this season, he was taking up yoga then he returned and managed to stay fit for several weeks if I'm not mistaken (which for Jones must be some sort of record) then he got injured again... returned... and is injured yet again. 

I'd still probably keep him, though. Partly because I'm not sure who would realistically take him on due to his injury record and we'd probably get a mediocre fee for him.

2198~~~
As soon as he starts gaining some momentum he gets injured. Always seems to happen.

2199~~~
He should definitely be kept, we just shouldn't be relying on him as much. Sign a new CB, sell Evans and push Jones slightly further down the pecking order.

2200~~~
Yeah, would be a mistake to sell him, but he shouldn't be a first team starter in the long-term unless his fitness and overall game both improve.

2201~~~
True. The problem is, that there isn't a hell of a lot of choices out there unfortunately

2202~~~
It's Friday, why not.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4X6VRVeNwo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2203~~~
Aye, having him and Smalling compete for the same spot in the team seems fair. Whoever can stay fit the most wins.

2204~~~
Maybe it's all one & the same problem. Considering how many opposition players he's managed to hurt, you gotta figure Jone's been dealing out some pain in practice games as well.

2205~~~
So long as he's only out for the one match, it's not an issue at all.

2206~~~
I love Phil Jones <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2207~~~
His injury record is completely woeful but he is only 23 years old so it would be absolutely crazy to just cut ties with him this summer. If we are bringing in a proper CB this summer then he will be a great squad option to have in the future. 

This recent injury shouldn't be blown up to much...it was only a week to be fair to the guy! He's not going to make it is he <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2208~~~
I'd rather we got rid of Jones and brought in a more dependable backup, even if they don't have the same potential as him.

2209~~~
Unfortunately, I doubt it. It's the same fear I have with Smalling. Whilst Smalling has been impressive this season, I have doubts whether we'll ever be able to rely on him consistently.

2210~~~
Who has he actually properly injured? Where is this long list of Jones victims?

2211~~~
Shh, no facts. Only dreams now.

2212~~~
Well, Milner limped off after his tackle in the City game while he made Lallana woozy in the Liverpool game.

2213~~~

2215~~~
Lallana is built like a 13 year old, and can barely run after an hour. 

The list just doesn't exist. Jones has injured himself more than other people.

2216~~~
To be fair, I'm fairly certain Jones was actually attempting to murder Lallana, so the fact that he was simply a bit groggy afterwards was a decent outcome for him.

2217~~~

To have injured his whole body and still have a return date of 26th April, he must have the recovery powers of a superhero.

2218~~~
By <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiejackson" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jamie Jackson</a> - 
Phil Jones is hopeful of signing a new deal at the club with negotiations ongoing regarding the 23-year-old’s fresh terms. The central defender’s current contract expires at the end of next season and it is thought Jones will follow Chris Smalling in committing his future to United until at least 2019.

Although Jones is currently injured he and Smalling have impressed Van Gaal in the seven times they have played together this year, though this small number of appearances in tandem continues to question their ability to form a regular partnership.

Van Gaal still favours adding at least one central defender in the close season, Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels remaining the manager’s No1 choice.

2219~~~
I wouldn't mind if Jones re-signs too. Though he can frustrate me there is definitely potential there to work with.

2220~~~
Need to get him signed too along with De Gea. He is improving quickly and is still a baby in defenders terms with great attributes.

Rafael unfortunately seems unlikely right now.

2221~~~
It could be sunburn.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2222~~~
Fecks sake you just panicked me... I thought he was injured again!

2223~~~

2224~~~
when i saw the thread bumped with this title, i thought he was injured again <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

2225~~~
best CB U23 in the world? who could that be?

the only one <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2226~~~
Zaha better than Erikson according to that and Michael Keane better than Laporte.

2227~~~
Yes it was a lovely ball, but as he had acres of space and nobody bothered challenging I would expect him to be able to do that.

2228~~~
These bloody stats. I wish someone would ban them from here.

2229~~~
I just love the way our supporters underrate Phil Jones

feck you people and have a nice day <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2230~~~
He can be a turn over player, to injury prone to be a regular starter, like was Wes Brown.

2231~~~
He's a liability.

2232~~~
They've played together 7 times this season. I guess that's down to the whole R/LCB thing? Otherwise that's shocking.

2233~~~
His passing can be a bit nervy and he's quite injury prone, but he's a terrific defender when he actually plays. His pace and aggression is <i>exactly</i> what we need against teams that counter-attack against us.

It's weird that his stock has fallen recently whilst Smalling's has risen. I actually think that Jones has been the better of the two in the last few games they've played. He's not been caught out of position as often, imo.

2234~~~
I also think - contrary to popular opinion - Jones might go on to be much the better player of the two. He's struggled to adapt to the new responsibilities that comes with Van Gaal's "philosophy" but the defensive side of his game has come on a lot this season. He's very young for a top flight CB too.

2235~~~
Sure even though he completed the pass, it looked like he wasn't going to complete the pass and he was going to fall down and it scared me.

2236~~~
Hope the big man's back against Palace. Him and Smalling formed quite a partnership before he got injured.

P.S. What a ball!

2237~~~
Yes they did. Not sure if he will play though if he was previous injured as per LvG's policy.

2238~~~
He was on the bench against West Brom and just played for the u21s, he should be back in the side for Palace.

2239~~~
'Of the 20 games <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/phil-jones" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Phil Jones</a> has started at centre-back for United this season they have lost just three of them - home and away against Swansea and the 1-0 reverse to Southampton. United have registered six clean sheets and conceded 18 goals when Jones has lined up under Louis van Gaal.'

2240~~~
Not sure I agree, but only because I've been so impressed with Smalling this year. I think Jones and Smalling were starting to strike up a very promising partnership, until of course, injury struck. I'm not totally convinced that we need to bring in a Hummels-type this summer, as I feel Jones and Smalling could be special. I'd certainly bring in a veteran capable of stepping in when one of them inevitably gets injured. For me, RB is the position that absolutely must be upgraded this summer.

2241~~~
Agreed, very underrated on here.

2242~~~
Could go on to be better than Smalling? Yeah, that's fair. He is the younger player after all and always had big potential.

I worry about his playing style though. I asked before but has there ever been a top class CB with Jones' lack of grace? I think someone suggested Puyol....

Plus his style isn't exactly conducive to avoiding injuries either, which has been his main problem for a while now. He has an awful lot of developing to do and that won't happen if he can't stay fit for good stretches of time.

2243~~~
Someone needs to secretly record a Phil Jones training performance because he must be performing like Lahm on drugs. This is the third manager that thinks he's better playing out of position than players that actually play that position.

Friendly reminder that SAF once played him behind the striker to finish a match.

Just wait until De Gea gets injured and Valdes comes on to play CB so that Jones can play in nets.

2244~~~
We need him to stay fit. Our best perfommer so far.

2245~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

But our left back is always injured. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2246~~~
Who do you want to play LB?

2247~~~
I'd rather Young or Blind to be honest, Evans can play too.

It's more of a comment on his view to managers though. Usually players with a bit of finesse, calmness and who are ambidextrous are thrown about the team but I don't see it with Jones albeit he did do a decent job at CM once or twice. Both managers have had no qualms with breaking up our ever changing CB pair. Which reminds me - remember the Smalling at right back obsession?

2248~~~
Did decently at LB tbf though was slightly getting tucked in too much and attacking ball like a CB.

Was good today overall.

2249~~~
Young was our best player, there was no point limiting him by pushing him back to LB and Blind was needed in midfield. Evans could have played there but he'd just be another CB playing out of position.

2250~~~
Clearly not a left back. Evans or Blind would of made much more sense going there.

2251~~~
I thought he did fine given he was way out of position in a role I don't think he's ever played before.

2252~~~
He played there vs Bayern IIRC last season. Don't remember him playing there anywhere else though. 

I think LVG put them there because of his pace vs Zaha and Bolasie. Evans would have been ripped apart and Removing Blind would have meant reshuffle of whole midfield.

2253~~~
Left back? fecking left back?!

What is LVG smoking?

2254~~~
I have a feeling he'll take a penalty for us in the not too distant future.

2255~~~
Yeah he played there last season in the closing stages of the home match vs Bayern, when Buttner went off injured. Robben didn't have much of the ball when big Phil moved there. What a man.

2256~~~
He already has, it was dreadful.

2257~~~
This and this. We were already losing the midfield and had to make the best of a bad situation.

2258~~~
Our best defender again today. Actually bothered challenging for the ball unlike the other defenders

2259~~~
Oh yeah, against sunderland in the league cup...

Thanks for having to remind me of that awful shootout. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2261~~~
I thought he was decent. Did alright when he moved to LB too.

2262~~~
Was our best defender yesterday. Great move by LVG to react by putting him LB, meant we could keep possession better with Blind in the middle and manage Bolasie with him being a fantastic 1v1 defender. Can't wait for him to establish himself as one of the best in the league next season (if he stays fit of course).

It was hilarious, but he has actually played quite well

Him and Smalling easily our best two centre backs 

I still expect us to acquire a new one in the summer

2281~~~
He is an accident waiting to happen I feel uncomfortable watching him.

2282~~~
It's the fact he was struggling to see the ball until he put his monocle back on that kills me.

2283~~~
Jones points to the ball then plays it back.

2284~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's a worrying CB but he's entertaining.

2285~~~
Oh someone needs to get on manip duty with this. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2286~~~
I think he has absolutely everything you need in a top class centre back but the number of brain farts he makes, particularly in big games, is absolutely ridiculous. I'm now losing faith in his ability to iron those out of his game.

2287~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2288~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant.

2289~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2290~~~
Bravo <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2291~~~
Some quality moments and some dodgy ones which is standard Jones, he's nothing if not entertaining.

2292~~~
Got away with murder today. Diabolical performance.

2293~~~
Absolutely love him!

2294~~~
He was fine. Solid 6/10 performance.

2295~~~
I love how terrified he is at the thought of giving away a chance. Crawls, swims, throws his head at the ball and does whatever it takes to stop it from happening. Brilliant.

2296~~~
Throughout all the madness Arsenal did not create a lot of good chances. He is going to make you scratch your head at times but, almost any good CB partnership needs a defender who plays with a bit of recklessness. Who will do anything to put out fires. Jones is that guy.

2297~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's got the bravery of Vidic, but the studs of Gerrard.

2298~~~
Possibly the greatest piece of defending the Premier League has ever seen.

2299~~~
He is 22 which is very young in defender terms. Even Rio didn't Iron out these kind of errors till much later.

2300~~~
Absolutely, but he also didn't make them with the frequency Jones did. More importantly he got consistent gametime from a very young age which allowed him to iron out those errors. Jones' injuries are preventing him from doing that.

2301~~~
Vidic is laughing somewhere. 

Love Jonsey. People forget his age. He will be a top defender in time.

2302~~~
I think he is worth another couple of seasons at least. I thought he bullied Giroud today and sent him into a shell.

2303~~~
He played well. Only brainfart was that stumble which ended up in him tackling Giroud with his face. Backpass fiasco was all De Gea's fault. He's a good defender and we're much harder to score against with him in central defence than we are without him. Still very young for a CB too. Think he can go on to be a top player for us. Definitely improved this season. Good to see.

2304~~~
Smalling and Jones, ftw. (Apart from today).

2305~~~
I agree. Sometimes he lacks a bit of a brain  but that will improve with time (i hope). The only thing that can stop Phil Jones to become a class CB are his injuries. 

Fergie loved him and Fergie hasnt been wrong about defenders very often so i still have high hopes for Jones.

2306~~~
100% commitment and effort. He has an amazing attitude and i have faith in him to become a good centre back like Lucio as he ages.

2307~~~
really a good lad.  can't ask more of his fighting spirit.   it's about time for him to replace his baby fat by pure muscles.   weight training and diet maybe the keys.  hope he can become a complete mature player in two years time

2308~~~
Jones or "Car Crash" as I affectionately call him, can be a liability, especially more recently. His "nick of time" defending is all due to bad timing and positioning. I did used to think he would partner Smalling regularly, but now I think differently. Slightly better than Evans. We need a quality CB to play with Smalling.

2309~~~
still not convinced by him but he does try to cover his shit. like a cat i guess. keep him sell evans

2310~~~
I think we're much better when Smalling's the aggressor and Jones is covering, as weird as that may sound considering their styles.

2311~~~
He's a total bomb scare. There was one moment in the first half where he was positioned at left centre back, had the ball at his feet, and he passed it diagonally, towards where Herrera or Blind may have been. But they weren't there. So he chased the ball down (the ball that he had passed - to no one!) and then passed it back to Smalling. I genuinely can't remember ever seeing a player pass the ball to himself, until yesterday. History has been made.

I still love that maniac though.

2312~~~
I am starting to like him more and more for some reason. I keep forgetting how young he actually is, seems like he has been around forever. I would probably have Smalling partner a new CB, but would definitely keep Jones as the 3rd CB.

2313~~~
How distant a memory the start of the season is. Feels like years ago he was charging about making last ditch blocks covering for Evans and Blackett against Swansea and Sunderland?

2314~~~
Yes I remember that. Blind disappeared on him though. It was bloody funny like.

2315~~~
Thing is, he gets the job done more often than not even if it is a case of 99% of the journey being as bad as possible.

Surely he's on his way to 4th choice after the summer? Behind Smalling, Rojo and the expected CB transfer.

He's also got an eventual Phil Jagielka Everton replacement written all over him at some stage in his career at the moment.

And yet his antics, him as a person and even somehow that face is likeable throughout it all.

2316~~~
I prefer him to Rojo or Evans at centre back. Next season is his turn to make a big improvement, like Smalling has this season.

2317~~~
He's dodgy as f*ck.

2318~~~
He just needs to control how aggressive he is as a central defender and not ruin our defensive shape, and I think he'll be perfect to start for us regularly, though that's a tough ask especially with many defenders nowadays being overaggressive in their game.

He has all of the tools of a great central defender. He just needs them to be refined, and so far, his skills are being more refined with progress being made. He hasn't stalled in his progressive for some time under van Gaal, so I do think that he'll eventually make things difficult when van Gaal selects his right central defender.

2319~~~
World class pal, world claaaasss.

2320~~~
He's better than Rojo. If it weren't for fitness issues for both of them, I'd be perfectly happy with him partnering Smalling at the back next season.

2321~~~
I believe that Jones is not ready to be a first teamer at a top club. TBH I wonder if any of our defenders are. He does have passion and can hold himself up on the pitch but he certainly lack the necessary intelligence, composure and positioning needed at this level. He's not at Blackburn anymore.

Honestly I sometimes wonder if SAF had done Smalling & Jones justice by signing them so early in their career only to then put them as right backs. In one hand the tactic made sense. Rafael was made of glass, we had Rio and Vidic in the team and its better to gain experience than stay on the bench. Having said that, maybe 1-2 years on loan playing in their natural role would have been better for them. 

Anyway I believe that we desperately need 1-2 CBs. If Smalling and Jones are truly good enough than they will win their place back.

2322~~~
I can't understand why both Jones gets such a hard time. People should be careful what they wish for because you hear these foreigners getting talked up as being Ferdinand and Vidic rolled into one and they get over here and can't hack it. I really do think that CB's in the Premier League have it far harder than anywhere else in the world. Not only do they need to be hard as nails and strong in the air to cope with big lumps like Benteke/Walters/Carroll etc.....they are also expected to be capable of pinging 60 yard passes and bring the ball out of defence.

2323~~~
It's Strange. You'd fancy him to keep the best players in the world - Ronaldo, Aguero, Suarez - relativley quiet, yet you would be scared of him making huge mistakes against Jonathon Walters.

2324~~~
How many serious errors has he made this season?

I think he gave away a daft penalty and then had that daft look on his face afterwards. He gave away a couple last year too IIRC.

2325~~~
Am I the only who liked that crawling header? Any other defender in that situation might have given it up. Except maybe John Terry, who would've been praised to high heavens.

2326~~~
You'll be lucky to find a Vidic and there's no one like Rio. However there's plenty of defenders better than Jones.

2327~~~
I get a bit worried every time he attempts to control the football.  And when he moves in the direction of a 50/50 challenge.

Top marks for lunacy, commitment & bravery though.

2328~~~
Love Phil Jones, probably my favorite United  player now that DDG is leaving

2329~~~
I like him very much. Needs to get over the injury issues though; those injuries are only stumbling blocks in Smalling and Jones becoming top players for this club.

2330~~~
Looked jittery today on the ball but took that punch like a boxer!

2331~~~
Although he give away the ball quite a bit today, I thought he had a decent enough game defensively. He wasn't the only one, though. When our defenders have the ball, there's literally no one showing for them, which often means they hesitate and end up taking extra touches and get tackled or they hoof in up the pitch.

2332~~~
Shouldn't be starting games for a club with our ambitions, he's not good enough.

I'd be delighted to get 10-15m for him in the summer.

2333~~~
I liked how he gave away the ball to win it back a moment later, once it happned three times within 15 seconds.

2334~~~
He's a mistake away from costing us dearly.  He has good energy and can take on runners well but he loses his balance too easily and is sometimes a moment too slow in reacting.  He might be okay as a backup but he is simply not good enough if we want to chase titles.

2335~~~
I thought he was very solid today, made a lot of good interventions, headers and clearances. I'd like to see the stats.

Some joke posts above. Funny how he's always looking like he's going to cost us, yet never actually does. He makes funny faces, falls over a bit and overhits the odd backpass but he's no clown like Mangala etc.

2336~~~
He plays without his head, and that's a problem. If he can't improve that now, he won't become a starter imo

2337~~~
He defended well today but his distribution was horrendous. He must have misplaced at least 7 passes today.

2338~~~
Probably his worst season at United. Injuries have been a massive hindrance to his development. 

Needs to play with his head up and bring calmness to his play. 

5/10

2339~~~
agree.

But us getting Otamendi means LvG is going to play different permutations.

2340~~~
It didn't bother me at all that he got punched in the stomach today.

2341~~~
I'd give him a 6 or 7, I thought he looked solid in most games.

2342~~~
Statistical MOTM according to WhoScored thanks to all his 15 clearances.  Never seen anybody have that many before, but I am sure it has happened especially by defenders in the worse teams. 3 tackles and 2 interceptions which was the (shared) third highest after Rojo and Blind.

2343~~~
I'm glad he didn't retaliate and get a red. Others wouldn't have been so restrained.

2344~~~
Very rarely happens though does it? In reality, you know.

2345~~~
I'm not, our team lacks balls. Can you imagine if that was Stam? Vidic? I'm not saying go punch him in the face, but a slight reaction would have been good.

2346~~~
His contract is up next summer, right?

2347~~~
That's a lot of clearances for someone who doesn't have any anticipation or positional skills. Must've been all last ditch attempts <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2348~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> yeah thats right, should've gone all Fellaini on his sorry ass!

2349~~~
It also amazes me how a braindead defender like Phil Jones can also consistently get interceptions.

2350~~~
He is also the highest rated defender of the PL season and finished top 10 in WhoScored's overall ratings for the season.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/4311/Stages/9155/PlayerStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/25...erStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015</a>

2351~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
That's not what I meant, but at least have a go or something.

2352~~~
Yeah Jones gets highly rated because he has a high workrate, so he gets more of everything done than almost any CB in the league. Unfortunately he tends to ruin that with dodgy passes and choices leaving openings for the opposition. Rojo is in a similar position, he also gets rated highly but a few choices ruin his day

2353~~~
Which is a very good thing, obviously. And reflects well on him as a defender. 

Don't remember any "dodgy choices" yesterday. Sounds like you're stretching for reasons to criticise.

2354~~~
Sad as it is to say, Phil Jones is just a bit short of being a top top player, I do believe that he still could be but it would mean him having an injury free season (unlikely), a regular partner (also unlikely) and most importantly have the total faith of his manager (which is possible with a good pre-season)
It's an old cliche but this season could be make or break for him.....I hope it's the former.

2355~~~
I think it reflects very well on him that he didn't.

2356~~~
Can Jones and Smalling finally stay fit for an entire season? If they can then I maintain that we don't need any additional centrebacks (unless we get rid of Jonny Evans).

Really want to see a Jones/Smalling partnership for the next 10 years.

2357~~~
I thought he had an ok season and he definitely improved as the season went on. Still not convinced by him though.

2358~~~
I'd hazard a guess that he's been heavily involved in at least 2/3 of the goals we've conceded against top teams when he's played. He has a lot of very good qualities but he consistently makes mistakes, I don't see how anyone could argue against that.

2359~~~
I actually thought he had one of his better performances of the season yesterday. He's got to improve next season because hopefully if we do sign another centre half he's going to be spending a lot of time on the bench.

2360~~~
2/3 of goals we've conceded against top teams? Care to name any examples? I don't think he's even played in many of the big games this season. He makes mistakes but there are two types of mistakes a defender can make (a) those resulting from being a shit defender and making positional and not reading the game well and (b) those from losing concentration or panicking . I'd say he's making more of the latter which isn't particularly worrying for someone who's young. I'd be more concerned if he was a Luiz or Mangala with no defensive instincts.

2361~~~
He wouldn't have been playing if he had!

'this guy costs us against us every big team we play, the stats say it so'

'lets play him against all the big sides then'

'good idea batman'.

2362~~~
He's only played 7 games against 'top' opposition this season (Arsenal twice, Liverpool twice, Tottenham twice and City once). In those games we've only conceded four goals with him on the pitch (the Blackett OG, Aguero's first at OT in the league, Sturridge at Anfield in the league and Welbeck in the FA Cup). Possibly only Aguero's was partly Jones' fault, but even then there were others who were more culpable. And even the best defenders can get duped by the movement of a world class striker. Vidic wasn't shit in the air because he let Messi score a header off him.

2363~~~
For what it's worth, I think Jones is one of the most intelligent players in our squad. That's why he's been trusted by all of his managers, for club and country, since he was 18 years old. They always seem to want to shoehorn him into the XI, even if it means he ends up playing in a position in which he's not a natural.

Granted, the guy looks like an idiot and moves with the grace of a washing machine falling down a flight of stairs, but he's actually a huge asset to the team and massively underrated as a footballer.

2364~~~
That's the big issue for me. I agree that he isn't as stupid as he looks (though if he was he'd be too dangerous to let near the public anyway) but the inherent lack of grace in his game could be a hindrance in and of itself. Reminded of Ferguson suggesting it was a bad sign that one of our previous defenders (Kevin Moran maybe?) got hurt so often....

2365~~~
If he can stay fit and maintain the form that led him to be proclaimed Duncan Edwards mk2 then he will be a top top defender, He has a bit of everything. He does need to work on his footballing brain though and mainly his fitness.

2366~~~
Yes, I was surprised he wasn't signed up at the same time as Smalling even though I don't think he'll ever be good enough for what we need.

2367~~~
I think his main weakness right now is that occasionally he overhits his passes when he's put under pressure. That'll improve with experience.

The thing about him being injury prone through recklessness is overstated, imo.

2368~~~
His technique I think is an issue sometimes when passing. I've seen a fair few times that when passing it often 'flies' with no spin as if it had come off his ankle. I never feel comfortable with him on the ball and it might be a bit unfair but I don't think he'll ever be top class.

2369~~~
Please explain how this is possible.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.com/phil-jones/verletzungen/spieler/117996" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.com/phil-jones/verletzungen/spieler/117996</a>

2370~~~
Smalling and Evans are injured just as much but they aren't reckless, explain how that is possible.

2371~~~
It's my understanding that they train in a confined space with Phil Jones.

2372~~~
His main weakness is when we're in possession, cause his touch and passing is terrible.  Teams are picking up on this and do allow him to get the ball with space in front of him.  Then as soon as he brings it forward they close him down and we lose the ball, sometimes in dangerous areas.

His general defending is good..

2373~~~

Lad

2374~~~
Yeah you've basically just made this up based on nothing. He's among the top 5 in our squad this season based on fewest unstable touches and fewest number of times dispossessed and has a passing accuracy over 85%

2375~~~
well said.

2376~~~
Coming off injured.

Anyone remember the last time he got injured?

2377~~~
Man City home?

2378~~~
2 weeks ago??

<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2379~~~
Phil's not gonna last at the highest level eh? Either injured or having a brainfart. He's one of our players so feel bad for him. He just doesn't use his brain (sigh)

2380~~~
Too clumsy and got shit for brains!

2381~~~
It was a shit attempt at sarcasm.

2382~~~
Not the best from him today. He's not a right back but that's hardly a excuse. He's played there often enough.

2383~~~
He's awful enthusiastic, like a half-trained Labrador, that will lollop off to fetch a stick and then shit in your shoes.

2384~~~
Not sure if this has been posted yet:

Phil Jones doing his best to get himself injured.

2388~~~
Does he have only 1 year left? Wouldn't surprise me to see him sold if I'm completely honest. I'd imagine he'll get a renewal, but no chance Van Gaal will want him as one of the starting 2 cbs

2392~~~
just read he has signed a new 4 year deal with us.

2393~~~
Not sure if this is good or bad news

2394~~~
of course it is good news. Think him and Smalling will be a great partnership.

2395~~~
Not sure what he's done to deserve 4 years.

2396~~~
Protects us more than anything. He's what, 22? If he kicks on the next two years, then he'd only have a year left and we could get screwed over by him. If he doesn't improve in the next two seasons he'll be shipped out and we'll get a half decent fee since he'd have 2 years left on contract.

2397~~~
I imagine it's for insurance purposes... as a way to cover ourselves for death in service.

2398~~~
His detractors on this forum must be confused. He's a top defender. Every manager he's worked under seems to think so, and now LvG has joined the club. I assume they've all watched his performances rather than been swayed by internet memes.

2399~~~
Really? He's one of the most haphazard footballers I've ever seen at the club. A disaster or injury waiting to happen. What he's demonstrated beyond that to earn an extension baffles me.

2400~~~
I think managers look at his physical attributes and think that if they can only find a way to train his brain he'd be a top CB.

2401~~~
He's has his problems with injuries but his recklessness as a defender is massively over-stated. How many goals have we conceded due to him over-commiting in a tackle? Can't remember him ever conceding a pen. He's never been sent off and never missed a game for accumulated bookings. I don't think he's as reckless as people make out.

2402~~~
Has he definitely signed a new contract?

2403~~~
He certainly has talent. Some way from being a top defender yet though and needs to kick on over the coming years.

At 22 though giving him a new contract is a no brainer.

2404~~~
There's no confirmation of this. It's just some rumour making the rounds at various sources, but there's nothing from Man. Utd. themselves as of yet.

2405~~~
For me, we just seem to play at our worst when Jones is part of the team during the last season or so. Everything is so laboured, in great part due to Jones and Valencia's 'link-up' play. The last thing I want to see next season is any more of Valencia bombing down the right before stopping about 3/4 of the way down the pitch, hesitating, dropping his shoulder and passing meekly to Phil Jones, sho in turn meekly passes to whoever the nearest other team mate is. Ad infinitum. 

Also, I have just never rated his performances at the centre of our defence, its nervewracking stuff to see him starting there. Surely he's good enough to fill a John O'Shea type of role as a second stringer, but he shouldn't be getting regular football for us, he's simply not good enough.

2406~~~
Now imagine Terry and Cahill playing with Valencia as right back, marcos rojo as left back and Blind as DM.

that would be something so funny to watch. 

Smalling + Jones (and DDG of course) have been pulling miracles out of their asses game after game. But well... haters gonna hate and blah blah.

2407~~~
I think Smalling is easily a level above Jones, and should he get over his own injury troubles, could do a good job for us as a starter for years. Jones is a completely different matter, and it's imperitive that he is replaced in the starting XI by someone with a steadier head (that's not trying to tackle players three inches off the ground).

2408~~~
Pretty strange thing to say considering he played in the wins against Liverpool x2, Newcastle x2, Spurs and City and when he wasnt playing we lost against City, Chelsea, Leicester, Everton and West Brom. He only actually played in 3 losses which were Swansea x2 and Southampton

2409~~~
Conceded 1 this season against Newcastle.

We apparently conceded 4 this season - Shaw vs Everton, Blackett vs Leicester, Jones vs Newcastle and what was the 4th?

Edit: Rafael vs Leicester.

2410~~~
Yeah, I'm sure we'd have lost all of those games if matchwinner Jones hadn't started. As a club, we can - and must - do better than Phil Jones.

2411~~~
That was not the point of the post you quoted.  They were disproving a facetious claim you made.

2412~~~
Well you said we played at our worst when hes in the team while the fact is hes actually played in our best performances of the season but well done on the childish comeback

2413~~~
Were you genuinely happy with his performances last year? Do you think those performances were due to Jones's influence on those games, or despite them? Is it inconceivable that we would have played as well or better with a different player taking his place?

Do you think Phil Jones can stand shoulder to shoulder with any of the United centre backs of the last 20 years or so? Pallister, Bruce, Stam, Ferdinand, Vidic? Even those a level below, like Ronny Johnsen? Honestly, there's a lot of scope for improvement to the squad, and he's one of the first we should be looking at replacing with better.

2414~~~
I'm not saying the results we achieved were particularly bad when he played, but there were only a few of those where I was happy with the performances in general. It was painful to watch so many games last season, with that pairing I mentioned being a particularly troublesome aspect of that.

2415~~~
He should be grateful of the new contract but if he can't provide consistency and improvement then the questions are raised if should we go after other defenders in his age like Laporte or even Stones.

Could be his last contract in United if he won't change his ways.

2416~~~
He had a good season, he deserves the new contract.

2417~~~
In most of the games we were poor in the problems were a lack of creativity and cohesion further up the pitch while we had most of the ball rather than us conceding a load of goals so to insinuate that a player who did considerably more defensively than any of our other defenders and had a passing accuracy of 85% was one of the main problems is a bit of a reach. It seems people see what they want when it comes to Jones rather than any actual evidence

2418~~~
Pfft... You can prove anything with facts.

2419~~~
Yes.  Jones is statistically one of the best young centre backs in the world.  Its rather sad that he's been reduced to a meme in these waters.  Apart from the first Aguero goal at Old Trafford this season, I cannot remember him making a mistake that leads to a goal.  The only complain I have against him is that he doesn't take care of his fitness much.  If he were playing consistently at the back, he will be our best defender, heads and shoulders above everybody else.  Including Smalling.

FWIW our current centre-back du jour Chris Smalling was slated on this board after his atrocious performance away against City.  He bounced back.  In fact, before this season, he's had a pretty hit and miss record.  Smalling is 25.  Evans was finally written off by this board this season.  He's 27.  Jones is 22.

 I think its because of Jones, not despite him.  He remains our best ball-playing centre back.

  That depends.  If the player replacing him was Thiago Silva or Diego Godin then we would've played better.  The replacements from within the team were not too much better.

  How many of those were the finished article at 22, barring Ferdinand, who is a one-in-a-generation player? 

  Yes, but replacing all our promising young players is not the way to go about it.

 No.  We're supposed to get behind him and support him.  He clearly has the potential to be one of the best in the world.  Frankly we don't have a discussion if you don't think that is true.

2420~~~
Agreed.

2421~~~
well said.

2422~~~
It's interesting to see Jones be touted as a liability due to his playing style whilst most defenders aren't put in the same boat for playing a similar style. Koscielny isn't mentioned as a liability even though he's a very aggressive defender who loves to win the ball quickly without any regard of Arsenal's defensive shape and structure. Ramos does the same for Real Madrid. Kompany under Mancini (when he was the "best defender" in the League) was also very rash; he conceded lots of fouls and played very instinctively. Pepe used to do this until he matured and controlled his tendencies to become a more dependable defender. Otamendi, like Pepe, also transformed himself to be more dependable as he got older.

There are so many defenders like Jones today who either do not control themselves and remain rash for their whole career or become more dependable only during their late 20's. From what I have seen, Jones may either become reliable during his late 20's or, if he continues to improve at this rate, become dependable 2 years sooner, possibly.

Did he sign that new contract yet? He seems to have been on the verge of signing it for a while now. Starting to get  litte bit worried.

2425~~~
i don't think he's back from vacation yet.

2426~~~
I think smallings rise to prominence is due to the possesion style of football we play rather than him being actually better than jones because before last season; i think most of us rated jones higher. 

Saying that; alot has to do with how his surrounding players are.  In an ideal scenario you woukd have two ball playing defenders covered by a tenacious DM like Schneiderlin meanhwile 2 Hardcore CB's like Jones &  Rojo should in theory be covered by someone like carrick.

2427~~~
Not sure I understand the logic there, as I see it Jones is the better ball-player but Smalling is the better defender.

2428~~~
We need him gone ASAP.

2429~~~
you know this is not going to happen

Why bother posting it?

2430~~~
With each passing year it may become harder for him as we'll be adding new defenders. He may easily not make it in a long run but while he's 23 there's still some chance to reverse the tide.

2431~~~
What does that mean? The fact is I want him gone.

2432~~~
Hope he signs a new deal. One of my favourite players at the club. With more experience, I still maintain that he can be a very good centre back.

2433~~~
I feel the same but he's English so he'll get another contract for sure.

2434~~~

2435~~~
Beat me to it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Good stuff, hoping to see some major improvement over the coming years.

2436~~~
Four more years of the prettiest face in football <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2437~~~
Good news!

2438~~~
Oh bloody hell, seen some guy signing some paper on facebook, thought it was some new transfer and it's just our juggernaut. 

Good news anyways I guess.

2439~~~
Eat it, <a class="username" data-user="66634, @Offside" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66634/">@Offside</a>!

Jones: "I'm delighted to have signed a new deal. This is a great club to be part of and I can't wait to start the new campaign."

Louis van Gaal on Jones' contract: "Phil is a talented footballer with great versatility and can play in a number of positions."

2441~~~
It means why waste your time posting somethng that has no chance of happening

2442~~~
And he's signed a new contract. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2443~~~
Great stuff, Woody! Get them signing and resigning while they're hot! Sloth is here to stay...wahaaaaay!

2444~~~
Yup, I'm delighted about him and Smalling signing new deals

2445~~~
As he should. Even if he ends up not "making it" he'll be a very good squad player for us.

2446~~~
Me too.

2447~~~
Good news! Now, if he can just stop injuring himself and others, he might reach his supposed potential.

2448~~~
Great news, big Phil is still young and I think there is alot more to come from him<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2449~~~
Very bad news. Not good enough.

2450~~~
Van Gaal considering him as a right back? Or am I looking into that statement too much? I can't much see LVG seeing Jones as a midfielder like Fergie did.

2451~~~
Who needs new signings when you've got Phil Jones until 2019 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

This sounds sarcastic but I'm genuinely happy with the news. Even if you don't think he's first team quality, surely no one can argue he's not even a useful squad player?

2452~~~
Glad he has been re-signed. Not so happy about the multiple positions comment. Don't want to see him at RB or in midfield again.

2453~~~
The multiple positions thing will only come into play if we have an injury crisis at RB or CDM. It's a nice option to have, but I don't see van Gaal making Jones a regular anywhere other than central defence.
