1~~~
Looking good so far v MK Dons.. already better than Cleverley.

2~~~
Looks enthusiastic which is more than we can say for a certain mr powell. Clearly talented. Been awful too many times for u21s but maybe he would step up really well, like januzaj

3~~~
Been the one bright light tonight, for me.

4~~~
Looks like we found the next Scholesy.

5~~~
Watch that Lucas silva vid and watch this kid play.. similar. This boy can play, we need to push him into the first team squad.

6~~~
Wow played really well the last 20 mins, I know it's just MK dons but kept the ball better than several experienced players and pinged some nice long passes. I liked him a lot

7~~~
Wilson looked good again for me... but yes that is about it

8~~~
Only positive today for me.

9~~~
Looks a player.

10~~~
Why did LVG even shift Pereira deeper with a tired Anderson while keeping Cheech ?

We crumbled from that point once he had to play midfield alone.

Were building some momentum with him as AM as well.

11~~~
Not a surprise he and Wilson looked the best tonight. Probably the most talented - and likely to break through - of the youth team.

12~~~
Needs to be in the squad on Saturday. Already better than all our CM's besides Herrera and he is only 18.

13~~~
Him and Wilson made me proud

14~~~
Some fairly good moments, a decent cameo. Showed he should be more in contention to get a game in CM than Powell or Anderson

15~~~
Yep thought for a while he is one of the few youngsters with the required quality. One of the few bright sparks.

16~~~
Played alright but needs to be along side a defensive midfielder...Not Anderson.

17~~~
It was nice to see Pereira and Wilson get on the pitch tonight, they were the only highlights in an otherwise dire night for the club.

Says something about their character to come on in that scenario and still put in a good performance.

18~~~
The only player who was trying to do something out there.

19~~~
I said the kid is ready before.  Impressive today. He just gave me the impression that although he wasn't always great in the 21s, he would be in the first team.

Hope to see more of him, better at football than the likes of Cleverley easily.

20~~~
Thought he did very well. Made a few mistakes, but he never stopped fighting and looked the only player capable of creating something. Wilson did very well also. Vermijl did well enough, but I'm not going to praise a defender when we've conceded 4 goals even though you could really only attribute the 3rd goal to him. The rest were beyond terrible. I hope Pereira and Wilson get rewarded for their displays because they genuinely tried their best out there. A place on the bench against Burnley would be a great moment for both I'm sure.

21~~~
Better than either of the other 4 who played in midfield.

22~~~
Our best reserve prospect alongwith Wilson. Really reminds me of Gundogan for some reason. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

23~~~
Looks good this kid, main thing is he's positive, always looking to play an incisive pass or take someone one unlike most of our midfielders who are just static and can't pass. 

He should be loaned out if he's not given games here but with our injuries problems and lack of talent in CM, I don't see why he shouldn't be getting minutes. Maybe a kneejerk but surely he can't be worse than Cleverely/Anderson and possibly even Fellaini?

24~~~
Yep, him and Wilson.

25~~~
Him and Wilson bright sparks in a major lulwut show.

26~~~
Depends where you want him to play really. He was soft as shit on the fourth goal so central midfield looks a little beyond him at the minute. He was good on the ball though.

27~~~
He needs to be along side a lot of things he wasn't tonight.

Was a bit worried he'd be slow to step up like he was to the U21s but he did great today or as good as he really could be out there. Was covering ground, pressing high, tracking deep, putting in some physical challenges and was the only one trying to push the game. Unfortunately for him he was practically out there on his own. Give the lad some more minutes.

28~~~
Burney are better than MK Dons so I wouldn't get too excited by him just yet. We are desperately short of experience in midfield so chucking in a good prospect may be more damaging than you think

29~~~
Not surprised as I've seen quite a lot of him in the junior teams, he's special.

30~~~
He has something. Unlike many who played tonight.

31~~~
He played well today. He needs to start playing more in midfield instead of a #10, but can't because Pearson and Rothwell have the midfield locked up.

32~~~
He made some nice passes but also gave the ball away cheaply far too frequently. Clearly talented, but I don't think he's ready for a starting spot in the first team at the moment.

33~~~
Him and Wilson - the only players to take any sort of credit from today.

34~~~
Milton Keynes Dons supporters would have thinking that he's their player.

35~~~
Not saying to start him or even bring him on, but even being in the squad at such a young age would be a great experience. Not like we have too many subs in midfield anyway.

36~~~
Can we just scrap everything and start again with Januzaj Welbeck Wilson up front terrifying people, let them gel for 3 years while we finished mid table and then just win the CL

37~~~
Why?

38~~~
I like the way he moves the ball, and isn't scared to shoot or penetrate with a pass. He deserves more time in the future, looked head and shoulders over Anderson anyway.

39~~~
Because he put some effort in this match.

40~~~
I tend to agree with this. I counted 3 good moments and 3 errors; one of which was deep in our half. Impressive performance but looks high risk if expected to play centre midfield in the PL this season.

41~~~
Of course not. Who is suggesting he gets a starting spot?

42~~~
Ya true. He was trying until the last minute which can't be said about the rest of the team.

43~~~
He did well. Our best midfielder both in terms of quality and energy. This guy and Wilson are definite silver linings on a surreal night.

44~~~
He looked bright, shame we're out of the League Cup as I would've liked to see him get some more first team action there. I doubt he's ready for Premier League football yet.

45~~~
Do you know who is playing for us in midfield if Herrera is not? Let me refresh your memory - Cleverley, Fellaini, Fletcher and Anderson. Can he really be any worse? If he isn't ready, then play him and make him ready. This way at least if we aren't spending big to bring a world class midfielder, instead of playing the shower of shite that we have, I would rather promote and see if things work out that way, like what happened with Januzaj last season.

46~~~
He actually pinged the ball round beautifully, and his moving of the ball was decent too. Obviously he wasn't being pressed much though so it probably make him seem a lot more comfortable, but he's got potential for sure.

47~~~
Maybe you're right and we should play him, considering the alternatives, but then we need to be prepared to forgive him a lot of poor performances.

48~~~
He gave the ball cheaply few times in this game when the opponents didn't even press that hard.Imagine it's against a PL team and we conceded a few goals from his mistakes.Our fans would have written him off immediately like they did with M.Keane tonight.

I would introduce him slowly into the team instead.

49~~~
Well Im not asking to start him tomorrow. Start him on the bench and give him 30 mins a week to see what he can do. With some of our CMs getting a chance to play in the first team, why not a youngest from our academy who has the potential to make it here. Why not start him a bit early and teach him things and he will be able to pick it up fast.

50~~~
Had some bad passes and some bad duels but he was good, he is already so much better than Cleverley, Ando.

51~~~
He did alright when he came on. Some nice passes and build up play, couple of wayward shots but showed some real promise on his debut.

52~~~
He is a promising talent but not ready yet.

Certainly not ready to play Central Mid in the prem at that.

He will have to breakthrough as a AM probably.

53~~~
He could do well in last minutes of some matches when the other team is tired. It would be interesting to see him if he would do okay if he was more pressed. well considering fletcher and cleverley as first option may seem as crazy as to start pereira instead of them..

54~~~
It'll be a joke from now on if Cleverley starts ahead of him. MK Dons or not, he shows more fight, determination and talent than Cleverley.

55~~~
Not ready yet for the prem but clearly has talent.  He seems like a go to player who is a ball magnet, very involved, which is a good sign.

56~~~
I was really impressed with him today. His confidence and performance especially as we were getting battered is what I found most impressive. They would give him the ball and he was the one pinging it around. Anderson would just lay the ball off to him and he was bossing it a bit to be honest. So impressed and I hope he makes the bench vs Burnley.

57~~~
Have to agree, not just his impressive performance, looking to attack and invent all the time but amidst the gloomy circumstance it spoke volumes about his mentality, got the impression he was stalling a bit in his progression with the U21's but he seemed to be at home on the big stage, it defo has put a silver lining on the outcome of the game for me, along with Wilson who was also excellent.

58~~~
Yeah. Wilson and Pereira were really impressive. I'll be furious if Hernandez is preferred to Wilson vs Burnley. It might be a bit over the top but I would put Pereira on the bench vs Burnley too. I was that impressed and I'm not usually one to knee jerk.

59~~~
They are fine, they are stars of the future here as was suspected, that confirmed it big time, I am probably one of the few positive after that match having seen them perform in such circumstance, but I didn't expect any different from any of the other players, bar Januzaj who was a bit poor by his standards.

60~~~
Couldn't have been easy for him to come on when the team was playing how it was, he showed some promise though with his positive passing and wasn't afraid to shoot. How old is he again?

61~~~
Agreed! I've been watching this kid for a while now was pleased when I saw his name on the subs list, I think he deserves a real chance in the first team squad.

62~~~
18 right?

63~~~
Yep 18.

I can't tell whether he could end up as a CM or a #10 eventually. He's young so he still has time to grow and bulk up a bit. Definitely has the energy to be an Oscar-like player.

64~~~
Serious question, when people say a young player is not ready, how do they come to this conclusion? I'm not saying Pareira should be starting in CM for us but he clearly has the talent to be a top class player, so, why not ease him in gradually, here and there and get him ready. He's never going to be ready playing in the junior teams. I'm glad we have LVG, people will be surprised how fast he'll promote some of our young players.

65~~~
I think he showed enough in that team last night to warrant further opportunities down the line. Going out of the Carling Cup will limit opportunities but I think he did stand out. Especially once the side is settled and he's playing in a better team surrounded by more senior players.

66~~~
That's exactly what I thought.

67~~~
Good thing about LvG is he doesn't see age as a limitation. So rest assured if he thinks he can add something to the team then he'll get the chance I'm sure.

68~~~
Technically I think he's above any of our midfield players bar Herrera. The premier league is probably too much for him right now because of the added physical nature but I wouldn't be against seeing him get an odd appearance when we have settled down a bit. He does go missing from time to time but I definitely believe along with Wilson that he is United quality.

69~~~
If he did well, then these are the sort of characters we need right now. Those who won't shirk and hide and ultimately sink, but take on situations.

70~~~
If he's not going to form part of our squad, we should loan him out. Was really impressed with his technique, but more importantly, the bravery he showed last night.

Can add Wilson to that list as well.

Wouldn't mind too much if LvG wanted to work with the following squad for the season. He's already mentioned a squad of 20 odd would be ideal (and we're already out of the CoC).

This is assuming Kagawa*, Cleverley, Welbeck*, Chich, Fellaini etc are all sold/loaned out. Obviously don't think Fletcher will be loaned out etc. He should consider retiring at the end of the season if things don't improve.

(4-2-3-1)
DDG, Lindegaard

(4) Rafael, Smalling, Jones, Rojo, Shaw, Evans, Blackett

(2) Carrick, Herrera, CM, Perreira, Fletcher (?)

(3) Mata, Januzaj, AdM, Valencia, Young (Rooney)

(1) RvP, Rooney, Wilson

* would prefer keeping them, but the squad is already bloated and they need game time.

71~~~
Showed great potential for an 18 year old. He has a bright future ahead of him.

72~~~
But not a central midfielder.

73~~~
that 44 number looks to be magical. I wouldnt mind him having him on the bench next match. If anythink he looked like the player who is needed to bring on in CM if we need to score a goal. creative energic midfielder who can pass the ball with ease..

74~~~
He will play there long term I reckon. Do not be fooled by big Benick yesterday brushing him (as he did to our most senior centre-half too!) - Andreas can certainly look after himself. He's a lot more than just pretty.

75~~~
Played well last night I thought. Credit to him.

76~~~
One of the very few players (the others being Welbeck and Wilson) that actually came out of that game with a bit of credit. Showed more in that game than a lot of our other centre midfielders have recently.

77~~~
His performance was a surprise to me, when i was in the newbies, i bashed him constantly saying he will not make it here, he gets dispossessed too often, misplaces passes, ball greedy, not playing a pass at the right time and a few other things i thought he could never sort out.

I'm not an MUTV subscriber anymore, but if yesterday's game is anything to go by, he seems to have improved.

78~~~
I did the same.It was furious sometimes to watch him in the U18s/U21s.In fact he should be dropped for Weir/Harrop at the end of last season performance-wised.

79~~~
I think he looks to be the kind of polayer that will excel if brought into the main squad but could stagnate with another season of reserve football. Last night he showed the technique, pace and energy in midfield that could see him be an asset off the bench this season IMO. 

His passing was a bit loose at times but that is because he was trying things to get us back in the game, he was always looking to do that and take hold of the game which is more important, it showed the right attitude.

80~~~
I am not fooled. He has not played at CM before that I am aware of and I can see good reasons for that. To start with, at least, he should play in a more attacking role.

81~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/la-hg8NLi7o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Match comp is up. 

Uncropped because I don't think they take down Capital One Cup match comps.

82~~~
Need to keep him involved and training/travelling with the first team but another season in the U21s won't do him that much harm or atleast till January.

Also keep Pearson and Rothwell involved unless they are loaned out.

83~~~
Agree. That's the all part of these games for me and Fergie used this tournament in the same way.

84~~~
Even better performance than i thought after watching that.

Anyone else think he would be great in a deep midfield role for us?  Was impressive in his attacking play, but looked especially reassured when in a deeper position - Good interceptions/good use of short-passes and always finding a man with his mid-long range passing.

85~~~
Yes he has. It's just that he can't play in midfield due to Rothwell and Pearson playing. Same reason why Goss won't be able to play in midfield much and instead will have to opt for left back or lcb. You could say the same for Janko. He's a rb, but has been forced to play an attacking role due to having Varela at rb.

Pereira will end up in midfield not as a #10.

86~~~
Pearson and Rothwell offer very good examples of why I don't think he will be a central midfielder. And I am not convinced he would be played there even if they were not around.

I can see that in theory he has the tools for the middle but have my doubts about his engine and positional instincts.

87~~~
He could play in a 4-3-3, but I dont think he could play as midfielder in 4231.

88~~~
He did for our under 18's a year ago in the Milk Cup and won player of the tournament. I have no doubt that he will end up as a CM.

89~~~
Thought he did very well when he come on yesterday. One of our very few positives out of the game. Showed some nice touches and skill, and played some adventurous balls.

90~~~
Still too lightweight, got brushed off way too easily. Very nice on the ball but he still needs to become more consistent for the reserves.

91~~~
Looks like a natural number 8 to me

92~~~
Uploaded cropped and uncropped just in case the first one gets taken down.

93~~~
Some interesting points but he's got a great engine.

94~~~
Just for the sake of argument, what does Cleverley offer that Pereira doesn't?  A bit of experience, not quite such a pushover defensively, what else?  Pereira already looks better on the ball.

95~~~
Damn. He actually did better than I thought he did. If we aren't going to buy anyone, at least give the kids a run in the first team - Pereira, Pearson and Rothwell. Just don't go back to playing Cleverley and Fletcher. Try something different LVG. Kids who are good enough take the chances that are given to them like Januzaj last year. No one thought he was going to be as good as he was last season. Maybe one of the other kids could be like that this year.

96~~~
He goes missing in too many games. You need more consistency to play in the middle. 

Maybe in the long term but should start more attacking and would do better I think.

97~~~
Which basically says he is a #10 and a not a central midfielder.

98~~~
Yeah, he needs to influence games more consistently and so far this season, he has. I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, just the point about his engine.

99~~~
I think the same

Cleverley, Anderson and Fletcher are nothing players....i would rather play him than of this players again

100~~~
Still a bit lightweight to play with the big boys but has excellent technical ability.

101~~~
He's every bit a central midfielder. Again, another play that would most likely benefit from a shift to a genuine 433.

102~~~
No. He could play like this

           Carrick
  Herrera        Pereira, and thats no #10 role. He could also play like this
Herrera         Pereira
            Mata

103~~~
We could bring in Zoltan Gera and play a Herrera-Pereira-Gera midfield three. It would usher in a whole new -era.

104~~~
I don't think he's played a game in CM for the U21s/reserves, though there are several followers of the youth system that think he can become a CM.

I'm not convinced myself, but LVG is a great person to try to convert him.

105~~~
After the game I thought he played reasonably well, but after watching the vid. I actually think he was fantastic. He made more long successful passes in 30minutes than TC23 last season. He also looks to ping the ball around with ease "almost" like scholes used to do it, certainly the technique is there. We could dominate the game with him if we get him a good midfield partner. Someone like Carvalho. Actually I think he would do good with Jones. I am sure that van Gaal will watch him closely since tuesday.. Shame for him Pearson and Rothwell is a good pairing. He should not be used out wide anymore. I think he can become as good CM as CAM like Oscar but his future is in LVGs hands and I think it is clear that we have a lack of quality CM so he may be towards CM afterall. I think he should at least make the bench against Burnley..

106~~~
We the first one isn't a #10 but the second one is a central midfield role and you said he is not capable of that.

107~~~
I think this boy is getting a promotion. So will Powell and Wilson.

108~~~
Where did I say that?

109~~~
You said he couldn't play as a midfielder in a 4-2-3-1 formation.

110~~~
But that is a more CDM role normally, some CAM's, CM's play there but I think you need some experience to play there.

111~~~
Well not both midfielders in the 4-2-3-1 are CDMs. One of them usually is, which is the #6 and the other, #8 usually roams around and is more of a box to box.

112~~~
Yeah and the latter one is the one I dont think he can do (yet).

113~~~
Agree with Pereira and Wilson, but don't agree with Powell. He looked quite poor vs Mk Dons, got pushed off the ball so easily and his passing was really poor. Pretty much all he has is a nice shot, but other then that, he doesn't have much to his game.

114~~~
It's his first game after 6 months without any sort of pre-season.Give the lad time.

115~~~
Im confused here. But the formation you posted above had him as a #8, but you're saying he is not ready to do that?

116~~~
Yeah I know that, I'm just saying he's never really shown anything as a midfielder. He had a decent loan spell at Wigan, but as a striker. We'll see but it's way too soon for him to go in the first team.

117~~~
Hopefully gets a promotion this season, along with Wilson.

Wilson may well be third choice striker now, and rightfully so. Pereira could easily be fourth choice in midfield after Herrera, Carrick and whoever else we sign.

118~~~
If we sell Clev to Villa within the next 24 hours I wouldn't be surprised if Pereira plays on Saturday.

119~~~
The #8 in a 433 is quite different than in a 4231, normally in 433 the #10 drops back a bit lot more than in 4231 I have noticed, whilst on paper you barely see a difference. I havent seen much #8 in 4231 who are deep lying playmakers or am I wrong now? While at 433 I see it more often.

120~~~

121~~~
You only have to rewind 2 years to remind yourself of what people were saying about Cleverley(then look at him now) for you to remember to stop making declarations already. This place can be so weird(stupid) sometimes.

122~~~
To be fair, I doubt a 15 year old Cleverley was being chased by all of Europe's elite. Pereira was always on a different trajectory.

I can see him being involved from now on. He played very well on Tuesday, and LVG has spoken many times about age does not matter in his 'philosophy'.

To be honest, we used to think the same way. United fans (not you) often tend to be a bit hypocritical, at least in recent years with regards to youth. Players now are always 'not ready' to play, and the approach seems to be more cautious than before, although we love to brag that we basically invented giving youth a chance.

I am all for caution, but if the players in the first-team are crap, and that is exactly what most of them are in midfield - then the kids should play. Take away Mike Oliver and 75,000, put Fletcher, Cleverley, Pereira and a football in a park and I'm pretty confident who will come out looking the best footballer. Now he just needs a bit of trusting here and there.

123~~~
Just watched an 8 and a half minute compilation of his game, which is impressive given he was on the pitch for just 45 minutes. Looked really good looking back though. His passing seems more composed then most of our midfielders already (says more about our mids though, but he looks a class passer). Definitely needs to bulk up though, but I have high hopes for him. Has that touch of class to his game. Gave the ball away 3 or 4 times but that's not bad at all. 

Let's hope he works out.

124~~~
It's too early to say either way. I have long said that he's an attacking player and not a midfielder despite United's intent to convert him into one, but he needs more time in the middle of the park before any of us write him off. He has little experience playing in a midfield 2. At Crewe he was an attacking midfielder (from what I remember), and on loan he played as the striker, or as an attacking midfielder. The only time spent in midfield was the few games he played for United's first team, and a couple of games for reserves. He didn't play the whole season there because the reserves had a shortage of strikers and he started to play up top until he picked up a season ending injury.

I think Pereira will end up as part of a midfield 2 as well despite spending most of his time as a #10 for the youth team. I don't feel he's creative or aggressive enough in his passing to play that position like Januzaj did. He has the tools to play in midfield though.

125~~~
His best position is basically as the head of a 3 man midfield with 2 wide creative players besides him and a passer in behind. Don't think he has the positional discipline or the passing range to play CM in our kind of setup right now. Plus bit like Barkley playing him at CM limits his qualities somewhat. He will get better there if he plays more and improves positionally and becomes less casual as a CM but really i think right now even a Wing forward sort of role in a 3 suits him better.

There's something about him that screams talent though to me. He might be having a poor game and then he will burst into it and produce something out of nothing or do something Extraordinary a bit like Rooney you could say. Been terribly unlucky with injuries at the wrong times and long ones at that last 2 and some years he has been here and SAF retiring didn't help either given how highly he rated him. PL loan where he is used not as a striker would be ideal if we don't wanna use him that much now. 

I agree with you. Actually infact the passing range he showed for the senior team was better than what he usually shows for the U21s oddly. I think once he gets stronger and improves his stamina along with his discipline he has more tools to be a number #8 than a number #10 though he can probably do both jobs.

His skills set is pretty complete though, just needs it to click all together and improve physically and gain consistency. Will be interesting if he has leapfrogged Pearson/Rothwell already now and how we handle him from now. Also be interesting how he does with the U21s now after his first team debut. Has started this season in good form already. Can he go up a further notch and will Joyce start rating him more ?

126~~~
The one thing I'm seeing in these younger players is that they seem to be physically a little underdeveloped for their age.  Maybe it's the TV playing camera tricks, but they looked someone slight to me.

Even though we got thrashed at the hands of MK fukking Dons, I thought our young players actually looked pretty decent.  It was the senior players, most notably Evans and Hernandez, who really let us down.

127~~~
Anyone thinks he'll get promoted to the first team soon? Always has been impressive whenever I've seen him. Here's hoping that after we clear our deadwood, our midfield options would be something like: Herrera, Strootman, Carrick, Blind, Pereira, Fletcher

128~~~
This is my exact feeling about Powell, I keep hearing how he's a world class talent and all that, but, I just haven't seen it each time he's played.

129~~~
He was training with the first team again today according to the training session clip.

130~~~
Agreed

131~~~
I think Powell is "world class" with his shot technique, but pretty much everything else is right in line with our other young players or worse.

Sir Alex and Gradi both said he'd be a midfielder, but he simply hasn't played there and hasnt improved in the many areas he'd have to improve on to play as a central midfielder for us.

He has played as a forward and as a forward I dont see him making it here unless he has a huge burst of development this season

132~~~
Great. I hope he is promoted now on a permanent basis.

133~~~
LVG talked a lot about youngsters taking their chances. Think him and Wilson did against Dons.

134~~~
Ya I thought he did great against the MK Dons but then again I've always been a fan. I really hope LVG uses him deeper than he plays with the under 21's. It will be easier for him to get in the team plus I think he will ultimately end up playing as a orthodox CM as his skill set suits that role.

135~~~
Might be on the bench Sunday, here's hoping<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

136~~~
I think he'll be a decent player but i wouldn't expect much from him this season tbh

137~~~
I don't think its fair to expect anything from him this season. He will below 10 games as it is unless he proves himself more on the pitch. This year is his bedding in year with the first team if he plays. He needs to get up to the pace with the big boys and take it step by step.

138~~~
I think he'll be our 4th choice midfielder this season. With all the talk of LvG wanting to make space for youth, I think this kid could be in line for some game time.

139~~~
If we went for a 3 man midfield there wouldn't actually be that much competition in the the roles we expect Herrera and Di Maria to play. Fellaini, Anderson? I'd fancy his chances.

140~~~
Fletcher and Blind as well.

141~~~
I imagine Blind will be competing with Carrick for the role infront of the defenders. The #6, if you like. Fletcher can do both, but I think he'll be seeing more of the bench. This is all conjecture anyway, if we stick with the 352 then chances reduce greatly.

142~~~
Fellaini and Anderson are personae non gratae. Fletcher will be the only obstacle to Pereira being a regular on the bench, and the DF's form has taken a huge dip recently.

143~~~
Honestly think Perreira is the type of player, that if he was at a German or Belgium club playing regularly at his age, we would all be going mental asking to sign him. 

He has matured lot's physically and I think he is ready now for more football. He move the ball around beautifully, and did well against MK Dons considering they were very physical. In the Premier League he will get more protection. His work rate is there for all to see, so I hope LVG gives him a chance with Wilson soon. 

I personally think if Di Maria get's moved to the wing, he could bring us energy and creativity to midfield.

144~~~
Pereira is not as good as being made out on here - there are others in the reserves/u18s that have done more to be deserving of a chance than him.  Harrop, Pearson, and Rothwell have all excelled and I would say have shown more. 

That said, Pereira has got something.  I just do not believe he's as good as the other 3 i've mentioned.

145~~~
Dunno, if Harrop has done more. Pearson, Rothwell were thought to be ahead though and now supposedly been leapfrogged.

146~~~
Harrop has seldom had a kick. Pearson and Rothwell have both impressed but you can't help but get the impression that Pereira has that bit more to give at first team level.

147~~~
I actually don't rate Pereira particularly highly, but the fact that LvG played him in the League Cup suggests that he's first in line amongst the reserve midfielders. Given our lack of numbers in that area of the pitch, I think Pereira could definitely add something to the first team squad.

For my money, he still does too much on the ball when the simple option is the right one. I think that's down to the fact that he's so much more gifted than most u21's that he sometimes has a false sense of security regarding how much time he can spend with the ball at his feet. He also goes missing a fair bit during matches. Fortunately, both of those weaknesses can be addressed by (judiciously) throwing him in at the deep end. That's what I see happening, at any rate.

148~~~
How old is he now?

149~~~
Only 18. He has plenty of time.

150~~~
It's true that last season he wasn't that great compared to numerous players. Still, that doesn't mean that others are the better prospect for first team football. I don't think he's a #10 and thought he should have played in midfield alongside Pearson since the start of last season. I remember one uefa youth league match he played much better in midfield compared to the #10, but rarely played in that position the rest of the season for both the u18s and u21s.

Maybe LVG sees qualities that puts him above Pearson and Rothwell.

151~~~
I think with the likes of Pearson, Rothwell and Harrop they look better in the reserves and seem the better players but really that's not the case. 

Pereira is extremely talented albeit inconsistent at the moment due to his age. It's the same as how everyone used to rave about Tunnicliffe, he looked quality for reserves and under 21's for a period of time and there was talk of him being the next Roy Keane but the top talent was never really there. Pereira has that something about him where he can change a game at any level with a pass or run.

152~~~
He's got great potential. Definitely the best midfield talent in the U21s. He's not ready for pl football though. Maybe a few mins against the weaker teams buts that's about it for this season IMO. He's still very young.

153~~~
Tunnicliffe was shit in the U21s.It's the U18s that he starred.

Pearson and Rothwell surely deserve a chance as well but fair enough if LVG thinks Pereira should be promoted first.

154~~~
So far this season there's been a noticeable reduction of the above boldfaced problems. His maturation seems to be bang on schedule. I'd love to see him get a few games for the first team. Physically he may not be quite there yet but he's something as unique as a not grotesquely injury-plagued United prodigy, so I'm sure he could handle it.

155~~~
well he is such a class young player. He might seem quite inconsistent but the fact that hes been played all over the pitch wouldn't help him, particularly out wide, where he simply cant play.. he is no pace and power run down the wings. He is a brilliant passer, better than majority of our senior players, his passing range is awesome and he can play final pass. He can dribble when needed and can get past players. Right now he is something between Oscar and Fabregas. If it was on me I would choose him any day over Pearson to give him start in first team as deep laying playmaker. He may need to work on his defensive skills but looks hardworking kids not afraid to stuck in. Id go as far as saying that he is the most talented boy in our reserves even than Wilson but needs to have right guidance and to be trusted.. I hope that he will be given another chances to "take" and will fill those "vacant" places about what vG was speaking... rate him very highly

156~~~
Haven't seen enough of Rothwell to make a judgement but Pearson for me I have had doubts due to his lack of athleticism - doesn't seem to have those legs to eat up ground, seems like he has to work hard to dominate games at that level - he does have great stamina and tenaciousness to make up for it, but then again he reminds me of Daley Blind - and is arguably a better mover than that..

For me when I see Pereira, I see all the makings of a modern top midfielder.. I've seen vids posted of Ruben Neves and Lucas Silva, he is a player very much in that mould and always looked the player with the most potential at that age group whenever I do watch a game. There is a difference between players who perform very competently at that level but might never progress beyond it and those who may make alot of mistakes but they have that growth in them whether it is down to exceptional technique or superior athleticism that marks them out as top player potential. He also looks like he would be unfazed playing at a higher level but again these are assumptions.

Pearson in terms of footballing brain is a first team player, reads the game very well but could he handle the pace of a premiership game?

157~~~
I haven't seen that much of him, but you say you don't rate him that highly, yet say he is more gifted and the problems you mention are surely regarding his maturity as a player rather than his ability, you pretty much allude to this yourself? I remember him being really hyped when signed, when I have seen him he has looked promising though again over hyped such as against MK Dons where he did pretty well for a while. He fits the mould, just like Wilson of the types of young youth players we need coming through but from what little I have seen they certainly seem a fair while away from regular starts....the whole problem with youth players.

158~~~
The debate here reminds me of Blackett, most argued that he was below Keane and Thorpe but LvG has given him PL starts and he has done well, you just never know.

159~~~
In terms of stepping up to the first team, I don't rate him highly at the moment. The fact he has raw talent is cause for optimism, but not enough for me to think he's a better option than someone like Pearson, for example. Having said that, I think that LvG disagrees with me and I can rationalise as to why. There's certainly a better player in there than I've seen so far. I'll bow to Elliott's greater knowledge on how he's developed this season. Not been to any games yet.

160~~~
Blackett been more surprising than Pereira will be if he does indeed break through more.

Pereira might have been behind Pearson/Rothwell but he's always been talented enough to have a great big leap in 1 year of developmental time at that age just like Januzaj did in like 6 months.

161~~~
Thought he was excellent against MK Don's, i see him as a box to box midfielder, possibly even as a deep lying midfielder like Scholes (later years)/Alonso.  Has a good range of passing and looked comfortable when he was a deeper position against MK Dons.

I've not seen enough of him in the academy lately to make further judgement.

162~~~
Hope he gets on the bench on Sunday and not Anderson.

Seems to be in with a chance.

163~~~
I can see why some think he hasn't shown as much overt he past 18 months as Pearson/Rothwell (who I also rate highly) and is less deserving of chance currently, but in my opinion this lad cant be ignored as his ceiling of potential is much higher.

Agree that he could well end up deeper in midfield than he has played in the youth teams, but I think its just a case of getting your special creative players as near to goal as possible at that level. Anyway some of the best deep-lying playmakers of recent times have started off as attacking midfielders, such as Pirlo and Scholes amongst others.

164~~~

165~~~
I've seen him a few times but was pleasantly surprised by just how agile he looked against MK Dons. We aren't exactly crawling with players who can turn quickly and beat people, though Di Maria and Januzaj should help us on that score as they become fixtures. The 1 on 1 ability to just drop a shoulder and send a man the other way was promising. Excited to see how he does next time he gets a chance.

166~~~
I was just meaning in terms of the direction of the conversation in the thread.

From the little I've seen of Pereira he looks like he has that bit of extra quality in locker, like Januzaj, that would catch a managers eye as a player he wants training and playing with the seniors sooner rather than later, which is not a knock on the other 3 young CM's.

167~~~
When i watch him, he is barely involved but can produce moments of class. A lot of talent but he wont get near the first team until he can contribute in more phases of the game

168~~~
I hope to see him on the bench instead of Anderson tomorrow.

169~~~
Staying at the Lowry hotel it seems, with the first team.

170~~~
Good luck to him if he is included today.

171~~~
Makes me wonder what's the deal with Pearson/Rothwell? LVG has overlooked them to date yet they are rated more highly.

172~~~
Rothwell?

173~~~
Pereira is quite clearly a lot more talented than Rothwell or Pearson. That probably has something to do with it.

You're not looking for consistency at that age. More talent. Consistency comes later anyway as long as the player has the right attitude.

174~~~
Pereira must have impressed LVG

175~~~
He gets to play on LW often right? Its no shame that he doesnt contribute a lot in much phases of the game, unless you're Messi/Reus/Hazard almost nobody does that.

176~~~
I understand and accept where you are coming from but I think it's probably a little more complex than that.

I agree that the consistency comes with age and experience and that talent is key in getting your chance. But in saying that, if players can show maturity at a young age, it can also place them above the more talented kids. So many players have come through the system and not been the best of the bunch but had a good head on their shoulders, worked hard and put in consistent displays at youth level to get their chance.

Every case is different though, I wouldn't say Pereira being involved means he doesnt rate the other players, it's just he is getting the look in now, the others have to be patient.

177~~~
Will correct, right now.

178~~~
Pretty much this. When he gets involved Pereira is quite clearly a level above most of our u21/youth players. Pleased to see him being used as part of the first team squad.

179~~~
Pereira is younger than Pearson and Rothwell and players grow a lot in few months at that age. He has started off the season well too and is more tactically flexible and able to play more positions.

Plus he's clearly pretty talented. Hope he is on the bench ahead of Anderson and Pearson/Rothwell get their chances too in due course. Otherwise a good loan would do both of them good at this point.

180~~~
Rather see him getting a chance on the bench than Anderson, good luck to the lad he's looked talented whenever I've seen him.

181~~~
I can't wait to see how the juice plays today. It's going to be refreshing.

182~~~
He's the only player in the squad who can possibly understudy for and provide similar qualities to Herrera.  I definitely see him more of an 8 than a 10.

183~~~
Pereira and Harrop have both started the season better than Pearson and Rothwell but given some of the performances the latter two put in last season, I think it's at best premature to label Pereira as <i>quite clearly a lot more talented</i>. In terms of potential he might indeed edge it, but it's not as cut and dry as you make it out to be. Rothwell, especially, put in some sensational performances for the u19s and u21s last season, performances Pereira has yet to match at that level, though he's getting there. Rothwell was roughly half a year older than Pereira is now when he really started dominating for the u21s, but then he's probably lost a lot more than 6 months to injury compared to Pereira. Early season form rather than quality saw Pereira edge ahead and given his brilliant performance at MK Dons, you'd hope the challenge for Rothwell, Pearson and Harrop is to join him - rather than replace him - as part of not-too-distant-future first team squads.

184~~~
Rothwell is very talented tbh. But yeah, Pereira is probably a better dribbler.

185~~~
Has he confirmed the juice will be involved?

186~~~
Is he OJ's bastard son or something?

187~~~
Was really good vs MK Dons, much better than most u18s games Ive seen him in. He plays better the deeper he is from what I can tell. Woul love to see him involved today and play well

188~~~
Pereira was seen part of the team in the hotel, so he'll be on the bench. Blackett may even start with Jones out, but Rojo takes his position so I'm not sure. Januzaj will be benched as well. So there's enough juice there.

189~~~
Not necessary that Pereira will be on the bench tbf. They might have taken one extra player to the hotel anyway, especially for experience and getting him integrated into the group etc..

It's a home game so slightly strange they are staying in the hotel for a night anyway. Guess, it's because the new guys are resident there till they find a house.

190~~~
They still in the Lowry before every home game as far as I know.

191~~~
Ah ok didn't know that. I thought they did it only for some games.

Wonder if they take the exact match squad there, or couple more extra players.

192~~~
Ya there is always a few extra players taken so no guarantee he will be on the bench but it's a good sign nonetheless.

On the bench. Great to see

196~~~
But, but.. our identity is dead...

Happy to see Andreas on the bench though, he could be this seasons Adnan.

197~~~
I hope if, i mean when we have a comfortable lead he'll bring him on, feck up the identity brigade.

198~~~
He is doing something right to be in subs today.

199~~~

200~~~
Glad to see him make the bench.

201~~~
Slap in the face for Anderson!

202~~~
It is probably still jiggling as well.

203~~~
Was thinking he was the only senior fit midfielder to not make the squad today. I think everyone would prefer a kid to get a chance ahead of him.

204~~~
Perfect game to send him on for ~20 minutes.

205~~~
Only 3 out of him, Januzaj, Shaw and Falcao can come on.

206~~~
Hopefully he gets in. Perfect match for him to get some minutes with absolutely no pressure at all.

207~~~
Rather had seen him on than Januzaj, and would have brought RVP off, and pushed Rooney back up top.  However, this is where I thought he would be this season, playing in the Capitol One Cup, and a few games sitting on the bench and a few chances this season.  I will suggest we'll start to see more and more of him from here on in, and next year he'll be challenging for a starting position with everyone else.

208~~~
Encouraging signs to see him on the bench, LvG clearly rates him highly. With all the new signings and players on the bench, it was always going to be hard for him to actually get subbed on, but this is the first time he is in the match day squad at all I think (not counting the MK Dons game). A big step on its own. He'll make a few appearances this season for sure.

209~~~
Wondering if he will play for the U21s tomorrow.Wilson didn't play with the U21s last time he was involved with the first team.With Lawrence gone,Wilson injured and Pereira with the first team we might see quite a different team tomorrow.

210~~~
Shame he didn't get a chance. I imagine he, along with Reece James, Lingard and Wilson, will be on the bench for perhaps 10 PL games each this season but may not get many mins on the pitch.

211~~~
yes, I actually thought he could come and boss the midfield to see the game out for us, this was perfect time to bring him on but we wrere one substitution short. As Rafael needed to be rested, Falcao always making his debut and yeah he might come on for dimaria as well as januzaj but adnan is not playing simply because we are playing diamond in other case he would be starter so we need him to be content here giving him regular time on the pitch.. But I want to see him play desperately. It will be very interesting next season: our midfield could easily be: Herrera, Blind, diMaria, Strootman, Carrick, Pereira, quite experienced and still very young and full of energy..

212~~~
How did this guy know we weren't going to bring him on? Surely we wouldn't have had him on the bench if that was the case.

213~~~
Probably easing him into the First team squad and keeping him hungry, i.e. earn your minutes.

214~~~
That's true. Just seemed like with us being 4-0 up that it made sense to give him a run. I hope we get his contract sorted soon.

215~~~
Obviously Januzaj will get the attention for his hat trick for the u21s tonight but I thought Pereira was excellent again he's had a really good start to the season and is showing really good signs that his game is maturing from training with the seniors and he took his goal really well as well

216~~~
As I said in the match thread I'm glad he is being given a run in a deeper role now. Ultimately I think he will end up as a CM rather than a #10.

217~~~
Yeah I've always said that. I think he gets crowded out a bit playing as a 10 he normally takes his touch to make the yard of space but because he's so close to goal there's always another player there where as when he plays deeper once he makes the space he actually has a bit of time and space to affect the game. I also think playing him as a 10 with a single striker ahead of him takes away one of his best attributes which is his ability to open up the game with Scholesy style long balls. Also worth noting that he played deeper for the Belgium under age teams which is where he has looked at his best and where he got his high reputation and also won player of the tournament at the 2013 Milk Cup playing deeper. Here's a video of him for Belgium for anyone who hasnt seen it before 
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PGtQfmeh-jI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

218~~~
Ya he was brilliant at the Milk Cup playing deeper. The extra responsibility of being more involved in the game seems to bring the best out of him.

I remember watching that video when we first signed him. Hard to believe he was only 15 or 16 there.

219~~~
Glad to hear he had a good game and that he played in a deeper CM role again, I think over the next 18 months he can start challenging for a spot in the diamond where Herrera plays, not talking about pushing him out, just simply offering a genuine option there depending on form/injuries etc.

Is their a vid of his performance in the game tonight?

220~~~
Spot on.

221~~~
If he can't sort out how quickly he releases the ball, he'll struggle to make it in any position. Hopefully it's just an experience thing rather than a lack of vision.

222~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9lCPP584M4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

223~~~
Very impressive

224~~~
Pure class, he also reminds me a little bit of Scholes, does smart ,neat passes are just class.

225~~~
Looks a bit demonic.

226~~~
For the first time in a long time we've got four youngsters so close to the first team. If him, Wilson, Blackett and Lingard make it then it'll be a big win for our academy.

227~~~
Great that LVG is showing trust in him. I reckon he loves his style of play. Keeps it ticking over nicely, but at the right time has the natural ability to dribble and the flair to beat a man. Has 2 great feet and can pass long or short.

He actually reminds me of Gundogan a little, perhaps without his pace though. 

If he continues to improve we've got another solid CM on or hands <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

228~~~
Every time I watch this boy feel like I need to contain my excitement. He has everything that you would want in a modern day midfielder - literally is all about whether he can bring these attributes to the field against top opposition, he needs to be tested at a higher level now.

229~~~
Woody and LVG need to sort out his contract ASAP.

In the team dinner photos as well.

230~~~
He looks like he's about to trip on the ball on a few occasions when he has possession. Needs to be more decisive and sort that one out

231~~~
I agree. December last year I wrote this when he played in the U19 Champions League match. He wasn't really playing too well as a 10 that time but he was performing better a bit deeper. It's no surprise he was impressive vs MK Dons playing deeper too. He was dictating the game when he came on.

232~~~
Yep I think he's the type of player who's far better when he has the game in front of him rather than having to play with his back to goal and having to try and turn and do something while being tightly marked which often happens when he plays as a 10. When he plays deeper he can arrive in the box unmarked as well which we saw the other night and we saw a few times from Herrera against QPR which is something the first team has been missing for a long time.

233~~~
Yeah. It'll be interesting to see how many minutes he gets for the first team this season. I'm hoping he signs a new contract too. But he was ahead of Anderson on the bench vs QPR, does that mean he's ahead of him in terms of a first team spot?

234~~~
Thanks for posting the vid. I know I am going to get slated for it but he has all the look of a Gundogan or Pjanic about his style, I am really excited to see him develop under LvG, the way he can create that bit of space for himself with a dribble or little injection of pace is what top CM's need and his passing range and weight is very good. I also like the way that after he passes he moves immediately to give an option for the return.

235~~~
Looks like the real deal - I'll be very excited to keep an eye on him.

236~~~
I think its also his strength, he often puts defender on the wrong foot with it, its his way of getting past a defender, if he develops it, it could be a huge quality for him.

237~~~
Yes that feint and body movement. It's good wrong footing a defender, just hope he doesn't wrong foot himself and trip over. Notice how Anderson lazily passes to him then ran somewhere else or stood still while Pereira did the rest of the work

239~~~
It's only September... there's plenty of time to get him in.

240~~~
Bias aside, I think it's total bollocks to be fair. In a time of transition under one of the best youth coaches in the past 20 years leaving would be a big mistake on his part.

241~~~
thats not good tbh. Time to get him and De Gea a contract extension. Would be silly to go at the moment, but it could happen. I can see Juve waiting for January 1st to get their usual deal done.

242~~~
I really hope we don't make the same mistake we made with Pogba. If he wants a bit more money just give to him and sign him up for an extension.

243~~~
So, is the reason he's been suddenly propelled into every single first team squad activity? A late attempt to convince him to stay?

244~~~
I don't think so. Its LVG. He gives kids a chance if they show potential and Perreira has shown potential. He is better than Anderson. Herrera-Di Maria should be first choice. Perreira should start when Herrera needs a rest or against weak opposition at home first to get some confidence.

245~~~
I'm convinced they had no idea that he had one year left on his contract until the Belgian journalist tweeted so. Due to the that I'm not really listening to what this journalist is saying. I will wait for something more reliable.

246~~~
He does, and I rate Pereira highly, but even James Wilson hasn't been pictured with the first team squad (on nights out etc) as much as Pereira has these last few weeks.

247~~~
The wages of the top Italian clubs were released a fews weeks ago and Pogba is a such a small amount(Obviously there are other ways for Juvea pay Pogba) so I do think throwing money at Pogba would have worked really, although everyone has a price I guess.

I'm not to worried at all about this story(It could be all bollocks)as Pereira already being moved forward to the first team and with LVG he will get chance. If was to leave United now with the manager we have now it would he's loss not United's(Still think it's a load of rubbish anyway).

248~~~
That article says absolutely nothing other than a few random things about Pogba and Andreas and we'll continue to see these same articles on all of our foreign youth for the foreseeable future because of Pogba just like we saw them last year with Adnan. With players under the age of 18 only being able to sign max 2 year contracts I believe it is going to be quite common for 18 year old players to have only a year left on their contract. Whether Andreas is thinking of leaving we don't know and neither do the papers but they'll spout whatever nonsense to belittle our youth program and will just reference Pogba as some sort of validity.

249~~~
Yeah. The reason pogba left was because fergie wasn't giving him chances with the first team whereas pereiras already part of the first team squad and will definitely get chances. I just hope we tie him down soon so we don't get the risk of losing him.

250~~~
I wasn't referring to giving Pogba more money. I was talking about the fact that we knew he was in his last year of contract and we let it keep running down and then tried to force a deal at the very end. Lets hope Perreira doesn't have a cnut of an agent.

251~~~
I don't follow our youth as much as I should but is he that good?

252~~~
I started following our youth team properly last year and in my opinion we have the best group there since the class of 92. Though he plays primarily as a #10, he has shown he is capable of playing deeper, which is where we will need to play him. We have enough #10s as it is. Perreira definitely has a future with us. He is a little raw just like any other young player with bags of potential. I think he at the right club with the right staff to fine tune him. Like LVG said he just has to take his opportunities when presented and show them his improvement. We don't need to spend another £40-60m on a midfielder if we develop the players we already have.

253~~~
Cheers mate.

Very interesting your views on our youth towards the class of 92 because for what I see of our youths (grant it not much) I'd nearly agree with you. Every time I hear of a new prospect, I try keep up to date with them as much as possible and when they continue to grow more younger players names keep getting brought up, its been happening like this since Morrison, Pogba and Januzaj.. who ever is in charge of youth scouting is doing an excellent job!

254~~~
While I agree with you, it's funny. A month ago, many users didn't rate Pereira that highly.

Talent-whise, he is a stand out. Performance-whise, he hasn't been in the past. I'm positive that a boost of confidence (like playing for the first team) could change that.

255~~~
He was a little inconsistent last year but its easy to forget how young he is, but if you watched him often every now and again you would get a glimpse at what might be with him. He seems to be mixing in with the Spanish speaking lads which should help and hopefully he starts getting some minutes off the bench.

It would be great if we sort his contract sooner rather than later though.

256~~~
I hope he does sign a new contract with the club, as far as I know Sean Goss (18) has done from the U21. Kieran O'Hara (18), Michael Keane (21), Ben Pearson (19), Joe Rothwell (19), Callum Evans (18), James Wier (19), William Keane (21) and Andreas Pereira (18) are out of contact at the end of this season. I hope we can at least get Ben Pearson and Andreas Pereira signed up on long term deals.
Carrick (33), Fletcher (30), Anderson (26), Cleverley (25) and Amos (24) are also out of contract at end this season, I hope only Carrick stays on.

257~~~
The way I see it is you aren't really looking for consistency in young players, it's the talent and the moments they show now and then so you can see their potential. Consistency comes with age and as they mature physically, but pereira definitely has the talent, if not the consistency yet. He looks way ahead of anyone else we have in the u21's talent wise and IMO that's why van gaal promoted him, despite being inconsistent in his performances.

258~~~
It doesn't say anything that he won't stay. It just says that we haven't opened contract talks with him. I'm sure we'll sign him to a new contract. The club has learned from Pogba(which in itself was a rarity).

259~~~
I look for consistency at youth level because it shows to me which players are certs if they also pair that up with their immense talent. That is why I am more hopeful of Januzaj and Wilson. If the player doesn't have consistency at youth level, I like to see glimpses of talent that make me go wow. Pogba did that. Pereira didn't leave me with that effect as the most impressive glimpses were his long range goals usually curled into the top corner or some good footwork. For most of last season Pereira played behind the striker, and I didn't think that was his best position. He was outplayed by numerous players for the u21s. Like Janko, I try not to be too harsh on players playing out of position and I won't rule out a change of fortune in the future.

I don't look for consistency when they play for the first team though as they are playing against older players and it's crazy to expect that.

260~~~
Rather be a youngster with bags of talent and crap performances than a youngster performing above expectations but ultimately limited in talent. 

It can of course to either way; the latter is more likely to have a consistent but not great career (a la Fletcher for example), but the former could end up like a Nani or Anderson. But, they also have the potential to end up a true quality player. 

With experience, training with the first team, and the odd game time here and there, we may suddenly see a spike in his performance.

261~~~
I don't think I agree with this logic. Consistency comes with time, experience, knowledge, confidence, mental strength etc... All of which are without a doubt linked to age on some level and opportunities. 

I explained my view in the post above. 

Obviously though the guy who is consistent and talented is everyone's dream but you're looking for a very rare breed of players there. I would however always go with talent at youth level as the driving thing. Riskier but leads the most fruitful returns n

262~~~
I think someone said so during the Pogba affair and look what happened. Obviously we had offered Pogba a contract then but now we are yet to.

263~~~
I know that's why the players that show that talent and consistency are considered certs. The other players could very well not make it or become a star provided they have talent. There is no way of knowing.

264~~~
Fairs.

265~~~
Exciting player emerges from our youth team to the first team and the media comes up with the 'player looking at other Clubs' line, what a shock.

266~~~
For every Paul Pogba argument, there's an Adnan Januzaj counter-argument.

267~~~
I'd rather we give him more minutes on the pitch instead of paying him loads to keep him interested. The motivation here should be playing time, not money.. let the youngsters have a go regardless if they're acting too big for their boots, especially talents like these.. if all the lads want to do is play, give them a chance - put up or shut up. Fergie was too cautious/stubborn with Pogba.

268~~~
I think it just shows how much of an influence the agent/advisor of a young footballer plays nowadays. Pogba is advised by Riola, who is well known to get the most money for himself and client. Whether Pogba was well/ill advised and if he was getting the best in terms of getting game time and where he'd be best learning his trade, is divided opinion.

Then there's Januzaj, his dad kept his feet on the ground and ensured that Adnan understood that United was the best place to develop as a footballer.

269~~~
Almost everyone said so during the Pogba affair. I was an early skeptic in the ' Pogba is sure to sign eventually' credo, but I think it's too soon to push the panic button with Andreas. Let's wait until we open negotiations and his agent starts dilly-dallying before we start to worry.

270~~~
If you only started following the youth team properly how can you come to the conclusion this is the best  group since 92??

271~~~
I was thinking that too! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

272~~~
A more educated opinion on him....

273~~~
In 2011 we had a youth team which consisted of Ravel, Pogba, Keane brothers, Thorpe, Lingard, Blackett, Cole and others with Adnan and Daehli in the background and on fringes. I like our current youth team and they're still very young as compared to that team but I don't think this team could overtake that team, let alone the 92 team(I hope I'm wrong on this one).

274~~~
Did I say I started following our youth teams only last year? No it was on and off but not until last year, did I make the time to actually watch a lot of their games and the way they played. I didn't watch as many youth games before that. Its not like I've never followed the youth team.

275~~~
A shame not to see him on the bench today.

276~~~
Andreas Pereira barely rose to the first team of Manchester United and has become the subject of a controversy in the British media. Born in Belgium, but with Brazilian parents, the midfielder has little less than a year remaining contract with the English club. Without further renewal set, he would be free to sign a pre-contract agreement with another team starting in January. The newspaper "Daily Mail", the athlete would have rejected a proposed renewal of the club. Andreas denies having received any contact from the board. 

- Right now nothing is happening. They not offered me the contract yet. But Manchester is more time consuming as well. I'm not worried because I went up a little while ago and I'm happy doing my job, going to work - said the player. 

Manchester United went through a traumatic event involving a star base recently. After spending three years preparing Frenchman Paul Pogba in the youth and first team, the British failed to reach an agreement for a new contract with the half and saw him come out to play for Juventus, Italy, in July 2012, without penny profit. 

Andreas has contract until July 2015 and does not disclose whether it has received offers from other European clubs, but says he is not worried about it at the moment. The focus of the athlete is to repay the confidence vote of Louis van Gaal and guarantee your space in the professional team. Nine days ago, in the rout of the Reds over Queens Park Rangers by 4-0, he came to stand on the bench. 

- He (Van Gaal) did not promise me anything, but said he would give me a chance because you think I'm good enough to stay in the first team. He is confident that if I do my job right, I can stay. He talks to me every day about what I have to do better, I'm learning a lot - Andreas said.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/futebol-internacional/futebol-ingles/noticia/2014/09/revelacao-do-united-brasileiro-nega-polemica-em-renovacao-de-contrato.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://globoesporte.globo.com/futeb...o-nega-polemica-em-renovacao-de-contrato.html</a>

Through Google translate.

277~~~
This youth team has nothing on Pogba and Ravel's year. Nothing. Pogba's year was clearly the best in England by a long way.

278~~~
Every focus in on Thorpe and McNair but Pereira is likely to be on the bench tomorrow due to the 10 players unavailable issue.

279~~~
I'm hearing he's running out of contract, would be a shame if he left, I always saw him as someone with a lot of potential.

280~~~

281~~~
hope he gets his home debut if things go well. But after leicester collapse it will only happen when we are leading 3:0 and there are no injuries. Van Gaal still needs to give minutes to Januzaj, Falcao and Mata and maybe save Shaw.. maybe he could help the team to put the game to bed when we sub off di maria again.. and he can play deep laying playmaker with blind clearing things around him...

282~~~
He really needs a loan where he could play full time minutes.He'd be well suited to be loaned to a Anderlecht, Standard Liege, Genk, or PSV, Feynoord, mid table German squad, or even a mid table French squad. Of course if he's not given a new contract it won't really matter.

283~~~
Think this guy could do a decent job in a deeper role, probably need someone with more experience though for tomorrow and as much as it pains me to say, it will probably be Darren Fletcher.

284~~~
Hope he gets his PL debut today.

285~~~
It's gonna be Mata, Januzaj and if no other injuries tough decision between Fletcher and Pereira. will depend on circumstances..

286~~~
Hoped he got his debut but i guess the red card killed his chances.

Wonder if there's a chance he might start next week if Herrera is out ?

287~~~
I hope so, I'd rather "Trust the juice" than play Fletcher.

288~~~
He could be starting until we get Carrick back. He'll play the next two hopefully and Carrick can start against Chelsea behind Di Maria and Blind.

289~~~
yeah, here's to hoping he gets his chance now and that he makes the most of it.

290~~~
He kicked the living shit out of about half a dozen Spurs players last night. Auditioning for the Herrera role?

291~~~
I hope he gets the chance to start against Everton since Herrera is sadly out, he makes more sense in the role than Fletcher who doesn't have the legs to go box top box anymore.

292~~~
I'll have give LVG credit if he starts this lad against Everton rather than Fletcher. It might not work but the easier option would certainly be to start Fletch.

293~~~
Will be interesting if LVG throws him in.

Seems less likely though.

294~~~
I fecking love this lad. That through ball to Janko in the first half was exactly what we have missed since Scholes. 

I also love the way he works space, he loves turning back and forth with a marker on him, very tricky to mark. Unlucky not to score with a great left foot shot that deflected.

295~~~
I'd accept that. Fletcher has a tendency to slow our play down, he's great to bring on when we need to become more defensive, I just don't think he has it in him anymore and I'd rather go with youth over experience in this case.

296~~~
Could of been sent of twice yesterday which is some achievement to do in the U21's

297~~~
I would love him to come in and replace Herrera while he's injured. I really think he would do a better job than any of our alternatives at present.

298~~~
It's gonna be Fletcher, unfortunately.

299~~~
Not going to happen, against Everton, City and Chelsea, I think .. we'll go with Fletch or Valencia unfortunately.
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I fear for our next three games.. I think maybe 4 points might be the best we can hope for

300~~~
Might be worth a try against Everton. In terms of providing moments of quality, he's the closest we have to Herrera, though I can't imagine him winning possession so often. High risk option but certainly worth considering.

301~~~
It will but Fletcher won't complete 90mins IMO. Tbh there's a chance Fletch probably would have started anyway, what with our captain out and LVG admitting he always wants thr captain on the pitch.

It's almost a certainty that at least one of Pereira or Januzaj will get game time on Sunday, and the coming weeks. It's pretty exciting really. Definitely fun times to be a United fan, you never know what to expect from one match to another- performance wise of personnel wise!

Really enjoying this season so far if I'm honest, regardless of results.

302~~~
Well LVG was given like 5 young players their league debuts in the first 6 league games, so maybe he'll want to keep his average up with Pereira soon enough.

303~~~
It would be really interesting if Herrera stayed fit wheter van Gaal would put on Fletcher instead of someone - say Blind his fav player.. and who would be captain in that case. I think he over judged Fletcher little bit..

304~~~
It all depends how he does in training, if he does better than other midfielders then he will get in. Lvg will play him, he doesnt have too much competition anyways, its valencia/fletcher or him. fletcher is a "6" lvg wont want to play him as an 8, valencia is nothing really these days. I think he will play on the weekend.

305~~~

306~~~
Indeed. I made it 3 challenges worthy of a yellow card and one that when seen in slow motion, should have been a straight red card. Thought he played pretty well overall but might want to keep his studs down if he gets a chance in the first team.

I'd still be tempted to give him 65 mins against Everton and hope he can come up with one or two moments of quality. That is unless he doesn't look quite ready when training with first team players.

307~~~
Couple of nasty challenges from him in that compilation from the spurs game, but I think sometimes CM's in his mold feel they need to show they are not soft pushovers, he just needs to find a less over the top way of doing it as those would probably both be reds in a PL match.

308~~~
I've not had a chance to watch him regularly, just the occasional game here and there but he does impress me. I know he's tenacious but what is his overall defensive game like? Can he play in a deeper role for first team without being a liability?

309~~~
At 0.38 he gave away a ball and it can cost you a goal at PL level. Other than that very good.

And BTW who is number 8. His movement is really good.

310~~~
I'd love to see Pereira playing for Herrera but I think it will be Fletch

311~~~
Josh Harrop. Best player on the pitch until he got injured.

312~~~
Yep he was awesome that night, I haven't seen much of him but he looks a tidy player.

313~~~
Harrop has been pretty good since stepping upto u21s so far.

Was seated suited in the West Ham game as well with Wilson and other injured first teamers which was interesting.

314~~~
Hard to believe he stayed on the field - do they play a different set of rules in the U21? If that's his usual approach he wouldn't make it to half time in a PL game. He also seems to dwell on the ball (even more than Fletcher, if that's possible). Be interesting to see if he can make the step up.

315~~~
From that performance, well, he has all the technical skills but (apart from the very 1st pass he did), he was very staid with most of his passing, kept looking to get it wide to the fullback, get it back and recycle.
But nice composure on the ball and the 1st pass (and that brilliant Belgian u16 video) shows he has the vision too...

316~~~
It was a very high tempo game, Tottenham were closing down very quickly and putting in a lot of niggly fouls themselves. I am not surprised that Pereira made a few fouls himself, as they were certainly giving it out too. You usually find tackling is a bit more relaxed in the u21 level, so you get away with a few.

317~~~
Against Everton it would have to be.

318~~~
How did he do tonight in the U21 game?

319~~~
What do you guys think? Is he ready to go out on loan in the Championship/Premier League or playing for U21s and training with the first team would be better?

320~~~
I'd like to see him stick around and get some playing time. We have no real back-up for Ander in the first team and ultimately I think Andreas will fit a similar mould. So I'd like to see him start the odd match against weaker opposition, especially if Ander has a knock or something and otherwise come off the bench a few times as well. It's a shame we don't have CL and we were knocked out of LC so early as it would have gave him some extra match time. If there is no chance of him getting a handful of appearances though, then I'd probably send him on loan at the end of January. He handled the LC match really well and I've been really impressed with his overall consistency over the last 6 months and his ability to take hold of a match. I would not send him to the Championship though, unless we are getting guaranteed of his playing time and not many Championship clubs are willing to throw out a young slender player of Andreas' style in important matches. Therefore, I think a short loan to the Eredivisie could be a good option, and van Gaal might have some good connections over there.

321~~~
Don't think there's any need with him, Wilson or Januzaj to send them out on loan. They definitely all seem to be part of the special category that would benefit more with training in our first team every day, and getting the odd appearance here and there. For now he'll be in the reserves but he would have had a few more appearances for sure if we were in other competitions.

322~~~
He doesn't need a loan. A loan is not always the right/compulsory route in player development. In fact, the higher the talent, the lesser a need for a loan. He needs to continue training with the first team and be given an opportunity to stake a claim for a starting shirt. He's that good.

323~~~
If we sign another midfielder in January, a six month loan would be a very good idea. We don't play enough matches this season to give him playing time.

324~~~
Any word on his new contract?

325~~~
Yeah, Woody/LVG needs to sort out the contract ASAP.

326~~~
Nice to see him make the bench again today. With 3 other midfielders on the bench there is slim chance of seeing him play but good to see him involved in the squad none the less.

327~~~
Will be fine to bring him on once we've gone 4-0 up with 20 mins to go <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

330~~~
Worrying his contract hasn't been sorted still. Can talk with all other clubs from January.

331~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

You <i>know</i> he's the sort of player every top club in Europe has at least half an eye on.

That said, Van Gaal's clearly going to some lengths to make him feel like he has a future here. Practically a regular on the bench at the moment, ahead of quite a few older lads.

332~~~
Agreed, I'm sure that's been noted by Pereira himself. Furthermore, it also helps that he doesnt have to watch Fabio in centre mid ahead of him!

333~~~
Another game in which he seems to have really struggled to complete passes at times. 

I know young players sometimes have that issue, and a player like Herrera performs well while being inconsistent in his passing and Pereira obviously has excellent agility, dribbling and good vision, but that worries me a lot from a central player. 

Di Maria and Herrera are both similarly direct, low-ish percentage passers, so maybe he can fit into the team without too much trouble as the team will be used to creative but lower percentage passing from the CM's, but it seems like this is a serious issue to me. 

Comforting to have Van Gaal around, as his record with developing young players is so good that he'll likely know what to do. He seems to like Pereira judging from his inclusion in squads, so maybe I'm overreacting to the few performances I've seen of him and in training he rarely gives it away.

334~~~
Not really sure where you're coming from tbh, even when he's trying to make things happen his passing percentages are high. How much of him have you seen?

335~~~
Not near enough to be definitive (Maybe like 4ish full games and every one of these "every touch" clips online) I could be wrong. 

Are there stats for his passing? 

I take it you don't agree. That's good. I hope he's Xavi with his distribution, It's just that the things that jump out at me about his game are his agility/ability to create space with a feint and his passing being a bit all over the place for an attacking mid. You have to be pretty damn good as a passer to make it as a central player for a top team who is picked for his ability going forward rather than his defensive/all around work. 

Yet another reason I really wish we were half-assing through the Europa League and seeing him play at a high level with Fletcher or Fellaini along side him, Januzaj and Wilson getting starts in attack with whoever needs a game and Blackett/McNair/Thorpe getting some good game time too.

336~~~

337~~~

338~~~
If anything I'd say his passing is one of his best things. Of course it can be a bit inconsistent now and then like all players, nobody is saying he's a Scholes now, but he's certainly got an eye for a pass and has the ability to pull it off.

339~~~
His passing is like Herrera in a way. Agree with whoever said that though he is more of a dribbler and slightly lesser passer maybe.

Not the most consistent tiki taka passer if you get what you mean who will retain possession while he can make some very good passes as well. His touch and other technical is pretty good though.

340~~~
He has the look about him that makes me think he will be unphased by the step up and I like that he's playing deeper now.

341~~~
Really rate the lad, look how much he tries to speed up the game and pass forward in that vid, I think that is one of his biggest strenghts, his weakness is the concentration with the sloppy short passing all the time. He is the closest to Herrera in terms of playing style, also has huge workrate and isnt afraid to put in a tackle. Renew his contract.

342~~~
I've watched the vast majority of games he's played for us. I wouldn't say <i>Xavi</i>, but Fabregas would be a fair comparison for the possession/aggression balance of his passing. You really don't have to worry about him being a player who gives it away too much, it's not something I've ever really considered a problem for him. You must have caught a couple of off-colour matches, which he certainly does have now and then.

It's actually Fabregas who makes me confident that Pereira's future is definitely as a #8 not a #10. He's a very similar player in style, possibly slightly more inclined to dribble. But he's actually more defensive, with an excellent tackle in his locker.

343~~~
I wouldn't say Fabregas either. Fabregas is incredibly good at playing short 1-2s in and around the box. Andreas can't do that. Fabregas can also play as a #10 with creative passing. I don't think Andreas has shown he can do that which is why he's really kicked on while playing deeper. To me, Andreas has always felt it hard to create in the 10 position with his passing. Whenever deployed there I found him good at using his footwork to create space for himself to shoot. Much different from Adnan in that position who used to always look for killer passes even if some weren't executed perfectly and always made it seem like he had a ton of time on the ball (at youth level). Maybe in time he can perform in that position, but right now I think he's shown that he can't despite the odd highlight from time to time. So I agree with you on that bit.

I think Herrera is most similar in style.

344~~~
Agree, playing deeper has really helped him, he looks a different player to last year where you could say he was a little inconsistent and selfish at times. This years he's been consistent, looks more a team player and using his skill set more effectively. He certainly looks a player who could make a step up, problem is we have far too many player now in that area of the pitch in the first team, maybe after the next transfer window he will have more opportunity though we have to get him signed up first.

345~~~
I don't think we do at all. He is playing the Herrera role and in the first team we only have Herrera for that role with Fellaini as an option for something different. I don't see Fletcher playing much and there is no one else to play that more B2B role.

346~~~
I really like Perreira. Genuinely hope he gets his chance here. Looks a class above as Reserves level now and is surely on the cusp of a few Premier League appearances.

I love his composure on the ball and how unnerved he is in possession. Demands the ball in (what would be to lesser players) vulnerable positions, controls it nonchalantly, drops a shoulder or two to make the yard for the pass, and flicks it around the corner to a teammate in a position to attack the space Perreira's created. A trait very difficult to coach but Perreira does it effortlessly.

347~~~
Add Valencia to that. That's 3 player he got to get through to start. IMO with the next 2 years or sooner I want him to be back up to Herrera.
The sooner some players leave the clearer thing will be regarding him. I want him to have a career at UTD.

348~~~
I agree with everything you've said there about Pereira... but I also think most of it applies to Fabregas! His best football has always come in that deeper role, which he played in his best years for Arsenal and now for Chelsea. Barca asked him to either stand in for Messi during injury or play alongside him in the old Iniesta position, and he never quite made it work. Admittedly Pereira <i>is</i> slightly less of a passer and more of a dribbler than Fabregas, but in terms of where in the pitch he is best deployed, I think they're very very similar.

Herrera also plays a similar position, but I don't think they're that similar in style. Pereira has a tackle in his locker but he's not a scrapper like Herrera. He won't run nonstop all game and get through a huge amount of work, which Herrera does. A player like Herrera wins the ball or picks up a loose ball, takes it past the opposition's creative midfielder, and then moves it on to a Pereira/Fabregas who will start the actual attacking move with a diagonal ball or a pass to the feet of the striker or something like that.

(It's worth pointing out that we're now debating a very fine distinction. We're basically on the same page, I think.)

350~~~
I was just about to post the article. He's got fantastic attitude and all the tools to make it here. I hope we make an announcement soon regarding his contract.

351~~~
The voiceover guy keeps ending every sentence like he's not sure what he's just said.

352~~~
Really like the attitude by him. Seems like he'll stay.

353~~~
I think we could actually use a player in his mold, none of our CM's have a great range of passing and he would add that to us, I mean he's maybe too young to be dictating games and I think he's got some similarities with Herrera, but I'd be interested to see how he did as a deep lying playemaker next to Blind in a 4-2-3-1.

354~~~
I really hope we sort his contract out ASAP, he's by far the brightest CM prospect we have. I do worry that apparently God may be involved in the deal though, he's not been a great agent for us in the past.

355~~~
He would certainly did good but needs someone more defensive, some strong presence, say Carvalho. Blind is also sort of playmaker with rather shorter passing range and some above average defensive skills. I really can't wait for the day Andreas will start in league game. He is awesome and the only thing he lacks is experience right now and the experience comes with games. Of course its safer to put in Valencia but I would experiment from time to time, anyway its a good sign when he is at least on the bench here and there. It really can be some new class of if we think about it. Januzaj, Pereira and Wilson who is already getting some game time, young defenders already made their debut too but I am not sure whether they(Blackett, McNair) are on the same level in terms of potential with those three attacking minded players mentioned above. Pearson is also mentioned a lot but curiously he looks nowhere near to first team for van Gaal even he looks like player who could easily be better than Blind and quite soon to be at least his back-up. Then there is Harrop and Rothwell.. but its getting to be long comment I will stop here. I believe youngsters have a chance but needs to take every chance given some of the "less" talented. Pereira belongs to the most talented young players in our academy and he took his chance brilliantly against dons so I hope he will soon get another chance to prove himself..

356~~~
Wait...what?

357~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

358~~~
I wouldnt be surprised to see Pereira make his league debut tomorrow

359~~~
Hope he gets some minutes, we have won just one match comfortably, we havent really got the chance to give him some minutes. Hope it'll happen tomorrow.

360~~~
When I saw the thread bump I hoped he'd signed a new contract. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

361~~~
A start or from the bench???

362~~~
He's a really interesting prospect.

Looked technically a class above at every level he's played at so far.

If the right attitude is there and he learns tactical discipline he could become... dare I say.... a world class midfielder.

363~~~

364~~~
Ola Aina, the defender Andreas was sparring with in that video, is another fantastic young talent. Will likely be a brilliant defender. Very young for his age group too, only 17 or 18 I think.

365~~~
Their Danish defender (Christensen..?) impressed me more. Also very young for his age group.

366~~~
Christensen is also very good. Very mature for his age. Aina looks more nailed on to me though. He has that Gallas/Cole thing about him where he is virtually unbeatable one on one.

367~~~
Been really pleased with him this season. He's done what we all hoped he would and started turning his prodigious ability into a more consistent impact on games. Seeing that, I'm not surprised LVG's keeping him around the first team and getting him on the bench whenever possible. Can't be long before he joins Wilson, Januzaj and the young CBs in getting some first team game time.

368~~~
I agree Christensen looks very classy every time I've seen him Aina looks more like the Micah Richards type to me relies more on physicality and pace to get away with sometimes suspect positioning. The left back DaSilva is a huge talent only turned 16 in April and looked comfortable with Chelseas first team in pre season.

369~~~
Time for his chance? Personally id love to see it. I know its Arsenal but I reckon he'd be up to the challenge...I think he needs to be tested at a higher as well

370~~~
He's not a DM even if Carrick is out too.

He's competing more with Herrera and Fellaini.


Anyway, why the feck have we not signed him to a new contract yet ?

371~~~

372~~~
Woodward from yesterday

“Encouragingly, in addition to the world leading players we have acquired, our first team now includes several new players promoted from our academy, including Blackett, McNair, Pereira and Wilson.

“Youth development is a key part of the club’s DNA and we continue to invest in our academy and scouting infrastructure to attract the most talented young players.”

Hopefully this is a sign hes close to signing a new deal

373~~~
Theres not a chance he'll be allowed slip through.

Im quite hopeful he'll get a run out at the weekend given the fitness issues surrounding our other midfielders.

I see no harm in playing him ahead of Fletcher at this stage either....

374~~~
I totally agree with this, but in a game of the magnitude of the Arsenal game, I fear it will always be the job of a more senior player, ie Fletcher, to play before Youth.  Sadly it seems managing Manchester United makes you do that!

375~~~
Seriously? What exactly do you base that on? 

Compare us like for like with most of the major teams in the Premier League & we're streets ahead on giving youngsters game time & Van Gaal will stick a youngster into a big match if he thinks they're up to it. I trust his judgement over any of the fan bois opinions on here...

376~~~
Well you can take the past few weeks as quite an easy example, as RVP looking horrifically out of form and not got the legs to run the front line on his own, but at no point would Wilson of started/put Rooney up top and play Mata behind, etc. All the managers tend to go with what they know more than throw someone in at the deep end, even in dire straights. Fergie with "that" Blackburn game.  Believe me, I welcome to be proved wrong, but I think we're more likely to see a midfield with Fletcher in before Pereira in the Arsenal game.

377~~~
You don't always strike goal with academies but I think we've done very well for ourselves in recent years not to mention a fine crop of young players still coming through. Who has done this better than us in Europe? Surely we're up there close to Barcelona.

378~~~
Think we are 2nd to them in terms of graduates to play for the first team. There was a thread done a while ago with a table detailing numbers etc.

379~~~

380~~~

381~~~

382~~~
Hope he can bag a chance in the busy schedule coming soon. I would give him a sub chance ahead of Fletcher, if the opportunity arises.

Also, which Brazilian players did LVG have a problem with ?? Even if he did in the past, that should not mean that the same should happen with Pereira.

383~~~
Rivaldo

384~~~
Is Rivaldo all Brazilian players or is that guy blowing it out of proportion?

Andreas isn't fully Brazilian anyway, does he speak Dutch or French or both does anyone know?

385~~~
Won't be surprised if it's another case of the press blowing things out of proportion or just plain lying.

Anyway, I want to see this kid playing soon. I've been impressed every time I've seen him play.

386~~~
Definitely, it reeks of stereotyping. Van Gaal may have had some minor issues with Brazilian players including Giovanni, Rivaldo, Sonny Anderson in the past but it was not a deliberate ploy against them stemming from their nationality. His main gripe was the unwillingness to adapt and follow his orders as part of a collective rather than indulging in individualism considering it's a team game after-all. If Andreas Pereira is willing to learn, improve and follow guidance, there's no reason to believe he won't be selected for the first team eventually provided the manager is satisfied with his progress.

387~~~
I like Pereira's attitude, slow and steady wins the race.

Didn't he also have beef with Romario, or was that just Cruyff?

388~~~
Mostly from his Barcelona days. Rivaldo, Giovanni, Sonny Anderson and Lucio from Bayern.

389~~~
I love Fletch but I agree. I would love to see this kid get a start ahead of Fletch

390~~~
Sonny Anderson! There's a blast from the past.

391~~~
Don't forget that Louis van Gaal wants friendlies when it is a good time in our schedule in the new year onwards assuming our injury crisis clears up and the team are hitting some consistency. 

Without a doubt the likes of Pereira will feature if so, not sure how competitive the games are going to be though.

392~~~
Giovanni called Van Gaal "The Hitler of Brazilian players" which is one of the silliest football related quotes I've ever seen.

393~~~
All his interviews are positive. Why haven't be signed him to a new contract yet ?

He said month and half ago he wasn't even offered one so far.

394~~~
We'll regret it if he leaves I think, I think he can develop to be a very useful deep lying midfielder in a few years, tons of untapped potential there.

395~~~
Looks like a good player, this is why its a shame we got knocked out of carling cup cos he could have started, decent draw in FA cup and maybe he could get games.

396~~~
Did he? That's worrying.

397~~~
Struggling to be concerned given that Van Gaal has had him on the bench a few times already, even though most U21-watchers would've expected him to take another season to get to that stage. If he rates him that highly then he's not going to let him leave.

Now that we've got the Chelsea-City-Arsenal run out of the way, I see him getting on as a sub within the next few games.

398~~~

Yeah, September end first -

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9491217/premier-league-andreas-pereira-has-not-started-talks-with-manchester-united-over-new-deal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...ed-talks-with-manchester-united-over-new-deal</a>

Then October end he kind of said he wanted to stay and he wasn't spoken too yet but he had told his agent to not tell him anyway -

399~~~
Cheers. At least he has said he want's to stay. I'd imagine it's only a matter of time before he is offered a new contract.

400~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-utRK2C3UjA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

401~~~
Is he just me or does he look bigger and stronger than earlier in the season against MK Dons? Developing into a proper box to box stature.

402~~~
I thought so too. That'll stand him in good stead.

403~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2_bhpeETBo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

404~~~
maybe it's about time to give him a chance

405~~~
Yep can see him taking Fletcher's place in the squad now.

406~~~
Couldn't have been worse than Fletcher today.

407~~~
no, he's not going to replace fletcher, they are of different positions.  whether if fletcher can start again or not has nothing to do with pereira, thing is not like that.

408~~~
Never mind getting him a start, lets get him a new contract.

409~~~
from what it seems, anybody could replace fletcher (football-wise) nevermind his position. As for Pereira he could end up anywhere in midfield, he can be profiled into b2b or CAM or even as DLP if he works on his defensive side. It is likely that he will end up further the pitch than fletch but he was several times on the bench to cover b2b positions van Gaal lacked. And B2b was the best position of Fletch's in his prime. But no he can't emulate him or replace him in what he does now. Sadly it's Darren's last season with us..

410~~~
I would start Pereira tomorrow in place of Fletcher. He's not a DM, but he could play in the second CM-role next to Rooney. With Blind, Herrera and Fellaini out with injury/illness and Carrick likely to continue in defence, we are short on options, and he can't be worse than Fletcher last game.

-----------------De Gea---------------
------Jones---Carrick---Evans-------
Rafael---A.Pereira---Rooney---Young
--------------Di Maria-----------------
-------------RVP---Falcao-------------

411~~~
The thinking behind Fletcher playing is obviously that as an experienced pro, he's going to track his midfield runners back towards his own goal and not let his team down. In practice it doesnt always happen, he's still been caught at times but he's far more likely to do the job than a kid who is primarily an attacking player. So thats why he's far more likely to play than Andreas in a team with players like Rooney in midfield

412~~~
Shame Pearson's not been involved with the squad like Pereira, then, because none of those issues would apply to him. Something like this would surely be better than playing Fletcher again after his last performance:

He's energetic, committed, a superb tackler and loves a real battle in midfield. He knows how to prioritise his defensive duties and cover other players when they move forwards, and he always takes responsibility. Plus he knows how to keep it simple - surrounded by flair talents like Pereira, Daehli, Januzaj and Harrop throughout his youth team career, he's become very good at knowing when to leave the risky stuff to players ahead of him, despite being very technically capable in his own right.

All entirely academic of course, since Van Gaal hasn't paid much attention to either him or Rothwell yet for one reason or another.

413~~~
That's a good point, and I understand why Fletcher is chosen ahead of the youngsters, I just think that Fletchers performance against Villa was so bad that if it was up to me I would risk a little youthfull naivety for a little more tempo in our play.

414~~~
I would play him if Carrick is in midfield. Someone to cover the young player's naivety. But if Carrick is in defence and Rooney is in midfield, its very gung ho and puts a lot of pressure on the defence

415~~~
I think the diamond formation with Carrick as the DM would suit Andreas well, but with the 3-4-3 formation, I can't see him getting into the starting XI.

416~~~
Was Rothwell in the training pics a couple weeks ago or am I remembering wrong? You're right though anyway, Pearson would be a great alternative to Fletcher in there and I think he needs to take a step forward from reserve football.

417~~~
You just know that LVG won't play Pearson so I don't see the point discussing something that won't happen.

418~~~
I'd much rather seem him play than Fletcher.

419~~~
How does anyone know? Unless the question is raised with Van Gaal in person.

If the lad is good enough he'll come under consideration.

420~~~
pereira has nothing to do with flecth.  for the season up till now we are still yet to resolve our no 10 issue.  now i'm really wanna giving pereira a shot

421~~~
I hope he is on the bench hopefully.

422~~~
Sadly it wil be like what you said but considering how poor fletcher is overall I wouldn't start him just because he is experienced, it was his foul who led to freekick and Benteke goal, just because he was too slow to catch the player he had to commit a foul and him and evans poor defending cost us the goal unfortunately. Hope he makes the bench at least, anyway diMaría might start as well as he looks like player who can get fit really quickly. Valencia in midfield and Rafael as RB/RWB another option

423~~~
Think he could be involved today

424~~~
On the bench!!!!!!!

425~~~
Hope he will get in later, really rate him.

426~~~
yeah I hope as well, the bench seems quite weak offensively, as the only two options to bolster the attack are Wilson and Andreas, of course Rafa can always go play rightback and valencia move to midfield.. Smalling and Blackett seems like subs ready to come on only when centrebacks get injured or having a really poor gave, hope Paddy will have a good game.. wonder what happened to Dimaria and Januzaj...

427~~~
To rest Falcao, I hope he subs Pereira for him, gets Rooney in the attack and Pereira as CM.

428~~~
Midfield was so open first half, would love to see him get a run out as he would have the space to get a few touches in and settle a bit

429~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

430~~~
Why Fletcher came on instead of him, i will never understand.

431~~~
why is this kid not being given game time - so frustrating!

432~~~
Because Fletcher is a straight replacement for Carrick who need to be rested.Pereira not defensive enough to play that role.

433~~~
Fletch has become very woeful, why not give this guy a chance?

434~~~
On paper and experience you pick Fletcher because its a straight swap but his actual performances show pretty much any competent midfielder would be a better choice. Today was a perfect chance to give this guy 15 minutes, instead we got to watch Fletcher lose the ball under his own control and pass it out for throw ins.

435~~~
He'll get his chance when LVG thinks he's ready.

436~~~
Shame. He's been on the bench for a couple of matches when we've had big leads but still not got on the pitch.

437~~~
It's very easy to say on here but let's say Pereira came on and lost his man that he's supposed to mark that led to a Newcastle's goal then I wouldn't want to imagine the reaction on the caf.

I would sub him on for Rooney or Mata but I guess LVG know better.

438~~~
Wilson got his another 30 minutes of being invisible.

439~~~
But Fletcher did exactly that and De Gea saved him. There isn't any point in talking about "ifs" when we haven't even seen this guy yet, Fletcher has looked really poor in every appearance recently and frankly its a matter of time at his current rate before he does cost us.

I agree though, Pereira should be getting swapped for someone higher up the pitch, even 3-0 up you wouldn't stick this guy that deep.......but Mata could have played the role Fletcher was, he practically was for the last 10 anyway.

440~~~
I really wish he'd came on for the last 25 minutes or so, Wilson has had plenty of chances already.

441~~~
Really pissed off Fletcher got a run ahead of him. Fletcher is finished and this guy is the future yet he is left on the bench! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

442~~~
Sounds familiar? #Park #Pogba

443~~~
Yep.

444~~~
Ah the CAF.....disappointment at one young player not being given a chance is expressed as disappointment at another young player actually being given a chance. Makes sense that....

445~~~
Ya I was just going to say he could be another Pogba. He looks a star in the making.

446~~~
Not coming on at 3 0 at home when the game was won, future looks bleak I'm afraid. Shame was desperate to see him today.

447~~~
Not as talented as Pogba but well I would say he's on the right track (if he's not going to leave us of course).

448~~~
Possibly not although I think Pogba was helped by his physicality. Pereira is better on the ball (touch, passing, vision) IMO although there ain't much in it.

449~~~
LVG puts him on the bench but seems very reluctant to use him.

Not like he hasn't had chances in matches where he's been on the bench.

450~~~
Didn't we offer Pogba a contract which he declined to sign? Last I heard, Pereira hadn't been made any sort of offer. I think AP wants to stay but it isn't in his hands at the moment.

451~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hardly. With another game in 48hrs the priority was giving certain players a breather and easing the likes of Rafael back into the team. Pereira is obviously rated highly if he's making our bench at 18yo.

452~~~
Maybe not 100% the same situation but yeah i fear we will lose him.

He should have come on instead of Wilson

453~~~
FFS as usual the caf paranoia continues.

454~~~
Hardly? Regardless of age, if he was that highly rated he would have played today (didn't Newcastle start at 17 year old) and  how many mins has Andreas played in the prem this year?

I'm sure if you look at our benches through the years we have had all sorts of players, so I don't read anything into that.

I'm gutted because it was a perfect opportunity, smacks of pogba all over again.

455~~~
Carricks played a lot of minutes since coming back from injury and is a key man now in time, so understood that sub. Fletcher the only holding mid we had on the bench so made sense.
Falcao was never going to play the 90, so Wilson on was another obvious one though i would have preferred Adnan.
Finally with the priority surely to go back to 4 at the back in the next couple of weeks, Rafael needed a cameo after being out for 2 months and not getting on the last game.

456~~~
We needed to play a holding midfielder when we were 3 0 up?

457~~~
I'm not paranoid, i'm just realistic, if he was that highly rated by the management then why wasn't he brought on today? This was the only game we have dominated recently and I just thought he could have seen some action.

458~~~
It's kind of like pogba, except instead of one of the best young CMs in the world it's a bizarrely inconsistent number 10.

AP doesn't deserve a place on the first team bench from what he did at under age, but clearly LVG is raising him up above that and letting him train with/travel with the first team. If LVG has taken an interest in him then he's in the best possible situation to make use of his talent, which in the first couple of years of his united career, apart from some nice youtube clips, looks to have been going to waste

459~~~
fletch was a direct replacement to carrick for giving him a rest.  so is the same for wilson/falcao swap.  pereira would only sub either mata or rooney.  as long as both of them were playing good probably this is preferable to keep them on the field since they both occupied key positions of the game.  could've only watched the 2nd half and they both looked okay to me during the last 45 mins.  so, nothing wrong there as mata has already smelt the pressure that he has to dedicate himself to the team play io just focusing in decorating his own statistics.

be patient, pereira will get his chance within the season.  i'm convinced

460~~~
We didnt need to but you know what Van gaal is like for systems. He's not gonna play 5-3-2 and not have a centre mid thats defensive minded. If Carrick gets injured its Fletcher that needs to be up to speed to replace him so it was a good chance to give him more minutes. Pereira's a player for the future, he'll not be in a panic right now to involve him. That he's makin the bench should be a sign that he's rated highly.

461~~~
LVG knows a thing or two about nurturing young players.

462~~~
Of course we still need it. One goal and they're be back in it. We need to keep shape and be solid. Not saying that I'm happy with Fletcher's substitution though.

463~~~

464~~~
Guessing he will be on the bench today. Would be great if he could get some game time.

465~~~
Don't think Stoke away is the place for him to make his league debut.

466~~~
Agreed.

467~~~
Worrying that there's still no development regarding his contract extension.

468~~~
In the media there isn't, we wouldn't have a clue what is going on behind closed doors.

469~~~
Exactly. He could be eating a big, fat cake as we speak.

470~~~
He will play against Yeovil guys he's only 19 lets see what he can do then.

471~~~
Anderson v2.0?

472~~~
To those who have watched him regularly this season, how has he done so far, and if he were to play against Yeovil, in what position would it be you reckon? 

------------Carrick---------
---Herrera--------Pereira--
-----Di Maria--Rooney----
-----------Falcao-----------

Yeovil 5 - 6 Man Utd

473~~~
I'd love him to start and he could slot in straight for Mata

474~~~
a definite no 10.  really want him to start

475~~~
He has to start against Yeovil.

476~~~
Good luck to him if he gets a run.

477~~~
Nope... No Pereira today, irritating.

478~~~
If he isn't injured or ill.......what a disgrace Anderson is on the bench and not Andreas <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

479~~~
Looks like he'll be off in the summer

480~~~
Anderson probably kept him out...

481~~~
Really surprised/disappointed that he's not even in the squad.

482~~~
feck sakes.

483~~~
Pretty much this.

484~~~
He's gone.

485~~~
We can buy him back from Atletico Madrid for 50m in 3 years

486~~~
How he's not in the squad today completely baffles me, especially when he's been on the bench quite a few times in EPL fixtures. He was the best of a bad bunch against MK Dons. Really disappointed not to see him.

487~~~
I dont see enough from him as a 10, especially considering we're oversaturated with players for that position. 

People were saying he can be as good as Pogba... Hopefully thats as crazy as it sounds if he's leaving.

488~~~
Given he plays for us maybe he's injured? That would at least excuse picking that oxygen thief Anderson over him.

489~~~
I guess we could be hoping we can stick Anderson on in the 2nd half and if he can play 20 minutes without looking diabolical someone might take a punt and pay some money for him in Jan

490~~~
Would have thought he'd make the squad at least. Probably injured/ill. Van Gaal obviously rates him and had him on the bench plenty of times this season already, people need to calm down a tad.

491~~~
he won't want to leave. He won't get those wages anywhere else. At best someone will take him on loan, with United paying nearly all his wages.

492~~~
Agreed. No need for all the hysterics on here. Shame he's not involved though. He's an enjoyable player to watch

493~~~
the greatest disappointment today, not even on the bench. Hopefully he is just injured, such a talent

494~~~
The way this season is, I'm going with an injury first. If he isn't then it doesn't look good for his future here, unless we are loaning him out soon.

495~~~
How can he be on the bench for Premier League matches, but not Yeovil in the cup?! Did we really have to bring Mata AND Di Maria? He's being treated like a work experience kid..

496~~~
Disappointing to not see him involved at all, unless he's injured of course.

497~~~

498~~~
Joke that Anderson makes the squad and Perreira doesn't.

499~~~
Surprising Ando made the bench considering Andreas was on the bench ahead of him for the last few PL games.. Might be ill or something like that

500~~~
Unless a solid explanation comes up, there's no fecking way I would accept Anderson to be in the squad ahead of Pereira.

501~~~
He's gone in the summer along with Falcao and Herrera.

502~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">If we remember back to LVG's first press conference, he said he would not immediately focus on youth development, that his immediate focus was sorting out first team honours. Leaving out players such as Pereira in such fixtures is evidence of that strategy, especially about the debacle against MK dons.</span>

503~~~
He should leave.

Anderson > Pereira according to LvG

Pogba alike situation...

504~~~
Disappointing that he's not in today but I don't think he's that special a talent. Nothing like the Pogba situation.

505~~~
He will leave in summer and then CAF will go round in circles debating how he wasn't used today by LVG.

506~~~
Unless he is injured he obviously isn't rated by LvG and Co.

507~~~
Should we leave youth development at that just because of one match? As far as I remember, our senior players were as much guilty (if not more) as the the youngsters were.

Sending Pereira in the stands in favor of a disgraced Anderson is the worst of insults there is for any player.

508~~~
What?

I see Caf has bone all panic and stuff about Pereira.

509~~~
Feck me. The hysteria in this thread. He's a kid. He'll get another chance. If he's good enough.

510~~~
I wasn't being serious. Just reiterating the point that the cafe went doomsday when Herrera and Falcao weren't getting a game just after coming back from injury.

511~~~
Yeah, its hilarious really.

512~~~
Ah, sorry. Yeah I agree. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

513~~~
Why on earth will Herrera be gone in the summer??

514~~~
TBF its a valid criticism.

What's the point of putting Anderson in the 18. He's a fecking useless lazy wanker.

515~~~
Because Anderson makes the bench ahead of him, despite him beating Anderson for a spot on the bench in numerous, more important games means that van Gaal prefers Anderson? Ok.

516~~~
What? I didn't say he must play, but he should be put ahead of Anderson for sure in the pecking order. The only words I have for Anderson is about calling him a fat and lazy SOB for a footballer who should be returned to the hole where he belongs.

517~~~
There's loads of potential reasons. Pereira has a bit of an injury, he's not been training well this week, he was allowed to spend new year with his family in Brazil. Whatever, it's one game. No justification at all for all the comments about this being the beginning of the end of his United career.

518~~~
See post above.

519~~~
Rumors about him leaving getting stronger.

Why hasn't his contract been extended yet ?

520~~~
What rumours?

521~~~
He has bags of potential, but sits on the bench most of the time. I didnt expect him to play every game, but he could have had a few cameo appearances here and there. It is normal that he thinks about hsi future, wouldnt surprise me if he leaves. Would be a big shame though.

522~~~
Pereira is a funny case.The more he's not playing, the more he's getting overrated by the caf.

People who's complaining about his contract clearly don't understand how this club works.We don't make decision about extending a youngster's contract at this point yet unless he's getting games in the first team which Pereira hasn't (does not mean we're going to keep him).It has been the same for every youngster every year yet I saw people complain every time.

523~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/players/andreas-pereira.44/">Andreas Pereira</a> on the bench today! Hoping for a cameo appearance.

524~~~
Yeah, he won't play.

525~~~
Is he though?  I'm confused with all this mis-information...

527~~~

528~~~
Uh oh..

529~~~
Not surprised if true.

530~~~
I'm saying this is definitely true. Balague has gone to the lengths to actually @ him. Plus, they both follow each other on twitter.

531~~~
is he any good though?

532~~~
Yes and No.

Has shown glimpses of brilliance but struggles with any form of consistency. By now he should have got the odd cameo here and there but overall he's place in the squad is about right.

533~~~
How consistent was Pogba in the academy?

534~~~
I want him to sign a new contract but I can't say I'll be gutted if he does leave. Hopefully he signs but if he doesn't, oh well..

535~~~
It'll be interesting to see if he features against Cambridge if they're in the middle of contract talks.

536~~~
More consistent than Pereira(From what I remember). Although Pogba in his last season didn't look arsed most of the time.(Was also getting at performed by David Petrucci <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>)

537~~~
I don't get the hype, to be honest, only seen him in the flesh half a dozen times, plenty of promise, great technique, but !

538~~~
From what I remember he was consistently very good when it suited him, him and Morrison were both brilliant the year we won the FA Youth Cup against Sheffield United. It was his attitude that was the problem, he was clearly too good for the level he was playing and reacted to that by not putting in the effort.

539~~~
I hope this gets sorted. He's a fantastic talent, very technically gifted, and it shows by the fact he's always been playing above his age group. He looked really talented against MK Dons too.

540~~~
Could be, but not how to measure how big of a talent imo, I have the same feeling with Pereira as I had with Pogba, Pogba was a bigger talent, but they both showed that they had the ability of a class above, but neither have shown the consistency of a lets say Pearson/Rothwell for a while, who are quite comfortably less talented imo. Sometims youngsters fail to get the consistency at such a level, I've noticed, with the type of player Pereira is and his position now, it doesnt even surprise me. But tbf, no matyer how talented you are, he has to show it. But its a shame that he's never been giving a chance and players like McNair and Blackett have, if you told me this 2 years ago, I'd call you crazy.

541~~~
No he did'nt

542~~~
He was definitely the only player that night who looked like a Manchester United talent.

543~~~
Such a joke he hasn't been given chances especially considering a washed up Fletcher has been getting plenty more game time than him. Could be Pogba 2.0 if LVG doesn't get his act together and open his eyes.

544~~~
After we lost Ravel and Pogba I stopped to be excited for youngsters to come through in our first team.

Too many players that I have been excited about have left the club! <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

It seems that most of the promising one doesn't get enough chance. It was the case with Ravel, Pogba, Rossi and Pique.

545~~~
It would be strange if he'd accepted it after not getting a sniff against Yeovil.

Cambridge is last chance to convince him, he can have future here.

546~~~
Hopefully he ends up signing, he's the only CM from the current youth team I can see making it here.

547~~~
I think it's more a case that the English lads are favoured. I know Ravel is English but he was a loose cannon. The other three players you mentioned have more talent in their left testicle than the likes of Welbeck, Cleverley and Evans yet because they aren't from Britain or Ireland they struggle to be given opportunities. No way would Welbeck, Cleverley or Evans have lasted as long as they did if they were from mainland Europe or South America.

548~~~
I can understand 99% of the matches LvG didn't bring on Pereira, even against Yeovil. 

But what i couldn't understand was the match when we were 3-0 up in lead with 15 min to go and him bringing on Fletcher. That was just utter retarded.

549~~~
If he doesn't want to sign the contract then he can piss off elsewhere. We've money to burn and the only way for the vast majority of young players at the club is down. This particular situation is very different to the Pogba farce.

550~~~
Rubbish.

And Anderson say Hi

551~~~
Anderson is a stupid example. He wasn't brought into the club for small money as a 15/16 year old. He was a big money signing. I was clearly talking about players who have come through our academy. He obviously didn't.

552~~~
That's utter nonsense. You need to look at each case individually, and players like Rafael, Fabio and Januzaj clearly prove it wrong. The last sentence has some semblance of truth, but mainly because since they are more local then they tend to be happier as squad players then some of the overseas youngsters.

553~~~
It's more a case of English players or those who have been at the club for waiting for their turn longer. 

And what <a class="username" data-user="40130, @datura" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/40130/">@datura</a> said.

554~~~
This is called contract negotiation folks.It's obvious that his side would want more benefits now they have the pulling power.We should have start the contract negotiation earlier.Either case, no big deal.

Sorry but Pereira didn't show half of the things Welbeck had shown at the same age.He might make it but he's one of the most overrated youngsters in the caf.

555~~~
Pereira suffered from playing behind the striker. He's clearly much better playing deeper than right behind the striker. It's no coincidence that he started to perform much better this season compared to last where apart from his goals was useless in a lot of games. I do agree that he's overhyped right now though.

556~~~
Fabio barely played for us after 2012 (when he was only 22). I agree with the decision to let him go but you can hardly say he was given plenty of chances. Rafael and Januzaj are clearly talented players which is why they have broken into the first team. My original point was that the likes of Pogba, Rossi and Pique were and are far more talented than the likes of Welbeck, Cleverley and Evans yet they weren't given the same chances the latter trio were. 

I do appreciate that is a factor.

I wasn't saying Pereira is as talented as Welbeck at the same age (although he may well turn out to be a better player) I was just saying that the likes of Pogba was more talented yet wasn't given the same opportunities.

557~~~
Welbeck,Cleverley and Evans all had to go through various successful loan moves to make the first team at 21-22.Pogba was pretty much part of it age 18.He wasn't patient enough, nothing to do with lack of opportunities.

Pereira should be happy that he's ahead of Pearson,Rothwell and Harrop despite showing less than them at U21s level.He might be more talented than some of them but not that much like people claimed it to be really with less consistency.

558~~~
From what I've seen of Pereira I think we would see more consistency from him as a CM (B2B) at #10 or out wide he has been inconsistent no doubt about that but as a Attacking CM like Anderson or Herrera I think could release his true potential. I can understand why he hasn't been getting game time because of our managers stubbornness to play 352 (extra defender, 1 less midfielder) in a 442 diamond he also plays well as he did against MK Dons and in the reserves but since we reverted back to 352 where he's been playing as a #10 he's not been at his best but still very talented to say the least. The potential is all there, just needs to be unlocked and it all depends on the formation we play.

559~~~
Balague states that he's rejected a new contract in the MEN today. 

What's going on here?

560~~~
He never gets any gametime mate.  A move may be the best for both parties

561~~~
When you really want to know the inside track on a Brazilian teenager negotiating a contract with a club based in Manchester, who better to keep us up to speed than a renowned Spanish bullshit artist?

562~~~
Time he got a first team run out. Friday is the perfect opportunity

563~~~
I'd rather see Januzaj start and don't see how both fit in the team, both are best at AM and wasted as CM.

564~~~
I don't agree, Andreas is much better playing deeper than as a AM. Andreas' problem, like Ander, is that van Gaal might feel they lack physically/defensively to play as a proper 8.

565~~~
You obviously haven't watched Pereira enough if you think that's the case

566~~~
That simply isn't true. Pique came through at the same time as Evans (and Shawcross) and was given plenty of opportunities (until that one mistake against Bolton IIRC). Due to having a world class and injury free Rio and Vidic at the time, there was always limited chances, and Pique didn't sign a new contract and the club chose to sell him back to Barcelona for a small fee. Evans was more patient; even though he didn't reach the intended levels, he was still a very talented youngster and looked more suited to the Premier League than pique at the time.

Rossi and Welbdck broke through at much different stages. Rossi after signing Tevez, as he already had Rooney, Saha and Solskjaer ahead of him. Of course Saha was injured forever and Ole received an injury that led to retirement; so had Rossi stayed, he would have had many chances. Welbeck didn't come through till much later.

Pogba is another story. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

567~~~
It was'nt hard to shine that night, I can turn quicker than Jonny Evans !

568~~~
No, just compilations and stuff. From what I've seen he can create way more havoc if he can get his trickery into play. Wasted may be over the top, yeah.

569~~~
He's more effective deeper, when he plays as a 10 he tends to get crowded out a bit too much because he's lacking a yard of pace but when he plays deeper he makes himself a bit of space then plays the pass or can drive with the ball. His long passing and ability to open up the game are also two of the better parts of his game and he doesn't really get to use them playing further forward.

570~~~
Shame he wasn't even on the bench today.

Seeming more likely that he might leave in the summer. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> (And then everyone will moan in hindsight at LVG not using him.)

571~~~
he is as good as gone, lets be honest.

572~~~
Psg in for him... Was a matter of time I guess. Weird he hasn't gotten any playing time.

573~~~
TBH what makes it worse is that this lad come on against MK Dons and played quite well, and hasn't had a sniff since, (even though we have had various injuries in midfield)
Anyway I guess you can't really complain, since a more senior player like Herrera is struggling for gametime.

574~~~
He won't leave.People are way too pessimistic these days.He's a very determined lad.

With Fletcher going he will have less competitors in the second half of this campaign (yeah I don't think we will sign anyone this Jan).

575~~~
He'll be gone at the end of season, cannot see it any other way.

576~~~
He'll probably see Pogba and think to himself perhaps this isnt the club to take your first steps in. Why havent we even found him a loan ffs.

577~~~
He'll stay. No worries.

578~~~
Why so sure?

579~~~
They have Cabaye and Rabiot not getting any games, hows he going to be more than 7th choice CM at a club like that? He's no better off than here so its probably a nonsense rumour

580~~~
Hopefully we sign him and turn him into another Pogba.

581~~~
He'll get a game in the replay I think, It would seem silly to start the kids in a hostile away atmosphere. We would have one eye on the Liverpool U-21 game tonight for him and I reckon He, Wilson and Januzaj will all start the replay.

582~~~
I remember him saying in an interview at the start of the season something about he could be playing first-team football in another club/league but he wanted to make it here. Whether he'll stay or not I don't know but I doubt he'll go to PSG.

583~~~
What was pogbas competition at huge before they signed him? Pirlo, Vidal, marchisio and a couple of others probably? While we had scholes out of retirement, Carrick, an ill fletcher, anderson and cleverley... Competition isn't the problem. Problem is the willingness to give players a chance and for some reason we're wasting another very promising central midfielder.

584~~~
He isnt Pogba

This is something people need to realise already.

Juventus had more competition for places than we had, but PSG have : Cabaye, Motta, Veratti, Pastore, Matuidi, and Rabiot already. He wouldnt have a chance. And Rabiot is another highly rated young player linked with top clubs, he's not getting his chance. Why would Pereira?

585~~~
PSG aren't any more likely to give him that chance though. Rabiot is pretty highly rated too and rarely plays, it would probably be similar for Pereira if he was to go there.

586~~~
I don't get the point of "wasting him".He isn't ready to play for us yet and even Herrera didn't get much game times recently.He's not Pogba level of talent and seems be more patient than his French senior.As I said Fletcher will go so that's one less competitor for him.

587~~~
Inevitable comparisons to Pogba will follow, but there's a sizeable difference in the talent of the two.

588~~~
Yes just like you turned Suso into better than Fabregas then <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

589~~~
Didn't progress as well as I hoped, but he is still very young there is still time for him to develop into a top player. He will probably leave at the end of the season somewhere he can get games.

590~~~
Where's this PSG story come from?

591~~~
I believe I said in the post that it might not be with us. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

592~~~
He said he wanted to stay just a few months ago. Also, there's no real reason for him to leave. He's progressing as a player and he's taken another step towards the first-team this season, which is all the club can ask of him and vice versa. There could be any number of reasons why his agent (Pereira says he doesn't want to get personally involved) rejected United's first contract offer, if indeed he did. That Balague fella seems to be the only one reporting it so a pinch of salt or two could well be in order.

593~~~
The fact is, he still didn't renew the contract and if we really would rate him very highly, surely we wouldn't wait this long to do serious business. So I can't be sure.

594~~~
I'm quite certain it's not unusual for us to wait until the new year to renew the contracts of 18/19-year-olds (perhaps <a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> or <a class="username" data-user="29933, @jb8521" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/29933/">@jb8521</a> could back me up here..?). I doubt the fact that it hasn't happened yet is a reflection of how highly rated he is within the club. But, like you, I can't be sure of anything. For now, though, I'd be amazed if he wasn't at United next season.

595~~~
Get Balotelli to score like a striker then get to pogba talk <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

596~~~
I dont agree with it personally but no its not unusual at all in fact its very rare for us to renew earlier when it comes to young players. From what I've heard he and his father are very happy with how he has been treated this year and the way he has been integrated into the squad not just in terms of playing and training but also the fact that he has been included on all of the clubs get togethers and nights out. Van Gaal clearly rates him and has spoken to him about his development. He says all the right things in interviews and seems determined to make it here. I think people are getting overly excited about him rejecting the clubs first offer as its extremely rare for a player to accept the initial offer thats why they're called contract negotiations after all. Id be surprised if he doesnt sign a new contract.

597~~~
By that logic the only young player we have rated in recent years is Januzaj. Rightly or wrongly we very rarely renew young players contracts any earlier than this

598~~~
Well, yeah. Can't think of anyone else who's been on the level of Januzaj in recent years potential-wise(apart from maybe Wilson), but Pereira seems the next best thing. And when there are rumours floating around that PSG are interested, why wait?

599~~~
Wilson hasnt signed a new contract yet either so going by your logic above does that mean we dont rate him either? I dont know the reasoning behind us waiting nor do I agree with it but thats the way its done at the club. If the player wants to stay at the club he will sign a new contract why should a paper writing about PSG being interested change how we do business?

600~~~
Darren Fletcher and Anderson getting ahead of him in the pecking order is reason enough for him to leave.

601~~~
Has he rejected a contract from us or have we failed to offer him one?

602~~~
Rejected a contract from us

603~~~
Wilson signed a new contract last summer no ? He was out of contract last year otherwise.

604~~~
Rejected the <b>initial offer</b>.

605~~~
I find it shocking that he hasn't been given any game time in the first team. More than good enough to at least be given a shot off the bench now and again. Kids of his technique don't come around often, you have to take a gamble and play them because if it clicks you have a gem on your hands, if it doesn't big deal.. adios.

606~~~
That's not the point, the question I ask myself is why we do business that way.

607~~~
Complete and utter stupidity from LVG to play Fletcher ahead of him when he is clearly finished at the top level and about to leave the club.

608~~~
did very good today, very mature performance

609~~~
As far as I know he signed a pro contract when he turned 17 which would take him up to this summer

610~~~
don't worry he will sign, but I would give him run out against Cambridge to encourage him to stay, that we actually count with him.. He mad ethe bench several times so I guess he is slowly getting to the first team. He is the player who needs to get chances in A-team as he can get lost in u21, playing with senior players would give him more confidence and he would definitely do better like he did his 20mins agaisnt dons where he was brilliant. 

and I also believe once Fletcher is gone and Anderson on his way out, he will get their squad place, so no need for the boy to be impatient...

611~~~
if herrera and januzaj hardly play, pereira's got no chance.

612~~~
His passing and general play making is always good, but I was impressed with his tackling and work rate yesterday too. I think he is definitely ready for some first team games, just needs to cut out the sloppy passing. Reminds me of Herrera in that scenario. Unlucky with the free kick not to score aswell.

613~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_vfEpS3QeQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

614~~~
Already better defensively than Paul Scholes.

Just a banter but it can only do good for his chances with the first team.The worst thing we need is another defensive liability in midfield.

615~~~
He should be our deputy Herrera...problem is he himself is barely getting game time.

616~~~
Problems is philosophy!!!

617~~~
Loves those long crossfield passes. That means he's crap. Amirite, redcafe?

618~~~
One of the things we're lacking to be honest. We don't really have someone who can switch play from deep at a really high standard. Carrick and Blind prefer to keep it on the ground and Herrera and Fellaini don't have the range.

619~~~
Rooney switches pretty well (albiet not always from very deep). Wouldn't say it's what we're lacking. We're poorer passing between the lines.

620~~~
Not been to any matches since they moved to Leigh, but he already looks a better player than last season if that video is anything to go by.

I love how comfortable he is on his left foot. That can only help him find a position under LvG's philosophy.

621~~~
What's the general feeling on this guy, staying or going?

622~~~
It would be an utter shame to lose him without seeing him given a proper first team opportunity. Other than the cup reply its not very likely this season. Question is will the player be patient? LVG has spoken to him at least....

623~~~
Im sure this guy is looking at januzaj at the moment and thinking "if he can't get in how am i supposed to?!".Then he sees Pogba leaving getting first team football and turning into a world star.

I would not be suprised if he leaves for first team football at all, many too clubs will sign him - probably juventus. So infuriating we can't give him and januzaj more chances.

624~~~
Fletcher all but gone is a good thing for him. Once LvG hopefully sees sense and starts playing players in their actual position I'm hopeful about him.

625~~~

626~~~
Next summer as in this coming 2015 summer?

627~~~
So his son wants to play yet PSG would be a good club for him?

628~~~
I think Rooney is decent at it, sometimes he mishits but we're used to Paul Scholes so i doubt we will ever see someone that good at long range passing ever again.

629~~~
Same was said about Pogba and Juventus and look how that turned out. Pereira isn't ever going to be as good as him but he's still one of our best talents. I'll be pissed if he leaves us as well, again partly down to mismanagement.

630~~~
What are you supposed to do with him though? if he isn't ready for the first team then he can't play there, especially this season with so few games, & if he isn't content biding his time in the U21's and won't sign a new contract then what can we do, he has to go.

It comes down to whether he has faith in his ability to improve, if he does then he knows he will get playing time with United, and a nice fat wage packet to go with it, lad just needs to show a bit of patience.

631~~~
Our lack of real faith in young players recently has been shocking for a club with such a long history of promoting and developing youngsters.

632~~~
What lack of real faith? Aren't we playing Wilson, McNair and Blackett?

633~~~
With Fletcher and Anderson leaving (hopefully) Andreas finds himself promoted, unless we sign a midfielder in this window (unlikely). It will make him 5th or 6th choice, depending on if you class Rooney as a midfielder.

634~~~
Hopefully we stop this nonsense of playing Rooney and Mata as CMs. Both are better further up the pitch. Di Maria, Carrick, Herrera, Blind, Fellaini and Pereira should be our midfield options.

635~~~
Let's face it he isn't gonna get a chance anytime soon. He's been on the bench when we've been winning games 2-0/3-0 and still not got a look in. If a £30m CM in Herrera is barely getting game time, I wouldn't be expecting to see this fella anytime soon.

636~~~
Wilson, Januzaj, Blackett, McNair and shaw have all featured this season, its hardly the time to suggest that.

637~~~
Jesus, the club and LVG have shown a lot more faith in young players than most of this forum!

638~~~
There is an argument to be made that if Fletcher leaves and we don't sign a central midfielder he'll get a look in between now and the end of the season. Especially when you consider how many appearances Fletcher has made this season.

639~~~
The latter two were because of injuries and Wilson has only played 300 mins of prem action this season.

640~~~
That is still pretty good, considering hes only scored 1 goal.

641~~~
and people on here are crying about every one of those mins Wilson has been given

642~~~
I agree. fecking LVG, he should put on the U18s next game.

643~~~
Yeah but Herrera was still sat on the bench whilst Fletcher made those appearances.

644~~~
Its his first season and obviously needs time to figure stuff out but with so few minutes he isn't even getting an opportunity to do so, even more incredible is that he's only started 2 matches while at times we've resorted to playing players out of position. Anyways, the sheer lack of minutes that Januzaj(who has proven he has the goods) and Pereira(who is talented to the heavens) have gotten is astonishing really.

645~~~
He actually is, so what if he has only started 2 matches? He needs to be eased in, and if he starts and plays poorly why should he start the next game? I think he is being eased in pretty well at the moment, don't see a problem with that.

Januzaj - Yes I agree on that one. I'm hoping he plays more from now given his decent performance in the last game.

With Pereira - Well the fact Herrera is also struggling for game time, I'm not suprised hes not been getting a chance, would have liked to see him involved a bit more instead of Fletcher, however Fletcher is now going, so he may get his chance.

646~~~
lol amazing retort considering what the consequences of these actions can be. We should know from experience that if you dick around with these young players' careers they are going to ditch us and find a new better home elsewhere. Now i don't have a problem with a young player being deemed not good enough to cut the grade here however i do have a problem with a really talented youngsters development being stalled for no reason. If we really do believe that these lads have it in them to one day cut the grade we need to make a bigger effort to get them onto the pitch or this story wont have a happy ending. Whats even more disappointing is the fact that the experienced big money players on our books aren't really showing their worth either so perhaps the opportunity is there to give them more of a run out, look what a leap of faith did for Sterlings career.
Such thinking makes no sense to me.

647~~~
With Fletcher leaving and Carrick out surely he has to come into Van Gaal's thinking now.

648~~~
All the mins Wilson has got will have helped him a lot coping with the demands of adult football. Most players are sent on loan to make that adjustment, Wilson has been given the oppertunity to do it at home. He's played more minutes than Harrison Reed, a 20 year old midfielder at Southampton. I thought they were supposed to be the masters of bringing youth through but Wilson has played more than he has.

Januzaj hasnt proven anything of the sort, he had half a season of good form and you obviously need to do more than that to be a first teamer at United. And Pereira is less talented than for example Ander Hererra, so talk about a gross exaggeration

649~~~
Exactly, and he needs more minutes. Not 17 mins here, 20 there. Reeds mins are saturated to a specific period in time, Wilson has been part of the team for some time now. The other thing is we don't really know how highly rated he is at Southampton but we've certainly seen in recent times that if someone is highly rated they'll get the mins to progress and generally do so. Being that young and being arguably the best outfield player at the club for a period of time is proving allot for a player in their first season. Certainly enough to warrant being given more game time that he has been this season. We'll have to agree to disagree on who's more talented between Pereira and Hererra.

650~~~
I think you just need to talk the Scholesy goggles off

651~~~
If I'm being honest Reed's talent isn't comparable to Wilson.

652~~~
Neither is his competition. Wilson has to be chosen over Falcao, RVP or possibly even Rooney. Reed can compete for 3 spots in midfield and only Schneiderlin is among the best CMs in the league.

653~~~
Exactly, Wilson is doing well, hes been picked ahead of Falcao a few times already this seasonn (when Falcao has been fit)
Hes developing well, needs to play a lot better when he gets his chances, but he seems to have every opportunity to make a real name for himself here between now and the end of the season, if he takes his chances.

654~~~
Is he injured? Thought he would be at least on the bench today?

655~~~
Played for the U21s last night.

656~~~
Ah cool cheers mate. Still hoping to see him get a 1st team chance.

657~~~
I hope we keep him, I think he can be a choice for the RM role in the diamond.

658~~~
Every piece of positive attacking play for us in this current U21 game has come through him, we need to re-sign him.

659~~~
Involved in both our goals tonight and was easily our best player. His free-kick took a deflection for the goal but his delivery on the one that Thorpe headed in was excellent.

660~~~
Watching the game now on MUTV - really hope we see him making some progress into the first team this season. He's been so good in this one, against probably the toughest side in the U21 league.

661~~~
He carries that attitude of 'give me the ball and something will happen' with him. He is definitely a prospect.

662~~~
He wouldn't be any worse than Rooney in midfield.

He's going to leave in the summer, and go tear it up elsewhere isn't he.

663~~~
99corriganHD has uploaded a vid of him, looked very impressive. He's pretty wasteful in his passing at times (similar to another very good midfielder in first team) but when dribbling, it looks like you cant snatch the ball of him, shields the ball very well and is a very good kick tacker (is this a word?).

664~~~
free kick taker would be the correct word.

Yes his ball in for Thorpe was beautiful, to be honest he would be the best corner and free kick taker in the team IMO, his effort from 30 yards was unlucky to be saved too, that curve <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I really don't see how he could do a worse job than Rooney or Herrera in midfield, I hope he get's a game from the bench soon, or even in the cup.

665~~~
Aah seems logical.

666~~~
Nothing new from him last night to be honest. Hes been at that all season. If we do lose him I'll begin to question what's going on with the club in many respects. When he made the bench early on in the season I was convinced that was the beginning of his emergence. Such a shame given the dross we've had to watch in there this year.

667~~~
Since no contract has been signed yet, LVG probably wont give him a spot on the bench either. I hope we keep him and he gets more playing time

668~~~
He's a lovely little player, I really hope that he'll be given some minutes soon.. or else he'll bugger off in the summer.

669~~~
Some one needs to have a word, tie him down to a contract and get him a good loan deal somewhere

670~~~
Yes, he plays with a lot of confidence and also a bit a spiky temperament which he'll need to protect himself if he gets the chance to play as a CM in the PL. I honestly think he's at the point where he's gotten all he can out of U21 level football, he needs to start getting minutes in the main squad like Wilson, McNair and Januzaj.

671~~~
Would love it if he would extend his deal, but he wont get a lot of minutes in the first team if that is the reason why he hasnt signed yet. We have Ander who barely gets a look in.

672~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIgR4unyloE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

673~~~
We need to make the lad feel like he has a future with us. Trouble is we are heading in to the business end of a season where we need to finish in the top 4 so opportunities in the first team will be really tough for him to get.  I hope we can keep him.

674~~~
I just wondered what the general consensus was on here, is this lad going to sign or not?

Still a tad surprised he hasn't had any minutes myself.

675~~~
Not looking good really is it?. He came on and impressed against MK dons when everybody else looked rubbish, then hasn't had a look in since. 

He's done pretty well in all the reserve games I have seen too, I really don't understand why he hasn't had a chance - especially in our midfield. 

By now he's probably negotiating with other teams, so unless we can persuade him I think he is gone <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

676~~~
I do think the club isn't going to give him a chance unless he signs a contract with the club. While maybe Pereira himself would prefer to be given a chance before signing the contract.

I don't think he'll sign.

677~~~
He seems quite a talent, lets face it we're still not blessed with players in the midfield surely throwing him in here and there wouldn't hurt.

678~~~
Think that's a very good shout.

679~~~
Be gutted if he doesn't.

Don't understand why we bother chasing these youngsters, we apparently beat a lot of clubs to both Andrea and Pogba, yet when they are on the verge of breaking through we don't seem to fully commit.

680~~~
I'd be very annoyed if we let him go.

681~~~
Give him a  18 month contract, and if he succeeds bump his contract up. I'd hate to lose him.

682~~~
His development into a CM this season has been the highlight of the youth team IMO and he is the only young CM we have I can see making it here, hopefully we sort something out with him.

683~~~
He would be ideal in our midfield diamond at the moment, his obvious trait is his passing and vision, but he seems very comfortable when out wide and has the skill set to glide past players, similar to Silva.

684~~~
Playing Rooney as a cm isn't helping his chances, either LVG changes his philosophy/formation or he's gone.

685~~~
I reckon we're not gonna play him unless he signs a contract! LVG won't see a point in playing him if he could be off, also showcases him for other clubs to come in.

He seems to really love the club though, going by his twitter posts

<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/andrinhopereira" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/andrinhopereira</a>

686~~~
As if other clubs don't know about him...

We're not playing so far simply because of the competition.How can he get games when he's behind Herrera in the pecking order and Ander had to sit on the bench every match?

That saying we seem to play him in different positions recently for the U21s so that might increase his chance with the first team.

687~~~
He didn't get a chance against yeovil or cambridge which I think many people are annoyed about. Those games he could quite easily have played and showed his worth, IMO he is better than Rooney in CM now!

688~~~
Obviously people know about him!

But if he starts getting a few games and makes an impact like Januzaj did then obviously more teams are going to want him, which will also drive up his contract demands and give him all the power in negotiation.

689~~~
By the same reason we shouldn't play Wilson or McNair also.

People overthought too much about Pereira's contract situation.He's no Pogba and he seems more determined to make it at this club than Paul.

690~~~
Any chance he'll make the bench on monday considering the injuries in midfield and the opposition?

691~~~
It just feels like Pogba all over again.

We are allowed to field 7 subs these days. I don't see why one cannot be used for this lad. If we get a controlling lead in a game, a perfect opportunity to see what he can do, and give him the minutes he deserves / requires

692~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/emEENzL2KXc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

693~~~
Sadly what i got out of that video us how much i miss Rafael!

694~~~
I hope LVG has promised him game time next season because if not he's off in the summer, sure of it.

695~~~
We've seen this movie before yet for some unknown reason we seem intent on seeing it again.

696~~~
This seems different from the Pogba situation.

Pogba not only got minutes on the pitch but SAF also kept putting him on the bench. It seemed like the manager was looking for an excuse to play him, but could never quite come up with one. Wrongly, in hindsight.

Perreira, on the other hand, has been completely blanked. He's not had a sniff. This doesn't feel like a case mismanagement; it feels like LvG simply doesn't rate him. There are no 'ifs, buts or maybes' like there were in Pogba's case. I trust the manager's judgement on youth, so I'm willing to get on board with it.

697~~~
Or simply because not every youngster would play in the first team at 18/19 especially at the top club?LVG rates him enough to make him train with the first team full time despite being one of the youngster in the U21s.If we want to put him on the bench who will we drop for him?

698~~~
Exactly. Perreira is still falling short on physique/ability/decision making so there's not much more the manager can currently do. I can live with that.

SAF was itching to give Pogba a chance, but LvG isn't doing so with Perreira. It doesn't feel like missed opportunities in the same way.

699~~~
We're struggling to get Herrera, Mata and Fellaini on the pitch as it is. Unless Pereira was like a 17 year old Fabregas once was, which he evidently isn't, he's going to have to wait his turn.

If he leaves then fair enough, but the Pogba comparisons are forced and predominantly unfair. Pogba was better, physically ready and coming through at a time when his competition was an ill Fletcher, a geriatric Scholes and an out of sorts Anderson. Times have changed somewhat.

700~~~
He should be loaned out next season. Well, that's if he signs a new contract

701~~~
LVG has explained it already. We lack certain things from our midfielders and have too many 10s and one way attacking players.

If we move Mata on in the summer maybe Andreas will get more gametime. But if he doesnt? We're already giving Wilson and Januzaj gametime in the attack, its not reasonable to expect more. In that case he might need to go on loan - just look at Atletico, they have young players getting some gametime but Oliver Torres still had to go on loan to Porto to play. Why would Pereira be any different? And in a lot of cases players develop better on loan, not just on the pitch but off it.

702~~~
I get the impression he'll leave and become a very good scholes type deep lying midfielder for someone in a few years.
If i were him I'd probably leave and try to get regular game time.

703~~~
Andreas is 19. And we play in the EPL which is acknowledged as being particularly physical in nature. Unlike he's a freak talent like Fabregas at that age, no tier 1 team plays a 19 y/o on a regular basis in CM. Not every "talented youngster" is a Messi or a Ronaldo.

He'll get his chance.

704~~~
Pogba was a freak. That's why he should have got his chance, if only for the sake of good man management. 

Perreira isn't a freak, so there's no way he can play at the moment. Let LvG deal with it. He understands youth better than anyone.

705~~~
The big difference is we're playing far less games, so much fewer opportunities for youngsters to get a run out (or time on the bench)

706~~~
That's what I'm trying to say. Your previous post seemed to suggest that LVG had frozen him out by not playing him.

707~~~
Indeed, and that is a big shame. Younsters like Pereira, Januzaj and Wilson would benefit from having more games then the occasional start and/or cameo.

708~~~
What makes you think he'll be a deep lying playmaker, and why do you think we dont use him there?

709~~~
Played well there for the youth before he moved up age groups, don't really like him as the playmaker/2nd forward role he has now.
Before I thought he wasn't played in a deeper role in Joyces lot because we had Pearson and that other kid whos name escapes me right now, but seeing as they're both out on loan now and he's still not playing there i can only presume Joyce just fancies him more in the top half of the pitch.

Also all these Pogba comparisons, I'm an avid watcher of our youth and he was never some maruading beast, he looked lazy half the time, I was sort of in agreement in with Sir Alex that he wasn't quite ready, but people here make out that he was dominating in back then and everyone bar them was blind not to see it, when in reality you got a glimpse of his talent here and there or at best patches, but never actually dominated a game in the same way a Morisson did at times in that team.

710~~~
Yes, a season in a competive 'second tier' league like Portugal, France or Holland would be good for him

711~~~
The point is that Pogba was close enough to the first team for SAF to have taken a gamble at the time.

Perreira isn't close to being ready, so neither player nor manager can be blamed for the current situation... even if the player ends up leaving.

712~~~
I'm probably going get shot down on this thread now, but I have watched quite a few games with this lad this season,I have to say how underwhelmed Ihave been. He scored a free kick versus Chelsea in the 2-1 win the other night, apartfrom that I thought he looked sloppy and lightweight for large spells the match, I really like the james weir kid, needs polishing but had bags of energy and ruffled the oppo in practically every game I have seen him.

As for the Pogba comparison, I can't see andreas ever hitting that lads level, quite simply the best youth player I have seen at OT in donkeys, the rest is just heartbreaking. The above is just my armchair scout opinion, go easy on me eh lads.

713~~~
So not specifically deep just a normal CM then? Thought you meant the latter Scholes trying to dictate from deep ala Pirlo in the deel lying role. Which doesnt sound like Pereira at all.

714~~~
I think Pogba comparisions are because of the situation with his contract and him being the most talented of the boys in reserves but you know it..

Shame I was too young to watch Scholes in reserves but I feel that Pereira could play that deep playmaking role but it will take time, needs to work on his defensive skills and passing passing passing just to be more accurate and not do many mistakes but he already has got fantastic passing range and good dribbling skills to lose the player. I guess he will be played there in later stages of his career if we can predict anything from what we see now..

715~~~
You are talking about Pogba ? I totally agree with you, he wasn't really trying, he wasn't showing any hunger, his talent was obvious but his attitude wasn't right he was very immature.
I have the same feeling with Pereira, he is talented but until last season (I haven't watched the juice this season), he didn't showed that he wanted it more than the others.

716~~~
I like Weir but his touch,passing and even dribbling are too hot and cold to be considered a serious prospect.Harrop is my favorite prospect of that group.He has everything for a midfielder just need to show it more often.Pereira is better at "no.8" position IMO but with our lack of attacking options in the U21s he has to play further up the pitch.

717~~~

718~~~
it was coming.... we are useless in keeping talented young players

719~~~

720~~~
of course he doesnt, we didnt give him a proper chance. Bags of talent, i had hopes we would sign him.

721~~~
Was always going to be difficult to keep Pereira. 
Was very ambitious when he arrived and looked like he had a clear idea about when he should be playing first team football.
Not really surprised he doesn't want to wait. PSV would be a great move for him.

722~~~
Not sure why this is even happening, there are other clubs who don't even give a sniff to youngsters and they still stick around hoping to make it. Could it just be that we've been signing more foreign players to the academy than others?

723~~~
Definitely feels like we are watching his final few performances for us. Just can't see him leaving it so late to sign an extension. It's a shame for sure because he has become more consistent and more influential over the course of the season, which is what most would have asked from his at this stage.

724~~~
Way to go, if this rate continues we wont be very attractive to go to, too many youngsters from foreign countries just dont get a chance.

725~~~
Amazing that we are letting go of yet another potential top class central midfielder after we lost Pogba. You think we would have learned after it happened so recently.

726~~~
Really ? I didn't see today's game but to me he's still got the same problems this season as he had last season(Consistent and controlling a game). At this moment his position at the club is pretty fair (a regular starter for the U21's and training with the 1st team)and I don't think he's done enough to warrant anything more.

727~~~
So? If we want consistency we might get in the likes of Rothwell, Harrop, Weir and other average talent, Pogba wasnt consistent either and he still isnt, that doesnt make him not ready to get a chance.

728~~~
He's definitely showing more consistency and having more of a regular impact. I'd like to see him out on loan, as the next step in his developmement, but I seriously think we are seeing the last of him.

729~~~
We should let him go either on a season long loan or a permanent with a pre-determined buy back clause.

730~~~
How come this doesnt seem happen to other clubs, at least players like Thiago waited until they were out of their teens! If it is true Psv would be a good move for him but i wouldnt give up on a united career so early if i was him.

731~~~
Why, if he proves himself good at PSV clubs like United will be aftee him in no time, just look at Depay.

732~~~
Thiago was getting games at Barcelona. He had more of a reason to let it play out. Most of our youth don't get a chance due to age which is funny considering we built such a legacy by utilising younger talent.

733~~~
Damn, not pleased with this. PSV is a good move by him, he needs constant game time, no doubt he's destined for big things. Hope he comes back here.

734~~~
Not surprised. We are not the club for youth players these days. All we do is develop them and sell them on.

735~~~
We aren't even making a tidy profit on them when we let players like Pogba leave on a free.

736~~~
I don't know what could we have done better with him this year. The competition for his position is very high, superior players like Mata, Herrera and Januzaj are constantly left out of the first 11, how could he get games? 

Disappointing to see him go, we can always buy him back for 40M, I guess. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

737~~~
Is the source reliable? Would be sad to see him go.

738~~~
Too easy for us to sign him up to a new deal. We'll just buy him back for £20 - 30m in the next 2-3 years, once he becomes world class. Obviously, £10-15m of that few will be done on credit. 

Thought van Gaal was all about giving youth a chance? Up to now he's only played youth, as we're lacking in the areas they play.

739~~~
That is the truth if the matter. Players of his talent level are better off at clubs like PSV. They get to progress sooner and have more stability.

740~~~
Fletcher got a few games ahead of him which was beyond stupid considering he was clearly on the way out of the club and Pereira has the potential to be the future. Anderson was also picked ahead of him a few times.

741~~~
Very disappointing if this is true. I think we'll regret this one. He's got bags of talent.

742~~~
What the hell is happening to this club.

743~~~
PSV would deserve that money though, since he was their youth player for six years in the first place.

And Dutch clubs have been robbed time and time again of their talent over the years, Chelsea and City are probably the standouts. Hasn't done much good for those players and it's not good for the Dutch league in general.

I'd say United is pretty decent at giving youth players a shot. From our perspective it's understandable that we're not giving that many chances to Pereira at the moment, and from his perspective it's understandable that he doesn't want to sign a new contract.

744~~~
His contract expires this summer.

745~~~
Please god let this be a good will thing behind the scenes to tie up Memphis Depay. Sad to see a talented lad go though if true.

746~~~
Disappointing, he hardly got a chance.

747~~~
We signed him from PSV didn't we?

748~~~
Indeed. We're proper shit at getting our young/all players to sign up.

749~~~
Not good enough to play this year. We'll move on without him no bother at all. 

The club has done little wrong here, although I'm sure the wankers amongst us will pretend otherwise.

750~~~
There was no reason for Fletcher to get games ahead of him this season once it was noticeable that he was done at United. Even just minutes at the end of a match are important for a young player.

751~~~
Fletcher and Anderson have played this season, this is really bad.

752~~~
Are those 2 tweets, or whatever the sources are, reliable?

753~~~
Doubt we'll see a Pogba like impact, if he does go. But if he impresses having left we're gonna have to look at our youth policy big time, even Adnan is struggling to get a run about this season.

754~~~
Real shame if he leaves he's got bags of potential.

755~~~
So frustrating.

756~~~
Came on agains MKDons and looked really good, then never saw the light of day again... sad.

757~~~
Exactly. Made no sense whatsoever. I'm not saying that he should have been starting ahead of Herrera or Fellaini but he certainly deserved to get the minutes Fletcher and Anderson got.

758~~~
It is always a tricky game with youth players at a top club, especially with the situation Utd are in, it is difficult finding time for young players When you need points and consistent performances.

I can't blame the club for not being able to tie him down. PSV is a good move for him if he goes.

759~~~
what a relief to be rid of a home-grown centre midfielder with bags of talent finally leave our books.

we've been overloaded in that department for about a decade now.

760~~~
Thankfully we got Januzaj tied up to a long term deal based on last season.

Or he'd be considering leaving too possibly.

761~~~
After Pogba got a chance in the first team, he really didn't impress in the reserves and this went someway to describing his lack of appearances at senior level.

With Pereira, he's been performing very well for the U21's and has really developed this season. For all of his talk about promoting youth, LvG has given Fletcher cameos ahead of this lad when it was clear that Fletcher had no future at the club and now it seems that partially as a result Andreas no longer has a future at the club .It'll be a real shame if he leaves, I really thought he could break through this season. Even if he gets performances now, I'd imagine his head has been turned enough that he'll stall a contract offer and most likely leave regardless of how man senior appearances he makes from now until the end of the season.

762~~~
Well that's shit. Makes it even more irritating that Fletcher and Anderson were given games ahead of him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

763~~~
ONCE this happened and we will hear it for eternity. Jesus

764~~~
Everyone saying the club is shit at keeping hold of young talent

It's only Pobga, not one other departure has mattered at all. 9/10 there is a good reason the club won't fight hard to keep the player and that is because they are not worth it.

765~~~
yeah of all the young talent that people moaned about leaving only Pogba was a bad thing, a very huge bad thing, but the only one I can really think of in the last few years that we really missed on when we were not able to keep him.

766~~~
He's going back home to PSV. I'd say it's as likely that he's homesick as anything else.

It's not like he's being snatched up by some European giant that can make us regret playing him at the highest level. It's the Dutch league, not Serie A, or Ligue 1 or someone in the CL.

767~~~
Anderson has started instead of him against MK Dons and he wasn't on the bench a single time in 4 matches against Yeovil, Cambridge and Preston.

It's a shame if he goes but i can a bit understand it.

768~~~
I'll be disappointed if he leaves but given where we are as a club (struggling through a rebuild), where proper players like Herrera can barely get 7 starts in 7 months, it's not surprising if he leaves to get more time elsewhere.

769~~~
We should get him to sign a 1 year deal, let him go to PSV for free but have a buy back/first refusal deal

770~~~
It would be great if we re-signed him and then he went on loan to PSV for a season as part of a deal for Depay.

771~~~
It always amazes me how on here any negative news regarding the club is instantly accepted as fact and overreacted to while a positive story could come from the same source but is almost always assumed to be just the press making things up

772~~~
How often do players renew in this kind of situation? Even if the PSG rumour is false, it does seem increasingly unlikely that he'll remain a United player after this summer.

773~~~

774~~~
I know the journalist is reliable especially when it comes to PSV but I'm not only talking about this occasion its always the same on here. There's always a massive desire to jump on negative stories on here but if a story is positive its immediately dismissed

775~~~
If with the talent he has he is not getting a sniff as others have said it doesn't look like LVG rates him as highly as people here.

Pogba being the exception generally if players are good enough they get chances here. If we want to keep him and he would rather go to PSV because he can't break his way into the team i'm not sure if it's the type of attitude we need anyway. 

I don't like to see us having to pander to these young foreign lads to keep them happy it's the manager who decides when they are ready not them. If they would rather take the easy option of leaving for a lesser club to get game time than try and prove the manager wrong it's probably for the best in the long run.

776~~~
I agree with you. But in the case with Pereira....i haven't believed the PSG rumours but the PSV Eindhoven rumour is very strong.

777~~~
Hes an ok player but would never have been that good for us. Hope he does well back in the Dutch League.

778~~~
He is far more than an ok player.

779~~~
what makes him far more than ok? The stats he is producing? The goals he is scoring? The global recognition he is getting? The level at which he is playing at? None of the above. He is a decent player for our under 21's. He's an inconsistent flair player who sometimes looks pretty good and other times might as well not be on the pitch. I'm just saying if he goes to PSV the club will probably live.

780~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/02/23/ander-herrera-backs-adnan-januzaj-and-andreas-pereira-to-be-important-players-77341/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/02...ndreas-pereira-to-be-important-players-77341/</a>

Interesting read, there may be hope still.

Furthermore, if we can, maybe next season we could do a deal for Depay with Pereira going on loan the other way. It would just be ridiculous to let him go for nothing.

781~~~
Rumours that he's as good as gone.Meanwhile he's keep training with the first team,tweeting/instagraming about United and playing every game for United U21s...

782~~~
Par for the course for United. 

Meanwhile, Chelsea sold Hazard's brother for 8m Euros after buying him for 500k a couple of years back.

783~~~
I would like the club to secure him on a new deal. However, he doesn't give me the same feeling Pogba and Januzaj gave. Could go onto become a very good player but I don't think it's as crucial as those two cases. In saying that, I do think it's important for numerous reasons that we do sort a deal out.

784~~~
i understand this is difficult to feature him game time this season for we already are having mega bucks signings warning the bench.  i hope we can arrange a new contract with him and a loan out to the netherlands.  i think this is good for him to maintain connection with the club too.

785~~~
He's decent but certainly isn't standing out at U-21 reserve level the way future first-teamers have in the past. Still young enough he might do, one day, but we're not talking about a Januzaj kind of talent here.

786~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-sell-thorgan-hazard-to-borussia-monchengladbach-for-1500-markup-as-impressive-sales-figures-continue-10065410.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...pressive-sales-figures-continue-10065410.html</a>

How the feck do they keep doing it??? He's barely made 20 league appearances for Gladbach. Was he that good? Can any Bundesliga fan provide further info?

<a class="username" data-user="11462, @Sean_RedDevil" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/11462/">@Sean_RedDevil</a>

Cheers

787~~~
I'd say he showed promising signs. He's clearly talented, but he's still a step away from being a quality player for a team like Gladbach. That being said, 8m Euro isn't that much money for a talented young attacker. According to Bild Chelsea also has a buy back clause over 25m that they can trigger in 2018, so it looks like they still rate him as well and want to keep an easy option to get him back.

788~~~
If Pereira is just a decent player for the u21's, I wonder who the good ones are.

789~~~
Sounds like you're describing last season's Pereira. He's done well after being moved further back in midfield rather than playing as a 10.

790~~~
Maybe he's just not impressed Van Gaal in training, maybe he's homesick. For what ever reason he seems to be leaving us good luck to him if this is indeed true.  There may be a silver lining. He might be used as a sweetener for Memphis Depay. The kind of player we need here.

791~~~
Would be close to impossible, his contract is running out so if PSV wants him, and he wants to leave there is nothing United can do about it and there wouldnt be negotiations about Depay in that deal. I think Depay is a situation apart from this one.

792~~~
Unless he is released by us I think we can ask for a compensation fee if I remember rightly. However it is still no clear if the sources above are reliable.

793~~~
He is a player who may become a very good player. In terms of his ability technically he is very good and he is getting stronger and his decision making is improving all the time. Players develop at different rates and have bursts of good and bad. He is one of the better of our young players coming through and it is a shame he is moving on if he is. I am not talking Pogba level (Pogba is on a path to be one of the best in the world) but there is a chance he could get to a level that we need and be a very good player for us.
The idea that he is "just ok" is something I dont agree with, he has real potential.

Do we know if theres a reason he wasn't played? Perhaps he hit a clause etc..

I can't imagine LVG genuinely preffered Ando & Fletch to him, I think it's more the LVG youth thing, I haven't seen him use a young player unless we are quite weak in that area.. (Wings, RB)

I imagine plenty more will leave too, what's a shame though is, he clearly isn't worse than Fletch/ Ando and would have been a cheaper salary option for a squad member, can't think of one reason we didn't  value/play him?

795~~~
He will never be a top 20 midfielder, he's a squad option for a top 4 or a starter for 5th - 10th in prem IMO, that's his potential at least, we will see where he ends up, but as I said above, I'd have liked us to have kept him for at least a squad player.

796~~~
Oh right, forget that then, poor planning again by us

797~~~

798~~~
How is it poor planning? How does "planning" stop someone wanting to leave?

799~~~
Because by "planning" a year ago, we could have given him more time, which would have made him feel more valued, and like he had a future here, making it more likely he would have stayed, what we don't know is if LVG rates his potential like we do.

800~~~
If he wants to leave, he will leave no doubt about that. These days, players have more power than anything else, and if he refused two offers, then it’s for sure that he will leave.

We have no place in the starting XI for Carrick/Blind/Herrera/Di Maria/Mata and the boy would like to play above them?

We’ve let Fletch go this January because he didn’t played much and what will we do with a young boy like him wanting to go ?

If he does a Pogba, good for him, bad for us.

801~~~
What do you mean?

802~~~
Time on the pitch does not depend upon the number of years he has left on the contract. He would have got the same or probably less time on the pitch had he signed a new contract earlier. If someone wants to leave, then they will leave.

803~~~
See Chelsea / Courtois as an example

804~~~
We should have sent him on loan to a club competing for the Spanish title a year ago? How do you think that would have worked?

He's probably ready for a loan this summer. No way was he ready a year ago.

805~~~
Not necessarily to a club competing for the Spanish title <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

But we should have been monitoring his development more closely, and ensuring that he was on a contract long enough to enable him to go out on loan when he was ready (e.g. next season) rather than having his contract run out just as he was ready for this next step in his development.  We could also have done more to make him feel valued.

806~~~
Not letting his contract run down, obviously. It's not overly hard to comprehend. Then maybe we could have loaned him out. I know it's very complex.

807~~~
That's all very vague. You've no idea when he was last offered a contract. As for making him "feel valued", what does that mean? He's been training with the first team. Been include in match-day squads. Travelling with the team to away games. What more could be done? Give him games instead of other, similar, players desperate for more minutes, like Mata, Januzaj or Hererra?

808~~~
This might blow your mind but getting a player tied down on a new contract involves, you know, the player. If the club could do this all on their own then life would be very simple.

This is all just the same idiotic comments you hear every time a player runs down his contract. Why didn't we extend his contract a year ago?!? As though it didn't occur to anyone at the club that the contract was running down and they could have unilaterally extended it whenever they wanted. Get a grip.

The bottom line is that if a youn footballer wants to change clubs then that's it. Nothing anyone at the club can do, other than try to convince them to stay. Which will obviously be happening in the case of any youngster with decent potential.

809~~~
You're obviously in the minority here, I'm sorry you don't understand what everyone else is saying - sometimes its best to stop digging a hole

810~~~
I was hoping you could share some of your wisdom with me. Oh well.

811~~~
Pretty fed up hearing everyone on here go on about how the club doesn't give enough chances to young players. He's 19 for feck sake, he'd have to be a very special talent to get game time in the Premier League at that age when we can't even give the likes of Herrera and Mata enough time in our midfield. He's the sort of player you give some minutes in league cup games, so he's been unlucky we were knocked out so early. As for Van Gaal giving chances to Fletcher and Anderson over him, he's given them half a season to prove themselves, they failed and he's moved them on at the first opportunity. Pretty sensible if you ask me. Ideally we'd give Pereira a new contract and loan him out next season, but there's no way you can blame the club or Van Gaal for not giving him chances in the first team this season.

812~~~
OK, you talk about 'giving him games' as the answer - how many games did Chelsea give Courtois before he seamlessly transitioned into the first team?  Not many.  I don't think that we use the loan system very well at all.  We seem to use it largely to do a favour for club old boys who have moved into management at Sunderland, Preston, or wherever rather than it being the best move for the player's development.

813~~~
Courtois went on loan when he was ready. I don't think Pereira was ready to go on loan a year ago. Certainly not to a club where he would be playing the type of football that would benefit his development. Do you think differently? Where should he have been sent last summer? 

Also, coming back to your own point, what would have made him feel "more valued"? Involving him with the first team as we have done, or shipping him out on loan?

814~~~
There was no need to give Fletcher and Anderson half a season to prove themselves though. It was clear at the start of the season that their days were over here. LVG should have been able see that sooner than he did.

815~~~
Maybe club didnt celebrate his birthday. 

Jokes aside, you're right, what else club could have done. 
And I find asuming that in this kind of stories its all gloom and doom here and everybody blames the club for not signing him. Its not as if player has anything with it, right?

816~~~
Courtois was ready when they bought him from Genk, Pereira wasn't ready last season, at least not to play at the very good level.

817~~~
Not true. Fletcher was one of our better players in pre-season. The first time van Gaal worked with the squad. 

As for Anderson, one disasterous CC game aside (when Pereira came on off the bench) has he featured at all?

818~~~
Anderson was one time instead of him on the bench if I'm not mistaken.

819~~~
Nobody knows this for sure at this point. What he does have is all the right attributes in place but  nobody knows  with absolute certainty that he wont be a top 20 midfielder.  What he is, is one of our best u21 players and it seems a shame to let him go.

820~~~
You are missing Pogues point completely. Might be best if you stop digging holes.

821~~~
The 'majority' aren't always right. Especially on the caf, where there's a 'majority' always waiting to swoop on any negative news.

On topic, the club wants to give him a new contract. If he still wants to quit, I don't see any issue. With lads like Herrera and Mata warming the bench, he's clearly not good enough to feature in games. This is vastly different to the Pogba situation.

822~~~
So almost not at all then. Who's to say Pereira didn't have some sort of niggle at the time, anyway.

823~~~
Exactly. People panic about that one time Anderson was on the bench instead of him. Hilarious. But we're in a minority here so maybe we shoud be quiet.

824~~~
Interesting how Falcao said in the MEN interview with Herrera.

Falcao's English is decent but he responds shyly. Herrera translated the odd sentence for him during their kick-about on the 3G pitch adjacent to Sir Alex Ferguson's statue and is the extrovert in Old Trafford's Salford Suite.

"I didn't know how good the academy is here," he confesses.

"Adnan Januzaj and Andreas Pereira are young players for Manchester United that are going to be very important players for many years."

825~~~
I'm not saying that he should have been loaned out when he wasn't ready, just that he should have had a contract long enough so that he could be loaned out (under contract) when he <i>was</i> ready, so that we could see how good he really is.

826~~~
Not sure what the issue is here. He looks a fine player but not the kind of outrageous talent that we'd be crazy to lose, or should be shifting out the likes of Mata or Herrera just to fit into the team.

Everyone's paranoid after Pogba, but that was the exception. You could tell in a minute that Pogba would be world class. Pereira, not so obvious. Could turn out a flop, could be a world beater, more likely he'll end up on the continent carving out a fine career for himself but not cementing a first team role at Bayern/Real/Barca.

827~~~
The club can't force him to sign a new contract, though.

828~~~
Clearly, the contract isn't an issue. We're giving him a new one. If the player wants to move, the whole argument is pointless.

829~~~
Yeah that's great and all. But the fact is, no one knows either way how his contract situation was handled. You seem certain that your assumptions are correct. People are entitled to speculate considering how this will be the second time that a highly rated youngster has been allowed to leave for nowt. Now, considering we fended off interest to get both Pogba and  Pereira, it seems bizarre that both their contracts were able to wind down.

830~~~
Also someone like <a class="username" data-user="29933, @jb8521" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/29933/">@jb8521</a> can clarify better, but when these 16 year olds get signed for the first time, they can only sign a 3 year deal.

831~~~
Guess some will use this one day as something to blame the club,after all its always clubs fault in this kind situations.

832~~~
he had a fair few chances to get some minutes from the bench this year, it's really bad management by van Gaal. Especially during the injury crysis Pereira should have had some minutes at later stages of the games. We will regret this at some point, not saying he will be pogba level player but he will surely play in top flight club one day.

BUt I hope it's not true anyway. Wel and why don't we give him good money and loan him to PSV or wherever he wants and is wanted to come back one day, like Chelsea did with Curtois even it's slightly different situations. The lad always seem to love United judging by his tweets..

833~~~
I think the problem is just the fact he's not quite ready yet, and it's an awful time for us to have his contract ending this year, in a season where we've played the least games since.. god knows when, opportunities have been scarce and the league games are too important in the race for top 4 to blood him.

I'm a fan of his, I think he'll be a good player in a top league for someone in a 3-4 years time, but again, I think it's more a bad timing issue rather than a miss-management issue.

834~~~
It's not hard to see why Van Gaal would give Fletcher chances. He's a model professional and a pretty versatile player. A good option to have on the bench. Once it became clear he was past it, Van Gaal didn't really play him anymore. I say half a season because it's the minimum amount of time before he could sell him, not because it took so long for Van Gaal to make up his mind. And Anderson was clearly out of favour much sooner. The point was that the certainly didn't stand in Pereira's way, as some have argued in this thread.

835~~~
They normally sign a 2 year contract when they turn 17 which is the most allowed although its more like a 2 and a half year deal because it goes until the next transfer window rather than running out in January

836~~~
How has he been allowed? Do you know if he's been offered a contract or not? If that's the case and he doesnt want it how have club then allowed him to go.

837~~~
NSIS... I'll bite..  We waited until now (And still haven't) offered him a new contract, we gave him very few sub appearances, while gave players that were clearly past it with no future minutes in the 1st team, that's an indication of what the club thinks, had that been different, I believe he might have stayed, which one could argue that if planned better, he may have got more minutes, rather than Darren & Ando

838~~~
Huh? Do you know something I don't? Where did you hear that?

839~~~
So what were we doing with him all this time then?

840~~~
Most if not all contracts have an ending date, so if one party does not agree to a new contract or extension then the contract winds down.

841~~~
You believe but you dont know.

842~~~
Indeed. It's letting them wind down that's the point. I have no idea, nor does anyone on here, whether there were talks over an extension. Surely we should be looking to sell if players are reluctant to sign new deals, rather than letting them wind down. 

Anyhow, I have no real stance on this as none of us know what happens within the club. I was more or less playing devils advocate.

843~~~
See above post.

844~~~
Wouldn't you prefer if the club gave it as long as possible to try and convince them to stay, rather than give up on them 6-12 months sooner for the sake of a few million quid? (if that)

845~~~
Even if the club did that, you would have seen criticism, like with Keane and Johnstone.

846~~~
Or Daehli.

847~~~
Depends, I guess. I would rather sell with the possibly of a buy back clause or something of that ilk. It all depends on the circumstances.

As I said, none of us have a clue with regards to Pereira. People are bound to get frustrated when something like this happens as the Pogba saga won't be forgotten in a hurry. Again, there were definitely extenuating circumstances there, but it'll now always be brought up when a highly rated youngster leaves.

848~~~
Thanks mate.

So basically we gave him the max possible length pro contract, which has been winding down since. And latest news suggests that he isn't interested in signing a new one. So yeah lets blame the fecking club for that...

849~~~
That last paragraph hits the nail on the head. However, we all have to remember that Pogba was a very unusual situation and the club generally gets these things right. Very very rare for us to end up regretting being unable to hold onto one of our academy products but countless examples of the fans getting carried away about the potential of young tootballers.

850~~~
Most people will know that we produce talented kids but that not everyone can make it because of the standards of the league and the first team squad. There's even competition at a lower levels where we've seen Wilson overtake Keane. The fact is the kid did well against MK dons and should have had more chances. That's not happened. However, maybe LVG prefers Pearson. Only time will tell. We do produce good youth players but maybe they're paid too much. We've certainly a good an academy as anyone in the country but our situation is different and therefore you cannot take a risk on a kid and put someone that's worth millions on the bench. It's not so simple. It's easy for smaller clubs as they look long term to profit from the kids they bring through. Hopefully Pereira will stay

851~~~
#PSV Indeed candidate club Hoelgebaum Andreas Pereira (VI yesterday). Would startling when he comes on a free transfer.

852~~~
Are we getting hustled by PSV? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck me

853~~~
I understood that more in Dutch and I can't speak Dutch.

854~~~
So we can end up losing both Gribbin and him this summer. So crap.

He was making all sorts of positive noises but saying no new deal talks yet earlier this season. Was Woody fecking sleeping ?

855~~~
So hes gone yeah? To Juventus again would fecking sting too.

856~~~
That sounds definitive. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Van Gaal should have atleast put him on bench more and given some sub minutes when he clearly had chances. Made him signed a deal earlier in the season.

857~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

It would hurt so much to see another Pogba case happen.

858~~~
Van Gaal has done nothing wrong and neither have the club.

859~~~
Exactly, and if the interview is true, he can fck right off. This is what's happening in football. Kids who have not even broken through are acting like prima donnas. If he feels he cannot displace anyone from the current midfield or feels we don't regard him highly (which cannot be the case as we have offered him a new deal) and he wants to leave, so be it. But at least act professional. Talking to Tuttosport about how exciting it would be to play with Pogba for Juve and how he is currently "blocked" by United is not the mentality I want to see from our youngsters.
If he was as good as he thinks, he would have got the chance, just like Wilson, McNair, Blackett. If he is not ready but still wants opportunities when we can't even get players like Mata and Herrera enough minutes then he can p*** off.

860~~~
But this is not like the Pogba case. He is not at that level where he could easily walk into our midfield.

861~~~
Just in the sense that he would succeed at another big club when we've always been known to give our youngsters a chance to prove themselves.

862~~~
Again, nothing to show that is going to happen. Seen many youngsters, who have impressed more than him at junior levels, not really reaching the heights we all thought they would. He seems to have grown too big for his shoes. If he thinks we are not the right club for him, good riddance is all I can say.

863~~~
Ffs

864~~~
People don't believe Marca but they believe Tuttosport.So true.They couldn't even have any exclusive photo of him as proof for the "interview".

865~~~
Spot on. And if he isn't leaving but is just trying to leverage some sort of better deal/playing time guarantee I'd call the little scrote's bluff and flog him. Jumped up prima donna twats with delusions of grandeur can get to feck - you don't build a team with them.

866~~~
Should just go out on loan, better players than him have had to take that route

867~~~
If his contract is running out in the summer, he will have to sign a contract first. Sounds like he thinks he should be in the first team already and wants fast tracking while others have to earn the right to be there.

868~~~
He can go with that kind of attitude.

869~~~
Well I mean before now since his situation has been clear for a while, but yes he'd have to sign something

870~~~
And we do. Wilson and McNair are testament to that as of right now.

Ander Herrera struggles to get a game for us in midfield, yet people are whining on about some kid in the reserves. It's genuinely mental. I've little problem with Pereira or his desire to move but this is nothing like the situation we had with Pogba.

871~~~
Problem is those are not quotes. That is an actual fkng interview. Unless Tuttosport are in the business of creative writing or winding up supporters of teams in another league, I don't know how they are made up.

872~~~
He can go after the comments, and you know what? I wouldn't be doing any business with Juventus ever again.

873~~~
To be fair they're not doing any business with us, they just poach our players for free.

874~~~
We sold them Evra for very little last summer.

875~~~
According to Di Marzio, Juventus are not interested in him.

876~~~
If you have ambition to make something out of your career and develop yourself and not stay in the u21 forever like numerous talents have done in recent years, you should go? <a class="username" data-user="65062, @Mali_Zeus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65062/">@Mali_Zeus</a>

877~~~
If Juventus get him, I will hate that club for the rest of my life. Biggest scavengers of Europe they are.

878~~~
I don't mind some young players leaving, we can't give playing time to all of them after all and at the same time can't expect them to wait forever to get an opportunity.

What I however don't like how we let them go without a buy-back option or something like that. Either extend their contract and loan them after that or sell them before the contract expires with a buy-back option. This way at least we either get some money or best case if they turn out to be good get them back.

879~~~
Don't sell to JUVENTUS!! sell to a team that will be eager to sell him back to us in 3 years

880~~~
He wouldnt be in U21 forever and young players seem to be too impatient these days.

881~~~
They have a point to be fair given how awful we've been lately. If a young player believes in their ability and thinks they can do better than their first team counterparts then it's no surprise they'd get frustrated and want to look at their options. Pogba was good enough to break through with the midfield we had back then but he wasn't given the opportunity. The same is now happening with Pereira (except the clubs results/performances have deteriorated since the Pogba days). If a young player has any ounce of ambition then they'd be wanting to play first team football, not the U21's. I don't blame him at all tbh, like I didn't blame Pogba when he left.

882~~~
What an interview... This guy is barely 19 and played like 15 minutes in the first team and thinks he is Leo fecking Messi. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

883~~~
Different situations, back then our midfield wasnt very good, now we have the likes of Herrera and Mata on the bench, so its not expected that Pereira would have the advantage over them.
This year our situation is we have to get nr. 4th, there will be time for him if the stays.

884~~~
Neither Herrera or Mata have set the world on fire at United though to the point where Rooney has played in midfield to plug a gap. You can therefore relate to his frustration at being stuck in the U21's (assuming he believes he's good enough to be starting for United). I think he's forced the clubs hand with that interview though (assuming it's legit).

I think lads like Pogba/Pereira understand that you can't mess about waiting. At their age they need to be playing first team football to develop and if that means leaving a big club to join a smaller one to act as a stepping stone then so be it. You may think it's impatient but if players believe they're future world stars then they'll want to prove it. Once they've proven their ability they'll have a range of clubs to pick from.

Many of us laughed at Odegaards decision to join Real Madrid because it will stunt his development and yet when one of our youngsters decides to move for playing reasons there's uproar. It'll probably be for the best if Pereira did move to PSV tbh.

885~~~
So, Juventus don't want him but PSV do? It's clear that the lad is having to move down about 3 or 4 levels because that's his best offer. Let him.

If he were good enough right now, he'd be playing. If the coaching staff thought he'd be good enough in the future, there'd be a massive contract waiting for him to sign. Instead, he's dropping down to the Dutch League. I'm not fussed.

886~~~
If they get him, what's their fault?

He's a goner, should they step aside and let someone else get him out of some weird morality nonsense?

887~~~
I think United have to appreciate that if you bring in the likes of Januzaj, Pogba, Pereira etc from other clubs, that they will only want to stay if they are being promoted at an early opportunity. They came here because they thought it was a better option than staying at their previous club. Given their talent, there will always be other clubs interested.

Personally I rate Pereira and once he had demonstrated his ability against MK Dons, I would have fast-tracked him into the first-team squad as LVG did, and put him on as a sub whenever the opportunity arose (LVG had him on the bench but chose to use other players). If he showed he could handle PL football then I would have given him the occasional start. Having watched Pereira play for the U21s he does look rather raw, so I'd be surprised if he could handle regular PL football without making big errors and perhaps getting sent off, given his tendency to make rather reckless challenges.

Anyway, it's a shame but there is a certain inevitability about events.

888~~~
That's not the case here and you know it. All of the players we're talking about are miles better than Pereira at present.

889~~~
It's a shame. He hasn't the patience, but there has been a few opportunities to at least give him  a sniff of first team football. I really hope he does go PSV rather than any big club, on the hope that if he does fufill his potential he may come back.

890~~~
How can anybody like Juventus? They are absolute scum, and I wouldn't be surprised if they have tapped up all the free agents they've signed on pre-contracts.

That's Pogba and possibly Pereira from us, and Kingsley Coman from PSG.

891~~~
For a league that's cash strapped, its a top drawer approach. Its weird to call them "scum" because they're smart and pick top talents for free knowing they have no chance of getting top players any other way.

892~~~
How so?

They just smart in the transfer market. They got Tevez, Llorente, Evra and Pirlo for peanuts.

893~~~
Juve can feck right off

894~~~
Definitely this. Whatever happens in the future, no one can know if he'll become a superstar or just an average player but you can't keep players who have proven nothing and who moan about playing opportunities they haven't deserved to get.

895~~~
Those cnuts have an FM editor or some shit

896~~~
The most talented young players are nearly always going to have a bit of the prima dona about them, they're nearly always going to be impatient and they're nearly always going to be career minded. That's the way football is. 

After all, if another club is offering you better opportunities and more money then why <i>wouldn't</i> you go? Especially when you're a foreign player with no real allegiance to your current club.

All we can control is our reaction. Either we think he's so good that it's worth compromising and offering what it takes to keep him or we don't. If we don't then we can hardly be surprised when he decides to go for a better offer.

Don't see the point in complaining about Juve either, they're right to look after their own interests. I'm sure there have been plenty of times we've taken players from clubs who were less than happy with our methods. Again, that's the way football is.

897~~~
If a player doesn't want to be here, then they can honestly go. I genuinely won't care, even if he's destined for big things (which I personally don't think he will). 

If he goes, he goes.

898~~~
Agree completely. State of some of the reactions in here. In a season where Fletcher made 14 or so first team appearances for us I think we need to look a little closer to home for someone to blame if he does leave.

899~~~
Considering we stole Pogba and Periera in the first place, I don't think we occupy the moral high ground here. There's always a risk talented foreign youngsters will leave by the same door they came in. Use 'em or lose 'em.

We haven't reaped much benefit from this policy. So far Januzaj is our only success.

900~~~
He has no chance here so its only fair he moves on.

901~~~
Anybody ever thought, us as supporters fan the flames of this. That we overpraise these kids. Then the agents start saying the fans are saying you are the next so and so and should be playing. If we ourselves would show a bit of patience, some of these situations might not happen.

902~~~
And if we're being honest he remains a qualified success for now.

903~~~
I felt embarrassed reading that. I was hoping it was made up. He hasn't even proven himself on loan yet and he's talking like he's in a position to make demands, talking about finances. Its a sad world we live in man.

904~~~
Too right

905~~~
Fair enough if he moves on, however this young man needs to realise that to get right to the top will take a lot of hard work. Problem is I think agents massage their ego's that much that they think they are entitled to a place in a first team. He might get a nasty shock especially at a Juventus. Pogba was a different level.

906~~~
Exactly. There has been loads more as well.

907~~~
That is likely what these kids are doing using us to get coaching and reputation, then move back abroad. It is a risk you take.

908~~~
The question here is why aren't we setting up loans for our top young players? 

Why wasn't Pogba starting for Lille or Swansea instead of getting frustrated here? 

Why isn't Pereira currently playing for some mid-table La Liga side or instead of Meyler in Hull's 3 man central midfield?

909~~~
I hope he fecks off to Juventus or PSV

910~~~
That I do agree with, maybe these lads think or thought they were too good to go out on loan. Other boys have gone out no problem. Maybe these two had too high a sense of their own importance.

911~~~
I'm wondering the same thing. Even if this forum is correct and Andreas is the next Pogba, what makes him think he should be playing while other young talents like Oliver Torres at Atletico, who has proven more, has to go out on loan to Porto to get gametime?

We have £30 million+ players competing for the same spot he is and they are being left out, of course its not realistic for him to get gametime. So go out on loan, come back a more complete player and professional and the coach will make way for you in the summer if you look a better bet than what we have.

912~~~
I have no proof, but I doubt these guys would turn down a good loan move. Why would they? 

Pogba could have gone anywhere but PSG and maybe Marseille, Lyon or another side or two his last year here and walked into the team. He wouldn't be happy spending a year at Bordeaux, St. Etienne or Lille in his own country, playing Europa league ball and getting 40 starts, if he was told that if he plays well he'll be a real part of the first team here upon his return? And we'd know better if he was good enough, or in his case, if he wasn't too lackadaisical.

913~~~
The little man thinks he'll be able to just walk into the Juventus first team. You're right, Pogba was a stratosphere above this kid at the same age.

914~~~
That's a bit bleak given he is our only real CM prospect from the current youth set up.

915~~~
He really has no chance. Why would endless players stay in the United reserves when they could actually play regularly for a variety of established clubs elsewhere.

916~~~
I'm not disagreeing with that aspect, just saying that it's disconcerting that we aren't producing anything much for the first team from this current youth crop.

917~~~
People can talk all they want about how we are not to blame but the simple fact is that this lad is clearly gifted and he should have been on loan to a decent club and getting first team football or at the very least be introduced off the bench and given some minutes here and there.. to judge if he is good enough and send out the message that we give kids a fair shot of making the first team in positions such as midfield. 

What young midfielder is going to want to play for this club after how we've dealt with Pogba and Pereira. He might flop but the fact remains, he looks technically above most of the midfielders he comes up against week in week out and deserved a push into the first team.. if guys like Cleverley can get games, and Fletch in his current state.. unbelievable he didn't get some minutes, especially as he was the stand out performer v MK Dons.

918~~~
How many of what you would consider the Big PL clubs have kids coming through? It is a sign of the times it seems. Chelsea, City don't bring kids through, the bring them in and then sell them on. We bring the odd one through, but not the quality of player I would hope for. Apart from Pereira none of our kids look like the next big thing. Maybe like when SAF came in, it is time for the scouting and academy to have an overhaul. Trouble is that isn't LvG's priority just now and will he be here long enough to carry it through?

919~~~
Maybe he's just not good enough? LVG has shown he has no problem playing young players if he thinks they're ready.

920~~~
Very true. I genuinely believe the era of youth players coming through to the first team may be over. The reason is quite simple - football has changed since Roman and the Arab sheikhs took over, which has resulted in a glut of money being thrown at emerging and established stars, which has in turn put tremendous pressure on clubs to win immediately. This reduces the time horizon whereby youth players can get enough minutes to properly develop at their original clubs, and usually results in them moving on to smaller clubs who can play them immediately. This is why we have been so successful at populating other prem sides with our youth players in recent years.

921~~~
That seems to be how academies are run now. That the kids get the coaching, good grounding, then move on for a small fee and at least have a career lower down the ladder. As you say it is now win now at all costs, so the kids will not get the time at a big club to develop.

922~~~
Really isn't the case.

United have a number of really good prospects from the ranks(Goss,Fosu-Mensah<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>Harrop,Thorpe)and also a number of players on loan who are showing good signs(Pearson,Rothwell,Lingard). Then let's take into account the players that have made a impact in the first team Wilson, McNair,Blackett(It's pretty clear LvG has no issue playing youth players)

Pretty much how I see it.

923~~~
The only thing that reduces the time to bring through young players is young players themselves, they are self-important pricks who are convinced that everything should be given to them when they turn 18 years old.

924~~~
That may be the case for a few of them, but the vast majority are probably just kids trying to make it in football.

925~~~
He's not going to get in midfield ahead of the likes of Blind, Carrick, Mata, Di Maria, Fellaini, Herrera etc.

Next season we should be in more competitions and he will get more opportunities to make a claim for a spot then.
If he's not looking to wait and prove his worth, then he can go.

926~~~
Unfortunately its just the way it is for us now, at least for 3/4 seasons id have thought. 

We can't afford to integrate these talented youngsters anymore when we're so set on getting back into the top 4 and being succesful again. The only way forward for us unfortunately is to build a new team full of experience that will get us to that point and gel. Only then will we be able to play inexperienced players like pereria in midfield. The kid knows we won't give him a run in the team without worrying that he has to perform in every game. 

Even januzaj and wilson who have arguably looked alot better are struggling to get game time. Until we have a settled 11 that can get results whilst still carrying an inexperienced youngster players like pereria will leave.

It's infuriating but the truth. The kid won't get games with us and in all honesty for his own sake he probably is better off playing for a juve or similar team to develop. Realistically he has 15 years left of playing football - if he's confident enough in himself to believe he is ready for first team football despite what we tell him then fair enough. Im sure there are many clubs that will pay him what we will but give him many more chances in the first team.

I hope its with us, but this has got pogba all over it. Lets hope ( for us) if he does leave he doesnt become a world superstar anytime soon to rub even more salt into the wound. Would be too embarrassing.

927~~~
From what I hear it's the majority who think that way.

I'm tired of hearing fans and young players taking shots at big clubs, a young player will need more time to break into a big club because the level of expectation is higher, if a young player don't understand that, he can get out.

At 19 years old, you are no one and you did nothing, and it's not like he did anything at youth level, he didn't shone at international level, at least players like Pogba, Kondogbia or even Herrera can brag about that, not Pereira.

928~~~
Its a bit more complicated than that. Young players need to play regularly to develop the skills, experience, and confidence to move to the next level. If they can't get it at big clubs because there are too many good players ahead of them, then they simply move on to slightly smaller clubs where they can play more.

929~~~
I agree with the playing time but you can sign a contract and agree to go on loan. Instead of that they take shots at their clubs and ask for favoritism.

930~~~
People were saying the same in 2012.

Not saying that Pereira will emulate Pogba, but he also looks to be a special talent. No idea why we didn't give him any minutes (bar those on Carling Cup).

Won't blame him at all for leaving us.

931~~~
He is "blocked" at United, but at Juve on the other hand he would only have to get in ahead of Pirlo, Vidal, Pogba and Marchisio...

932~~~
He seems a bit thick then. He won't be half the player Pogba is anyways.

933~~~
And those people, including myself, had a point back in 2012. The situation is considerably different now. Pereira isn't as good as Pogba was, isn't anywhere near as physically developed, hasn't been built up in the media the same way Pogba was by Sir Alex in the summer prior to him leaving and the competition is much, much better in the position he plays.

We don't have minutes to spare and we've got more important players to give those minutes to, namely Mata, Herrera, Fellaini and another - more talented - youngster in Januzaj. 

Aren't people sick of sticking it to the club on a daily basis? There are enough things to pick away at right now, but this is stretching a little.

934~~~
This comment shows a complete and utter lack of knowledge of what it takes just to get to being at Utd as a youth player or any other club. It also shows total ignorance of how people develop as the age and the different phases of mentality people have.

935~~~
You do realize that this comments is in the context of their level, not in the absolute. They worked hard to be where they are but they didn't worked harder than the players who are already in the team, they do not deserve more chances than these players.

936~~~
Hence why they leave to play for a team they are good enough to play for.

937~~~
I can understand why he feels there are limited opportunities at utd when we are using a formation to play as many players out of position as possible. In the current formation for game time he has to get ahead of Carrick, Blind, Herrera, Fellaini, Rooney, Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj and even Valencia (as a CM - Everton).
A change of formation to 4231 that most of us have been crying out for would drastically improve his selection chances. Earlier this year in the U21 he played as a CM and was superb in that position and IMO that's where his potential will be unlocked, Box to box midfielder. In this position he would have far less competition, only Carrick, Blind, Herrera and arguably Rooney can play in a 2 man midfield (I've not included Fellaini because IMO he's useless there).
That's where the problem is for me and probably him, when he looks at the amount of players VG is playing out of position, The players VG has frozen out and the football VG is playing I don't fault him for questioning his future here. I can't imagine him on the pitch hoofing it up to Fellaini every time he gets the ball.
The lad know how to play football and is exactly the type of young talented players we should promote through our academy but we also have to give them playing time. There is no doubt that he will become a top player, maybe not Pogba good but he will be up there. We should try and do everything to tie him down on a long term contract and send him out on loan to get first team football even if that means paying him extra, we have had to do that with Januzaj but then again if it weren't for Moyes We wouldnt have got Januzaj tied down. If LVG was here last season I don't think Januzaj would have signed either tbh.

938~~~
I'm not bothered about that, they should do that, but they shouldn't have digs at their former club.

939~~~
...and you say this because its happened before right? If he's gone he's gone for good. I'd show him the door myself if I could.

940~~~
No, get real, look at this season alone, we've had McNair, Wilson, Blackett breakthrough into the first team, Pereira and Wilson have show the potential over the last 2 years, Blackett was crap and McNair was unheard of really. They have all been given more than a few chances but Pereira has been given 1 where he did well and was never seen again in the first team, yet he still put in top performances in for the U21, he is at this current time our most outstanding U21 player, so the question is what more does he have to do to be given a chance?
Were using a formation that is playing so many players out of position its unreal, he has to get ahead of Carrick, Blind, Fellaini, Herrera, Rooney, Mata, Januzaj, Di Maria and even Valencia for some playing time. All we need to do is change formation to 4231 and his chances of first team football improve drastically, only Carrick, Blind, Herrera and arguably Rooney can play in a 2 man midfield, where he would fit into that is a box to box midfielder (as Herrera or Rooney would play), I don't see that happening anytime soon and I don't think he does either. Out of LVG stubbornness we knew we would have problems, this is 1 and if he was here last season Januzaj would have been #2. We can all see we need to change formation, its only 1 person who can't. This stubbornness is affecting our football and players (been frozen out) and because of it we can't get the right balance of squad depth, Pereira would add to the balance not hinder it like some of the players we have.

941~~~
Same thing was said about Pogba (minus Pogba obviously, that time it was a three of Pirlo-Vidal-Marchisio)
He backed himself to break into that midfield and now he's starting CL games for them.

Again, not saying Pereira is the same, but van Gaal has done some strange things with our midfield (mostly how he treated Herrera and Mata) so I don't trust fully his judgement on their fellow midfielder Pereira (same as after years of weird midfields by SAF culminating in Park-Rafael I lost faith in his valuation of Pogba)

942~~~
And again you show a complete ignorance of rates of development, differences in personality, learning styles, maturity growth rates etc etc. 
Blanket statements that players are self important  pricks show just how far removed from knowing what the reality is that you are.

943~~~
Can you explain it to me ?

944~~~
Perhaps he has heard that we are signing Pogba this summer so knows there is a free spot <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

945~~~
Maybe his agent and himself, are looking for more money off us? 
Would be tough to see another top prospect achieve their potential at another club, after leaving for pittance.

946~~~
It's a shame, but the bigger shame is we won't be getting a fee.......again!

947~~~

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Andreas Pereira's father confirms talks with PSV Eindhoven</b></span>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/02/25/pereiras-father-confirms-psv-talks-77837/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/02/25/pereiras-father-confirms-psv-talks-77837/</a>

950~~~
Would he even start that often at PSV? They have the rejuvinated Adam Maher as their creative/attacking CM

951~~~
My posts on him from July last year. Always had indications that he wasn't gonna stay around and bite his time behind the next 30 million benchwarmer etc..

Our best chance of getting him tied down seemed always at the start of the season when he was making positive indications after being involved in the squad by LVG. But then LVG never used him even as a sub despite oppurtunities and Woodward seemingly dithered around offering a deal. Should have involved him a bit and made him sign a deal.

952~~~
He can play deeper or they can play a diamond etc.. Maher might possibly be subject of interest as well from elsewhere.

Don't think starting for PSV would be a issue for him.

953~~~
Surely if he ends up back at PSV then he can only class his time at United as a failure.

954~~~
Their is lot of hindsight revision that goes on with Pobga. Players grow a lot over short periods of time at that age.

And for that time Pogba wasn't exactly ready to walk in our midfield either.


Anyway, Pogba who was a bigger talent more made it a ego battle with SAF and left despite a clear path that was there in his position little sooner or later(Carrick, Cleverley and little else). For Pereira 30 million Herrera/Fellaini and 40 million Mata are already is riding the bench, and LVG wants to spunk more big money it seems on top of that. How will he even get a chance even next season ? The timing is off and he and his father seems impatient from the time he arrived.

Offering him bigger money and convincing him to be loaned out on basis of that seems our best bet.

955~~~
I really don't get all this moaning about Fletcher playing ahead of him.

Pretty much all of Fletchers appearances came early on in the season when he was brought on for the final 10 minutes of games to try and help us keep hold of a slim lead. Would people honestly have rather we brought on a young, inexperienced, attacking midfielder in that situation? Because that would be batshit mental. Actually, saying that, I'm surprised thats not <i>exactly </i>what Van Gaal did.

956~~~
Youth breaks through and makes name at sml club then big trophy winning club buys youth for big fee. That's how it works you either give youth a chance and don't win anything or buy players and win stuff.

957~~~
There were atleast 4/5 occasions LVG could have used him while chasing the game or when the lead was above 2 goals atleast last few minutes and he brought someone else on. I think before the QPR game at home it was even reported that he would be on the bench but not be used. That's what happened even at 4-0.
Also 2/3 occasions when Anderson was used ahead or on the bench ahead.

958~~~

959~~~
Shame. Always thought he looked a good player.

I don't understand why we don't offer him a contract to cover our bases. We will be off loading more rubbish on high wages in the summer hopefully. Give him 20/25k a week and if he isn't going to amount to anything sell him next summer.

What will happen is he will go to PSV, play well for a few seasons before earning himself a big money move elsewhere.

960~~~
The kid can feck off for all I care. Who does he think he is, Ronaldo?

961~~~
He's turned down at least one contract, maybe others.

962~~~
Get rid now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What a twat

963~~~
My entourage reckon he is a spoilt prick and everything that is wrong with football - I agree

964~~~
Call him a prick if you must, but the boy believes in himself so much that he's prepared to walk out on United to get real playing time.  Given the reality of today's world, most of us would do the same thing.

With the players we already have and the rampant talk of us buying one or two midfielders this summer, does he have any realistic expectation of getting a chance with the first team next season?  Nope.

965~~~
Sorry but, have you read what he posted?

If he wants to go then, good luck to him....The fact is, he's a nobody in the grand scale of things and look at what he wrote <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ronaldo or Messi wouldn't even write that. It's insane <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

966~~~
Jaysus, bit strange to come out with a statement like that. He's made no impact on the first team and half our fans would have never heard of him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

967~~~
His entourage do not like your post

968~~~
His entourage can suck a fat one to be honest. The final season was f*cking shite.

969~~~
His entourage agrees. 

We need a caf entourage.

970~~~
It needs more David Brent:
"For my next project, alongside my entourage I will make a decision that matches my football philosophy and career objectives. And grab as much filthy lucre as possible."

971~~~
Are these quotes genuine? Anyway, you would expect us to make at least a nice profit from his sale, in stead of leaving him go on a free. If those quotes are legitimate, then feck me... What an attitude to have at that age <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He still has it all to prove the little shit.

972~~~
Wouldn't be surprised if those quotes are made up.I don't think Pereira's English is even that good.Plus doesn't sound like him ("entourage"???).The pic is again,taken from his Instagram.

He might still leave us but the media is the one who's gaining from it.Too many bullshit stories.

973~~~
Don't think so. That picture is from an instagram post that just says something like good morning everyone (or something pointless like that), and then the quotes is from a dailymail article quoting tuttosport, and they are known to make shit up all the time.

974~~~
Yeah, think the quotes may be fake. This is gay, back to the pile.

975~~~
didnt someone post the translated quote from the tuttosport article? i read it in the morning somewhere

976~~~
Already have next Vieira and now next Scholes in Juve? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

977~~~
I'd imagine entourage was a bad translation to be honest. Who says that?

Even still. What a tool! Anyone who wants to leave United to join a lower club in a lower league should be left go immediately.
Clubs like United need players of stronger character and attitude. Talent is only worth so much.

As to the youth system, how many world class players weren't good enough to play 1st team football at 18/19? I reckon very few.

Young players need to be brought into the club and told they will be developed until they are 19. At the time, if they are considered good enough, they will be given a run in the first team (that needs to then happen, unlike in Pogbas case). They should be told that it is their responsibility to impress during that run.

Those who are not deemed good enough, or fail to impress during their run in the first team should be told they are free to leave. There is no point in running a youth/reserve team full of 20 something year old journeymen just for the sake of it. I'd prefer to see talented young 16/17 year olds getting the exposure. If those told they can leave choose to stay and fight on, fair play to them - that shows character.

978~~~
Another wonderkid not making it through, even Januzaj could still flop here and leave in the coming years. In the bigger picture, I think our appeal will become a little bit weaker in countries like The Netherlands (produces a lot of great talents over and over again), nowadays players are almost condemned over here when they move to a foreign topclubs, clubs use examples like van Velzen, de Laet, Pogba, Rekik, Bruma, Bouy, Ake and now they'll do the same with Pereira. Players are now getting chances at Ajax/Psv/Twente/Feyenoord aged 18. The biggest reason to go to England is to make yourself and family financial independent, that will fade eventually because when you play at a Dutch top club aged 18, you'll not earn less than the common youth contracts you get in the academy. 

Other than that, in recent weeks, months, and years more and more youth players have been talkong about resisting the chance to go to England, other youth players preferring going to Ajax/PSV over other European topclubs, think of Fischer, Eriksen Boilesen, but also for now unknown ones like Muric, Cerny. Or some very tall Roma kid (new zlatan) who chose PSV over numerous European clubs just because of the thought that he'll get a chance there easier. 

Ofcourse still a fair amount of players will leave to England and other countries, TFM for example. But if these clubs continue at this rate, signing the biggest talents aged 15/16 and then failing to get them in the first team eventually, I think it will have negative effect for them.

979~~~
Can't understand the rage here. He believes he's ready for first team football, and there is no indication he'll get it anytime soon at United. His contract expires, which represents a good point in time to search for a good offer. Fair enough. Recent evidence suggests that the club's position isn't necessarily the best for a player's development.

Anyway, if he becomes a world beater elsewhere we could buy him back for 80 million in a couple of years. 85 million tops, including his entourage.

980~~~
Sums up my thoughts. Also, the Juve hate in here is a little odd.

981~~~
He's no wonderkid. What the feck has done? Nothing. Play your position

982~~~
It's cringey, but so what?  It's not as though he's offering his moral support to ISIS.  

Sign him or not, but let's not decide that on the basis of this statement, tweet or whatever re the fukk it is.

I have no idea how good he really is.  What I do know is that because we're in precarious position right now we just can't unleash an unproven 18 year old into the first team.  If that means we miss out on a world beater when he's 22 then so be it.  And if he thinks he's good enough to start for a decent club in Europe and would rather not toil in the second or third team, more power to him.  If he comes good, oh well.

983~~~
Ravel Morrison had a big entourage too if I'm not mistaken.

984~~~
Modern footballers....

We have a manager who isn't afraid to play youth. Blackett and mcnair might have been a bit default, but a rusty looking Adnan still gets belief from LvG 

He he doesn't have the patience, temperament or fight to prove his worth to the first team, then I do hope he goes. Last thing we need considering we need to fight to get back to the top as a team anyways

985~~~
"If you're good enough, you're old enough" Maybe he's just not at 1st team level. If he wants to leave then let him leave.

986~~~
should have sent him on loan this season - been a bit of a wasted year for him

wouldnt begrudge him leaving really - since Herrera spent most of the year on the bench, he has no chance

987~~~
He's just one of many good young players. If he's thinking about money over playing for the top club he's at, we'll have no problem replacing him in the summer

988~~~
Money? If he did it for the money he would stay, reportedly Blackett will get over 20k a weak, you immediately get to be one of the best paid players in the Eredivisie if not the best, he clearly wants to develop himself and play at a decent level. Psv is a club who will play CL next season, it's no Rotherham with all respect. The Eredivisie is a fine competition too which has produced many players who are now playing at rhe very top clubs in world football and the clubs just under that level. Think of Blind, rvp, eriksen, alderweireld, elia, verthongen, djuricic, dembele, janmaat, anita, pelle, bony, even Matic played here. It's clearly not about the money, or mostly not.

989~~~
"Alongside my entourage, I will evaluate all the offers that we have received and will evaluate many things before taking a decision. <b>The financial aspect will be important</b> but not crucial in making my decision."

Offer him 50k a week then watch him and his entourage sign that contract with the quickness

990~~~
"Entourage" what a tool <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

991~~~
Thats a sensible statement tbh (not the entourage bit), of course the financial aspect is important to all footballers (its their job)
However he said its not crucial to the decision he makes. He'd likely earn more @ United than playing for PSV

992~~~
If these are quotes then I'd send him packing. Silly kid thinking he can hold us to ransom.

993~~~
Why are people so convinced he spoke those exact words ? The source is Tuttosport aka Italian Daily star. Some random person attached the quote to his twitter pic and folks are going berserk over something that's most likely journalistic fiction.

994~~~
I hope he leaves.

995~~~
He said "the financial aspect will be important". That was the first thing for him to mention and it was for a reason. He's trying to get the clubs talking to him to offer more

996~~~
Do you know a person in this football world who thinks the financial aspect is not important? And it still would be a minor or irrelevant factor, as he's not really going to earn more at PSV than he would here if he'd sign a new contract.

997~~~
How are you so sure they're not real? Other reputable publications are running the story. His own response or lack of one to this will speak volumes because if these are not his quotes its defamation of character/slander by a publication with a huge circulation.

998~~~
Not even sure where these quotes come from, but still that doesnt mean he's doinf it for the money. If you want to get paid a lot, stay at United,  not a single player at this club isnt overpaid in terms of salary. From the youngsters till the over the top forwards. Money is ofcourse a factor, but I think it's a small one if he's really considering PSV.

999~~~
He's more likely to get a 2nd contract at PSV and they're more likely to offer him wages on a par with their high earners. He also then has the option to join a big club for a big payday, something that'll be a lot harder from here

Regardless of whether you think its important, he's told you its important and didnt mention any other factors. Theres a reason for that

1000~~~
He's not only talking to PSV

"I have spoken with Pogba many times, he is a good friend and he told me that I would be well served <i><b>in moving to Turin</b></i>, both<b> personally and professionally, two important things for me</b>.

"At this time I'm tied to United. My agent is evaluating the offers that have arrived, including that of Juventus, but it's no secret. Just as it's no secret that I have turned down the offers made by my current club.

<b>"I know the Italian league and I certainly would not be disappointed to play there as is one of the best leagues</b>. But I have not taken a decision yet.

1001~~~
Err it's Tuttosport, Juventus' mouthpiece. And you're hoping Pereira leaves without even questioning the validity of the source ?

1002~~~
So a player has seen Pogba leave, go to Juve play well get into the first team and become a superstar.
That I would say probably will sway things more than money, especially if a club is going to offer him first team football.
I'd like him to stay personally, but only if hes going to get an opportunity, otherwise I hope he leaves and becomes a success. No point rotting in our reserves.

1003~~~
Even then, it would highly be an improvement on what he could earn. Not saying he is as good or as talented, but Januzaj earns more than twice as much as the best paid player in the Eredivisie does (80 k per week), it's just not likely that PSV would offer him something that's even comparable to what Pereira could earn here. Even Juventus wouldnt offer him some huge money, does someone know how much they paid Pogba in the beginning? 

I think we should agree to disagree, money is a factor but I dont think he's doing this for that.

1004~~~
Thats a very mouthy quote. Even a publication like Metro star wouldn't go that far. Most of the fake quotes come from fake twitter/social media 'journos' for notoriety. Tuttosports don't have to sink that low....they've been in publication since the 40s and they get respect for the Golden boy awards. I just wonder what makes you think its all made up...and can you point me to any past articles where they've made up proven fake quotes?

1005~~~
The thing about the quote too is that we don't know the context. How do we know he wasn't asked a question which related to money? 
I'm not saying he isn't a money grabbing dueche, but to be perfectly honest, most on the caf called the fact that his lack of opportunities this season would lead to his departure. Seems the more likely thing to me.

1006~~~
Januzaj proved enough last season to be given the 11 shirt this season, Pereira would need to actually do something first before he was subject to similar wages.

I'm not saying he's only looking elsewhere for money, he's clearly looking to get some first team games as he hasnt found that here this season. 

But we <b>know</b> he's far more likely to get those games next season when we're in europe and hopefully dont crash out of the cup so fast. So that point isn't so clear. In fact in almost every scenario he'd be just as well off signing a new contract here - if he wants to play more at somewhere like PSV, send him to the Netherlands on loan next season to a different club. If he wants less games but to be involved at United, he'll get that next season here.

And its pretty alarming that he's mentioned that finances are important and doesnt mention anything else, that suggests a questionable character as does looking to leave already.

1007~~~
Let him go I say. He feels he's ready to be a starter somewhere. We can't accommodate his demands at the moment when we have so many players in midfield. We've offered him a contract and he's rejected it. He needs to be realistic about his situation in this team. Best he can do IMO is sign the contract and ask for a loan move next season.

Once proving himself on loan he'd come back a better player and be ready to fully make an assault on ensuring a first team/starting 11 berth. But no, it appears he wants immediate assurances about game time and also more money otherwise he wouldnt mention financials <i>after</i> rejecting United's offer. Good riddance

<a class="username" data-user="79807, @Sammyjunn" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79807/">@Sammyjunn</a> Januzaj is not on 80k btw

1008~~~
I wish him the best of luck. Actually I don't care <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

Everyone knows Tutto is one of the most unreliable sports publications out there, especially when it comes to fictionalizing stories from a Juventus perspective. Their modus operandi is to link Juventus with every single player in the world = more clicks and more papers sold. 

Don't even have to dig deep. Check up the Juventus/ Ibrahimovic/ Hansson or the Frank Schouten mis-quotes. There's a saying among Serie A followers that Juventus fan lap up Tuttosport articles while the rest of the league uses it as toilet paper.

And what does the Golden Boy have to do with anything ? What kind of reasoning is that ? One could similarly argue that the Daily Mail hands out a dozen different awards each year, and not just for sports. Yet they were accused of making quotes up :


And Tutto is the lowest of the low when it comes to football and specifically Juventus stories. There are very few reliable outlets where you can atleast speak with some conviction (eg. The Independent) and Tutto isn't one of them.

But never you mind. Pereira must be sent packing right this minute !

1010~~~
Very well, I still think the boy is stupid and misguided and its not solely because of that article. He has in fact rejected a contract offer and other articles have pointed to his father and agent talking about a lack of playing time. I guess they're all made up...fire starts from nowhere.

1011~~~
Out of curiosity, why do you think he is misguided? Or stupid?

1012~~~
He is, at least something in that region. Mist sources have stated that, let me put it that way.

1013~~~
Maybe that was a bit harsh, but Im assuming he's turning down the contract for playtime and financial reasons. United offer decent contracts, so im pretty sure whats been offered is a good reflection of where he stands in the team.
Pogba was reportedly offered about the same amount (some say we even offered more...30k/ a week and he ended up getting 20k at Juve) he ended up signing to Juventus for, so maybe its more about game time assurances.  LVG can't give him assurances about playing time, and he hasn't done anything to be in a position to demand or expect such assurances. If he wants to leave good for him.

My guess is his agent and his advisers have probably got in his head and made him believe he's worth more than he is, thats where the 'misguided' comes into play for me. He's not a wonderkid, he's just a talented youth player.

1014~~~
He's around that region but the figure is closer to 60k

1015~~~
So if you we're him, out of curiosity would you sign a new contract at United? (even though you only played a good 25 odd minutes for the 1st team)
Or would you go to PSV (or somewhere else) where you could play a lot of first team games and if you prove yourself play UCL football? 
If they both offered the same financial package?

1016~~~
I know, not saying he should be given that but if bloody Blackett can earn a fair amount, Pereira can too. Pereira is 19, if he goes on loan to a club like PSV he'll get a lot less chances than he would when signed by them. Signing for PSV is a far better option than extending the contract and then going on loan. Even Januzaj here who proved himself rarely gets chances in this side. If Pereira signs for PSV, he'll play CL, may end up winning prizes and if he performs similar to Bakkali/Depay he can get himself wanted by topclubs all over Europe and play every week and develop himself rapidly,  that's a far better option than getting games here rarely, having the task to outperform world class players in the first team, same thing Welbeck struggled with for example.

1017~~~
Even that is a bit more than thrice as much as the amount Ajax' best player gets. Psv pays a bit better so lets say that's a factor of 1,5 till 2. We are the club of overpaying, staying would be best for him financially (probably).

1018~~~
Everybody says and thinks how this is the "new Pogba" case, but Pogba is one in a hundred. No doubt that Pereira is talented, but he's nowhere near the first 11, not even first 18. Just look at all the world class stars that left United in the last few years: Zeki Fryers, Ravel Morisson, Mats Moller Daehli, Paul Pogba. Only Pogba lived up to the hype. Daehli is solid, but definitely not good enough for United. Fryers doesn't even play and Morrison will probably end up like Championship / Premier League relegation player and go to USA / India / Australia before he turns 30. Pereira might become world class, but if he thinks he can become better player in Juventus, in a league that is sinking more and more which is dominated by one team.. fine. Pogba is great I'm not saying he's not and I would like that he stayed, but no way he could be as easily dominant in Premier League as he is in Serie A nowdays.

1019~~~
Not being funny but when was Zeki Fryers ever rated as some world class star?

1020~~~
Are those quotes confirmed ?

1021~~~
On this very forum (newbies part) was hailed by quite a few people as 'next Ashley Cole'.

1022~~~
Can't really say, its different actually facing the situation. If I feel im good enough and my <i>ultimate aim</i> is to play for a big team than i'd sign with the big team im already at and prove myself on loan or hope to break through the following season when I know i'll have more chances to play (likely CL season, cups). At 19 I still have at least two seasons to really have a go at proving my worth to United...but of course in real life i'll have agents telling me other things.

1023~~~
So what you're saying is that he has a right to demand more playing time at this moment?

1024~~~
Interesting, I'd probably have the opposite view to you, but I see where you are coming from. I just think its incredibally hard for a young player to break through especially when the team is in transition and spending money like no bodies business. I'm not even sure he would get a look in next season since midfield is a priority for LVG in the summer.
I think players like De Bruyne are an example, just go away and play football somewhere for a lesser team and make a name for yourself. I doubt Pereira is going to improve much playing more U21 football tbh

1025~~~
Was not what I said but I think he's right to demand a chance given, some cameo's here and there, more minutes in the FA..Because he has arguably been the best player in the u21, of course he has great competition so his minutes were always going to be limited, but just a chance given should have been the case.

1026~~~
I agree, which is why im surprised he hasn't requested a loan yet. Evans, Beckham and Welbeck all did well coming back from loans. Anyway, its what it is. I don't consider him a wonderkid. I'll be surprised if he becomes as good as Pogba.

1027~~~
Really unlikely he'll be as good as Pogba. We'll be lucky if he can reach the heights of Gibson or Anderson, who were actually reasonably successful with us at their best.

I don't think he'll make it here, but he certainly has a shot if he can kick on, the raw talent is enough if he's dedicated.

1028~~~
Januzaj lost his chance because he played several games and didnt do well. He's just had a good performance and we'll see how often he plays now

1029~~~
Hasnt been much still and mostly out of position. He hasnt really played winger/10 this season.

1030~~~
He's good and has a lot of talent but I can't be bothered. This is nothing like Pogba's situation when we were crying out for a CM but never gave him a real crack at it. We're in a very unstable period and it's not the best time to blood young players, secondly, we have better players in midfield and #10. If he wants to leave then let him leave.

1031~~~
Juve denying interest, and his agent saying they are awaiting a new offer from us.. Not looking as horrible today as it did yesterday.

1032~~~
As I've said before I've no idea whether he will stay or go but people saying we should get rid of him because he rejected a contract offer clearly have no idea how negotiations work. Blackett and McNair both rejected the initial offers as well as will almost every player. Nearly as ridiculous as people saying get rid of him because someone on twitter google translated something from a notoriously unreliable source and put it alongside an old picture of him to make it look as if he'd put it up himself. The only thing for sure is that he is still speaking with united regarding his future. His father also has a lot of friends in the media in Holland and Belgium as an ex player so I wouldn't be surprised if some of these stories are tactical either

1033~~~
Source?

1034~~~
If the report is true, then it is also true he has turned down new contract offers from us, so if he leaves it is his doing not ours

1035~~~
hope you're right, would be very painful losing him as I had high hopes for the kid and watched his development for some time. He seemed nice lad off the pitch supporting the team on twitter even he didn't get on the bench most of the time so I guess we will give him better second offer, tie him down and loan him if he wants to play first team football. I think he's having better season than Pogba's was before he left..

1036~~~
Pogba, would as big a player in the EPL as he is becoming in Italy, the fact its supposed to be a lesser league means nothing. You simply have to look at his ability, his attitude (cocky is a good thing) his desire and his continual improvement to know he would be a success no matter what team he played in, no matter what league.
I dont think Perriera is in the same class as Pogba but it will be a shame to lose one of our best U21 players. However the timing of everything is unfortunate and if he feels he needs to move to progress then fair enough. Would prefer he stayed but wont hate him if he goes. I think he is going to be a quality player by the time he is 25, a big player for whatever team he plays for.  He has all the important attributes to succeed.

1037~~~
My word football has changed.

1038~~~
Wouldn't that 2nd paragraph also have applied to Pogba?

1039~~~
I'd say so, yes. If the club wants to keep hold of him, they have to offer him more playing time (or more money). TBH everyone here would do the same thing. You'd take the best offer, wouldn't you?

The chance for him to make it here is slim and he's probably not getting paid enough to compensate for that.


The quotes probably didn't do him any favour but it's totally valid to take the best offer.

1040~~~
Give him 20K a week, and send him on loan next season, can't be that difficult surely? Once pro players who've done a lot(hererra) start complementing youth players then you know there's something about them. If he goes to juve, then I'll know that we just aren't a serious organisation anymore.

1041~~~
This is so not right my friend. We've offered him a contract. Why has he rejected it?

1042~~~
He's such a good friend that he refers to him by his surname rather than his first name. Pidier.

1043~~~
People need to read jb's post on the previous page.He reflected quite as accurate as you can find picture of what is happening.

1044~~~
He's still too young for a loan at the start of this season and we wouldn't loan out players in the last 6 months of their contract that's why he's not going out on Jan.Plus foreign players usually don't get loaned out that often (for example Vermijl had 3 years in the U21s before he got loaned out,same for Petrucci,Eikrem and Ekangamene never got loaned out either).There might be other reasons such as LVG see it more beneficial to let him stay and train with the first team instead.

He might not be a wonderkid but still one of the best if not the best talents in our U21s currently.If we can keep him obviously we should keep him.

1045~~~
Probably money and playing time.

1046~~~
If he has rejected our offer then more fool him.

1047~~~
In our entire history there have been hundreds of youth players coming through the ranks.

Managers and coaches make a call on who is going to make it and who isn't. They see them in training every day and make judgements on their skill, temperament, work ethic, maturity, potential and how they might fit into a certain team or play in a certain style.

Depending on all these factors, they are then offered a contract within the pay/wage structure that exists within the club. This is exactly the same as most businesses in the world.

Players can choose to accept the contract or not. Many reasons exist because of this as we all know…playing time, money, agents input and so on.

In 99% of cases United have been proved to be correct with their decision making. Only a handful of players being released have gone on to actually be international stars and worthy of reconsideration. 

In effect, people at United know what they are doing, even if to us on the outside some of the decisions don't seem to make sense. Personally, I don't understand why Tom Thorpe hasn't been given a chance. Alternatively, Pereira has done little in my eyes to warrant all this hype. Everyone sees potential differently and there have only been a handful of players in my lifetime that I would call 'certs'. All the others are 'maybe's'.

At the end of the day a club can't offer game time to every young potential player. A club can't meet every wage request. A club can't meet every agents contract demands.

That is why young players like Pogba, Pereira, and many others have moved on.

Good luck to them. 

The bottom line with our club is that if a young player is good enough, is patient enough and has all the qualities described above he will get a chance and make it at Manchester United.

1048~~~
I dont blame him, when you are 3-0 up with 10 min left, and bring on Fletcher instead of Pereira who is desperate for a chance, then ye eventually the bomb snaps.

1049~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Midfielder in talks with Manchester United, move looks likely but not nailed on</b></span>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/midfielder-in-talks-with-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/midfielder-in-talks-with-manchester-united</a>

1050~~~
Yep. Also didnt give him a run out against Yeovil or in either Cambridge game.

1051~~~
Why? We haven't given him a chance and if he looks across to Juve, he'll see Pogba - who made the same move - now ripping it up and being touted as a future Ballon d'Or.

1052~~~
While he will see that, I think if he has half a brain, he will also know he isn't half the player Pogba was/is. Yes, he could turn into a great player one day but Pogba is set to become one of, if not the best in the world.

1053~~~
I really wouldn't be too fussed if we lost this lad really. He's good but nowhere near Pogba/Morrison level when they were the same age. He'll have a good career I just don't really care if he leaves to go abroad and doesn't come back to haunt us.

1054~~~
As has been said before there is a lot of revisionism going on with Pogba on here. When Pogba was playing for our reserves he wasn't even one of the teams best players. He showed glimpses of what he could do and he was clearly the most talented player in the team but he just wasn't consistently performing as well as he could. There were plenty of people that were saying his performances for the reserves didn't warrant his inclusion in the first-team. You could replace "Pogba" with "Pereira" in the above sentences and it would perfectly describe Pereira's current situation. He is clearly our under 21's most talented player but just needs to be more consistent (something he has improved on this season). 

Like with Pogba, I do feel Pereira has been very harshly treated in terms of the chances he has been given in the first-team. They were/are both very talented and deserved/deserve more chances with the first-team. 

However, to suggest that Pereira wasn't half the player Pogba was is just wrong. Pogba was the more talented when at Pereira's age but there wasn't that much in it. People are just spouting that nonsense because they are safe in the knowledge that he has become one of the world's best midfielders so they assume he must have been much more talented than Pereira. As someone who has watched them both play for the reserves/under 21's I can tell you that wasn't the case.

1055~~~
I don't think he's as good as that to be honest.

1056~~~
Nowhere wear as good I don't think.

1057~~~
His situation is different than Pogba's
Agree.Plus saying Pereira is no loss because he's nowhere near Pogba is like saying Gary Neville was no loss because he's no Cafu/Carlos.If a player has potential to be good enough for us, it's a loss regardless.

1058~~~
Totally agree, Pogba wasnt very consistent but both were clearly the most talented in their generation. Pogba more talented than Pereira but some act as if he's some dross since these rumours.

1059~~~
Can't knock your opinion but I can truly sit here and say that I felt Pogba would be one of the best in the world watching him years ago. Nothing to do with consistency, simply just as a footballer. I see Pereira making it as a very good footballer somewhere. And that is not a criticism but in regards to the very top bracket of players, I don't think he comes close to Pogba.

1060~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_l2MHoWIAAxcCp.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_l2MHoWIAAxcCp.jpg"/>

He's one of our own!

1061~~~
Good to see he hasn't been frozen out of first team training - that may be good news that the contract is close to being signed.

1062~~~
I reckon he'll most likely still be leaving but good to see him in training. Might be on the bench in the cup game. Shame we got knocked out of the league cup when we did as he probably would have played a few more games in that competition.

1063~~~
How high is his ceiling?  Would people be as outraged if he left like Pogba because we knew his potential was high?

1064~~~
Personally I wouldn't blame him but nor would I also blame LvG, but I do wish Andreas Pereira had a little bit more understanding. Yes, he's playing well. Yes, he deserves it so his frustration is undertandable. But we are in a crucial stage where every game is practically a cup final and although he does have the potential, it's a gamble at the moment and I feel we've wasted too much time gambling on Falcao to now accommodate an inform U21 player some playing time. Perhaps that's lack of faith but we cannot afford to play anything less than our best starting 11 at this crucial stage of the season.

I really do hope he does stay and he does get the opportunity he deserves next season but I cannot blame either party in this scenario.

1065~~~
I missed this. It's made me optimistic. I hope he stays.

1066~~~
Hope he gets a run today now. Need to make him sign.

1067~~~
PL debut! Get in!

1068~~~
Get in Hoelgebaum!

1069~~~
Been lively, made some good challenges

1070~~~
Good to see him getting his PL debut, but By the time he came on rest of the team had basically stopped playing and he was playing wide right as a 2nd RB almost.

1071~~~
PereIn.

1072~~~
Looked lively. Difficult to make an impression in that type of match when we've won the game already.

Encouraging though that he's getting a run out.

1073~~~
Good to see him tracking back well, as said above the game was already decided but a great experience for him.

1074~~~
Nice to see him gets some PL mins, having been an unused sub so often in the first half of the season.

1075~~~
Nice to see him get on and made to feel part of the first team.

1076~~~
Was working his ass off, happy for the kid, hope it means that he'll actually stay.

1077~~~
Nice to see him come on, hopefully it may entice him to stay.

1078~~~
Could this appearance be the sign of the ongoing renewal talks? I hope so!

1079~~~
Shades of Pogba two years ago. Hoping for a better outcomes this time.

1080~~~
Good to see him get a cameo, more of the same please.

1081~~~

1082~~~
Definitely is a positive sign. Not sure what's changed behind the scenes but glad LVG gave him some minutes. Hopefully it means he will stay, as I think he could have a bright future as an 8 for us.

1083~~~
Yep. 

Although it is weird that this hasn't happened earlier in the season against shitter teams. The fact that he's back in the fold could hopefully mean that there is a thaw in the negotiations.

1084~~~
Glad he come on today. Was a nice touch by Van Gaal.

1085~~~
New contract and loan next season ahead I think

1086~~~
Nice to see him get a run out, and hopefully will go some way to convincing him he has a future here. Can't really say much about his performance, as most of his work was tracking back when he came on. Most of our attacks came down the other side.

1087~~~
Very pleased for his debut appearance, hope it's not too late to convince him to stay. Young players are often impatient. I think he has got mentality to succeed at our level..

1088~~~
Wonder if it's too little too late. Hope he sees it as a good show of faith from LVG.

1089~~~
At first I thought LVG was afraid to make a change so it was a nice surprise when he put Pereira on.

1090~~~
Yep think the same

1091~~~
It was interesting to see him being pushed by the club earlier in the week with that visit to the school/hospital which ever it was.  They highlighted both Rafael and Andreas, which made me suspect that they'd be rewarded with some minutes this weekend. With all the bad press as such over his contract it would be easy for the club to ignore him, both media wise as well as playing wise, but events this week are encouraging.  It was good to see him on the pitch today, more of the same over the remainder of the season and he may just sign a new contract.

1092~~~
Yes, the loan might be part of the PSV deal to get Memphis.

1093~~~
A new contract, a loan to PSV and Depay coming here would be perfect!

1094~~~
Agreed, that would be a very shrewd and pleasing bit of business all round.

1095~~~
Ah, that would make every United fan's day with very intelligent business.

1096~~~
Thank christ he finally got on the pitch! Not much chance to do anything because we were sitting by then, but he just needed to put studs on turf really. Hopefully a few more of those coming up to keep him here.

1097~~~
That he was even the first sub was great <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1098~~~
I spent the entire game thinking it was Januzaj. Only realised when my old man mentioned it afterwards. Silly twat.

1099~~~
Too logical for us.

1100~~~
Nope.As if buying Depay is the hardest business in the world for us that we need Pereira to smoothen the deal.

Wouldn't loan Pereira out and even if we want to, he need to play first team football in England.

1101~~~
Considering how very poor our loan deals with English teams have been in recent times, I would rather make sure a potential Pereira loan turns into a successful one abroad.

1102~~~
Well, getting good deals on the transfer market hasn't exactly come naturally to us in recent years. Can you think of a good deal we've done recently? The best have perhaps been Rojo and Blind, and those were merely "sane" deals rather than good ones.

1103~~~
Good deals? ADM is a great signing, just crap that he's not found an effective role in the team. 
I think United had a very good summer in regard to transfers, who would have thought Falcao & ADM would be so underachieving? 
Anders starting to look good & Shaw is pretty solid when fit.

1104~~~
When was the last time that a youngster ever come back and play for the first team after an abroad loan?Chelsea sent a lot of youngsters to Vitesse who's about PSV's level and most if not all of them after that still had to get another further loan in the Championship.There's a big difference between English football and the rest of the world in terms of style,tempo and physicality and we're playing most of our football against England opponents so if we want to prepare the lads for first team football, it's the best to send him to English clubs.

That saying I don't think LVG will loan him out.

Financial aspect wouldn't be a problem for us so sending Pereira on loan to them or not won't change anything.

1105~~~
Glad to see the kid being given some minutes in the first team. Nothing overly impressive for a first outing, but hopefully he can keep impressing and push for a few more minutes in the future.

1106~~~
Well, maybe it's just me, but 65 million for someone RM wanted rid of, 30 million for a teenage fullback, and being made to pay the release clause for Herrera don't say "good deal" to me. I mean, there are decent arguments for them not being bad deals, but the fact that the argument has to be made says something in itself. Anyway, not to go off-topic here, I think my original point is simply limited to the fact that I don't think Pereira on loan as part of a Depay deal would be bad business, and also not bad for Pereira to get experience in another country if he can get first team football.

1107~~~
Has he actually signed anything yet it was that a Pogba esque appearance in hope of signing a new deal?

1108~~~
I think he learned quite quickly just how much quick the pace in the Premier League is. He got caught on the ball a few times and gave away a poor foul. Good lesson for him.

1109~~~

1110~~~
I think he'll be on the bench for the Villa game and get some minutes. Can't see him getting on against Liverpool, unless we're in a comfortable position.

1111~~~
I'm not impressed

1112~~~
Vitesse isn't at PSV their level. PSV actually has money and can buy good players, they're winning the league by 11 points and play CL next season. Vitesse is struggling to keep within FFP and gets loads of Chelsea youngsters every year, even for positions they don't need them. They play nice football but aren't a topclub like Ajax or PSV. They're currently 5th and 26 points behind PSV.

Atsu has done well at Vitesse and he's now playing for Everton. Not every young player has the talent to grow into something big, but the Eredivisie is a great place for youngsters. It isn't a physical league but tactically it's fine and they can give more playtime to youngsters than any team in the PL would (for unproven talents). That's basically what our league has become: a training ground for talent who we need to sell to earn money.

On the topic of him being loaned out to PSV, their current midfield:
They play with 2 attacking midfielders and 1 CDM, in order from most important:
AM: captain Wijnaldum, Maher, Guardado, Hiljemark, Ritzmaier
CDM: Guardado, Hendrix, Schaars, Hiljemark

Wijnaldum will probably leave and Guardado is on loan from Valencia (but willing to stay). Ritzmaier will definately leave. 

PSV need to strenghten there next summer if said players leave, but I'm not sure if they are interested in a loan. They do already have youngsters Rekik from Manchester City and Isimat-Mirin from AS Monaco on loan this season though so they might. 

It won't be a guaranteed starting place for him, but he'll have more of a chance than in the PL and maybe he'll even get the chance to play CL/EL. I think it would be a good temporary move for him to get some playtime if he extends his contract.

1113~~~
All worthless if he doesnt sign a new contract

1114~~~

He loves it!

1116~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1117~~~
I bet he'd been saving up for that one. 


In more ways than one.

1118~~~
I like the fact he says 'you get cash if you're good' meaning she might effectively end up with nothing, dignity included <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1119~~~
Sad state of truth is I'd wager most 19 year old girls would have sex with two footballers for £10,000. 

She's probably making it up.

1120~~~
I would believe if she said it was Pereira and Januzaj.

1121~~~
Would you have sex with 2 young famous actresses for £10,000? I think many people female or male would take this option <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1122~~~
Nah I wouldn't. I'd get fed up of them texting me afterwards for more <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>.

(plus my I'd never cheat on you my lovely girlfriend if you happen to read this.... <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>)

1123~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> for 10k that's a lot of "bang for your buck".

1124~~~
10k for 3 minutes (at most), work sounds great.

1125~~~
Fella seems oddly insistent on the presence of another dude.

1126~~~
She might have gotten more for the story, assuming the texts are proven.

1127~~~
Nothing wrong with a bit of squad bondage.

1128~~~
Performance related pay, I like it. Maybe we should include that in his new contract negotiations.

1129~~~
Dunno, they seem to work well together. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1130~~~
£200'000 an hour pro rata.

1131~~~
He needs money for this

1132~~~
If true: What a fecking tool <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Also, a threesome with Paddy McNair? Holy feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1133~~~
He says 5 each. Why are they assuming its £10,000 and not £10?

1134~~~
fecking hell how stupid is he? I mean she is gorgeous and all that but £10,000 for a bang, with Paddy fecking McNair, is just insanely bad value for money. Has he gotten to grips yet with the value of the GBP? Sounds like Horseshit.

1135~~~
Highly doubt its true, she's probably just making it up to make a quick buck or quick bit of fame really. I mean, let's be honest, she was probably out with them in the hope she would hook up with one of them anyways but she says no because she's offered £10k? Seems unlikely.

1136~~~
Yeah, probably. Hence my disclaimer <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Still, the idea of wanting to do a girl with Paddy's mug next to you!

1137~~~
Most of these girls go out with footballers in the faint hope that one will fall in love with them and they become a WAG. Financially it is like winning the lottery and they get to go to exclusive parties and so on and so forth. They might even reach Coleen levels and end up with some crap series on ITV4.

Most of them are not purely looking to have a one night stand with a footballer.

edit# just looked at her pic!?! £10k, keep dreaming. There are high class hookers that are far more attractive (and much cheaper) than her.

1138~~~
Paddy you dawg! 

Sounded like she was down if it was just Andreas. For 10grand I'd contemplate doing Andreas and Paddy.

1139~~~
Hopefully it's the last time she will be allowed into the VIP area

1140~~~
10K? I'd take it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1141~~~
Wonder how much she got for selling the article. Surely it's more embarrassing to have your face plastered everywhere in tabloids than going about your business quietly on a Friday evening in Manchester. Though I do agree it's incredibly insulting to be offered money for services rendered. The thing i don't get is he's a good looking guy, so not sure why he'd have to pay for it. Probably has Alan Partridge levels of banter, and spent all night discussing how the M60 is the UK's only true orbital motorway...

1142~~~
Funny how this story comes out in the week he makes his league debut.

1143~~~
There's going to be some uncomfortable moments for Paddy and Andreas from now on. The story is too good to be true.

1144~~~
"No?  Alright, how much for us going at it in the bathroom stall and my buddy _____ filming it?"

1145~~~
Somehow I didn't think a performance thread would include those kind of performances.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1146~~~
Wouldn't it be cheaper to just get yourself a bloody girlfriend.

1147~~~
Tbh, I think he could have gotten a much nicer bird for that money. Don't think she's worth £10,000<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
His agent's reply made me laugh though.

1148~~~
He's right in away. He is single. He can't be any great shakes if he has to pay £10,000 to get a bird.

1149~~~
Its not to just get a bird though. Its to get a bird for him and Paddy. The lad can't perform without his boy.

1150~~~
Seriously?

1151~~~
I'm a woman, we're not that expensive are we?<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1152~~~
Well, you'd get a lot more value out of your 10 large, but in the long run, it gets pretty expensive.

1153~~~
I hope he got his mum a nice Mothers Day present. I'd be annoyed if I got a bunch of flowers yet he was willing to spend £10,000 on bedding a girl. This is a great example of too much money.

1154~~~
Why is he so desperate to get Paddy McNair involved?

1155~~~
The mind boggles.

1156~~~
He's gay for Paddy.

1157~~~
When I heard he wanted a threesome, I expected it to be with another girl. Wanting a threesome with another guy is just... weird.

1158~~~
The inexperience of youth?<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1159~~~
Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole regularly tag teamed girls.

1160~~~
Sharing is caring and who better to share with than your mate?

1161~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This was my first thought too!

1162~~~
Perhaps it was paddy fancying a shag but he was too shy to ask, and he offered Andreas money to introduce them. Just so happened he thought he would have a go too!

1163~~~
The agents response was brilliant. He couldn't give two fecks and had no interest in pandering to tabloid nonsense and PC shite. As he said he's single and can shag who he wants with who he wants.

1164~~~
He shags who he wants! He shags who he wants!

1165~~~
Maybe she was more interested in Andreas but Paddy fancied her more.

1166~~~
If true!!!!! (It's from The Sun)

1) 10 pence or 10 quids or £10,000 for her.....if you are paying for sex then at least for a hot girl and not for a girl like her ffs!!!

2) "I nearly fell off my chair when he offered me £10,000 for a threesome. What kind of low-life does that? I'm not that kind of person at all and found it very, very insulting" ==>> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> To tell the story The Sun is like you are a whore

1167~~~
He had to have Paddy there because he owed him a few bob after he did the tarmacking on his driveway.

1168~~~
If he scores tomorrow he'll probably celebrate by dry humping the corner flag.

1169~~~
Na, he will "make it rain".

1170~~~
For £10k you can get professional escort / pornstar. The way she looks she needs to pay them to get laid.

1171~~~
Stop with the prostitutes

1172~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Captain affect.

1173~~~
She's worse than every United WAG that I've seen (bar maybe Young/Valencia).Wilson's gf is a bit overweight but at least she's cute.

1174~~~
Come on lads, there is no need to be mean about the girls looks. I'd throw her one.

1175~~~
Half of you would drag your dicks through shrapnel for a mile if she offered you a handie.

1176~~~

1177~~~
Moving to PSG would be a stupid move for him. He should stay and improve under LvG who obviously rates him and has a great record with youngsters. Money will come eventually.

1178~~~
Would be dissapointed if we lose him. Give him a decent 10-20k wage and lets avoid having an another (possible) Pogba situation.

1179~~~
I was under the impression that 'a decent 10-20k wage' <i>is</i> what we offered Pogba. Probably not far off what we're offering Pereira.

1180~~~
Yep, we did that to Pogba but there it was a matter of gameplay (not money) considering that he accepted Juve's 20k/week wage.

No idea what are we offering and what Pereira wants though.

1181~~~
''bit overweight'' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1182~~~
He's in the brazilian U20 squad

1183~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p-FzK5YVhwk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1184~~~
I'm guessing it's a good sign that he tweets stuff like this:



After all, it's not as if he needs to.

1185~~~
Will be on the bench for sure, can he do a job as a DM? atleast a better one than Rooney at DM?

Van Gaal has shown he doesn't mind playing youngsters if he thinks they can step up and do a job..

1186~~~
Isn't he with the Brazil U20s?

1187~~~
Oh really? I thought he'd be back by now! pointless thread bump in that case

1188~~~
Liam Grimshaw is the only pure DM at the club that is fit at the moment.Obviously Fellani/Thorpe can also play there.

Pereira is still away on international duty.

1189~~~
If he was here with the team, might have been in with a shout at getting a start.. Thorpe might make the bench though (long shot, more likely to be just Blackett on the bench with Rafael.)

1190~~~
Saddest thing is i can really imagine Grimshaw on the bench ahead of Rothwell, specially if you take CB's as example.....

1191~~~
Going by the last U21s match Thorpe must be either injured or already left for trial with another club.

1192~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1193~~~
I dont see how he would help.. Hes too attack minded, not further back the field disciplined

1194~~~
He's been improving a lot defensively over the past year i think.. Would be a good deep lying playmaker imo, maybe not a pure DM

1195~~~
He'd have a better chance of gametime now given the injuries (although only from the bench). Being away with the bloody U20s is ridiculous.

1196~~~
Dear God, imagine Liam Grimshaw playing for the first team against Chelsea. Paddy McNair would probably get in over him at DM though.

1197~~~
Back from U20 duty it seems, on the bench.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CC4ma6gWYAANKIV.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CC4ma6gWYAANKIV.jpg"/>

1198~~~
Nice surprise.

1199~~~
Delighted with that. Looks like LvG counts with him which is promising in the whole contract situation.

1200~~~
I'd love to see Herrera as the deepest of the cm 3 in that lineup. I just don't think Rooney can do that job.

1201~~~
yeah why the hell give him a chance when everything's done for us and we have a pub striker who can play box to box. I've seen this kind of situation once, where was it...?

1202~~~
Seems putting him on the bench is a ploy to get him to sign a contract. LVG doesn't seem to use him no matter what.

1203~~~
To be fair, I'm sure LVG wants to play him when the pressure is off. Recently the games have been very tight.

1204~~~
Bullshit! He should be brought on when we're 3-0 down to Everton and then we'd definitely have won <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1205~~~
We're in a top 4 race so it isnt  so strange he isnt playing.

1206~~~
Of course he's not getting minutes at the moment. We're in no position to give minutes to an unproven teenager. I've no doubt that if RVP was fit and didn't need minutes that he'd have been brought on against Everton jut to see what he could do. But I'd rather have Van Persie back match fit for the final few games.

He's been on the bench in, what, the last 6 games that he's been available for?

1207~~~
he'll play today with the U21, as will Januzaj, Wilson, Blackett

1208~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQMxarPOcFQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1209~~~
Haven't watched that video yet but would love a gif of that bit of skill he did on the left touch line in the second half. Flicking the ball up over a sliding tackle. Was well slick.

1210~~~
He was class yesterday for the U21's, if we're doing well against West Brom hopefully he can some minutes.

1211~~~

1212~~~
It has been obvious for a while that he's likely to stay looking at his performance and how he has been treated.Quite similar to Gribbin's.

1213~~~
That would be great news. He is one talented lad.

1214~~~
Andreas Pereira has been included in Brazil’s 26-player provisional squad for the FIFA U-20 World Cup.

1215~~~
He's Brazilian? I always thought he's Portugese or something

1216~~~
Both of his parents are Brazilian, his father was a professional player in Belgium where he was born.

1217~~~
What's his best/preferred position really? Can he make it as a CM?

1218~~~
CM

1219~~~
I would say he is similar to Herrera, can play in central midfield or at 10.

1220~~~
CM is his best position, but he can also play as a no.10 and do a job on the wing.

1221~~~
We will find out when he plays in that Juve midfield next season. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1222~~~
our future  midfield,  Pereira and Gerson <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1223~~~
I can't say that I'm at all clued up on youth football stuff, but he looks quite engaged in his U21 performances, nothing like Pogba looked just before he was off.

1224~~~
Just watching that video, the way he moves is so similar to a young ronaldo, maybe its just the boots and the ankle tape (its not)

Obviously this is no mark of his talent, but just found it interesting

1225~~~
Watching that he reminds me a bit of Coutinho.

1226~~~
Would be great news, hope he can be part of the squad next season and get some gametime. Even if we sign a midfielder our depth in that area is still not that great so he could get a game here and there.

1227~~~
Hopefully we see one of those contract signing pics with him and LvG soon, it would be a shame for him to leave without even getting a chance at having an impact on the senior team.

1228~~~
His recent performances have started to remind me of Thiago, he still does a lot of flicks and tricks but now theres a lot more purpose to them rather than just for the sake of it. He's also keeping the ball a lot better and raised the tempo of his passing and his all round game. He's developed and matured quite a bit this season

1229~~~
Hope he stays.

1230~~~
Eerily similar to Deco in terms of style of play. Don't know if he'll progress into that type of a player long term, but Pereira has comparable confidence in his own skillset (eg. 3:00 - no look pass), very good dribbling ability, awareness of what's going on around him, good control in constricted spaces and decent passing range. Could stand to improve his field vision and general decision making but to be fair, he has shown a lot of improvement already this season and more should come naturally with age and experience, and overall just working towards translating his confidence to the senior stage.

If Andreas progresses well over the next couple of seasons, he could be a good option as Ander's central midfield cohort. Or atleast be a good option coming off the bench. It's going to be a critical phase for him, as it is for all footballers on the verge of senior football. Just hope we iron out his contract and tie him to a long term deal.

1231~~~
He is too attack-minded to be a CM in a 4-4-2 for me.

1232~~~
Great news. I really like him.

1233~~~
So? When's the last time we used that formation? He could easily play the role Herrera currently does for us.

1234~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Manchester United's Andreas Pereira hints at stay amid PSG link</b>

1235~~~
This kid has a future here. I think him, Wilson and Januzaj need to go out on loan. If he doesnt go out on loan, then with the amount of games and injuries next season, he will definitely get his chance to play.

1236~~~
We have to get this lad signed up. IMO I wouldn't want Gundogan at the club at the expense of Pereira. This lad has bags of potential and he requires game time to fulfill that potential. He should be a back up player to Herrera in the same way Januzaj is a back up player to our wingers. Looking to the future I'd like to see both players move centrally with a DM behind them, maybe Goss or Pearson.

1237~~~
Good that it sounds like he's happy to stay and fight for some chances

1238~~~
Hopefully we dont make the same mistake we made with Pogba.

1239~~~
He was born in Belgium but both parents are Brazilian I believe.

1240~~~
How? When he isnt Pogba?

1241~~~
We dont give him enough chances? Wait till the very very end to offer him a new contract? Dont play Valencia in midfield if we have injury problems to our first team CMs?

1242~~~
I think it was number 8 for the other team in that video was a thug, not an ounce of ability just trying to flatten as many of our players as possible, Pereira has seriously matured this last year; he's a far better team player and his technical ability for his age is brilliant. Seriously reminds me of Coutinho for some reason though.

1243~~~
We've given others chances, including people like Januzaj playing in his position. If he isn't impressing the manager more than Januzaj who's fault is that? Thats not what happened with Pogba. And just because he might be our most talented CM in the reserves doesn't mean that if he is let go, he'll find a new club and become one of the best midfielders in the world like Pogba. Its far more likely that Pogba is a one off.

1244~~~
if we had the same midfield as we did last year, this is a guy who'd be getting far more chances ahead of the likes of fletcher and cleverley. however with the addition of herrera it's been tougher.

i really hope he stays too. i go to sleep every night holding my blankey tight dreaming of wilson, januzaj and pereira playing for us in the future. my wife isn't aware of this, but it doesn't concern her.

1245~~~
Probably answered elsewhere but does his contract definitley end in the summer?

1246~~~
Against Liverpool he played on the wing and I believe that it's where Van gaal sees him play, so no he wouldn't have had more playing time because he isn't in competition with the CMs.

1247~~~
yes.

1248~~~
This is very true and stuff what van Gaal would really like, he seems to do for under-21 more of what Herrera does for senior team. I am very pleased with his progress this season. Let's hope we give him chance in the last games of the season and convince him to stay. Still feel he's thinking of moving elsewhere to have more gametime..

1249~~~
I dont like him playing off the forwards as a no.10, particuarly since he's stepped up a level from our youth teams to the reserves, I think he's better playing a little deeper, he's so inconsistent minute to minute playing higher.
If I were him I would actually leave United and try to get regular games to develop, unless he's specifically been told he can go on loan next year.

as Casienma says, I'm another who would love to see Januzaj, Wilson and Pereira as the corner stones of our side for the next decade.

1250~~~
Just because he played like 15 minutes on the right against Liverpool doesn't mean he isn't viewed as a CM. He played the MK Dons match centrally so he is obviously seen as being able to play centrally and he usually plays centrally for the u21s. Young players often play multiple positions and are usually thrown out wide when breaking into the first team. Him playing wide against Liverpool really has no indication on what position he is viewed at by van Gaal.

1251~~~
He said that he sees himself as a wide attacking midfielder, though.

1252~~~
He also said first he sees himself as a 10 and he has said before that he likes to play as an 8 too.

1253~~~
Basically he says that he is willing to play everywhere as long as he plays. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1254~~~
Would be great news if he stays. Same as Gribbin.

1255~~~
He's not half bad defensively, I think he can be a better CM than an AMC or a playmaker playing on the wings

1256~~~
Haven't seen a lot of him......what player would people compare him to?

1257~~~
He's definitely a cm. He's only playing out wide because players in the youth team tend to play a lot of positions sometimes depending on which players are available to play.

1258~~~
Has he signed yet?

1259~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p-FzK5YVhwk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I bet everyone on here would want us to sign him after watching that video if he was playing for another club. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1261~~~
So is he still a new Pogba?

1262~~~
Haha, little did you know he was more than likely LITERALLY sitting at a table signing as you typed that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1263~~~
0:48. That passed was weighed to perfection.

What player would you compare Andreas to? Which player does he have a similar playing style to him?

1264~~~
To be honest with you, up until last season I thought he didn't have a future here. He was being shoved out wide and I always thought he didn't have the pace or the trickery to be really dangerous and he faded away in matches but then come up with a brilliant goal.  But this past year under van Gaal he's progressed so much, his passing, the way he utilities the ball, decision making and his all round game has really improved and now he participates much more in everything our side does even when he's being played as a wide attacking midfielder. If I were to compare him to one of our current players I think it would be Mata, but much stronger and energetic.

1265~~~
He is more Herrera than Mata.

1266~~~
Glad that's sorted out! Looking forward to watching to break into the first team next season

1267~~~
I'll be honest, before this season it looked like his development is stagnating and I certainly didn't expect to see him around the 1st team.  
But LVG saw his quality and brought him in the first team squad and since then he has improved a lot. I honestly think he's one of the our most improved players this year. Hopefully he keeps it up in the future, he will become a great player if he does.

Great to see him sign a new contract!

1268~~~
Pereira was doing well since the absolute start of the season, before he got to play in the first team. A shift in position is what ultimately helped him. Last year he played as a 10 and this year he spent most of his time deeper in cm.

He's played consistently well this year as opposed to last year

1269~~~
He is a fantatsic player. I remember watching that youth indoor tournament in Zürich, he was techncially a joy to watch, one of the best players in the tournament. Glad he sidgned, now hopefully he can take the next steps.

1270~~~
Great news!

1271~~~
Always wondered - is 99Corrigan a member of the board?

1272~~~
I'd probably say Thiago - in that he is capable of playing as a #8, #10 and could possibly even sit deeper as a #6. On top of that, he's got a great eye for a pass, is two-footed, is a great dribbler, plays with a lot of flair, scores a fair amount of goals and has even played out wide on occasions.

1273~~~
Really had come leaps and bounds this season. Hope he establishes himself here

1274~~~
Looked to have quite a bit of quality when he came on vs MKDons its a shame he didn't get much more first team minutes, but hopefully he win next season.

1275~~~
if he gets his positioning better and overall defensive play he will be a complete midfielder. I'd like him to play deeper as his long range passing reminds of Scholes' but on the other hand he has great shot and eye for pass in the final third, maybe he can arrive in the box late.. 

well it will be interesting how van Gaal develops the lad, he has a big chance to make it here..

Januzaj, Pereira, Wilson, McNair, Pearson that sounds pretty good and I didn't even mention other players from the academy. Our u18 squad is full of great talents.. Would be fantastic to see the team being built around them one day..

1276~~~
Looked like he might be coming on before Smalling got injured, I wonder who he would have replaced.

1277~~~
I think he was going to warm up along with Wilson, then Smalling went down.

Hopefully if Chelsea sort it out tomorrow he will get some game time against Arsenal and Hull.

1278~~~
Unlikely to be around for the Arsenal match and definitely wont be around for the Hull match. The Brazil under 20s fly out for the under 20 World Cup next Saturday

1279~~~
We'd still be possibly chasing 3rd also.

1280~~~
Ah, didn't realise he was heading off for that.

1281~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-youngster-andreas-pereira-9231417" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester Evening News</a>

1282~~~
Great attitude.

Hope he goes out on loan next season, especially if we're further strengthening in midfield.

1283~~~
Good man! Hopefully he can make an appearance in the final two games of the season.

1284~~~
I'll be surprised if he goes out on loan. Image one of the reasons he signed was that he would be more involved with the first team.

1285~~~
Yeah, I'm always split on these decision to be honest. At the beginning of this season, after we signed AdM, I thought Januzaj should go out on loan as well.

I guess I have it fixed in my head that the 18-21 age is key for development. i.e. if you're not guaranteed minutes, it's best getting minutes in a different league etc. But I guess there's a ton of development happening by just being around the first team as well.

Guess we'll see.

1286~~~
Mitten said he would go on loan abroad while Lvg wanted him to go in England iirc.

1287~~~
A lot of rumours about him going on loan next season. PSV seems like a good place to go, if they give him a enough playing time that is.

1288~~~
Not too worried about whether he goes on loan or not. I think at that age they can afford a season of limited chances, as long as it doesn't stretch to more than a season. For example, I don't think this season will have done Januzaj any harm, but <i>next</i> season it's much more important that he either plays fairly regularly or goes on loan.

Consider that we offloaded Anderson and Fletcher this season, and Cleverley looks likely to go this summer too. Even with one likely incoming central midfielder (Gundogan, if the rumours are anything to go by), there's a good deal of room for a young CM in our squad. I'm hoping Pearson will also be around next season too, pressing his case to be Carrick's successor, unless a Premier League loan spell presents itself. That would leave us with CM options looking like this:

Carrick
Blind
Pearson
Gundogan
Herrera
Pereira

Which seems about right to me.

1289~~~
He's already met up with the Brazil under 20's for the world cup so wont be available

1290~~~
Going abroad screwed up Macheda. It doesn't mean that would happen to Pereira but I would prefer to see him loaned out to an English club.

1291~~~
Sounds about right until you realise we also have Fellani.

1292~~~
From the clip he reminds me a little of Kaka

1293~~~
Wonder why he aint playing today for the U21's ?

1294~~~
away on International duty i think

1295~~~
Ahh ok, thanks

1296~~~
More like a Jack Wilshere type, but less influential, his form has been really, really inconsistent over the last couple years in the reserves, but he certainly has the talent burried in there though thats for sure, just needs to put it all together..
I'm still not sure where he'd play for us longterm, I dont think he'll be good enough to get a consistent run in our side as a no.10, where Joyce mostly played him.

Will be interesting to see where LvG puts him, I would say he's more a no.8.

1297~~~
Seems a tad harsh. Do you rate Wilshere highly?

1298~~~
Yea, Wilshere's a good player, just been unlucky with injuries, he's not.. 100% a Wilshere type clone either, it's kinda hard to compare him to someone already in the game, I mention Wilshere in the sense of similarities, can run with the ball, pick out a good pass, great technique, but puts himself about despite being a *technical player*, and can play no.8 or 10.
He's clearly very talented, but I just cant see him breaking into the team and being impressive enough, and consistent minute to minute to stay there as a no.10 for us, not at this point anyway.

Hope that makes sense, it almost did in my head. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1299~~~
He's been anything but this season. Will walk the player of the season voting and rightly so.

1300~~~
First half of the year he was still fairly inconsistent for me, not in total games as a whole, but minute to minute, if that makes sense could do amazing bits and pieces as always, then be eratic with his short passing the next,  second half the season I'd be inclined to agree with you but in full honesty I havent caught as many of the reserve games the last few months than I usually sit down for.

What position do you see him playing for us if he steps up next season?

1301~~~
I could seem him playing a very similar role to the one Herrera fulfils. Like Herrera he has plenty of energy to get about the park, is a good passer, and is a goal threat. I certainly don't think he is at his best as a #10 as he can struggle to influence games from there.

1302~~~
Just realised he will be playing an hour south of Sydney at the end of the month. Will have to take the trip down to have a watch. Will be good to see him in action.

1303~~~
But LVG has rightly clocked that he's not really a central midfielder in any normal sense of the word, which is why I didn't include him. I was thinking exclusively of people who could play the Herrera or Carrick roles.

1304~~~
Are you talking about a midfield 3 or midfield 2?If it's the former then Fellani is definitely a part of it.If it's the latter then having 6 players is overkilled.

1305~~~
If we played without Fellaini, it's a genuine 433. With him, it's not really. <i>Sometimes</i> he's in those central areas, but as soon as we're on the attack he pushes right up into the box to look for aerial balls etc and plays much more like a forward. So that's why I don't include him on that list.

1306~~~
Imagine a holy trinity consisting of Januzaj on the left, Wilson as striker and Pereira on the right. Would be amazing if they could get a chance in the League Cup to play together and see how they handle it in a competitive match.

1307~~~
33 pages and the guy has played like 5 minutes in the first team all season.

1308~~~
Might be a reason for that, have you watched him play much?

1309~~~
I don't get your point.

1310~~~
If you've watched him play in the U21's then you'll know why there's 33 pages on him.

1311~~~
Oh, but he still can't get minutes in the first team.  Januzaj & Wilson look awesome in the reserves too, btw.

1312~~~
Hence their threads are 98 and 56 pages long, respectively.

1313~~~
Another CM didn't get many minutes in the first team either. Anyway the guy is a good talent, and thats why people are talking about him, including LVG.

1314~~~
That's great, but my original point was that we have over 1,300 posts on someone who has barely played in the first team.

Edit:  tbf, it seems about par looking at the other player's performance threads.

1315~~~
away with Brazil u20s so maybe we won't get to see him at all now in the "almost dead rubber" games.

1316~~~
Bumped into him last night. I was wearing a United jacket standing at a set of traffic lights and heard a guy say Manchester and smile, after a second glance, it clicked who it was. Was a nice enough guy and was surprised he was happy to chat a little.

Going to see him play tomorrow when they play Portugal in a friendly. Will be good to see him play live.

1317~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's bloody brilliant. I pictured him as you would a little kid who doesn't know how to speak English but knows Manchester United so just keeps saying Manchester and smiling.

1318~~~
It was a little like that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> but his English was fine for basic conversation.

1319~~~
He is apperantly quite the linguistic genious, being fluent in flemish, portugeese, french, english and spanish.

1320~~~
Just home from watching Brazil v Portugal 20s. Pereira played the first half, everything Brazil did went through him. Such a good performance was disappointed to see him taken off but it was only a friendly.

1321~~~
Brilliant!  

All I can picture is the little Greek kid in the Inbetweeners Movie pointing at Jay's shorts shouting "MANCHESTER".... you didnt throw non-swimmer Pereira into a swimming pool did you?

1322~~~

1323~~~
Good article, hopefully we see a lot more of him next season.

1324~~~
Does he start for Brazil? Bit unfortunate for him if he misses the start of preseason but would expect him to get carling cup games in Herrera's position and if he impresses will get some chances off the bench or cover for injuries.

1325~~~
Starting for Brazil right now, number 18 I think.

1326~~~
Taken off at half time and his replacement immediately scores a wonder goal. Thought Andreas was actually doing quite good but I bet he'll be benched now.

Took a couple corners with his left foot too. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1327~~~
I wasnt surprised he was subbed at half time. He gave the ball away a number of times and just wasnt in the groove. The replacement made a clear impact on the game for the remainder of the half.  Just one of those days where a player is just not quite in tune with the game.

1328~~~
Coming in now for the 2nd half against Hungary

1329~~~
Anyone see how he did?

1330~~~
Done good so far. Just scored on a penalty kick(1-2) Started with a decent shot and got an assist on the following corner(1-1). Tries a few trickeries and have got some FK's out of it. Only negatives i have registered are some unnecessary loss of possession and a poorly taken FK.

Turned the game around for his team now, well done

1331~~~
Cheers. Good to hear. Hopefully won a place back in the starting 11.

1332~~~
Why doesn't he start? Do they have better players?

1333~~~
Would he benefit from a loan next season?
Get some competitive games under his belt and see if he can come back the year after and challenge for a place

1334~~~
He started the first game but had a poor game so it was no surprise he was on the bench for the second game.

1335~~~
Think LVG will surprise us all and see him as a first team member come August?

1336~~~
Haven't watched the Hungary match yet, got it recorded and will watch when I get home tonight. I love how he takes corners with his left foot though, our own little Santi <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1337~~~
Scholes-esque <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1338~~~
A CM with the agility of Pereira who is completely 2-footed is a rarity, for sure. Intriguing.

1339~~~

1340~~~
Haha was a shite penalty tbh, nearly scored a really good goal though. The Brazil keeper for the first goal, wow, seriously poor!

1341~~~
Anybody watch the match? I see they won 3-0 and looks like he may have started, hopefully he has settled into the team again.

1342~~~
Match report says that he came on at half time and got the assist for the third goal.

1343~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OjQfTc0B7U0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Highlights  from the game his assist for the third goal is at 1:33.

1344~~~
The North Koreans are the Africans of Asia. They look like they are in their late 20s or 30s.

1345~~~
Eh

1346~~~
He seems to have a great attitude. I really hope he gets more playing time next season.

1347~~~
Good lad.

1348~~~
Depends how preseason goes, but unlikely in my opinion.

1349~~~
I'm of the same view but given how highly LVG seems to rate the boy...

1350~~~
Came on as a substitute against Uruguay in the Round of 16 game and just scored a penalty in the shootout.

1351~~~
That Brazil side was absolutely dominating and created a lot of chances, something crazy like 40 shots and no goals compared to Uruguay's 8 shots. Poor finishing from everyone really, so many sitters missed.

1352~~~
With him signing the contract (I think the delay was about first team team opportunities)I think he must know that he'll get some game time next season.

1353~~~
Hope he gets the games he needs.

1354~~~
We all want big money signings, we all want the midfield strengthened so as we can compete for the League & in Europe.  In order to do this, our better young players are not going to get much of a sniff.

1355~~~
nobody knows how many players we sign who would compete directly with Pereira for gametime. Buying someone like Schneiderlin would make absolute sense as he would compete mostly with Carrick and Blind for no6 and occasionally as no8 and Andreas could get gametime as no8 backup to Herrera, no10 and here and there he could offer cover for Mata as false right winger even Pereira plays rather from the left. 

For that reason I wouldn't want Gundogan as he would get more gametime from Pereira than Schneids and wouldn't get us better like him. Hope Pereira gets his chances on tour and shows what he can offer. In a full functional team there is always place for one or two youngsters who wouldn't lost there and could make up for their inexperience with their tenacity..

1356~~~
I don't.

LVG has all of this in mind so let's see how he will resolve.

1357~~~
Loan him out. He's contracted now, so get him some game time in a top division somewhere. He'd easily play 30 games in La Liga.

1358~~~
Some comedy gold on that video: 2 candidates for miss of the year at the very beginning, and then the 3 North Koreans falling on top of each other as the 3rd goal goes in.

1359~~~
Malaga or something like that would be decent loan

1360~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rl0nef0fkwM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XALOtDfotIg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

seen some of his highlights from his contribution in the u20 world cup, he looks suddenly quicker and very confident on the ball, not afraid to take-on players, he wasn't doing that often but he played centrally a lot, maybe was too restricted in Warren's side. But his dribbling looks very good, must be that boost of confidence of wearing the yellow jersey of Brasil. 

One thing I am confident he has a great chance to make it with us for is that he is very well rounded and versatile player capable of playing anywhere in front three and more attacking midfield role, he had a great cameo against Dons in deeper role too. Hope he shines in preseason. We should give this guy a chance next season, I don't think player like Gundogan is needed, rather Schneiderlin so Pereira could get minutes as the creative box to box midfielder but who knows what Van Gaal thinks of him in terms of roles on the pitch. We will soon find out

1361~~~
fecker is already dreaming of Real.

1362~~~
Came on at HT again to win on penalties, scoring the first one.

1363~~~
Apparently he played very poorly. A pity, as it might mean he gets less minutes in his next outing.

1364~~~
Just scored a superb solo goal to bring Brazil levellevel inin the final <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1365~~~
What a goal!

1366~~~
In terms of ability, he has the potential to play for United. Now for him it's the consistency and focus that neefs to be 'on point'. Not sure if he gets that in playing u21, where he may not be challenged that much anymore. Hope we transform him into a squad player or a good loan abroad.

1367~~~
Who is no. 18?

1368~~~
gif of the goal?

1369~~~
He's been terrible since he scored mind.

1370~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvUeQsJA3fw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1371~~~
Was that our new keeper in goal for the Serbs ?

1372~~~
Shame. Great goal by the lad though.

1373~~~
No, he was on the bench.

1374~~~
He certainly had an impact. One way or another. Great experience for him.

1375~~~
Can't understand why he was mostly used as a sub throughout the tournament. when he came on he was mostly Brazil's best player.

1376~~~
Need to find a good loan for him under a quality manager in a team which plays decent football,but we are terrible at loans.

1377~~~
Of all our emerging youth players over the past few years, I get the suspicion Pereira has the best shot at becoming a top player.

1378~~~
Watched him play live two years ago in a friendly -- Lawrence and Wilson actually caught my eye more that day, but Pereira will probably have a better career than both.

1379~~~
Watched the vid of the goal on my phone and thought wow, what a goal. Must be a real talent. 

Had no clue it was him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1380~~~
I was a bit confused as well. Must've missed the news he switched from Belgium to Brazil.

1381~~~
He came on at half time a few times which is odd. Perhaps the manager really rated two players in his position. Perhaps there was a little bit of him not being seen as a real Brazilian too. He only switched recently and a lot of the other players have probably been in the set up for years.

1382~~~
I still relate him to that video of when he was 16.

1383~~~
Decent footwork and finish but the defending there is absolutely atrocious.

1384~~~
Must be a bit odd for the Brazilians to import one of their own when they're usually exporting them (Costa, Thiago, Marcos Senna etc).

1385~~~
I did know he was playing for Brazil but just couldn't make out the face in the small screen.

1386~~~
I do think this had an effect.

1387~~~
Great experience for Pereira, despite the loss. Scored a decisive (match-leveling) goal in the final, assisted a couple of crucial goals, came through on penalties. But based on his performances through the tournament, he needs to get a lot more consistent to stake a claim for regular first team football at United. Far too many iffy touches, lapses in decision-making, and cases of frivolous loss of possession. He is some ways behind say the 2013 U-20 versions of say Oliver or Bernat from that perspective. Hope this tournament helps his chances for a good loan deal though. The U-20 World Cup is a great showcase for talent, a lot of good performers go on to have great first team careers for their clubs.

PS : We may have signed the wrong Serbian goalkeeper. Apparently this Rajkovic lad helped the Serbian U-19 win the 2013 European Championship and was one of their most important players, reached the semis of the same tournament again in 2014, and now the U-20 World Cup, where he was named the best goalkeeper and skippered the champions. Has also turned out for the Serbian national team, and about 30 times for Red Star, Vidic's old club - at age 19.

1388~~~
Pogba, Januzaj & Morrison all comfortably better in my opinion. Wilson further ahead too currently.

1389~~~
I would agree. He's undoubtedly talented but, and I hate to use this word, is very raw right now. Needs a lot work if he's to have a chance of making the first team. A loan at a decent European team where he can a get a decent amount of playing time would be the way to go this season.

1390~~~
I think he is at least as talented as all of them but I agree with what has been said, he needs to put it all together consistently to be a top player. He is too slack too often. If he can put it together then he can be one of the best in the world in his position IMO.

1391~~~
I myself think he has more qualities than Januzaj and he has the advantage of already having a position where he will play in the futurw, while Januzaj is still searching. Januzaj is far more experienced tho and in his debut season, focused on what he could. Pereira tries to do everything, while Januzaj focused on taking defenders on, beating them and then put in a cross or a shot.

1392~~~
Nah. Januzaj is quite blatantly a better talent and Pereira's position on the pitch is far from certain either. He's not going to play as a number 8 anytime soon with his sloppy passing and he ain't good enough as a #10.

1393~~~
He aint good enough as a 10? Since when is that? Januzaj is a lot more consistent and less raw than Pereira is, but in the position Pereira plays, he really has it all. He's fast, he's extremely two footed, has a brilliant shot on him, goalscoring ability, great technique, can beat players, has a high work rate, can tackle, he has vision. My main problem with him is that he's too inconsistent, and tries too much at times. And loses focus a lot during matches, these arent small weaknesses tho, but pure talentwise he's a star. But Januzaj is far further in his development.

1394~~~
Ain't good enough to get a look in at United is what I mean. His passing even further forward lets him down too many times. Januzaj's passing and vision was on a different level when he was a regular in the team under Moyes. Consistency isn't the issue not that Januzaj can be described as consistent either. Januzaj just looks far far more talented.

I actually think his best chance of making it will be as a #8 not further forward.

1395~~~
It seems like a lot on here havent actually watched him for the past year and are basing most of their opinions on a couple of games in the u20 world cup. He has actually been very consistent this year since he started training with the first team and his passing is rarely sloppy anymore. In a couple of the games at the u20 world cup he was clearly trying to up the tempo of the games with quick passing as he has been doing with the u21s this season and which has probably been the thing hes improved most this year but his team mates with Brazil seemed intent on only playing at the one pace all the time.

1396~~~
I don't get how Januzaj is far more talented. Pereira can basically do everything.

1397~~~
I think Van Gaal has mentioned this a few times but Pereira is pretty much considered a squad member of the first team now. Also it seemed the reasoning to why he took so long to sign the contact extension was because of the worry of not getting any chances at the first team. You would have to image that with him signing the extension he's pretty confident of getting chances next season.
Yep he's passing he very good in the U21's. Also I have'nt followed the torment really but it seems he's used all over the pitch(Didn't he play as a striker as some point).

1398~~~
This is a seemingly true point. There was some evidence that Pereira was a good passers, with good vision, good from direct free kicks and range, while also being tenacious in midfield. But rather than being naturally great at all those things, every match he's trying to prove again that he's decent at those things. The one thing not in doubt is that he's technically quite sound and fairly confident.

1399~~~
Yeah, you could see him adding a hussle that had been missing from Brazil's game when he came on today. He was really progressive with his passing and looking to force the pace. I thought he had a decent enough impact, goal aside.

1400~~~
Januzaj was consistent under Moyes, for some long periods during the season he was one of our best players week in and out. This season his consistency has gone to non-existent.

Well Pereira has been the u21 standout performer this year and also won the individual prize very deservedly in an u21 title winning side. He's certainly warranted a look in, but rather due to circumstances he hasnt really got a chance. The first team have been shaky all season, and we barely win games comfortably, so ofcourse he doesnt really get a look in. 

Dont know how to word it right but having more qualities isnt per se being a bigger talent, AOC for example has more qualities than Coutinho, Sterling, Eriksen but I think those 3 are far bigger talents. Before you get to be a class player, its important to pick your moments, read the game and focus on what you can, something Januzaj excells in compared to Pereira for me.

1401~~~
Have you watched him for the reserves at all?

1402~~~
Really do think he should be used in rotation with Herrera now. He is ready for first team duties, either that or needs a loan to a good club that he will start at. None of these sides that will be relegation fodder please.

1403~~~
Front four for League Cup games this year (hopefully):

---------Wilson
Depay--Pereira--Januzaj

Very interchangeable.

1404~~~
That seems entirely plausible mate. However, Van Gaal has certain short term sporting targets to meet, especially after spending big amounts of money - with more to come this summer. Which ultimately might mean fewer opportunities (and less margin for error) for the likes of Andreas this coming season. We've seen Januzaj's progression come to a standstill with infrequent first team playing time combined with inconsistency (which Van Gaal often abhors), so I'm a bit wary of the whole situation recurring.

If the likes of Pereira aren't regularly turning out for the first team, Louis will inevitably stick them in the reserves, which isn't the greatest level of competition by all means (as opposed to a season long loan at say PSV - who are expected to contend for the title, and play a similar scheme as Van Gaal under Cocu). On some levels, retaining players on the cusp of first team football at United does make sense. They'll slowly be integrated into the team, will have a much better understanding of Van Gaal's requirements etc.

But at the same time, this is a very critical stage in Pereira's development, especially in terms of playing time. He is going to turn 20 this season, and sitting on the bench (like he did last season) or turning out for the reserves won't really push him forward. Not discounting either scenario (retained - most likely vs loaned), but sometimes a good loan move can help a player find his bearings, become more consistent, and gain more confidence in terms of playing first team football. 

Like Pique for example, who really progressed in his time at Zaragoza, or Wilshere at Bolton, Evans at Sunderland, Kroos at Leverkusen, even Welbeck at Sunderland for that matter.

<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> Cheers mate should have checked there.

And...wow.

1408~~~
Awesome goal!

1409~~~
That is just bullshit, why would you like to exaggerate like that? Is Fosuh-Mensah more talented than James Wilson or Sam Johnstone? they are different players, having different talent. Pereira is very versatile and could play almost any position, has certainly better shot than Januzaj and I feel his footwork is also better, more dynamic and better working player, Januzaj has a great vision and directness in him both are great playmakers but from different positions, they need also different positions o play in right now, Pereira will eventually play deeper than Januzaj who will later be used as free roaming attacking player I feel.
And consistency certainly is the issue, it is a must have attribute to become regular first team player.

Januzaj is slightly better and more settled player in A team, older and more experienced, that's true but he stagnated while Pereira got a sniff in the first team and maybe next year he will have a breakthrough season.. but one does never know judging players is always tough when they are in different stage of development, is Odegaard better than Hazard? Both Januzaj and Pereira are great talents, time will tell but the former is definitely not much more or far far more talented.

1410~~~
Just got back from the game. Thought he had an immediate impact, caused the Serbian side a lot of problems. Then he made 3 poor cross pitch passes and shortly after that was moved forward and got far less ball. Not sure why the coaching staff moved him forward as he was doing a lot of talking and directing in the middle. I had great seats and could hear and see him really well. I also saw him a couple of times tell a team mate to move into spaces 2-3 passes before Anders got the ball and then get frustrated when he got the ball and his team mate wasnt in position. 
I have seen him live in a few of these games and thought that he wasnt playing as well as he could but saw enough tonight to believe he has the ability to become a very talented player for us if the stars align for him. Live his footwork, speed of thought and movement is much more impressive than tv footage I have seen of him.

1411~~~
I would argue that the Januzaj situation is a bit different (Januzaj has been a bit shit this season).But Van Gaal has shown a number of times this season that even when the pressure's is on he is willing to play youth players. And now already now Van Gaal has said he will be taking youth players on the summer tour(Rumours of a couple of U18's players going)And this summer tour is more important than most considering we've got CL qualifiers coming up. Lack of opportunities won't be a problem with Van Gaal as manager 

Yep to have a state of flux situation where a player is clearly too good for U21's but getting no game time is a concern(It's really the situation with Januzaj now)but it would on the player to turn it around, Januzaj did get chances this season but didn't take them(Not for the lack of trying mind)and Mata/Young did. As for understanding of Van Gaal's requirements. Pereira has trained with the first team for pretty much the whole season and being picked a couple of times this season. So that shouldn't be a problem 

I'll be honest I'm not a massive fan of the loan system.The main reason being your first point,managers tend not to pick young players when the pressure is on and almost always fall back on 'experience'. Is this different in Holland, I haven't got a clue but PSV will be in the CL this season and trying to defend their league title, the pressure will be on. Also if Pereira talented enough to get into United's first team and make a difference.

1412~~~
Very good goal. Almost certain we'll see a fair chunk of him this season.

1413~~~
You can tell from the way he moves that he's a very, very good player. Skilful, strong and precise. I like him even more now!

1414~~~
Why didn't he even start the final for Brazil u20s? We all knew he had moments like that in him, we've seen it at reserve level, but why isn't he even starting a big match for that team?

1415~~~
Fair enough. Here's the thing though - while Januzaj has been inconsistent for the first team, and Pereira has been mint for the reserves (by and large) - the step up in terms of quality on a week by week basis is substantial. What happened with Januzaj this season in terms of below par decision-making and trying entirely too much, might happen with Pereira too given his propensity to take charge, and play with a sense of adventure and artistic freedom. 

And while Van Gaal has an undeniable historical track record of promoting youth team players, and people say that lack of opportunities won't be a problem, the situation at United is very fluid so we can't say anything definitively. Will Van Gaal be willing to provide developmental game-time for Pereira if (hypothetically) we sign someone like Gundogan or Schweinsteiger ? How many first team minutes will Pereira realistically get if we're again struggling to cement Top 4 status next season and all bets are off ? These minor circumstances will invariably come into play, and might inhibit first team opportunities for Pereira. 

Especially on the basis of this year - where Van Gaal evidenced a distinct reluctance to introduce him into the starting line-up, or even use him as an impact sub despite obvious weaknesses in midfield and injuries to Carrick, or Blind, or Herrera at various points during the season (he played just 13 minutes in the league vs Tottenham). In recent times we have seen some talented young players getting buried in the depth charts, and stagnating at a certain level. So I'm a bit concerned for Pereira from that perspective.

Don't necessarily disagree with any of that. But again, there's a degree of speculation at play here. We can't say one way or another if adapting to regular first team action will be a problem for Pereira (or not). What if Pereira doesn't make the most his chances ? It would be unacceptable at United, but some other clubs <i>might</i> be willing to persist with him given thei dearth of quality options at their disposal (when compared with United). That's my sole argument here, though to be fair - it too is speculative in some ways.

That is why I brought up the specific example of PSV. The second sentence of your paragraph is applicable to United, and generally most clubs in the Premier League/ La Liga/ Serie A. But Eredivisie clubs are much more receptive to the idea of persisting with young players, given their weaker resources and lack of experienced options. And that argument is somewhat vindicated by the development of the likes of Klaassen, Kishna, El Ghazi, Sinkgraven at Ajax; or Van Beek, Kongolo at Feyenoord; or Rekik, Willems, Hendrix at PSV who were given regular chances to develop despite inconsistent performances. A good example for a loan deal working out really well would be Arkadiusz Milik from Leverkusen to Ajax. This is someone who couldn't get adequate playing time at the former, but really shone - scoring 11 goals, and making 21 league appearances for the latter under De Boer.

PSV have some weaknesses in midfield and wider attacking areas (Memphis' departure didn't help either), so Pereria would most likely get enough playing time. Furthermore, he has a history with the club having spent 6 seasons in the youth teams at Eindhoven, is familiar with the language and culture, will get the chance to develop and improve under low amounts of pressure, plus Cocu played under Louis and employs a similar 4-3-3 system at PSV - which will help Pereira acclimatize to Van Gaal's requirements, and given the gaffer's close personal ties with both the club's upper management and Cocu, he can keep tabs on Pereira's development. Infact, if I'm not wrong <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> (a PSV fan) stated that they would likely entertain the idea of having Pereira in their team.

Then again, maybe Van Gaal plans on making Pereira a centerpiece for the future, which would render all the loan chatter moot. But loan deals can certainly be super effective under the right circumstances. eg. Oliver at Porto last season because he was a bit inconsistent and maybe slightly light weight for Simeone's liking, Carvajal at Leverkusen from Real Madrid (not exactly a loan deal but a great developmental curve of sorts), Berardi at Sassuolo from Juventus, among other.

1416~~~
The defending isn't great but his touch and balance for that goal are excellent.

1417~~~

<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> 

I think Pereira's lack of gametime this year can't be looked at seperately from the inbalance in our squad. LvG has his own strict ideas about defensive balance and we just lacked defensive midfield options when we moved away from 3 at the back, this combined with the fact we needed top 4 wasn't ideal to let a flair player like Pereira get experience in the first team. Once we have a more balanced selection van Gaal will have more options to use him, wether he's going to is hard to predict as I haven't seen that much of Pereira myself. Normally it shouldn't matter what position a talent plays, van Gaal isn't shy to use them if he thinks they are ready.

I'm sure PSV would take him on loan, they tried to sign him before he extended his contract. Brands said that he would like to attract top talent to the ED and with captain Wijnaldum probably leaving Pereira would have a good chance of playing 1 of the 2 CAM positions. The problem is that Cocu is one of the few Dutch coaches who dares to play counter attacking football and that van Gaal rarely loans out talents. I actually think Wilson, McNair, Januzaj and Pereira will all be here next season because they wouldn't learn football 'the van Gaal way' if they moved elsewhere temporarily. That said, I'd love Januzaj or Pereira at PSV next season.

1419~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> really loves to exaggerate with my favourite of his claims being "Sterling is twice the player Depay is"

I haven't watched Andreas that often apart from a few of our youth games and a couple of his WC games, but from the little I have seen I don't see how Adnan looks more talented than him, let alone "far far".

Cheers mate !

Reading that, part of my argument was predicated on the continued imbalance within our squad. Carrick, our first choice deep lying midfielder is one year older. Blind might be a part of the solution when it's all said and done; but and even apart from him, we are yet to fully address the defensive frailties in the squad. Will the incoming additions this summer be of requisite quality to remedy that lack of balance from the get go, and as a consequence bring younger, more adventurous members of the squad like Pereira into the equation without jeopardizing the defensive structure of the XI ? Hope so, but there are still some ways to go from that regard, and it will very much be a work in progress, which makes me kinda skeptical.

1421~~~
"Far far" was a double type but Januzaj is comfortably more talented in my view. And he looked a lot more talented when he played in the reserves when compared to Pereira.

1422~~~
It was Serbias only lapse for the night, they were brilliant defensively throughout the game. Therefore I put it in the Pereira brilliance.

1423~~~
Brilliant goal, imagine if Messi scored that goal the whole world would lose their shit. 

Hope he gets more game time next season, very promising youth.

1424~~~
Makes you think who else in our squad could score that sort of goal?. Di Maria or januzaj maybe? Nani too I guess.

1425~~~
Depay !

1426~~~
great goal, hope he gets chances this season

1427~~~
I can see why they called him the new Messi.

1428~~~
Here's some video of the game. His goal is at 0:49.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.lastminutegoals.org/2015/06/20/brazil-u20-vs-serbia-u20-highlights/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lastminutegoals</a>

1429~~~
What a goal! Love this kid... Cant wait to see how he does in the States on tour.

1430~~~
He'll smash up the tour and become a starter for us.

1431~~~
this is the best signing we made...keeping this lad will bring huge rewards. He also has the common sense to want to sign for us even if he could have had immediate rewards elswhere.

1432~~~
Hope fans are patient with him. He has moments of pure brilliance and moments where it all goes wrong. There is a ton of talent there but hopefully we dont push him too fast too early but still give him decent game time in the league cup etc.

1433~~~
i think the last 20 minutes of normal time + 30 minutes of extra time during the final kind of sums up the player pereira is at the moment.

a brilliant solo goal, plus some brilliant passing, skills and link up play, but 3 poor cross field passes to his teammates. agree he got bags of talent yet we have to be patient with him. hope he'll get his chance to impress at the US tour too.

1434~~~
Considering he's only just started his summer break, is it even reasonable to expect him to go on tour?

1435~~~
should be back in training in 4-5 weeks time, maybe..are we still in the US by then?

1436~~~
Don't think the tour starts for another 4-5 weeks.

1437~~~

Vote Andreas! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1438~~~
it's essential that he does. it's so important for players to be involved right from the off, especially for young players trying to break into the first team.

1439~~~
Yep we saw how lingard impressed on tour and got his chance, hopefully pereira gets that chance too.

1440~~~
Hopefully he breaks through this year. Would be nice to have another product of the academy in the first team.

1441~~~
He's saying all the right things in the press as well, hope he gets a good go!

1442~~~
Will this guy go on the tour with us if hes just played a major tournament at his level?

1443~~~
He'll probably join slightly later on or something.

1444~~~
I like it... Four very talented youngster ready for first team action

1445~~~
That's the 4 I want to start the domestic cup games.

1446~~~
Or even add Lingard in there <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1447~~~
If he wants any chance of breaking into the first team this year he will have a normal 2 week holiday and return!

1448~~~
I dont know if he is yet ready for the first team, a loan spell might be a good option after xmas

1449~~~
I think he's ready for minutes, but perhaps not difficult away games. I would certainly prefer giving him time in midfield over dropping Rooney back anyway. We need to test these players and see if they will sink or swim.

1450~~~
Considering the amount of times he was involved on the bench, van Gaal obviously sees something he likes, so with the added game, he should make at least 10 appearances in my opinion.

1451~~~
if he is going to spend most of the time on the bench and only make 10 appearances then he would probably be better off with a loan where he plays regularly

1452~~~
I agree but the loan would have to be somewhere in Europe, not the Premier League or Championship, I can't see a club using him at the bottom of the Premiership. I would rather 10 appearances at United than 10 in a relegation battle. If they can get a move somewhere in Europe, that would be best though, I agree.

1453~~~
He really does look like a potential star.

1454~~~
Very exciting so far.

1455~~~
Think he'll get plenty of playing time this season... Huge prospect

1456~~~
Looked very good so far.

1457~~~
This guy is a talent, a real talent. Reminds me so much of Iniesta the way he plays.

1458~~~
Will he get a chance soon I wonder?

1459~~~
Aye, with Fellaini back and Herrera seemingly struggling to get minutes, maybe we should be looking at loaning him out?

1460~~~
No point in loaning imo. We lack in numbers up front and he will get his minutes, I hope.

1461~~~
I hope so, though Januzaj struggled for minutes last season too iirc. Thoug understandably we were extremely top heavy.

Let's wait and see.

1462~~~
Wouldn't he just be competing with Herrera for a spot on the bench?

1463~~~
If he's not going to get any minutes besides the odd cup game, he needs to go out on loan.  Thought he looked better than Januzaj during our preseason.  Appears to be a forgotten man now.  Will only get worse for him as Fellaini makes his way back from suspension.  He's not even making the bench as a sub as is.

1464~~~
If we have to watch our frontline falter, I would rather see him get minutes to develop.

1465~~~
Would like to see him on the right, Mata behind Chicharito, and Depay on the left.

1466~~~
Soooooo....with Januzaj and Hernandez gone, will this lad now get some proper game time?

Looked good in pre-season, better then Januzaj in fact, but hasn't been since the season started, with Januzaj getting the minutes instead.

What do we reckon?

1467~~~
Hope so, see no reason why not

1468~~~
We're so light on attacking numbers that he should get plenty of games this season. We only have three senior wingers like.

1469~~~
Hope he gets a chance and really makes good on it. It's a bit bizarre to not see him on the bench at all yet after a very promising preseason.

1470~~~
Play him centrally. Whether that's at #10 or behind as an #8 but I really don't want to see him shafted out onto the wings. Yes he's a good dribbler but he doesn't have the pace and his fantastic vision would be wasted out wide.

I reckon if we gave him a chance at #10 and said we had confidence in him there even if he doesn't start out amazing (I see him as a player who can definitely try too hard to impress) he'd absolutely flourish.

1471~~~
I just find it strange that he's not even been making the bench, while Januzaj has been starting and is now loaned out.

<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1472~~~
We're all myth'd

1473~~~
Looks like he'll get a chance to make a breakthrough this year. For the league cup matches, it would be interesting to see a front four of:

-------------Perreira-----------
Martial-----Wilson---------Depay

1474~~~
I don't think that's a coincidence with Januzaj. He was tested to see if he was ready and Van Gaal thought otherwise. Sure he did the same at the beginning of last season as well (with other players).

1475~~~
Seems to have been using competitive games as trials. Nothing surprises when it comes to LVG.

1476~~~
So will Pereira now be tested? If he 'fails' does he get loaned out too?

Surely he's the one that actually needed to be tested, as Januzaj is actually proven (somewhat) at PL level.

1477~~~
He's not proven as a number ten in this system though. 

I have no idea what will happen with Pereira (obviously) but I seriously doubt we'd loan him out now. We're too short on numbers for that.

1478~~~
This is the wrong thread by the way. Discussion should be in the 15/16 performances thread.
