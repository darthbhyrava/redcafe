He's back.

2~~~
It's great to have him back.

3~~~
Fletch Lives!

4~~~
Really impressed with his 2 showings thus far. This role in this formation really suits him. Fingers crossed he can stay fit and healthy.

5~~~
He looked good.

6~~~
Love him! Please stay healthy and strong. He will be valuable to our campaign when he stays healthy.

7~~~
I think Van Gaal is the right guy for him. There is no sentimental there that Ferguson and Moyes would have showed him due to his health problems.

Reports of Van Gaal pushing him and making him do more running.

8~~~
I'm trying not to get my hopes up that he'll get back to this 2008-11 form, but the signs are looking good. First full pre-season he's had in how long, could do wonders. One thing is clear, if we had a Fletch that was 5 years younger, I wouldn't be fussed at all about missing out on Vidal.

9~~~
For me, I don't think I can personally consider him back anywhere near his best level until we've seen him in a prolonged run in the team, where he is really contributing, instigating the attacks by feeding the ball into the number 10 consistently. He needs a Carrick 2011 moment where he capitalises on the chances he takes and doesn't look back to his worst (well for a good 2 years or so anyway - following on from the Carrick example).

I've been reading a few things about his particular operation which sound promising, but I look to a similar player who was at a similar level in 2010 and wonder how long it will last. Nani being the example, where he takes one hit and he's finished again for another 6-12 months. Fletcher obviously seems stronger mentally which is a massive boost.

Either way if we're shifting Fellaini and Anderson being useless, a midfield quartet of Fletcher, Cleverley, Herrera and Carrick needs one more for a little bit more help.

10~~~
Thought he was poor in the first game and last night played the easy ball but was never pressed when in possession, which his weakness due to the number of touches it takes him to control a ball.

11~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> can a passing mod thread ban this eejit?

12~~~
Your quote of start him over Herrera in CM should be sufficient to get you banned. Completely clueless.

13~~~
I think he did okay against Inter, just finished watching second half. Sort of even borderline good-ish okay.

For me his ball control skills are not the main issue, although he is not really a technical player, but he never was. He was so good because of the engine, his stamina and pace, not even pace, but i would say mile coverage and his positioning/choosing when to run. In his best matches, it looked like he is everywhere and while never being particularly pacy he is always on time to tackles, intercept, provide cover or option for pass in attack. This is sort of general fitness skill. And with his problems, he lost a lot of that. I don't know whether he could ever get it back, probably no.
But i still i believe he can be a valuable asset. First of all he is our only DM a player that is a most defensive-oriented. So that's already something. He is clearly loyal to the club and i believe if even to repay the faith United showed him, he will be willing to stay for a squad role, he is also very determined and diligent, with a good work-rate, which makes him very good squad player, you can always rely on him to perform of decent level at least. He is not the sulking type, like some of our "more southern" players.
So, his contract is up next year, United will probably run it down, because with Fletcher there is little, virtually none, risk that he will venture somewhere else in search of a fat paycheck if United will need him. And then LVG will decide whether we need him for 2 more years. I think he could well be a good squad player until 2016-2017.

14~~~
I'll take compliments where I can get them and coming from you...

15~~~
Tbh I don't really care how you take it as your opinion has never counted much to me. - 'ban a poster for questioning Fletchers 1st touch' priceless!!

16~~~
Heh. Yeah, that's why I think you shouldn't post in this thread. Righto.

17~~~
I don't want a bash a player who's been through so much but equally I don't want our midfield depending upon him this season.  IMHO he's not up to it and his supposed £80k/week could be far better utilised.

18~~~
I don't think anyone wants our midfield to depend on him. We're in trouble if we do. Just a shame you can't acknowledge a good performance when you see one. That's the kind of extreme bias that means certain people really shouldn't post about certain players.

19~~~
Wow! Back that horse up! There's no questioning he had a good game last night, it was just not a game you could judge how he will perform in a full blooded PL match, that was my point re: he was not put under pressure when in possession.

20~~~
I think some got carried away with the performance against Inter when you read some of the post-match posts, but there's no denying he's looked sharp and if he keeps healthy he's a decent option in the squad with this system offering more protection.

21~~~
I've said it before and I'll say it again, remember him having a fantastic game or two when he first returned last season (Swansea at OT or something) and everyone got excited saying "he's back"; then he played like absolute horse shit for the remaining games? His performance vs Sunderland at OT made me wish I was on the pitch, because even I could have done a better job than that. Lets not jump to conclusions here, especially in pre season games where the pace is nothing like the Premier League/Champions League. Wait it out first

22~~~
That's the thing though. You can't imply he only did well because it was an easy game to look good in without wondering why Herrera didn't look equally as good? Now he's a player we really will rely on next season. Why did Fletcher find it easier to shine against Inter than he did? (I think Herrera is the more talented player, by the way)

23~~~
Herrera was obviously asked to do more than play the easy ball (nothing wrong with that by the way).  So his job was more challenging than Fletchers and when you try more difficult balls/runs and they don't come off then obviously it reflects on how your game is perceived by fans and alike. 

Anyway, surely even you and I can agree that if Fletcher offers another option in CM this season then that can only be a positive for OUR team?

24~~~
I never really understood why some were so quick to try and right him off. Yeah he had a mixed return, being average/poor in some games to giving some of the better if not best cm performances we saw last season but given the team he came in to, the fact he was coming back from a long illness and no real pre-season there was plenty positives to take away if people were being objective. 

Now he's seemingly a lot healthier, he certainly seems to look like his oldself and the more he trains the more the physical aspects of his game will increase even if they won't quite reach what they were. Either way he's showed that there's no reason he can't be a handy player to have around, able to keep the play moving well and giving a good defensive cover.

I think Fletch will do well with LVG as well, especially in this set up. Although some don't think he tackles enough I've always seen his defensive game being about taking up good positions to press the opposition and either force them back or force them wide where it's harder to get in a good ball. Unfortunately the problem with this is that if other players aren't in the right areas it can fall down, but I think the team will be set up better and his approach will work well.

I'd still like us to bring in another peak box to box player but Fletch, providing he can stay fit, might surprise a few on here I think.

25~~~
Absolutely. And I'll consider the fact you're even thinking this a remote possibility as progress!

26~~~
Now this should be added to Caf history! Lol

27~~~
Moyes wouldn't be able to appreciate  how good Fletch is even he never had health issue.

28~~~
He was good this preseason and I agree with people saying he’s a very good option as a squad player. However, IF we don’t bring another defensive minded midfielder, we will have to rely on him, not only because he’s the best we’ve got in this role, but also because there is nobody else.

Unfortunately, I doubt if he is good enough to play in the EPL on regular basis and we’re asking too much from him, but hopefully I’m wrong.

29~~~
WIll you two get a fecking room?

30~~~
It was good to see him play so well against Inter. Hope he gets back to his best. I reckon he'll play a different role than what he previously did. I expect to become more of a deep lying playmaker controlling the game rather than someone who'd provide energy and steal.  

Also delighted seeing him score the winning penalty.

31~~~
Looking a heck of lot fitter which is great, hope he can carry this form over into the season.

32~~~
Best I've seen him play since his pomp back in 09/10.

Very very encouraging.

33~~~
What a great half from him. Brilliant pre season from our Fletch so far. Just brilliant

34~~~
Some great long balls and movement. One of the best players in the first half for me.

35~~~
Looking very good so far.  Hopefully this means he is over all his injury problems

36~~~
I'm not getting my hopes up yet. But what a story it would be if he got back to his best. It really would be like a new signing

37~~~
Definitely enjoying seeing him play this well - it's pre-season but, can't help feeling encouraged.

38~~~
I know this is a cliche and a bit too early... but he's been like a new signing so far.

39~~~
Looked so much quicker and his passing is top notch. He could be the new signing we've been talking about ages.

40~~~
Captain, leader, legend.

I've said it before, I'll say it again. Between 2008 and 2010 there weren't many midfielders in the Premier League capable of going toe to toe with Fletch. We're set if Fletcher gets back to being the man who stomped all over Milan's midfield in the last 16 of 2010 Champions League. Positive signs so far on this tour.

Fletcher could prove to be as much of a 'new signing' as Scholesy was in 2006/07 if he keeps up this form.

41~~~
Good on Fletch!

People were too negative last season. It takes longer than people realized to rebuild muscle and fitness levels.

42~~~
Obviously this is not nearly as physically competitive as a PL game but his passing and movement has been excellent.

43~~~
His tempo has been good, we really haven't needed him to break up play. 

Strong performance so far.

44~~~
I have to say that was another good performance. (Pogue may have had a point!)

45~~~
Great performance, so glad for him.

46~~~
Closest he's come to replicating his 09/10 form. Very encouraging.

47~~~
Another fantastic performance for him, God, this man went through so much shit you simply have to love him.

48~~~
Fantastic performance, really pleased for him. Hope he can keep this up, I genuinely thought he'd be one of our players to leave this summer but glad he's proving me wrong.

49~~~
He was poor until that goal, then came to life, I hope its an upward trajectory from here.

50~~~
Great to see him in this condition. I'm really pleased for him.

51~~~
So happy for Fletcher after what he's been through, but I do feel that we need a new midfielder still. Fletcher will be great for rotation/backup.

52~~~
Good first half with good passing and penetration with his runs. Quite poor in the 2nd half like most others

53~~~
He's been brilliant. Hopefully he can continue like this because we will need him quite a bit with Carrick's injury.

54~~~
He was just awesome first half and then did alright 2nd half as well though not as good as first.

Would be great to have him fully back, though it's a risk.

55~~~
Was great tonight. Pressing looks to be a key part of our new system, and if Fletch can keep up the intensity he showed there steadily through a season then he could play a big part.

56~~~
Fletch dominated the first half. The changes at half time took the game away from us a bit, which meant Fletch didn't have quite the same influence, but there's been shades of 2009/10 during this tour. Feeling really good about Fletcher going into this season. Glad that the manager has given him the armband in America too. I'm sure Fletch appreciates it as a sign of the boss' faith in him to stay free of illness.

57~~~
Thought he was excellent today and overall on the tour so far, it's very encouraging to have Fletcher showing signs of his best form given our midfield problems. I see him playing an important role for us this season, my choice for the next captain.

58~~~
Good game, although in a start of second half he faded very badly and very quickly. Thanks god it was only a 20 minutes and he was able to recover. Still showing much promise, esp with Ander link-up.

59~~~
Fletcher's done very well in the midfield role, and it seems like he's finally starting to get back to his old self. What amazes me is how good he is, technically, and how good his passing is as well. Defensively, he's improved massively, and his positioning, reading of the game, and awareness of what goes on around him is back to what it was in the past. The captaincy is also bringing the best out of Fletcher as a leader. He has more presence on the pitch as a leader, and I hope he remains our captain as his calmness and consistency will wear off onto the other players. Having him in midfield can bring the best out of Herrera as Fletcher can allow Herrera to play his natural game.

60~~~
His passing was always underrated. If he's healthy I can see him really fitting into Van Gaal's plans.

He looked destined to become United captain before his injury. Might still happen.

61~~~
I've been out for tea, just glancing over the reviews of tonight. In a nutshell, Fletcher, is he back?

62~~~
Basically exactly what I was about to post. He was excellent once again and it'd be great to see him captaining the side with so many having written him off.

63~~~
Nothing would please me more than seeing him continue this form into the new season. If he's fit enough to play week in week out he should be captain too.

64~~~
so glad he's back fit & seemingly on form as well, he was so good for us before his injury, said before if he gets back to anything like that level he is a quality CM.

well, he's captained us several times pre-season, he knows the club as he's been here for years & came through the academy, definitely has potential to be the man for the job!

65~~~
And people were calling for him to be sold, if its one thing they should know is: NEVER WRITE OFF FLETCHER.

66~~~
Have to say he's proving me wrong so far and I've always rated him before his illness.

67~~~
Fletcherinho is back baby

68~~~
Really pleased with how he's going. I was one who doubted he'd ever get the sharpness back to be able to compete at the highest level. He's proving me wrong though, and I'm glad.

69~~~
Passing has been sublime. Have to say though the games are not being played at the pace and intensity that he's struggled with since 2010/11 season.

Been so good on tour it may deter Van Gaal from adding to our midfield... Does that concern anyone?

70~~~
Happy for him.

If he can give us a solid 25+ games it'll be very good.

71~~~
This, I had written him off when he had returned, if he can replicate this in the league then I'll be happy to be wrong.

72~~~
So happy to see him put in a performance like that, really proud of him.

73~~~
We might don't need to worry too much if we fail to sign another new midfield this season if Fletcher can showed his best performance like in 2009/2010.
So far looking very good. He wasn't ready last season. He didn't even play in pre season and had got no time to build his fitness again. Keep it up Fletcher. There is only one Darren Fletcher!!
LVG should stick the captain choice to Fletcher if he's willing to play Fletcher in starting eleven. He is a great role model for youngsters. Never give up and always play for the team.

74~~~
Let's not get carried away here....No matter what, we need another midfielder. Let's not kid ourselves.

Still, great guy, great attitude and great to see him even playing. Our first 6 fixtures are "comfortable" so, I'm very keen to see how he does in proper competitive football

75~~~
Majstic performance today, his mobility has returned and he's showing a passing range that I haven't seen from him before. I'd be so happy if Fletch resurrected his career after his illness.

76~~~
Early days but for me yesterday was like watching a time-warp. Fletcher just looked like his old self in peak fitness. He looked strong, assured, made those darting runs and looked so hard to shake off the ball.

77~~~
Wow, can't believe that was Fletcher. His passing was brilliant and can't believe how great his performance was. Thought he would probably be nothing more that a good squad option but he might have something to say about that. Hope he carries this form into the season.

78~~~
If he can stay fit for majority of the games, I'd give him the captains arm band. He has the experience, the united history and the temperament to be a Manchester United captain.

I've always wanted him to come back and do well and it seems like a lot of fans hopes are now coming true. *crosses fingers*

79~~~
The manager must take some credit too

80~~~
His touch has really improved I felt. He also contributed heavily going forward. Proper box to box performance that was. Brilliant.

81~~~
People forget or never saw just how good a player fletcher was at 15-16, injuries and illness have stopped him being right up there among the very best. Sheer guts and determination has enabled him to keep coming back to a good level.

82~~~
We still need 1 more midfielder unless Van Gaal rates Fellaini/Anderson.

83~~~
Yeah, I remember him being touted as a replacement for Beckham on the right wing. I'm really surprised that Fletcher was underrated at that point, IMO. I guess that's how things worked out.

84~~~
He was never much of a winger though - much too slow. Beckham wasn't lightning, but Fletcher didn't exploit the spaces like Beckham did, nor did he cross the ball as well. When he broke through in the centre of midfield, his short passing and immense stamina made him the quality player he was and now looking to be once more.

85~~~
Who does though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>?

Love seeing Fletcher back, will always be one of my favourite players.

86~~~
Best thing so far this preseason. He's one of my favourite United players and it's really good to see him displaying a bit of the form that made him indispensable in 09. Hope he carries it into the season when the real matches start.

87~~~

88~~~
Wasn't entirely sure Fletch could come back to his best but he looks well on his way to doing that. Fair play, we could really use a player like him at the moment.

89~~~
He's been brilliant this pre season. Played the full 90 all but once I ink, and he didn't play at all in that game, which was probably our worst performance. Let's hope he can keep it up in the speed of the premier league but I don't see why not, he's looked class against some of the best teams in the world.

90~~~
I've never understood those articles. Of course he's fecking pleased.

91~~~
I've been really pleased with him. He's looked closer to his old self recently, long way to go though.

92~~~
He's been brilliant all preseason, nailed on started over Carrick IMO.

93~~~
His ability to switch the play accurately has been a real key factor for us playing so well. Young was talking about how we'd been working on it in training in the post match interview.

He's been improving every game. A complete CM performance yesterday.

94~~~
He was very neat and tidy last night. I only noticed him make one error giving away possession. The majority of his balls were very positive too, rarely passing backwards.

My expectations were skewed reading everyone's thoughts on here after the game though. The way some in the Vidal thread were talking, making it sound like we don't need him now Fletcher is regaining form, made me think he was going to be playing on another level. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm delighted to see him playing well and looking better and better (on the field and psychically). However I'm a long way from being convinced that Fletcher can be anything more than a squad player this season - albeit a very good one. Aside from the fact that I don't think he's good enough yet to play in a midfield 2 of a title winning team week in week out, there's always the worry that his illness could flare up and then we lose him for god knows how long again.

95~~~
Must say, I've been proved wrong somewhat after seeing him against Madrid. As good as I've ever seen him. 

I know it's pre-season and all but still, very encouraging.

96~~~
I thought he had it a bit easy in the earlier games, with lots of time and space, and too conservative in his passing. But he was impressive against Real - almost like the Fletcher of old, putting out fires all over the pitch. From the amount of playing time he's had, it looks like Van Gaal is thinking seriously about him as a lynchpin in the middle.

97~~~
He's been the player of the tour so far for me. He's showing signs of his former self where he was a real asset.

98~~~
It's vital for him now to put his injury problems behind, if he can stay fit, given our starting games he will have a great chance to prove himself in the center of the field.

99~~~
I think some of the criticism of him last season was extremely unreasonable and unjustified. He returned from a debilitating illness that is bound to have an effect on his physical attributes and energy; key components of Fletchers game. He deserved the time to recover and being a consummate professional, a full pre-season where he can get up to speed can make a massive impact.

That said, I am extremely and pleasantly surprised how he's performed on tour. His performance level has been so high, that it's at the extent of being one of our stand-out players so far. He looks mobile, he's a very good foil for Herrera and he looks extremely comfortable under pressure and distributing the ball. That's something that concerned me, as his first touch and technique often deserted him last season. 

He can still be a key player for us, whether we sign another midfielder or not. As it stands, he would be our second choice midfielder for the next three months or so in Carrick's absence and Herrera might take time to adjust to the league. It isn't even a certainty that he would be omitted from the first team if we signed Vidal anyway.

100~~~
Really pleased to see Fletch getting back to something like his best. He could be huge for us this season and a serious candidate for the armband just for his experience and ability to organise. He never stopped talking to the other players, always helping he younger ones.

We still need another CM but still great to have him available and fit again.

101~~~

102~~~
Captain Fletch ?

103~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6mHNpLV7SU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

104~~~
If he can keep the form he's shown on the tour, he deserves to stay for sure. Before this season, he was one of the players I thought wouldnt make it. Fair play to him!

105~~~
Fletch could be such a big player for us this season. He's been brilliant during the warm-up games so here's hoping he stays fully fit for the title race. A serious contender for captain, too. Nothing but admiration for the lad, he has the work ethic, spirit and commitment that our midfield has been lacking in recent years.

Also says a lot that Fergie thought highly of him, and LVG gave him the armband for his first game in charge.

106~~~
Stay ? The lad is in contention for the armband, a genuine contender! I, however, think we ought to look for a young upcoming defensive midfielder to rotate in and out of the side with Fletcher and Carrick because, for different reasons, there could be a time when they are both unavailable. We definitely need cover for both CM positions because I don't rate Cleverley as back up for Cleverley.

107~~~
LVG says his captain will always play no matter what. I'm not sure Fletch can give that guarantee. What I said was that if he keeps his current form, he's one that has a future at United which was not always the case

108~~~
I'll admit I was one of those hoping Fletcher would be let go or moved into coaching this season but credit to him his been arguably our best player so far.

109~~~
Exactly! Great qualities for a Captain and will see some games, but even if we do not sign another CM what about when Carrick comes back.

110~~~
I agree. In games where Cleverley can't play, I don't think we should play Cleverley. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

111~~~
He's been excellent so far on tour... but I'm surprised by just how surprised everyone is by this. He was comfortably our best CM last year, and showed signs of getting back towards the level he used to be capable of. I suppose it is easy to lose track of any good individual performances from last year amongst the waves of mediocrity and general team  shiteness.

Obviously I might not have predicted that he would practically be our best player in pre-season, but I'm not surprised that he's been really good. I think perhaps a lot of people haven't got their heads around the fact that the colitis surgery is an actual cure, and were expecting his physical performance to always be somewhat limited, to never get back to the old levels.

112~~~
Same.

113~~~
fecking hell, Fletcher is playing very well. He's holding his position, protecting the defense, and spraying balls like Scholes, kinda. I'm actually impressed with his passing range.

114~~~
I'm ecstatic about his form pre-season but still feel concerned - he simply doesn't look well to me, and still can't regain the muscle he had before he took his first break. I'd worry about him in PL games, though he may benefit from the extra CB LvG seems likely to pick.

115~~~
Don't what happened there, meant to say Herrera.

116~~~
He's been epic this preseason. He has definitely been one of the major plus points of the tour. I'd give him the captaincy.

117~~~
He has always been a big game player.  Regardless of who LVG chooses to be the club captain, I think he should get the armband today anyways.  He has survived many transfer windows with angry fans calling for his departure , I can't think of any other player who has been through as much shite as him and still come back stronger than ever.  He is a living breathing example of the United Way.

118~~~
Passing has generally been shaky after missing so much time (as it was early in his career) but it was impeccable against Madrid. If he keeps playing out of trouble in tight spaces, moving forward for 1-2's and stretching play when he's got a second to look up, he'll take Carrick's spot next to Herrera.

119~~~
Will be interesting to see if he's preferred to Carrick. His style is more compatible to the 352, imo.

120~~~
If he's unwell, it's nothing to do with the colitis. The surgery effectively cures that. It no longer has any real physical impact on him.

Personally I think he's just done that thing that older players generally have to of maintaining high levels of stamina by dropping off a bit of muscle weight. By that age they're generally canny enough to not need muscle to be strong on the ball, so slimming down a bit tends to be a win-win.

Obviously with Fletcher it's been more a case of not putting all the muscle back <i>on, </i>rather than having to actively lose it.

121~~~
Has he whitened his teeth?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

122~~~
Completely off the pace for the opening 20 or so minutes today, got better after that though. We should still buy someone there but he's a good option to have, good to have him back playing at this level.

123~~~
That's exactly what the problem will be with him. He is a very good footballer no doubt, but I doubt he can play week in week out during the whole PL after such a long time out. 

We need a CM.

124~~~
He was poor. But we have to remember he played 90 mins on Saturday and he looked tired today.

125~~~
We need a new CM but he would hardly have to play 4 games in space of 10 or so days in the Prem right now with us out of Europe as well.

Not to forget he played the full 90 vs Madrid 2 days ago.


Looked tired today and shouldn't have started. Shows LVG trusts him enough already though to start him in the strongest available team time and again or doesn't trust Cleverley enough.

Still that first time pass to Young for that Cheech chance early on was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

126~~~
He was beyond poor today, he must have misplaced 50% of his passes in the first 20 minutes given away possession each time. Arguably our top 3 player throughout the tour but today his head just wasn't in the game. Hopefully this is a once off and he can continue his great form.

127~~~
It shows trust but also a lack of options which is exactly the point.

128~~~
Don't understand why he started. Crazy decision. Reminds me of Rio playing twice a week last season. You just knew he would be awful. Certainly deserved to be substituted at half-time. Having said that, he's had a good tour. Performing well one game a week is fine for us this season. Indeed 15-20 starts in the season would be perfectly acceptable so long as his performances were good enough.

129~~~
Not happy with his performance today. Probably just toot tired after Real Madrid game
or Alonso and Modric are just getting too old which make Allen, Gerrard and Henderson look superior than them. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

130~~~
He certainly looked like a player who just completed 90 minutes a couple of days ago. A lot of tired and misplaced passes.

131~~~
Agree with the comments on here. Not too concerned about the performance really. It was poor but the scheduling of the matches didn't help him. Disappointing that his last tour match was that bad though.

132~~~
Looked tired but still showed signs that he could play a big role for us. Great to see him doing what he is doing though.

133~~~
No I guess he got a tan for the first time. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

134~~~
Difference today was he was pressed when in possession and he can't deal with it. Never has been able to. 

He's been arguably one of the best players pre season but in every other game he's been allowed time on the ball.

135~~~
Yeah, it was another kind of tempo for this match and it showed. 

I'm still reserving judgement until he's tested in competitive matches. I've seen so many players shine in pre-season before only to wither away when the real fun begins.

136~~~
Fletcher has played 90 minutes more often than anyone else on the tour and it showed last night. He was well off the pace and made errors that were shocking based on his form going into the game. However, I'm quite confident with a few days down time he'll be back to his best. I also think, looking at the team, that a lot of them played the occasion and not the opposition: They all desperately wanted to beat Liverpool and they looked nervous all the way up to our first goal. I guess the games last year when Liverpool rolled us up with ease left some mental scars.

137~~~
The different time zones are wrecking my head but am I right in thinking the gap between our last two games was shorter than we would ever usually face? It's still early in the season to expect anyone to play 90 minutes then another game just a few days later.

Obviously, with the season that's ahead of us, recovery times during a packed schedule of games is not going to be an issue!

138~~~
Yeah, its like playing a game on Saturday at 1pm and then another on Monday at 8pm. Not often you get that turnaround, save for the odd hellish end of season fixture pile up.

139~~~
We'll only have a game every 7 days next year. He played twice in 48 hours in severe humidity with a plane journey in between in pre season, when no one is fully fit. Wouldn't read too much into it. He has more minutes than anyone on this tour and has done really well.

140~~~
Yeah and we hardly going to play on a Saturday, then travel and play Monday. Must have been tiring for the lads. And most players would have struggled with the situation Fletcher was in by playing 90 mins Saturday. 

And I don't know why people are saying we shouldn't play him because he can't play 2 games a week. It's like they forgotten a very important fact about next season.

Yes, I still think we should sign another CM. I'm just glad Fletcher has shown a bit of his old form and hope he keeps it up.

141~~~
On game too many I think......looked tired

142~~~
Not really bothered by his poor performance. Didn't watch the game, but considering what he's been through, I doubt he'd ever really be able to play Saturday - Monday for us anyways (not that we'll be doing that anytime soon if ever).

These games are all about fitness and getting used to LvG tactics. Results aren't the most important thing.

143~~~
His first preseason in 3 years. Because of the tour United have had limited preseason training between the games. How many games in the last 10 days and people are passing judgements on his ability to play a couple of games in a row????? mental.

144~~~
He looked very tired. Was a big ask for him to maintain his form against Liverpool after just a couple of days' rest. Having said that, it didn't look good and Herrera was doing the job of two men in that midfield which made him look quite ragged at times. I am just not confident in our options after Herrera and Fletcher. Think Van Gaal will sign a cm and a central defender after last night's horrendous first half. Has he said anything to the press about the display yet? I bet he wasn't happy with most of what he saw.

145~~~
Awful today. He cannot be our main midfielder this year. Too many people went overboard due to our pre season performances and results.

146~~~
Pre-season means feck all.

He can't handle high intensity football and he's going to be a massive burden if he continues to get games.

147~~~
Yep, think people just wanting Fletcher to do well even more-so because of his troubles etc.(not that that's a bad thing) mean people overrate his performances too. Shouldn't be anywhere close to being a starter for us.

148~~~
Fantastic testament to the guy for what he's been through but he is not good enough anymore, he is finished at this level.

149~~~
Vice Captain

150~~~
For sentimental reasons, not footballing.

151~~~
I'm done with him and I'm done with those who defend him. I was adamant in saying that the guy is finished but others were adamant in saying that he can make it here. I don't ever want to see him in a United shirt again, he is a liability to the club and no other club would tolerate this. This situation epitomises why we are in the position we are

152~~~
One game doesn't prove he's finished.

That said, we should never have been depending on him in the way we are. Fletcher being back should've been seen as nothing more than a bonus.

153~~~
He offers little other than sideways passes. Not dynamic enough.

154~~~
Been awful. No getting away from it.

155~~~
been saying this for years.

156~~~
His passing has been nothing short of pathetic. Very lazy casual passes giving the ball away.

157~~~
And yet Herrera came off not him.
Worrying.

158~~~
He's clearly not good enough.

159~~~
Absolutely. Appalling that it's gotten to this situation really. Manchester United, one of the giants of club football, so reliant on Fletcher is nuts.

160~~~
Looks ouf of his depth, unfortunately.

161~~~
I don't think he passed forward once. 

We can't be relying on him.

162~~~
Nope that much is obvious and Carrick I think is 33 now. A midfield purchase is an absolute must.

163~~~
I think he wasn't overrated, it's just Premier League is much, much faster and he can't handle it.

164~~~
Wasn't just on about pre-season, happened last season too when he first started playing more.

165~~~
Absolutely woeful today

166~~~
Finished at this level, would not start for any side in the top 8

167~~~
The poor lad was brutal today. When we quicken our tempo he does not seem capable of stepping the speed of his passing up. He should not be first choice for a club as big as us

168~~~
He did, they just weren't successful.

169~~~
I guess it's easy to look good in pre season games that no other team gave two shits about. He was well out of pace today and also also against Valencia.
SHouldnt start for us I fear.

170~~~
It's sad but it so painfully clear he can't be relied on anymore, he can't pass forwards for starters.

171~~~
Why are people surprised he was left on the pitch? He's our ONLY defensive minded midfielder. He is and will remain first choice until Carrick is back. And Carrick will not be that much if an improvement in this system.

172~~~
He was awful.  Shouldn't be in the team again anytime soon.  Oh wait, we don't have any other midfielders but Fellaini and Cleverley.

173~~~
Not been convinced since the start of pre-season. It's only one real game but the man won't get to that level again. Harsh reality for me.

It's never been so obvious that we needed more than one midfielder...and our best one was substituted off today which is even more alarming.

174~~~
Very poor from Fletch. Slow,cumbersome and how many times did he give the ball away? Ffs!

175~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

176~~~
Shelvey and Ki are better midfielders than him. Simple

177~~~
Just doesn't do the basics of a holding midfield role well enough. If you aren't tracking midfielders supporting the frontman, why are you on the pitch

178~~~
Vice captain <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

179~~~
Worrying he's been given the vice captaincy.

180~~~
He was shit. We need to buy more midfielders.

181~~~
Bloody awful today but you need to ask who else do we have that can do a better job?

182~~~
I don't think they were casual or lazy; I thought he couldn't cope with the game and was flat out.

183~~~
What everyone said at the end of last season - he is finished at Premier League level.

Like Young, he seems to have fooled everyone on the back of pre season performances.

184~~~
Until Carrick is back I can see him playing plenty, unfortunately.

185~~~
I thought Young did well today. The 2nd goal was his fault but he's not a left back, so it's not surprise. He did well in tackle and run. And his crosses have been so good today. I only see one bad cross from him. 
Fletcher was poor today.

186~~~
Fletcher is not good enough to play for Man Utd.

187~~~
Hopefully those who thought he was back to his best got their wake up call s today. It's unfortunate to say but I think he's best days are gone.

188~~~
Cleverley or Fellaini should be starting with Herrera. If we had other defenders I would even say Jones could play there.  Fletcher shouldn't be playing for the club.

189~~~
As a few of us said during pre-season, the pace and intensity of the PL will be the test and he looked well short of it today.

190~~~
Said it before and i'll say it again, great he's recovered from his illness, i wouldn't wish any harm on any human being, but from a Manchester United pov how is it good news? A starting 11 with Darren Fletcher in is not great, try and imagine yourself as a City/Chelsea fan, United are playing one of those teams, you saw Darren Fletcher on the team sheet i'd be loving it.

191~~~
Worst player on the pitch by some distance. Needs to wake up.

192~~~
He wasn't great today at all. I didn't understand some of the positivity about him during preseason; he was almost being made out to be our new midfield saviour. He looked well off the pace today.

193~~~
He was horrendous. I don't think he's up to it personally.

194~~~
Worst player on the pitch today. Every time he touched the ball he slowed the play down and when he passed the ball it went backwards.

195~~~
Either he just doesn't have it in him anymore or he's seriously ring rusty. Hopefully it's the latter, one things for sure though the Fletcher of a few years ago would have gotten stuck in far more there today.

196~~~
This is why we are where we are. Fletcher is a great guy, he came back from a serious injury so lets make him vice captain and automatic starter. Which other top club would do that for feck sake. Sentimentalism is ripping us apart.

197~~~
That is the biggest worry. Fletcher hasn't been great really since he came back yet he is still one of our better midfielders. We just don't have any quality in the area at all

198~~~
His main asset was always his energy and drive. Now that he's not what he was physically we seem to be hoping he can turn into a deep-lying playmaker type and I don't think he has the quality for that.

If we are aiming to win trophies he should be third or fourth choice and not a first team starter.

199~~~
Thought he was ok but faded away badly in the 2nd half, both goals came from bad tracking from the midfield but I haven't checked in depth who was at fault.

200~~~
completely agree.

201~~~
Anonymous, but where were the passes into midfield from our defenders?

It looked to me like the defenders were getting pulled out of position and were just moving it side to side.

In the second half the tactic changed to going down the wings and kicking it long to Fellaini, so Fletcher was bypassed intentionally for long stretches.

202~~~
Oh dear! So promising in pre-season then a really shocking performance today. His last 20 mins were almost comically bad. A gutless display too, handing responsibility to Blackett and Smalling again and again.

203~~~
People who say Darren Fletcher is a great role model too, stop talking out of your arse.

Fletcher is a role model to no one, if i was a young kid starting out, there are many pros i would look up to but not Darren Fletcher is not one of them.  I just really do not know how:-

1) he's on Manchester United's pay role still the amount of games he's started last 5 years
2) how he starts when fit
3) how he's vice captain.

204~~~
I agree. I think it's a-lot of sentiment on here and people desperately wanting him to make it, that is clouding judgements.

205~~~
Shocking today, Fellaini was much better even when sitting.  I am not sure why Fletcher seems to be the answer, vice captain too.

I hope I am wrong - but It's hard to see him being good enough for us again.

206~~~
He should be fourth choice central midfielder at best. We need at least one more midfielder in stat or we'll struggle this season once again.

207~~~
I think that's partly down to Fletcher not being great at making himself available though. He does like to stand around and point when defenders have the ball, instead of dragging his marker away or finding space where he can receive the ball. Towards the end he was seriously struggling physically, under hitting passes and so on, which might explain the bypassing of the midfield (well that and Fellaini being on the pitch).

208~~~
Underhit so many passes that I was ready to throw my remote into the tv by the end. The kingpin in a listless display for me.

209~~~
1) Because he had a medical issue which threatened his career - nobody is going to buy him with that being a factor, and we'll at least be decent enough to let him see out his contract - there's more to football than winning every match at all costs.
2) because Carrick is injured
3) because it matters very little, the main captain is what matters.

210~~~
He was giving 100% in pre-season while the opposition was probably going at about 70%. That's why he stood out.

In a proper game, it's painfully obvious how hopeless he is these days. We're not in a position to carry him, he shouldn't be playing for us.

211~~~
He wouldn't be a United player now had he didn't have his illness. We should have replaced him after 2011 and move on.

212~~~
None of them is an upgrade over the others,  put it this way. Would any of them get a game at Arsenal,  City, Chelsea or even Liverpool.

I would even go  further and say I would highly doubt the would get that at Spurs and maybe Everton.

213~~~
That 5 yards pass he hit about 3 yards and failed to reached one of our players was tragic.

214~~~
What are you on about pal? Fletcher is a model professional. A valid role model for any of the young guys looking to make a career at United.
 ----
Poor performance from him today, just don't think we can rely on Fletcher to be a solid starting midfielder for us any more unfortunately. I think he still has some value to us as a squad player though and a good senior influence on the dressing room. If Vidal or whoever doesn't happen I would get De Jong in to partner Herrera.

215~~~
Yeah I think it's better to have De Jong starting next to Herrera because when you are creating feck all it's better to have a solid outfit that doesn't concede avoidable goals like Swansea's first. Imo Fletcher has lost the dynamism and the power to effectively screen in front of the defence, such a performance against City or Chelsea it could get real messy.

216~~~
Not anywhere near good enough. The sooner Carrick is back, the better.

217~~~
Ah yeah our good old Carrick. One of our worst performers last season, 33 years old and back from a bad ancle injury in about 2 months. I can see him saving our season.

218~~~
I thought he did very well. Not pre-illness Fletcher but comfortably better than any other midfielder in the squad would have / did aside from Herrera.

219~~~
Better ball player than Fletcher, and he could cover the back and create space for Herrera. I definitely can see him saving our midfield, if not the season.

220~~~
I'm so happy he's come back from his problems with illness but I predicted he would get found out in the Premier League. He's no more than a squad player anymore to go along with Carrick Cleverley & Fellaini. They should be struggling to get games not starting. Too much is being put on Herrera partnering him with these players.

221~~~
He is gonna come out one of the bests on couple of matches but for the most part he is gonna be average or anonymous. I don't expect a lot from Fletcher, Cleverly and Carrick

222~~~
I will cry if he starts against Sunderland

He isn't even good enough for Crystal Palace.......he's a nothing player nowadays....it's harsh but it's the truth

223~~~
Let's wait and see. I don't think he will save anything anymore. He was bad last season and considering his slow starts EVERY year and his injury right now, I'm not sure what and when he is supposed to save us.

And who shall we start instead? Cleverley who didnt even look good in pre season? Fellaini that moron? We have feck all in CM.

224~~~
Yeah unfortunately I concor. I was just shocked that so many on here believed he was going to be the same player as before. Preseason is a very different scenario to actual competitive football. Sentiment is one thing, but at the end of the day, no player should be playing if they simply aren't up to it.

225~~~
At least Cleverley can pass the ball to the our players...also his passes are 90% sideways

The PL tempo is too high for Fletcher and he's useless

It's a great story that Fletcher is back on the football pitch.....but his time is over at Old Trafford

226~~~
Don't think his time is over. But the lad played about every pre season match and now this game as well. I don't think he can handle that much game time. He looked on his last legs.

He will still have a role to play but he shouldnt be the main man in our CM alongside Herrera. Neither should that be Cleverley, Carrick or Fellaini.

227~~~
He was absolutely awful. Great in preseason where teams played at pedestrian pace but struggled big time against a proper full of running priemier team.

That's not to say that he's finished or anything but it's pretty daft of the club to go into the season with us being hugely reliant on a guy who looked unfit for this league when he played in it last season.

228~~~
Agreed.

229~~~
I think someone else said that "Fletcher has played 100% in pre-season and other players have played with 70%".....that's the reason why he has looked so good in the last weeks
Like said i love Fletcher and it's a great story but he shouldn't be Manchester United player anymore

But he's vice-captain....i think that shows Van Gaal has big plans with him and i don't understand that

230~~~
I said it in pre-season, that you don't know what you can expect from Fletch game on game and shouldn't be relied upon,  and was criticised at the time due to him putting in a couple of displays, but again today we saw him put in another woeful performance, he can't be relied upon as a starter.

231~~~
That's very harsh.
But as far as this vice captain thingy goes: That's meaningless. If Rooney or Fletch don't play someone else will be the captain.

232~~~
It hurt seeing him out there.

I tried telling the usual "I'll go into this thread with the opposite opinion of everyone else just for the feck of it"-crew that he's nowhere close to being able to hack it at PL level at his current physical and mental level.

Even against a below average PL side today he was woefully found out. Imagine when we're actually going to have to do actual defending for large amounts of the match?

233~~~
I don't think i'm harsh
The loss wasn't just his fault today...but he was a big reason....our midfield was awful and he has offered nothing at all (or you can tell me what he has done)

I mean it was just feckin Swansea's midfield today <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

234~~~
Herrera's best games have come when he is the main playmaker from midfield, i saw him many times asking for the ball and it going wide time after time. Maybe we should try Fellaini (hopefully Vidal) Herrera combo next match.

235~~~
Not enough brave and aggressive to rule the midfield. You can't expect highest United level, not anymore I think.

I'm sorry but he degraded and it shouldn't be a secret... not after his terrible illness which is not his fault.

FA/Capital One Cup level with all respect to this great, loyal and intelligent human being.

236~~~
Think a lot of the comments about Fletch are needlessly negative. Fletch had a bad first half but looked good at the start of the second. He dropped off when Herrera was replaced. Understandably, because Fellaini was so high up sometimes Fletch was alone trying to cover midfield.

237~~~
Choosing from Fellaini, Cleverley and Fletcher is grim like. We need two midfielders at least, we really do. Someone like Vidal and then a bargain on the cheap (De Jong or the like).

238~~~
It's his illness it's robbed us and him of his prime. Sad but true should be nowhere near our starting 11 but then it highlights our strength of midfield player. Not his fault wish other players had this boys heart.

239~~~
Tell me, is it me or he is to blame for both goals? The first one he was jogging back far far away from action, the second one he was covering nobody. 
Genuine question, because IMO these are his areas to cover, or am I wrong?

240~~~
I love the guy and I don't want to admit it but I thought so as well. I also thought he was off the pace for the majority as well - as though he was 'tired' or a bit 'unfit'. He just didn't fight tooth and nail liek I've seen him do on many occasions and I wasn't sitting watching going "COME ON MATE" I was thinking to myself "there is something not right with Fletch today... He seems off the pace"... 

Love the guy to bits but we are rolling the dice large on him and Carrick being our two main midfielders if I am honest.

241~~~
Could it not be that he just had a bad game, like most out there in a red shirt? One bad showing isn't necessarily down to his illness, and doesn't mean he's finished.

242~~~
Yes that was an awful performance. Very conservative - but even then he couldn't get the simple stuff right. But I'm confident that was just a <i>very</i> bad day for him. He's shown in pre season and in glimpses previously he still has that grit and class about him. Hopefully it can all come together again.

243~~~
I honestly didn't think the team were that bad, most were quite sharp throughout and there was some nice interplay at various intervals. A couple of crap to concede goals took the stuffing out of us. But I did feel there was something not right about him on the day. From my observation anyway.

244~~~
Individually it wasn't shocking, but we didn't look cohesive. Just very average and lacklustre, something we've known for ages. I think heaping the blame on Fletch is a tad unfair, especially when he looked like a viable, or dare i say good option in pre-season.

245~~~
I've said it before but I feel he's no better than Cleverley or Fellaini. I've great admiration for the man, but he should not be regularly starting centre-midfield for Manchester United.

246~~~
Perception versus reality. 1st half only.

I watched the game and have seen a decent number of comments in the match thread and a few in here regarding how he played in the first half. One comment that came up a few times is how often he gave the ball away in the 1st half.
So I took some notes when watching the game again. I havent yet watched the 2nd half yet so this is just for the 1st half.
17 passes attempted.
15 passes completed. 5 of them forward, 11 sideways and 4 backwards.
1 pass was too strong and went out for a throw in. 1 pass when he was in the attacking third played into the box was intercepted by a defender.

I also noted that Herrera gave the ball away 6 times in the 1st half which may be related to why he was subbed instead of Fletcher although Herrera plays further forward where riskier passes are attempted. However far less critique of his efforts than Fletchers.

The point here is that based on comments I have seen that some made regarding the 1st half there is a clear difference between reality and perception.

247~~~
Don't want to give you any spoilers but the second half does not end well for him.

248~~~
This.

249~~~
I watched the whole game live, I already know about the 2nd half. The point is i do wonder what people see considering the comments about the 1st half etc.

250~~~
This is the line that kills. At some point, we will have to come to terms and accept that he will never be able to play at the standards we need any more. Even Barcelona had to drop any form of sentimentality and accept that Eric Abidal would never be the same after his liver problems because something was more important than continuing a great story - having players who can perform without any chronic hindrance.

251~~~
Pre season isnt a good example to use, the pace was slow which suits him. His game has changed to become more like Carricks. If we are dominating both players are perfectly fine, the problem is that when being pressed both players can be overrun.

Id rather Fletch stay as backup over Cleverly, but without a decent attacking outlet he becomes vunerable.

252~~~
I wouldn't say he's finished. He can still contribute to our season. But the tempo teams played pe season at did seem to flatter him. Main point is that he probably shouldn't be a key key player for us.

253~~~
In the Fletcher vice captain thread I said he was neither a leader on the pitch nor good enough. I got rounded on for that but it was there for all to see again yesterday. Even at his best he was nothing more than a journeyman.

He was appallingly bad yesterday and needs to be shipped out.

254~~~
He would still contribute well for us but he shouldn't be a regular starter for every match.Being 3rd choice CM should be proper for him at this stage.

255~~~
Yep. 3rd or 4th choice.

256~~~
Seems to me that he slows our play down. Those sideways and backwards passes can be frustrating to watch when I think we should be attacking with pace.

257~~~
This sums it up really. I'm sure we were all a bit emotional about his comeback, but truth must be told.

258~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

259~~~
Absolutely this. Not sure what the thinking behind giving him the VC title is - I hope it's more because of his experience around the squad and in the dressing room etc and NOT because he's a key first XI player for us.

260~~~
Could be, but one thing that worries me the most is that it looked like he was in some kind of energy-saving mode. He had a great pre-season so I was hoping he is in better shape.

His role is extremely energy-consuming, after all he is playing in 2 man midfield.

261~~~
In his prime he was all about energy and getting around the pitch, that was his job and he was brilliant. Now he's lost the dynamism due to illness and his age and he was never a great passer of the ball, he is finished at the highest level. He's such a great professional but he's played about 20 odd PL games in total in the last 3 seasons and that shows, the game has passed him by. 

I believe his contract ends next summer and sadly it should not be renewed. He is only 30 so I could still see him going to another lower PL team and doing a good job for a few years.

262~~~
Tbh Fletcher is a good back-up but no more.  We  need more quality in midfield and specifically a box to box midfielder who can defend and enforce the attack.  He has had a good pre season but on his first competitive match he looked to be short of quality and has left the defence exposed at times due to lack of concentration and not tracking down the opposition

263~~~
If that's the best Fletcher can do in the Premier League, then he shouldn't be back up either, if we're one or two injuries away from, well, this.

264~~~
He's got to go, it really is that simple. We should be looking towards the future and he cant under any conditions be part of it.

265~~~
I agree, unfortunately. It's all well and good that he COULD play as a 3rd or 4th choice CM for us, and as a squad player, but in reality what is the point in that? Cleverley and Fellaini are arguably both at his level (if not above it) and are younger options. It's a shame that his illness robbed him of another few seasons at his best, and at his best he was very good, but he just isn't up to it anymore.

266~~~
if you look at the selection united has, he's only decent player to play alongside Herrera. Swansea was poor for him but all players has a poor game, and dont forget the system is completely new to Manchester United. To think they'll play world class in a instant is ridiculous, united need depth within the team. United has lost a strong bench now, its lucky united wasnt in europe because united wouldnt survive with the squad they have. Fletcher cant play every game, with Carrick out its more pressure on the guy. i doubt they wont be many axing too many players too soon.

267~~~
After Herrera we've signed nobody in central midfield. If Fletcher goes ( and Carrick is still injured ) then we've got Fellaini or Cleverley to play alongside Herrera.

Simply no.

268~~~
Then wee need to get in the market and get some quality in. its totally unacceptable for a club our size to have a player who's well past it in midfield.
 I'm sorry but he's hardly shown an decent form since he's come back, in fact he looks well out of his depth. His illness has robbed him of the qualities that made him a good footballer thinking he'd be decent after that is nothing short of a pipe dream.

269~~~
It's not his fault that he isn't a proper defensive midfielder. People say you don't need one with 3 at the back, but there'll always be that gap between defence and midfield without one.

270~~~
I was always under the impression that he was a defensive midfielder, even under Sir Alex I remember Fletcher playing alongside Carrick as a defensive midfielder, although from time to time both would venture forward. 

Saturdays game though, I believe he was at fault for the second goal as he should have closed Sigurdsson down but rather decided to watch from a distance.

271~~~
I always thought Carrick was a bit more defensive, also better in it and Fletcher compensated the lack of pure abilities with a lot of running. He's not as offensive as Cleverley for example or a typical modern CM, but he's also no real defensive-midfielder IMO, we only have one defensive midfielder and that's Carrick, all the other one's - Cleverley, Fletcher, Anderson, Fellaini, Herrera are all better in advanced positions. 4 of those players have contracts running out in 2015.

He was definitely at fault for at least one goal, yeah.

272~~~
He's not up to the pace of this league. Sad to say.

273~~~
He's terrible I'd rather we kept Fellaini and loaned Fletcher out.

274~~~
The thoughts of him playing regularly this season depresses me. Happy to have him as a squad player but not a starter. He's so completely off the pace.

275~~~
The guy really is dreadful, he can't even play a short pass, i honest think we'd be better off with a League 1 midfielder instead of him, yet he's vice captain <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

276~~~
He should have retired, he isn't up to pace anymore.

277~~~
He's finished. He's past it. I used to be sentiemtal about it, but times up. We need a whole set of new midfielders.

278~~~
Not a premier league level defender. Manchester United level is something else all together.

279~~~
He needs 40 yards of space to bring the ball under control.

280~~~
Yep totally gone. 

Pre season was a horrible trick

281~~~
Not even that for me. He's just not a Premier League footballer anymore.

282~~~
He seems slower than everyone else on the pitch.

283~~~
Diabolical. Poor passing, doesn't defend. Inexplicable to make him vice captain this season

284~~~
He's that bad he's on par with Cleverley should take up a coaching role or be moved on.

285~~~
Its actually painful to see him playing like this.

286~~~
I wonder what kind of intensity our work on the training ground is done at, since LvG hasn't seen that the guy's miles off the pace (just as he was the last time he played in the league).

He's such a liability it's not even funny. Couple that with Cleverley's horrid and cowardly performance and we're getting outgunned by Sunderland.

287~~~
Just fecking ship him off, I'm sick to death of seeing him now and its getting annoying. He makes Fellainis look like Xavi when it comes to controlling the ball. Honestly Darren, just do the club a favour and announce your retirement

288~~~
He was far worse than Cleverley today, not even comparable.

289~~~
This so much. Aweful.

290~~~
Not even squad quality..... 
Sadly.

291~~~
Our vice captain ladies and gentlemen.

292~~~
So many underhit passes. I'ts a shame to see him like this.

293~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I understand him losing his athleticism, but why is his touch so poor? A decent touch is one of those basics you'd expect every professional footballer to have. Fletcher, today, is almost booting it forward when he receives it.

294~~~
2015 cannot come any quicker, Carrick obvious is a keeper, but fletcher Anderson and Cleverley, with those 3 gone that is wages off the books.

295~~~
Sadly not. Cleverley has been better but there's not a lot in it

296~~~
Coached to play football by Darren Fletcher?  What an exciting prospect for a professional footballer.

And Tom Cleverley is 2 levels above him and that's saying something, at least Cleverley can play short passes and can control a ball.

297~~~
I would say his energy was one of his main attributes during his best time for us. He always had average technique and passing skills.

Take that energy away and you have Fletcher 2014. Not his fault really...

298~~~
That's about £150k a week off our books plus some transfer fees, enough to replace with 2 upgraded CMs

299~~~
Just dreadful. Please can we bring in a midfielder before the end of the window. We will finish bottom half if Fletcher and Cleverley start our games.

300~~~
He's just so clearly not up to it any more unfortunately. I was watching that half through my fingers for the most part when the ball was in midfield, both when Sunderland were walking through ours at will and when Fletch or Cleverley were on the ball themselves.

301~~~
Fletcher has an excuse Cleverley is mid twenties and completely shite. Not even funny anymore that he gets to pull on the shirt. I'd honestly rather have Scholes Giggs or even Anderson than TC23!

302~~~
The fear in his game...if I could've had a £50 for every time he mis-controlled the ball! Shocking that the pressure has done this to him. Fletch used to be one of our leaders. We did well hrs season after selling Ronnie, in large part, cos he stepped up. He's so far from his 2009-10 self it's unreal.

303~~~
Sentimentality is slowly killing this club.

304~~~
We literally have one of the best attacks in the world, but have a championship midfield. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> How is that possible?

305~~~
I'm done with a sentiment. Being overplayed against Sunderland like a kid, falling on the ground from every challenge, constantly losing the ball, can't even pass properly... 1st half shows he would have physical problems even on Championship division level.

You can't make this shit up. If your midfield can't compete with Sunderland you can as well give chances to Powell and Pearson.

This chronic disease he had is taking it's toll in a saddest way.

306~~~
I know, hard time and all that with his sickness but this is G.Neville type of bad the season before he retired.

307~~~
Why does he require five touches to even have a look up?

308~~~
I hate admitting it, but it's what I've been thinking too.

309~~~
Thought he played well in preseason but this is shambolic.

310~~~
I would honestly rather have Anderson in the middle. At least he would add energy and forwards passes to our game.

311~~~
Yeah you're probably right, to be fair.

312~~~
This.

We should have been brutal, football is brutal and if we don't change our ways we'll slip further down the ladder.

313~~~
Buy out their contracts why not, but it seems we are so short on numbers, we have too make due with this lot. They give Valencia a new contract , so I would not be surprised of fletcher and Cleverley get new contracts

314~~~
No idea how he's vice captain as well. Sentimentality.

315~~~
Good subs. (young is a disgrace)

316~~~
Awful, awful performance. Such a shame to see.

317~~~
Would not be sad if that were the last time we saw him in a United shirt.

318~~~
I don't expect anything from him ,Cleverly, Young and Smalling  except average performance here and there.

319~~~
he loves the club and that's the most important for central midfielder.

320~~~
Not good enough for PL football. Give him some role at United where he can talk some nonsense and write a book or sth.

321~~~
Should be sold. He's completely shot.

322~~~
Sad to watch him today. It brought back memories of Gary Neville's last few games for Utd where he looked completely and utterly past it.

I'm not even sure if he's good enough to be 3rd or 4th choice.

323~~~
He's finished, as sad as it is. Championship standard at best, can't keep up with the pace of the league anymore. His passing was atrocious at times.

324~~~
Getting embarrassing I'm afraid. 2nd half an improvement on the first but two awful performances to start the season. Can't seem to control the ball on a regular basis.

325~~~
As some of us have been saying during illness, he had little ability before he was ill, but had nuisance value because of his work rate.

Now, he has no work rate, still has no ability and is a  liability out there.

"He will be back to his best after a proper pre season!"

feck off.

326~~~
Absolutely atrocious today and in the last game. And he's our best option there. Sigh...

327~~~
a few years ago he was my favroite player, but really he shoudnt be in a million miles of the first team anymore, its sad but his illness has ruined him and he just can keep up with the pace of the PL

we cant spend as much money on di maira as we want, but unless we buy a top quiality mobile defesive midfilder we f**ked!!

328~~~
Then Mick Hucknall is the answer to all our problems.

329~~~
Should never play for us again.

Sorry Darren.

330~~~
Barely made the grade before his illness. Probably not good enough now to get in a PL midfield anywhere.

331~~~
Feel a bit harsh slagging him off after what he's been through, and the fight he put in to return, but you can see that it has just taken it out of him. He is a yard slower, at least. He operates in slow motion, thinking he's got way more time than he actually has, and he ends up losing the ball stupidly, or make a forced hash of a pass. You can't control the midfield if your midfielder can't control the ball. We made Larsson and Cattermole look like Xavi and Iniesta. They strolled through.

332~~~
He's just not up to it anymore. I hoped that Fletcher and Cleverley could become good squad players for us but, truth be told, how many teams would anyone be comfortable seeing them against?

Our midfield is absolutely grim, it really is.

333~~~
At this stage Anderson would probably be better option. 

His best attribute was that ability to keep running and bring energy. He has none of that left and also added poor passing to his game.

334~~~
There's always something very, very suspect about a central midfielder who plays a match and makes 0 tackles and 0 interceptions. Even the most attack minded ones in the world. Thats coasting.

Darren Fletcher made neither a tackle nor interception today, something he did a bunch of times last season when it looked clear that he's not good enough to be a squad player at United.

335~~~
That's harsh. He was absolutely phenomenal from 2008 to 2010. Very underrated player back then.

336~~~
No. He was excellent prior to his illness.

337~~~
He was very good before his illness, but he should probably just hang up his boots.  He's no where near good enough to play for United.

338~~~
I really wanted to believe in him being able to come back to his best, especially after doing well in preseason.

But he looks done. No place in a club like this for passengers.

339~~~
It's sad to see but he's not up to standard right now, might never be again. Hopefully we bring in another CM and he is just kept around for his experience and the odd run out.

340~~~
It's not harsh to criticise him - there's no room for sentiment in football.

The fact is, he's arguably lost a bit of what he was, but it's not his illness or what it's done that's letting him down overall. He has perhaps lost a bit of engine which was valuable but his passing was never great. He was playing in a much better side a few years ago and looked a much better player for it. We don't have that now and need better players.

341~~~
Yet again shows that pre season form means nothing. He's been a complete liability in the 2 prem games, and even that Valencia game where he somehow managed to feck up 5 yard passes when he wasn't even getting pressed. The guy is done, and wouldn't get into any other prem midfield (nor would Cleverley)

342~~~
Sorry but no. I've said it elsewhere here he was a journey man at best. He's now done and wouldn't get into any other PL side that's going anywhere

343~~~
Utterly shite. I'd rather watch Anderson waddle about

344~~~
Making Carrick's performances of 13-14 look good at the moment isn't he?

345~~~
You're lost in the woods there, mate. Fletcher was a sure starter in one of the best squads we've ever had.

346~~~
you ve"said it elsewhere"......so what?
i d prefer to rely on the opinion of someone like mourinho....

347~~~
Strongly disagree. He was a colossal figure in our midfield 2008-2011. Huge engine, got stuck in, pressed and harried the ball, won it back and kept it moving. Chipped in with a few goals as well, a few of them were screamers n'all. The guts and engine Fletcher had in his prime is what we need right now. Teams are strolling through our midfield, swatting away any kind of physical presence we have to offer. Fletcher just doesn't have that in him anymore, which is saddening.

348~~~
He's finished.

I'd rather get Roy Keane back on a short term contract.

Useless.

349~~~
He's not good enough at this level anymore.

350~~~
I like him, but it doesn't look like much has changed from last year, he looks done on this level. Maybe as 4th or 5th choice midfielder, but he shouldn't start games for us.

351~~~
That was like watching Ferdinand, Vidić, and Carrick last season rolled into one. Completely off the pace and takes 10 extra touches of the ball.

352~~~
Sorry, but he's finished.

353~~~
Vice Captain or not, van Gaal won't tolerate people who aren't performing. I think we all want Fletch to come back to his best. Pre season he was excellent but we're now into the important stuff and on the evidence of the first two games, it's concerning. To very poor performances from him, although he's not alone.

Probably part of the problem rather than part of the solution at the moment. Certainly in terms of starting games.

354~~~
He had 1 good match in pre-season the rest he was average.

355~~~
Just terminate his contract, no one is buying him after that performance.

356~~~
Fletcher on current for should be nowhere near our first team...He wasn't even nearly as bad as Mata and Cleverley today but Fletch looks like he is over the hill...It's sad to see such a wonderful servant playing at a level that is miles lower than what he used to produce for us but he shouldn't be in the first team

357~~~
Are you serious? No, for United ability at he highest level is important.

Keano and Scholes must be pulling pillows over there heads after his last two games.

358~~~
Awful post. Just truly awful. Fletcher does indeed look past it now but to say he had little ability before he was ill is laughably ignorant. Nuisance value was all he had. Jesus wept. There's so much wrong with this post I just don't know where to begin.

Either you never watched him or you're just clueless.

Forum rules dictate that one must attack the post, not the poster. So with that in mind, let me just say that your post is a cnut.

359~~~
Harsh it may be, but its true.

He was the legs of an otherwise immobile midfield, and complimented it well.

What he wasn't, no matter how hard you want to believe it, was a particularly brilliant player in his own right.

360~~~
Saying his main strength was his work rate is a long way removed from saying he had little ability. Which is what you said. And which remains bollocks. Fletcher at his best was one of our most important players. His use of the ball, work rate, short and mid range passing, and goal scoring were all vital to our team. Memories are so short on here.

361~~~
He was good enough to feed the ball from our world class defence of Rio, Vidic and Evra to our world class attack of Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez. He wouldn't have been good enough if the team around him was weaker.

362~~~
pretty much, theres no way anderson would have been worse than Fletcherely out there. they all need to go.

363~~~
He was really great in his role. No one expected from him to be Scholes or Keane. He was an essential figure in a team that had great success both in the Premier League and in CL. 

However now it's time to hang up the boots, he is a mere shadow of his former self.

364~~~
Rose tinted glassed I'm afraid. The midfield was always the weak part of that team and Fletcher was just about good enough.

365~~~
Colossal was how I'd describe Bryan Robson or Roy Keane, both absolute animals of players who could dominate and run a midfield, drag teams single handily through games on any given day regardless of how their team mates were playing. 

Darren Fletcher was never colossal, in his prime he would still be miles off getting in the top teams in Europe and stood out because our midfield was so weak and has been getting weaker year after year.

He was a good player nothing more, now he is completely finished and can't even seem to do the basics in which he excelled at a few years ago, keeping the ball, closing people down etc.

Unfortunately the illness has taken its toll but he would be ideal to coach our youngsters in some capacity.

366~~~
"He was good enough to feed the ball from our world class defence of Hierro, Roberto Carlos and Salgado to our world class attack of Ronaldo, Zidane and Figo. He wouldn't have been good enough if the team around him was weaker."

Look at that. Now it looks like it's been written by an equally wrong Real Madrid fan about Makelele.

367~~~
Nicky Butt was a better player.

368~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

369~~~
He doesn't have the legs for the PL anymore, his greatest strength was his engine and his combativeness in hunting the ball down, now he is losing most of the 50/50's he goes in for and I think the pressure of the pace is affecting his passing as despite what some are saying he was a tidy, if basic, distributor of the ball, but now he is struggling to hit simple passes if there is even a hint of a player closing him down.

370~~~
Pre-illness he was one of the best midfielders in the league. He was our best midfielder from 08-11.

371~~~
Early days in the season and he's just off his first pre-season in a few years so I wouldn't like to judge too early, but he doesn't seem to have the mobility that made him so effective. Without that he doesn't offer a massive amount on the pitch, or certainly not so much that he couldn't be replaced IMO. Fingers crossed his form picks up in the next few weeks with games.

372~~~
Fletcher was always over rated by United fans. Never bought into his hype as one of the best midfielders in the league. He wasn't as good as Nicky Butt in his peak. 

I'm scottish and would of loved it if Fletcher had ever been world class.

373~~~
Overhyping players from the academy is the greatest sin among so many Manchester United supporters. Class of 92 is far behind us...

374~~~
Really wanted Fletcher to have a great season, he's been a good player for us in the past and has overcome so much to get to this stage. That said, he shouldn't get special treatment due to his past illness. He'd probably be the first to admit that he's been well off the pace in the first two games of the season. Lost count of how many times he's given the ball away.

375~~~
He was incredible in 09. You can't really expect someone with this type of injury to recover and be better than before, it simply just doesn't happen. For what it's worth I thought he was a miles better player than Nicky Butt, especially in that 09 season.

376~~~
Was he heck. Paul Scholes and even Owen Hargreaves when fit were better.

377~~~
Look we all have our opinions about Fletcher pre illness and most on the Caf know mine.

I think Wenger once called him anti football, just on the back of us knocking them out of the CL and to be honest that's the way I viewed him. Somebody that ran round pressing the ball all over the pitch. Clearly that's now completely gone and he's left with the other more limited areas of his game.

That said he's done remarkably well to come back playing at all and TBF even I was getting a little optimistic that he could offer us something this season, after a good pre season. Sadly for him and our club that doesn't look like it's the case, the only positive is that LVG must surely have realised that now and the transfer window is still open.

378~~~
I'm not expecting him too ever be what he was. Giggs was never near what he was in his prime last year, and thus I never wanted to see him play last year.

Fletcher's illness is horrible, and as someone who has had severe stomach issues himself, I sympathise. Doesn't change the fact he isn't good enough anymore. I would argue he isn't even good enough for a top 10 side in this league anymore.

379~~~
Man United through and through.  Great lad.  Sad illness story.  Also, not good enough.

380~~~
Where in they are in the reserves and the academy they get overhyped, the ones who have been brought into the first team have consistently come under brutal criticism, the majority of fans deeming them not up to the required standard.

381~~~
I do feel sad for him though. He has been a faithful servant to the club and worked his socks off to get into the starting eleven.

He must be feeling like shit about his performances over the last two weeks.

382~~~
Really poor today. I feel bad about criticising him but we just can't accommodate any passengers and he's miles off the pace. I could list a number of things he did wrong but the blunt truth is that he's just not very good any more. It's understandable and a sad story but we need someone else in that role. It's crazy that I was happy to see Adnan playing in there instead and I was even thinking before that to try Welbeck on there. He could maybe continue the latter years of his career abroad. I think the pace of the PL is way too much.

383~~~
Oh dear.

Fletcher was never amazing, I can certainly see how rival fans (who are used to good midfielders) would think he barely scrapes by as a good option at his best. He was however more than good enough to keep Hargreaves out of the team, who was absolutely clueless in CM and therefore moved to right back, right midfield and even left midfield

384~~~
Hate reading stuff like this, the only ones who has been faithful is the club to Darren Fletcher, supporting him through his illness, paying him £12m in wages for doing nothing.

If you call that being faithful servant to the club, well then I'll be faithful servant to the club too if they pay £12m for 5 years, infact £1m for 20 years will do, gimme anything though, as most of us here will be faithful servants to the club forever for free.

385~~~
How he got the vice captaincy is beyond me. He had one good game in the preseason and its been down hill ever since he played Liverpool.

386~~~
I understand the angst towards Cleverley but the vitriol towards Fletcher is baffling. I can't believe people are trying to downplay Fletcher's past performances for the club. He was truly fantastic for about 3 seasons and many still claim we would have done better in the 08/09 CL final if we had Fletcher available then. He was an integral part of that team and to be questioning the quality of that Fletcher is ridiculous... Remember guys due to the reconstructive nature of memories, future events can cause your memories to be distorted in a negative or positive manner depending on the nature of the future event.

Fletcher has had a horrific chronic illness and look a pale shadow of the player he used to be. That much is obvious to us, it is a criminal lack of planning on the club's behalf to use him as a first team player going into the season with Carrick out. He should have been nothing more than our 4th/5th option for our midfield and yet we probably have to start the next 2-3 games with him. Make no mistake, I am not defending Fletcher's performances, they have been abysmal, but it the club's mistake that they are persisting with a has-been player for a first team spot. In the best case scenario he should be have 10-20 appearances throughout the season and should be in the squad for his experience alone since we are severely lacking that at the moment with Rio, Vidic and Evra having left.

387~~~
Exactly.

For us to be relying on a 30 year old Darren Fletcher, who has been suffering with his illness for about 3 years now on and off, to just come back straight into the first team like nothing has happened shows just how negligent we have been in regards to midfield over the last 5 or 6 years. Fletcher should be nothing more than backup at best, it's not his fault we've ignored the gaping hole in our midfield for years and years and are having to rely on him.

388~~~
I can't believe he's vice-captain.....he should must leave the club ffs

389~~~
Bossed by Cattermole and looked well off the pace 

You would expect some sort of leadership but he was anonymous and his passing was awful 

Disappointed after all the preseason promise

390~~~
it is a harsh post. Everyone knows now he should be our last option playing one match in two weeks to save energy for it. It is obvious that he had to change his game and all that was characteristic for him in his game and so valuable for us - energy, hardworking, tackling is gone. I think he should do Brown/Sheasy and the sooner the better for the club which is always bigger than player so we should try not to be hasitating about it much we need to win things straight away. Anyway he should stay for this season, we truly need someone so experienced and a player who knows the club who will tell so many incoming players how it works here. That doesn't mean he is played week in week out. Giving him captaincy should be a good respect showed to him in this season which could be his arguably last if we are onto win titles again in the future. This was sunderland. I wonder how will we paly at anfield or white heart line with high pressing team like tottenham, we have no chance to succeed. Our midfield has been shit for a long time. Carrick being our best player is the sign of it. He is the player who should be considered as a backup at best. Don't say we should be real madrid but look at how many top teams have better midfield option than us on the pitch and on the bench as well. Carrick was guaranteed starter now we have Fletcher after his illness. Club have to asses this problem ASAP. In one year there is gonna be different squad hopefully but Fletcher needs to stay for one more year

391~~~
I understand that he had a bad game and he isn't the answer to our midfield problems but some of the reactions have been more disgusting than his performance. We didn't win a football match, grow up and deal with it.

392~~~
I think we overestimated him with his preseason performances. With his health and fitness regressed over the past three years, I don't think he can start for us anymore in the league. Maybe CC and FA Cup games but hopefully Carrick can come back soon to take his place.

393~~~
I will be blunt here: I know people were touched by the story with his illness and how he worked hard to play football again at United. However, this kind of dreamland bollocks just has to stop once and for all because reality cannot afford to be rosy with this kind of particular situation.

Look at Eric Abidal in Barcelona. We all heard about the long struggle he had to get a new liver and then return to competitive football. However, Barcelona ended up realizing that he just doesn't fit in the team's plans anymore. What did they do? They phased him out by different means and ended up "signing the separation papers". Abidal sure was angry, but hey it was the right decision. When it comes to Darren Fletcher, I hope we will show the same amount of realism and ruthlessness regardless of whether or not Fletcher will get angry in public. Football is all about business, nothing personal.

394~~~
I don't care if you hate it or love it, Fletcher "was" good for us before his illness and before that he worked hard and never complained. Nobody here is talking about money here other than you mate.
Yes I agree he shouldn't be starting for us again like everybody else, but lets not take away the fact that he was a very important player for this club.

395~~~
I like Fletch, I think he is a nice guy. I rated him when he was at his peak for us too. However, he is done; that performance was dreadful. Someone needs to tap him on the shoulder and tell him that maybe he should give it up.

396~~~
It's really quite a shame to see him be as terrible as he has been in these last two games... especially considering a) the player he was and b) the fact that it's probably through no fault of his own.

397~~~
Dunno about that, he has never been a consistent goal scorer. It's like saying Carrick's goal scoring has been a vital part of our team, he HAS scored some crackers, but he didn't do it very often.

Anyway, Fletcher was very good in 2009, 5 years ago. Now he is terrible, that's all that really matters.

398~~~
Yeah, I wasn't saying he is good now. Just taking exception to those that say he was never any good. And people calling for his contract to be terminated.

399~~~
His spirit is willing but his body has given up on him and the illness has taken a lot out of him.

He will probably retire this season and start coaching one will think.

400~~~
Darren is a red thorugh and through, but EPL is too much for him. We as a club have been very loyal to him, and he has been the same to us, however, its about the time to part our ways.

401~~~
He used to be just as good as Carrick and Hargreaves a few years ago.  Which is to say that our midfield pretty much looked pedestrian whenever any two out of those three played there.  

Due to the aftereffects of his illness, he is no longer good enough.  This is not his fault - just an unfortunate fact of life.

I have no issues with him staying and being a 5th choice CM at the club.  But under no circumstances can he be our 1st choice.

402~~~
Bunch of ABUs in here. He wasn't a limited player, he was very good in one of our best ever sides. He was a very important player for us and if anything he was underrated at the time. Stop rewriting history because he isn't good now. If you had been what he'd been through you'd probably be lucky to kick a football at your pub league game. He's not the quality we need but terminating his contract, forcing him to retire, or pushing him into the lower rungs of english/scottish football is stupid, ignorant, classless talk. Keep him around for his contract, but we can't rely on him to play much. We need a replacement but not to fecking lynch the man.

403~~~
Horrible performance from him, and just looks well off the pace sadly. As much as I would love to see him back to his best, it just isn't happening and he is a liability in midfield a lot of the time.

404~~~
Bunch of 'Anyone But United'? Doesn't make sense, in relation to some fans wanting him moved on/retired.

As for Fletcher he's a bit part player at best. I personally find no reason why the club should pay him a fortune to be a footballer for the club. He simply isn't up to it anymore unfortunately. Shame he's not more like Gaz who knew when his number was up & took the correct course of action. Both excellent servants & players to the club, but there comes a time when basically they're stealing a living. Club needs to be a bit more ruthless in this regard as we have a lot of well paid players on the books who simply are not up to the desired quality.

405~~~
Was a good player for a very successful period for the club. But now, he is living on sentiment. He clearly isn't up to it at this level anymore.

406~~~
Great that he made a comeback but the current level is just not good enough. He slows us down and lost the ball in the most stupiest moment

407~~~
we all agree he shouldn't start or even be 2nd\3rd choice in our midfield, but lets not get carried away with what the club is paying and not paying. He has a contract so the club will pay him regardless.  

as for stealing a living... who the feck are you?. Darren Fletcher is a United player right now so support him even though his shite.

408~~~
Bloke should have some professional pride & retire. Who I am has nothing to do with Fletch taking up a squad place! It is simply my opinion.

409~~~
It's funny cause I wasn't a fan of his when he was fit. Great pro but a player that needs quality next to him. Looked good the start of the season when Herrera was next to him, now he's injured not so good. Fletch is a good lad and pro but you can't lose so much of your football career to injuries and it not take it's toil....

410~~~
This just shows the worth of these pre season games, even against good opposition... he looked a world beater in them at times <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

411~~~
He should have left this summer, and taken the rest of his 'midfield' with him, perhaps except Michael Carrick. 

That he managed to put in a worse performance than Tom Cleverley yesterday is amazing in itself. Yesterday was bad enough to have been his Gary Neville moment.

412~~~
He looks unfit or something. Jaded or not match fit or something. There just seems to me to be something off - he .. I guess kind of looked like this in pre-season but it wasn't pronounced. He looks like he spent all of his gas on tour and has come back really struggling for fitness. It's bizarre.

edit: Something something fitness

413~~~
Classy.

Hugely overrated by a percentage of United fans (who seem pretty sensitive to criticism) and underrated by fans elsewhere. I'll stand by my opinion of him and it's the one I've always held....to paraphrase Cantona re Deschamps he was a "water carrier". Some might say that's an important job. He was a decent harrier and niggler of better opposition midfielders (anti football) but his passing has always been poor and he could never beat a man.   If that's the sum total of your skillset I call that a very limited player. I'm in agreement with whoever posted that Nicky Butt was a far superior version of the type of player Fletcher is (was)

414~~~
To be fair, for me Fletcher looked a good player doing an ugly job in a good side with good players around him. Take those players away and his flaws become glaringly evident - specifically slow sideways passing and at times a heavy touch.

He had a great engine before his illness and maybe that covered some of his flaws, and perhaps that's been affected by the illness.

Sadly, however nice a bloke he is, on current form he looks done at the top level and we need much, much better.

415~~~
He is a limited player, always has been. Footballing wise, he does not have specific outstanding strengths - he was more about work rate, determination, etc. Now that Carrick and Herrera are out, more is expected of him but he's just unable to deliver. In an ideal world, he should be our 4th choice midfielder

416~~~
He will obviously never find his top form again but he used to be a decent player. Nothing spectacular, certainly not at the level he was touted at (someone said that Xavi - Iniesta - Fletcher would be the best midfield in the world back in the day, absolutely ridiculous to have his name next to them) but nevertheless a decent player. We could use someone like top form Fletcher at the minute but after 2 years away from football it is not going to happen.

417~~~
Looked good in pre season but has looked some way off the pace so far. Given his time out with illness and injury I really wanted him to return to some kind of form even if it was as a dependable squad player but the signs are great for him early on.

418~~~
This - it was incredible to come back from his illness, but he's far too pedestrian and his touch has become worse than nay int eh squad abr Cleverley. He should go into coaching before he has to do a Neville mid-season. It shows how desperate we are for bodies there though.

419~~~
He shouldn't and won't be a starter once our only 2 proper midfielders are fit again.

420~~~
Atrocious player. I'd honestly replace him with one of our youth midfielders. They have no chance of being that incompetent on the ball.

421~~~
meant to say OTT, it was late lol

422~~~
With Cleverley sold off, I find our situation with Fletcher to be very odd.  Fletcher has put in a much better career than Clevs but after his illness and seeing that he will probably never get to his old level again, I think the two players can't really be distinguished from one another nowadays.  I guess you can argue that Cleverley has a bit more mobility and playmaking ability (largely due to age and staying well), but IMO it doesn't make him much better of a player.

Logic tells me that Fletcher should also be sold off or convinced to retire (which he no doubt wouldn't), but he was made vice-captain and unless there is buying this week our current midfield options barring Herrera and DiMaria include him and Anderson.  This prospect frightens me...

423~~~
Fletcher provides more defensive cover than Cleverley which is what this midfield really lacks so it makes sense to keep him if it was a choice between the two. That and it would probably be a lot harder to sell Fletcher. Cleverley looks like he's going to bring us in £9m, a 30 year old Fletcher isn't going to conjure up those figures, it's better business this way. Add in other factors like experience, leadership, seniority and I would say logic dictates keeping him around, at least until we can adequately replace him. Put it really bluntly, Cleverley is far more expendable than Fletcher.

424~~~
How Darren Fletcher is a millionaire from playing football i don't know, if he can be a professional footballer and a professional footballer for Manchester United then I've not given up hope of playing for Manchester United one day too and I'm shit.

425~~~
Right about now he'd be better off moving on to Scottish league, unfortunately.

426~~~
Doesn't come towards the CB. Doesn't get involved in physical challenges. Too slow and awful in possession. 

Just woeful .

427~~~
He is so bad when the defenders have the ball, its infuriating. He is not making space at ALL for passes.

428~~~
3rd week in a row, same crap performance.

429~~~
The ball continues to bypass the midfield, I almost feel bad for slating the guy after his illness but Darren Fletcher offers nothing.

430~~~
How he can receive the ball with so much time and end up with a yellow card is amazing.

431~~~
He's never gonna get a better situation than right now to show he's still good enough. Unfortunately it looks like he just isn't, doesn't really do anything on the pitch anymore.

432~~~
I honestly think that's too good for him.  His performances are non-league like and i don't think that's an over exaggeration.

433~~~
This formation(3-5-2) is totally dependent upon an extremely well positioned deep lying midfielder. Fletchers play is awful, however his positioning and tracking is an absolute disgrace.

434~~~
Maybe a but harsh, but this is embarrassing to look at. He is miles away from the player he once was.

435~~~
Should've ended his career with that illness to be fair. He looks weak, technically abysmal and slow.

436~~~
What was he once? Let's be right, he was never that great.

437~~~
If us laymen can see it, then Van Gaal can definitely see it. Which makes me think ... is this a message to the board, like, "Woody, look at this shit. Blind <i>and</i> Carvalho/Vidal, please."

438~~~
His main strength was always his drive and energy and now that he's lost that he's attempting to play as a deep lying playmaker despite the fact he lacks the positioning and intelligence to do so. 

It's like the Steven Gerrard situation with the main difference that Gerrard can actually pass the ball, which Fletcher seemingly can't anymore.

439~~~
His drive and energy are gone. He looks completely useless out there and has caused us nothing but problems since the first ball was kicked this season.

440~~~
If I was one of our CBs today, I would also hoof it rather than pass to him.

441~~~
He does nothing and he is the sole reason our defenders have to revert to hoof ball and that our build up play goes to shit. He is the free man in the 5 but he doesn't show for anyone. I could cut some slack if he was providing any kind of defensive cover or bothered to track his man when Burnley break but no he just casually jogs around. If because of his condition he can't hack the PL which I predicted he should retire.

442~~~
Dead man walking

443~~~
Louis Van Gaal should deal with the situation Randy Marsh style; "step forward everyone who plays in midfield for Man Utd... not so fast Darren...".

444~~~
I'm no big fan of Blind, but he can't do any worse.

445~~~
He's done as a football player.

446~~~
I agree, he was never "great", but the point still stands.

Hes gone from "Very good" to utterly useless.

447~~~
He's useless.

448~~~
He wouldn't start for any other PL team, and I genuinely believe that.

But yet, at united, he's vice captain.

449~~~
Hope to not see him in the starting line up in two weeks.

450~~~
I want him out, honestly. It's no use keeping a guy like that as long as he wants to be an active player, bleeding United or not.

451~~~
Vice captain guarantees that he'll play plenty of football. He's just finished.

452~~~
His biggest asset was his mobility and athleticism. Without them he just isn't United quality.

453~~~
When Anderson who hasn't played for ages comes on for you and improves things, you know it is bad. Fletcher needs to be dropped, hopefully by our next game we will have a few more fit CM who can replace him, ideally a new signing altogether.

454~~~
Fletcher really gives nothing going forward or backward and honestly, I don't think he was ever cut out to negotiate play in the center on his own.  He was always a supporting middle and doesn't have any ability left to even do that.

455~~~
Was he better in the 2nd half? Or did he just go completely missing and I didn't see him?

456~~~
He should take Gary Neville's approach and just call it a career.

457~~~
A nothing player who has tricked everybody into believing that he would come good in the pre-season, i think he should hangup his boots after this match. We would still have Blind,Herrera,Anderson,Carrick and hopefully another CM to come.

458~~~
Should never have started the season here. This has to stop.

459~~~
He should of been a part of the clearing out of the old guard at the end of last season, along with Rio, Vidic, Giggs and Evra etc.

460~~~
He should have been pensioned off 2 years ago.

461~~~
I would have any of those four instead of Fletcher.

462~~~
I know, I'm just saying that when we got rid of the older players in the summer, Fletcher should of been one of them too.

463~~~
He's terrible. Nowhere near good enough to be starting for us.

464~~~
Has he played every minute of league competition so far this year? I'm surprised at the amount of playing time he's getting, I suppose with injuries we just don't have other options. I think Darren's limitations are a big part of our problems.

465~~~
Fletcher as with Valencia was nit worse than the rest. Imo the main issue with Fletcher is the team lacking any balance. Those who watched Holland 352 system during wc finals could notice 2 hardworking midfielders in front of defence - usually de jong and de guzman with sneijder in front of them. Today, united played with fletcher in front of defence together with di Maria and Mata. With Mata totally immobile we ended with fletch and di Maria being outnumbered all the time. Situation improved slightly in 2 nd half when the wing backs pushed more forward. I think we ll see a better performance from fletcher or the player replacing him when sore dynamic player replaces Mata (or better his role today)

466~~~
We might as well have Paul Scholes in there and I'm being serious. He would offer the same mobility and drive but at least he can control the ball and pass it.

467~~~
Or Giggs for that matter.

468~~~
I think he could be a good ambassador for the club. But the fact that Cattermole and David Jones a former wigan player were voted men of the match against us says it all. I dont care who will play instead of him. Either it is Anderson, yes him or Pereira I dont really care, Blind whoever

469~~~
Ye agree think he should have been the first on the list tbh.

470~~~
David Jones is a former United player too.

471~~~
Wishing him all the best, but time to say goodbye.

472~~~
yeah it didnt come to my mind, but I rather stated it to demonstrate how bad our midfield is when we are overplayed by championship level players. It is very sad and we need to do sth with it ASAP. Hope the fact that he was named vice captain doesnt mean that he "has to be played" week in week out. The same with rooney about him being dropped I am concerned much more though.

473~~~
He's playing because we don't have a choice at the moment. I don't see why we didn't get the Blind deal done straight away, regardless of other targets. There's room for more midfielders in the squad, plus Blind is so versatile he will be fine for game time.

474~~~
I am sorry but I think he's done in this league imo. I love him for the sheer effort he put in to make a comeback but he looks off the pace and a shadow of his former self. With Blind coming in I suppose he would  have limited chances anyway. Its a shame that his condition has affected him so much. Its cruel really but then I suppose nothing can be done about it. I wouldn't be surprised if he announces his retirement this season as well. Knowing him he probably realises that his time is up.

475~~~
He has regressed too much due to his illness and it doesn't look like he is going to regain his old form anymore. The most infuriating aspect of his display yesterday was his lack of desire to drop back to provide the defence with a outlet to pass. It was a back 5 and then a significant gap between them and Fletcher and Di Maria (can't blame him as he is an attacking mid) and then our forwards. Can't wait for Herrera to return.

476~~~
Just gets worse. Falls over the ball on top of it. Sorry to say but he shouldn't be playing for United anymore

477~~~
Selling Tom Cleverley or even Anderson makes no sense while Fletcher is still on the books. He should be the first out of the door.

478~~~
Sadly as expected he looks finished at this level and if fellaini and cleverley are going to be moved on we need another cm as well as blind to be signed before the window closes.

479~~~
It seems like more people are losing this romantic vision of Darren Fletcher coming back to be the savior. Good, we should have cut our losses when he first got his illness as harsh as that sounds, football is a ruthless business, there is no room for sentiment which is the only reason why he is still at the club and is vice captain.

480~~~
Feel bad saying it as I was so happy he made a full recovery from his illness but he isn't up to playing at this level anymore. He offers nothing. Atm we need him to play every game because of the injuries, but when Carrick, Herrera and Blind are available I hope he's just used very sparingly.

481~~~
Jones offers far more than Fletcher in CM. The injury crisis is just so bad we can't spare him.

482~~~
I don't like saying it but, he's done at this level, as a starter! He's been abysmal for us and he was dreadful tonight. 

Scotland looked so much better once he went off

483~~~
I thought he was miles off the pace, felt sorry for him at times.

484~~~
Would it be too harsh to say that he wouldn't be playing for Scotland so soon after his return if he was playing for Sunderland, Stoke or Aston Villa?

485~~~
Its a bit horrible watching him right now in all honesty. You so badly want him to be good, but he's miles off the pace.

486~~~
He's at that point Gary Neville was when he just needs to realize it's over.

487~~~
i admire the attempt to get to a point where he's able to physically get onto the pitch, but he's done and dusted unfortunately .

488~~~
I think somebody will have to tell him it's over. Gary Neville made the decision himself when he knew he was done. He set himself the highest standards, and when he couldn't live up to them he called time.

489~~~
To be fair to him, I just re watched our first half vs Swansea, and he was actually quite good. Haven't watched the second half yet though, so maybe that's where he turns to shit.

490~~~
It's really sad and why I think it will be hard for him to accept that he can't play at the top level anymore after working so hard to get back.

That is where LvG will have to step in as I don't see Giggs doing it.

491~~~
Giggs certainly won't do it. Somebody less attached to United's past will have to do it.

492~~~
He's still 30. Was his illness really so bad that it has damaged his playing ability forever? Maybe if he is given a few more months he'll warm up and become better? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

493~~~
Last 25 mins he goes to pieces, by which time we'd used all our subs. I agree 1st half was decent.

494~~~
To be fair, in the game against Burnley, where we played the 5-3-2, he had no support in central midfield whatsoever. Both Mata (who was permanently stationed forward) and Di Maria (Who was very good, but kept bombing forward) were hardly of any defensive help in the areas ahead of the defense. It was a nightmare for Fletcher and he kept getting overrun; he just could not cope with the lack of support.

495~~~
Problem is, if we drop him and play Blind there, Blind will have the same issues.

Our midfield is still a mess.

496~~~
Exactly. However, I am hopeful when Herrera is back; hopefully Blind and he will lend more balance in there

497~~~
Fletcher doesn't look premier league standard nowadays. Not sure what happens next with him given that he is vice captain.

498~~~
I think there's decent balance if we play both Blind and Herrera. One of Fletcher's main strengths was his energy and stamina and he looks to have lost most of that which is a real shame. Blind offers tactical discipline and safe passing, while Herrera gives us that all action energy and dynamism. I think the midfield is vastly improved, especially with Di Maria too.

499~~~
He can still do a job as a utility player for us. I would also guess that with so many changes in personnel, the loss of experience over the summer and the young age of a lot fo the squad, Fletcher is valuable just being around day to day for the new players.

500~~~
If there's any chance of all at Fletcher getting back to a level that is near his previous best it was always going to take him a while to get back up to speed. Looking miles off the pace, for club and country, in his first 4 or 5 games tells us nothing we didn't know already. It's still far too soon to draw conclusions about his likely contribution this season.

501~~~
Don't think our midfield was overrun vs Burnley. Especially after the first 20 minutes we were mostly in control of the game and defense settled as well.

502~~~
just hoping blind starts infront him from now on, but i have a feeling blind will start at wing back

503~~~
I dont think he will ever be good enough for us. 

But then I do suffer from premature concludulation.

504~~~
with Jones and Smalling out - could Fletch be an option to start in a back 3?

I would not have much faith in a backline of Evans, Rojo and Blackett TBH

505~~~
He is worse than Anderson in any position now. His decline is pretty depressing.

I would have 100x more faith in that back line than in one with Darren Fletcher.

506~~~
he's been poor but I still take him over Anderson and think he could fit into a back 3  - we lacked someone with experience to organise the defence and to bring the ball out of defence, he could do both of those

507~~~
Fletcher in the back 3??? What!! He has no pace, can't tackle, has no composure under pressure, trips over the ball and can only pass backwards or sideways! Yes play him at the back FFS !

508~~~
There's a lot wrong in that post but the bit in bold is deranged.

509~~~
Pogue, even you have to agree he can't play at the back. It's just a nonsense.

He came back toward the back end of last season and was poor, to be fair he had a great pre season but has been disastrous since and playing him at the back (especially in a back 3) is just not viable in any shape or form.

510~~~
He was at that point last season too. It's  inspirational that he could come back, but he really isn't capable of playing ath the highest level any more. Can't run, can't control half the balls, and he turns like an oil tanker now. He can still pass decently but event hat was inconsistent. he gae away several balls vs Swansea and Burnley.

511~~~
It was great that he made it back. I think he'll realise soon that he isn't up to it anymore. Definitely don't want him in the back three against QPR. Too timid and can't control a ball. Imagine if he and the Evans from last game are both in there <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b> Darren Fletcher battling to save Manchester United career with Villa, Hull and Stoke on alert </b></span>

513~~~
I think Hull is the best option from those 3.

514~~~
I wouldn't let him go if if he's still keen to stay. He'll work fine as back-up or cup competitions (we saw how well he moved in pre-season until he played too many games in a row), as well as being a leader in the dressing room.

515~~~
Cup competitions should be for the kids, not for players about to retire soon. Dont think we need him as backup either tbh.

516~~~
He deserves to stay at the club as long as he wants, providing he's not first choice until he absolutely has to be. I fear that there is no hope now.. But I still think he deserves everything he gets from the club in terms of minutes.

517~~~
What do you mean by this? Didnt get it.

518~~~
As in, the club has stuck by him through his UC battle, so any minutes that they give him start or off the bench are deserved in terms of loyalty to a player they stood by and let try and get back to full productivity. Maybe it doesn't make sense?

519~~~
We should give him minutes in the hope he becomes productive again out of loyalty to him and because we stuck by him during his illness? Yeah, doesnt make sense to me if that's what you mean.

520~~~
Cup competitions are usually for guys on the fringe, whatever the age. The fact that Van Gaal named Fletcher as vice captain clearly shows that values and appreciates what he brings, even if it's not as a starter. As for not needing him as back-up, I disagree. I would prefer Fletcher to Fellaini or Anderson, and really right now that's all we have. Of course, if we get Strootman or another high quality central midfielder then it's a different story, but I'll factor that in if it actually happens.

521~~~
Fringe players to prepare them for the main team or keep them fit to contribute. Would make no sense to keep him to play cup games if we dont believe he can contribute to the 1st team anymore. 

For the defensive mid position, we have Blind, Carrick and Fellaini. In case of emergencies, Jones as well. I'd play any of these 4 ahead of him. Signing Strootman or someone of his quality means little in terms of Fletch's role in the team because like it or not, he's just a backup squad player now, whether we get a top drawer CM or not wont justify keeping him as we have backups already.

522~~~
Not what I mean, I am not saying the club has to objectively go out of their way to give him minutes. If he decided to just keep signing minimum contracts until retirement and be a bit part player and get minutes here and there then he would be deserving. The opposite of a scenario where a player is just wasting time and energy and doesn't deserve to start getting minutes. His experience and bleed-red attitude is handy.

523~~~
I'm not sure about cup competition being for kids or fringe players. We should do our best and play our best team for the FA Cup this season. 

We not likely to win the league. But I hope we take the FA Cup seriously as it's something we haven't won in a long time and could be the perfect kick starter for us again. 

So I don't want to see players like Fletcher or any other fringe players play in the FA Cup.

524~~~
I think he will prove his worth in the odd game here and there but he is far too gone to be a starter here. If he has no problem playing such a minimal role then he can stay for as long as possible, it's not like he is keeping out a talented player or drawing 300k/wk!

525~~~
I don't want to see Darren Fletcher ever again full stop.

526~~~
Same. Maybe one more send off match in a testimonial or something. Not in an important competitive match though.

527~~~
Shouldn't be anywhere near a 1st team place now. And I'd be pretty surprised another premiership club would be in for him as anything other than a backup player.

528~~~
I think a few prem clubs will be keen on him if he wants to leave.

His contract is up next summer. I'd like us to offer him a coaching role of some sort but if he wants to play then he'd have to leave probably.

529~~~
I think people are reading too much into the vice captaincy. All it means is Van Gaal had no intention to let him go this summer. It could be for various reasons. He may not have been able to read early on, through pre season games, how bad he will perform in actual games; He might have thought that we can't complete the restructure needed in midfield in one summer, so Fletcher would survive early on; He may be looking for a little leadership after the departure of several senior players.

None of those options mean Fletcher has a big role to play in terms of first team football, and once Blind arrived he promptly lost his place in the first 11, and rightly so. He probably doesn't have enough to offer, even in a squad player. It was good of the club to give him time to recover and a chance to play for us again, but there's a limit to have far we can go with that. Not knowing when to give up on players is part of the reason we lost out way a bit. We allowed him to ressurrect his career. Unless he surprises us with his performances, his career path should lead him elsewhere.

530~~~
Good substitution to bring him on. He offered the experience and leadership to keep the team together during the inevitable rearguard action after the red card. Kudos to Fletch.

531~~~

532~~~
This is the stuff he is brilliant at. Decent cameo too.

533~~~
It's been almost a month since his brief cameo appearance and once Rooney, Falcao and Valencia are back I think he is going to struggle to even make the bench. I know he's hoping to captain Scotland at the Euros in 2016 but it seems a long shot. He's clearly highly respected by the other players and I can't help but feel now might be the time for him to move towards the coaching staff.

534~~~
Scotland will take whatever they can. He's going to the Euros

535~~~
He was a great player for the club for them two seasons, and good back-up before hand. He used to always turn up in the big games, I remember that season where he was MOTM in 90% of the big games we played but then his form started to decline and he wasn't the same player. He then got diagnosed with his illness which obviously explained the drop in form and we didn't see him for the best part of two years.

For someone to have a really bad illness like that and then even return to football is a great story and credit to Fletcher but it's unrealistic to expect him to return as the same player at such an intense level. Ideally he should retire and be kept on in same role at the club, maybe even a coach. He's a great character to have around the club but I can't see him starting much especially considering we will strengthen our midfield come the end of the season.

536~~~
With the new signings in midfield, Fellaini showing signs of life and some of the youngsters we have as well it wouldn't really make sense to renew his contract when it expires in the summer. Have a lot of respect for him not only for coming back from the illness but for transforming himself from a player who was ridiculed to one of our most reliable performers in big games. I think he should carry on elsewhere, a move to Celtic would be good for him and would allow him to play regularly and stay in the Scotland squad, he may as well enjoy couple more years playing regularly rather than sitting on the bench and one day he might come back and join the coaching staff.

537~~~
He's done as a player for a big club I think. He looks too far off the pace. I'm not even sure he's a Premier League player at the moment with the current level of quality/competitiveness.

I think he could do really well in the Championship though, his experience would be valuable for an ambitious promotion-chasing side. That said, I'd like him to hang around in some sort of coaching capacity ideally.

538~~~
If he had an opportunity to play for Celtic and wanted that I'd wish him well, despite the fact I think he seems to offer some leadership behind the scenes here. If he can get to lead Scotland at an International tournament he might see that has a great finale to his return and come back here as a coach afterwards.

539~~~
I find it ridiculous people saying he should retire. He is only 30 and has worked his ass off to get through his illness and get back on the pitch. No way should he just hang up his boots.

540~~~
He can stay as long as he likes. He's willing to sit on the bench or in the team, that's good enough for me.

541~~~
His best qualities were always his drive, determination and work-rate. He wasn't a brilliant technical player by any means but his energy made him invaluable. 

Now that he's lost that I don't really see a place for him. It's a shame and I wish that wasn't the case but I'd be surprised if he was here next year.

542~~~
The ultimate servant of the club. I guarantee he has taken on the Evra/Rio/Vida role of being the go-to guy for the newbies.

543~~~
His leadership, experience and club know-how will be important behind the scenes, agreed. I think he'll leave next summer, in search of the first team football he deserves, but holding on to him until then should prove to be a good decision.

Considering we have lost so many players that truly understood what being a United player is all about, retaining Fletcher until the new management and players have had a year to fully settle in should prove wise.

544~~~
Completely agree. I may be wrong but I think Fletcher and Rooney are the only 2 players who are still here and joined in there late teens. They know, moreso than any other player, what it's like to join such a big club at such a young age and Fletch, particularly, knows what it's like to have a tough time.

545~~~
no problems with him being a squad player, but can't really see him influencing things like he used to.

making him vice captain was mad, as he'll rarely be anywhere near the pitch

546~~~
He doesnt have to play every game to be an important player in the squad. People are so desperate to sell or retire every player that is not a starter on every match.

547~~~
Sorry his time is over Old Trafford.

548~~~
Or it was clever, no? It saved Van Gaal the job of explaining why he had to choose between Rooney and Van Persie for captain and vice captain. Van Persie is our vice captain in all but name, but it isn't really a major talking point seeing as Fletcher quite sensibly fills that role. Whether he plays or not doesn't really matter.

549~~~
When I bumped the thread that is not what I said, it's got nothing to do with starting, I think he's fast approaching a point where he wont even make the bench.

550~~~
The yobby sweary know nothing fan who sits behind me kept woefully shouting "it's Fletcher, It's Fletcher coming on" for a couple of mins, when Wilson was coming on.

The idea that Van Gaal would bring a defensive mid on with so little time left when losing was interesting.

551~~~
i was a bit confused about where he played when he came on today?

552~~~
Me too. Did he come on to play at fullback???

553~~~
Smalling was moved to RB I think. He dropped in in midfield or at CB maybe? Either way it wasn't the best cameo, gave the ball away a lot.

554~~~
at first i thought it was a straight swap for valencia but looked more like smalling dropped into RB

then either Fletch played CB or Carrick moved to CB and fletch in mid

all seemed like unnecessary reorganisation anyway

555~~~
Afraid to say he needs to be moved on in January and hopefully we can get Strootman.

556~~~
Agreed. He seems like he's unable to play in our system anyway. Reached his end I feel.

557~~~
Why the rush? Vice-captain and our current longest-serving player that rarely gets any minutes. Probably a influential person in the dressing room also. Don't forget we're unlikely to get anything for him. Is this the way to treat a club player like him? Atleast give him the rest of the season unless he himself wants to move on before that. I rather let him stay for as long he likes.

558~~~
That's not how football works. 

By your logic we should have kept Rio as he wanted to stay. Despite his performances going downhill. But hey ho he's been here 10 years he can stay for how long he wants. Or let's get Sir Bobby back as I'm sure he fancies a kick about. 

This sentimental bollocks needs to stop. His performances aren't good enough anymore. Even his cameos.

559~~~
He was awful even in his few minutes.......too slow in Hull's last attacking move (Rojo saw the yellow in the end of that i think) and then his awful simple pass to Smalling

He was great for us and a shame about his illness but <a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a>
is 100%......This sentimental bollocks needs to stop

We're a football club (Yeah more a family club)......i rather see Pearson, Pereira or a new signing in his place

He must really go in the next 6 months......maybe even in January.....sorry Darren

560~~~
He wasn't awful, he was fine. But there's really no point giving him these little pointless cameos. Get a youngster on the bench and give them a run-out instead, that would be infinitely more valuable.

He went into Carrick's position, Carrick dropped into Smalling's, and Smalling replaced Valencia at FB. Can't think what the point was other than that Van Gaal didn't want to risk our last semi-appropriate RB once the game was won.

561~~~
Its a shame but he's not up to the pace any more. All he could really do in his cameo was pass the ball backwards because by the time he'd got it under control and out of his feet Hull had already closed him down. A couple of times he didn't even manage that and lost the ball or was forced into a poor pass. Give him a coaching role or something if we're being sentimental, but get him out of the match day squad.

562~~~
I can see why van Gaal brings him on, with his experience to see out matches. Once Blind is fit and on the bench though (assuming he doesn't displace Carrick or play with him) I assume it will be his role.

563~~~
IMO, Blind has been our best outfield players.
I doubt that he will be on the bench if fully fit.
With regards to Fletcher - IMO he isnt good enough to play in the Premiership (PL). Maybe the Championship, but not the PL.
I'm not 100% sure what LvG sees in him, but LvG knows far more than any of us...

564~~~
He's backup to Carrick and Blind I guess. In case both of them gets injured.

I'll rather have Pereira starting, I think he'll perform better than Fletcher as of now and Anderson is just Anderson. But obviously you can't throw a youngster with no PL experience straight into the team and expect him deliver.

565~~~
Given that we've got Blind, Carrick and probably Fellaini ahead of him in the DM pecking order he's perfectly capable. Barring an(other) injury crisis he'll rarely play and he's only gotten minutes so far because one of Carrick or Blind have been injured/roped in to cover for injured defenders.

566~~~
He's past it thanks to health problems. I believe it would be better to sub Valencia for Blackett and play him a few minutes at left back (or Rojo) with Young taking Valencia's place.

567~~~
Just stop bringing him on. Awful as always.

568~~~
Arnautovic got past him way too easily.

569~~~
Lost his pace and strength, should have done better before the Young foul which could have cost us.

He seems more of a liability than a calming figure currently.

570~~~
Two games in a row Fletch coming on has actually made us worse rather than better. After the U.S. tour I thought we'd see him back to his old self, or at least something like it, but whatever he was introduced for it failed. Really off the pace sadly. His introduction coincided with Stoke's onslaught. Coincidence? I doubt it.

571~~~
He won't be here next season

Surely......

572~~~
He's done. But this is nothing new. Need Blind back ASAP as he is a better option of the bench.

573~~~
Yeah I don't see the point in bringing him on anymore apart from when the game is won and we want to give someone a rest. We're better off asking Herrera to just sit deep instead.

574~~~
Seriously. That decision to bring him on could have cost us the game. That for me is a huge concern about LVG.

575~~~
Finished as a United player. Bloody unfortunate.

576~~~
Yeah that was terrible 'defending'.

577~~~
Wasn't really a need to bring him on. If we're going 4-4-2, Herrera or Fellaini can sit next to Carrick.

578~~~
Yeah, sorry to say that he doesn't look up to it anymore. Too bad.

579~~~
I can only assume he's a real calming influence for the other players, because he offers nothing physically. Sad to see, but he really is finished at the top level.

580~~~
Zero point to him. Doesn't offer any protection and doesn't help us keep the ball.

581~~~
Awful. Even Anderson could do more, and no that isn't a joke.

582~~~
The Sottish Pirlo, came on and dictated the game for Stoke! just kidding! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> Eh, he just doesn't have the legs to come on when we face pressure, he's too easily brushed off the ball and hasn't got the legs to cover space, if anything he makes the last 10 minutes more nervy as he's a glaring weak spot.

583~~~
He's genuinely terrible these days. I'm sorry but he is.

584~~~
It's worrying when he comes on these days. Only when we're 2 or 3 up please.

585~~~
I'm guessing he'll retire in the summer.

586~~~
I genuine think Ben Pearson would do a better job than him now - and that's already taken into account the massive difference between U21s and first team football.

587~~~
I don't like how LVG puts him on all the time in the end. Usually for players who played pretty well too, and sometimes when United are getting pegged back which results in a messier finish that could have easily been avoided.

It's sad how much he regressed, Carrick should really have been our vice captain.

588~~~
He just needs to bulk up again.  If he is healthy then he just needs to hit the gym and work his way back to fitness.

That's the Fergie way.  Van Gaal would be forgiven he if he were to bring in his trusted compatriot, Strootman, to solve this problem.

589~~~
I'm not sure what to do with him, as I don't think he's good enough to play for us anymore but I would like him to remain in and around the dressing room. I know it's a bit Mourinho that van Gaal likes to bring him on late in the game to see it out, but I don't really have a problem with it. He's an intelligent player and someone van Gaal obviously trusts.

590~~~
Time for Fletch to move on and Pearson and Perriera to be promoted to the 1st team

591~~~
I've been disappointed in Fletcher. He seems to be off the mark this season. It seems to me that he's not cut out for Man. Utd. anymore and needs to move on to a lower club that would play him regularly.

592~~~
Not to disregard his service, absolutely fantastic but he will be phased out and replaced with potentially Pearson.

593~~~
No, we should let him stay as long as he likes.

594~~~
Why? This sentimentality needs to go.

595~~~
Realistically, Fletch isn't going anywhere anytime soon. He's an experienced and valuable squad player to have.

596~~~
this.

and he has been bloody awful lately..<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

597~~~
Because he's a better option than Anderson and by all accounts is important off the pitch. It's a squad's game, what's the harm in keeping him? We're having a season where Valencia, Young and Fellaini are getting plaudits after 95% of the fans wanted them gone in the summer. Surely we're not that daft that we judge Fletcher after a few appearances under a new manager? At least wait till May before demanding he retires. People don't learn, it's ridiculous.

598~~~
Hopefully you're right. But I do trust the club to do the right thing, I do think Fletcher will remain with us in some capacity.

599~~~
He's definitely one of those players the club will try to accommodate for as long as possible - mainly due to his attitude and experience. I can see Fletch staying with us for another 2-3 years before being given a coaching role.

600~~~
Yep, we may even accommodate him as some form of a coach within our youth setup.

601~~~
And your attitude is the reason Anderson is still drawing a substantial wage packet at the club

"He's good in the dressing room" does not vindicate being included in the squad, might as well sign a comedian to sit on the bench while we're at it

602~~~
I was joking. See previous page.

603~~~
No, we need some older heads now we've offloaded most of our experience. Comparing that to Anderson is moronic. Also if you actually read my post I said Fletcher is a better option (on the pitch) than Anderson.  That's two reasons for preferring Fletcher to Anderson. My main point was a different one though, Fletcher should be given at least this season to prove his worth to LVG (and to prove to himself he can still contribute). Luckily I think LVG agrees with me and not you there.

And why are we as fans bringing wages into this, especially when it's someone who's not on a massive wage?

604~~~
Problem with this logic is, that generally when Fletcher comes on late in games we actually lose control of them and start to concede chances and all round just look far worse as a team. Experience is all well and good, but you need the body and skill still to be able to back it up, and sadly Fletcher isn't able to do that any more.

I would be happy if we don't see Fletcher come on anymore, and instead move him into a non playing role.

605~~~
It's been evident since the Burnley game. Maybe before, but it certainly stood out in the Burnley game for me.

606~~~
It's a bit painful watching him these days knowing that at one point he was the exact opposite to what he has become now - slow, lethargic and pointless. Should have kept Cleverley tbh.

607~~~
Fletcher is much quicker in the mind than 

Also for his role at the club and their current career stages it's best for both of them.

608~~~
Loyalty is great and everything but I think Fletcher needs to meet the club half way and join the coaching staff with Giggs, that way his influence on the players in training and the dressing room remains, but he no longer takes up a spot that he can't fulfill.

609~~~
Some have suggested Fletcher should join the coaching staff. Does he even have his badges?

610~~~
I wonder how he feels about these little cameos, they almost seem like a sentimental gesture as opposed to something valuable to seeing out games.

611~~~
If he loves United he should quit as a player and join the coaching staff

612~~~
Sadly, looking completely off the pace. But not like we had much of a choice today

613~~~
He's not good enough for any premier league club let alone us.

614~~~
Yeah he's a million miles away from the required standard.

615~~~
Horrible performance so far.

616~~~
Currently offers nothing for us on the pitch unfortunately.

617~~~
Eeschk.

618~~~
He's nowhere near good enough. Give him a coaching job or whatever but the quicker he's off the playing books the better.

619~~~
Sad to see, fully expect him to go this season. It really is like playing without a midfield with him in the side.

620~~~
Lovely guy, has been a great player for us but at the moment he is a complete liability. Sub now.

621~~~
Receive a pass, stop, look around for two seconds, pass it somewhere else. Turtle tempo and lot of predictability.

622~~~
I see Di Maria is on the bench. I hope he gets a 20/30 minute run in place of him.

623~~~
very much last choice in midfield, but he does the basics.

624~~~
His ability to pass the ball out of play, into the middle of nowhere, or to the opposition is quite impressive.

Horrible to see whats happened to him <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

625~~~
Has given the ball away far too much, very poor today.  Certainly shouldn't be starting.

626~~~
He's done.

627~~~
Finished at the highest level and that for quite some time now

628~~~
Oh so that's why people were worrying about him starting in the Matchday thread? Yep, they're the stupid ones... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

629~~~
Sentimentality is the only reason he will stay here. He isn't even a prem player. Send him back to a lesser league.

630~~~
Not good so far.

631~~~
Don't understand why he gets the call up over Herrera. Its mental.

632~~~
He is far from great, but he is still playing much better than so called world class, caf's favourite Mata and Falcao.

633~~~
He should have quit ages ago.

634~~~
Herrera is ill.

635~~~
The rest of the team are actually playing with some intensity I think, it's just whenever he gets it we completely slow down.

636~~~
No, no he isn't. Falcao has made all sorts of clever runs and is getting completely ignored. Fletcher hasn't had a decent pass, block, interception or tackle, yet and the game is completely passing him by.

637~~~
I used to think he could finish his career at Celtic. Doubt he'd get in ahead of Scott Brown playing like that mind.

Unless there's a massive turnaround I can't see this being anything other than his last season here.

638~~~
Rather have Valencia in midfield and Rafael as right back.

639~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

640~~~
Shame.  Two steps behind the pace when Villa counter and offers little going forward.  Carrick should be pushed up into MF.

641~~~
Oh my, thank god he's not a horse.

642~~~
Great guy but just not good enough for this level anymore.

643~~~
I haven't seen anything good from both of them, and I am quite sure I am not the only one. I am sure those two will be first to be substituted.

644~~~
Well, it was to be expected really, but the *******s will still say how he has a lot to offer. He's finished, as harsh as it may sound, and I'm really sorry to say it cause he should be in his prime. What LVG is thinking starting him today is completely beyond me, should play Carrick where he belongs and Fletcher as back-up off the bench.

645~~~
At least he's better than Evans.

646~~~
Perhaps a saving grace of his performance so far has been some decent pressing on quite a few occasions, but that aside, he offers absolutely nothing for a team dominating the ball and looking to probe and create openings. Defensively he's non-existent too.

There is simply no need for him to be here for footballing reasons.

647~~~
Coming in with almost no match practice is difficult. But broadly I probably agree. He looks to be really struggling to play at this level. Physically he looks a yard short and his use of the ball isn't good enough at the moment.

648~~~
That should be his last match for Manchester United ever!!!!!!!!!

Please go Darren!!!!!!!!

649~~~
Bad decision to start him but I'm glad LVG hasn't been stubborn in leaving him on. Should be his last start in any meaningful match for us.

650~~~
We've been playing much better ever since he was taken off.

651~~~
He comes off and suddenly we look better, coincidence?

Please man up Darren and retire or if you want to continue playing then hand in a transfer request and leave in January he isn't even a good squad player anymore

652~~~
My thoughts exactly.

653~~~
Bet you feel like a right cock now.

654~~~
Retire, please.

655~~~
Some embarrassing posts in here.

656~~~
Don't know why I even came in this thread. I was guaranteed to be disgusted by it's contents.

657~~~
It's over I'm afraid. Good luck in the SPL.

658~~~
Sad to say but, it's over for him.

Feel bad for him

659~~~
What has been said that is incorrect may I ask?

660~~~
Not really, I just made a mistake in reading van Gaal's mind, nothing wrong with that. It's more baffling that we were even worse in second half when apparently our worst player was substituted. I thought we were supposed to play much better when we bring Fletcher off, or at least that's what they've told me.

661~~~
Shouldn't start matches anymore, it's too tough for him. Off the bench, when the result has been guaranteed.

662~~~
Think this was one of the last starts he had for United.

663~~~
Nah, you feel like a dick, admit it. Also, you don't know how to watch football if you didn't see a dramatic improvement in our play, when Fletch went off.
If your next post isn't you admitting that you were completely wrong, on all counts, then don't bother replying to me.

664~~~
Nothing is incorrect. We all know he's past it but let's try and have a bit of class about it eh rather than some of the shite said in here.

665~~~
Didn't say anything was incorrect, but calling for a player like Fletcher to retire is certainly embarrassing.

666~~~
Terrible player, shadow of what he used to be, looks like he's only on the books for sentimental reasons.

667~~~
He's unfortunately finished. It's amazing that he's still playing after that illness to be honest.

668~~~
Yeah, we were much better for like ten minutes, and then we were ten times worse. Fair enough, I was completely wrong, and I feel like a dick(please don't reply even though I 'admitted' it).

669~~~
LVG's fault. Fletcher's performance level has been below PL standard all season, so I'm struggling to see why it would suddenly improve.

670~~~
Completely finished which is a shame, but at this level we can't carry anyone, he should do a Neville and retire, give him a coaching role.

671~~~
Just shows how big difference preseason is compared to a real game.

672~~~
yeah hes finished!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

673~~~
There were a lot of people moaning in the matchday thread when they found out Fletcher was starting today, and looking at it now, it seemed that they were right. Bad game from Fletch today. When Blind, Fellaini and Carrick are all fit, I can imagine they'll always be ahead of him, providing we play a holding midfielder.

674~~~
As someone said in the matchday thread, I think he's had his "Neville against WBA" moment.

675~~~
I can understand people getting upset at some of the abuse Fletcher is copping, but he really is crap now. Has no close control and lacks physical presence. We need a new midfielder in January as we'll only struggle with Fletch starting.

676~~~
It's nothing to do with Fletch as a person and I'm sure every single one of us remembers how much he did for the club, but it doesn't take away the fact that he's finished and should be moved on. We can't afford to have passengers like him starting, it's just the way it is if we want to get back to the very top. Getting shot down by fellow caftards in the matchday thread for stating the bloody obvious seems to be a new sport on here – not all of us are spoilt idiots, it's nothing to do with that actually... it's just saying how it is and once again most 'moaners' have been proven right again. Are we also spoilt because we complain about the 3-5-2, while bloody everyone can see it's not working? No. 

I'm really sorry for Fletch, but his time at the club is over, and saying that means no disrespect. LVG got that spectacularly wrong today, and he himself admitted it at halftime, which is rare enough. I doubt we'll see much of Fletch until the end of the season.

677~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Really complacent decision to use him today. Offered nothing at all. No movement, penetration, imagination. Zilch.

678~~~
I think Fletcher has shown a superb attitude to get his fitness back after suffering with illness for so long, but he's not good enough to start for us anymore based on what we've seen this season.

679~~~
Retire now or hand in a transfer request, Fletcher. Either way, you shouldn't play for Manchester United ever anymore.

680~~~
He needn't retire from the sport, that is ridiculously reactionary in fact and arguably disrespectful. Fletcher  may need to find a situation where he'll be afforded more regular football mind, as transitioning from a handful of minutes spread over as many games to that of a starting position is bound to leave an infrequently used player even more out of touch.

Whilst this was probably going to be Fletcher's last season at United, it oughtn't be too much to ask for the fanbase not to regress nearly a decade in its treatment of him.

681~~~
it's not as if he's below "Manchester United" level. He's so clearly not good enough to be playing for any premier league club at the moment. He's looked completely out of his depth every game this season. Makes me wonder how he's doing in training.

682~~~
He'll leave in the summer with our best wishes having proved to be a valuable dressing room asset amongst all of the recent change. He isn't very good anymore and that is a shame as much as it's completely understandable. The "retire now" comments are stupid, however. It isn't Fletcher that cost us points today.

683~~~
He could certainly still be an asset to many teams, but it's an unfortunate truth that he's not able to play well at this level anymore.

684~~~
When I saw his name on the teamsheet today instead of Herrera's I had a bad feeling about today. He'll never get back to the player he was sadly and will be sold in the summer to burnley or West Brom

685~~~
We would've been better off starting Blackett and playing Carrick in CM.

Which says it all really.

686~~~
I don't know why some get so annoyed when people suggest he retire, I don't think he's good enough for any PL team now, the league is just too fast and physical. I'd much rather he retired and went onto the coaching staff as clearly he is well liked and highly respected by the players and could still be an asset to United in a different capacity.

687~~~
Would people stop shouting for him to retire, it's disgraceful

By all means I agree that I think he's probably had his time at United and arguably this level but he could certainly play on in the SPL for example. He's fought hard to come back from a serious illness he deserves to play football for as long as he can!

688~~~
What qualifies him to be on the coaching staff? He's an ex player? So what?

689~~~
I think some people are far too sentimental.
We are the 3rd biggest football club in the World.
The individuals at the club need to be the best at what they do.
Moyes wasnt good enough, so he was sacked.
Fletcher needs to go the same way.
If he can play for another club, then good for him, otherwise he should retire.
During the first half, their were times that he looked like a deer in head-lights. And this was against Aston Villa!

690~~~
Guys, do you think he can be a success elsewhere, for example in Scotland? Personally I don’t think so, I think he’s finished as a player on any level. He looked very good in preseason but now it seems he struggles with any physicality and looks like he’s been on the pitch for 90 minutes since the kick off.

I wish him the very best but I really can’t see anyone being interested in his services.

691~~~
Don't be daft. He'd be great in the SPL.

692~~~
I'm sorry for asking. I have zero knowledge of the SPL.

693~~~
He'll do fine at anyone in the SPL bar Celtic who have to play better players in Europe.

694~~~
Golden Blunder he may deserve to play football but at the suitable level. He's finished at this level as you say but don't pan him of in the sfl for feck sake your a disgrace for even saying this lol

695~~~
Probably just fine, which is why LVG has kept playing him. The slightly lower intensity in training probably hides his deficiencies.

Im grateful for his services and hope he can continue playing somewhere, but he has now slipped into the costing us games territory. He cannot play for us again in my eyes.

696~~~
He's done. Most of us here have known this for a while though. I don't blame him for the performance though. Van Gaal shouldn't have selected him. It's been obvious for ages that he just can't do it anymore. It will be his last season I imagine.

697~~~
I'm aware he only played vs Villa due to a lack of personnel, but somebody has to tell him he's not good enough any longer for a club that wants champions league football.

698~~~
Pretty certain he knows that already. He's what our 7th choice CM? And we're hardly blessed with Bayernesque talent there.

699~~~
How much of this anti Fletcher thing from the Villa game was predetermined by so many deciding he would have a bad game even before kick off?. I am just watching the game again and 15 minutes in he hasnt put a foot wrong. The match thread however was already indicating he was having a stinker. Is there a level of confirmation bias kicking in here?. Decide he is shit and then wait till he makes a mistake and that confirms he is shit?

700~~~
Love Fletch but not sure how he got the nod today.

701~~~
Most have said the same allthe  season......everyone could see that in the first three matches that he's nowhere good enough anymore to play for us.

I think we all love Fletcher and it's great to see he's back on the football pitch........now is important and not the past!!!!

And "He hasn't put a foot wrong" should be never a compliment for a Manchester United player.

He was too slow and he hasn't made a single risky pass.

702~~~
When was that moment where he got the ball just behind the 2 strikers, RVP had spun off and was atleast 10 yards from the nearest CB, ball was zipped into fletch, I rose from my sofa anticipating a simple pass to RVP and fletch couldnt even control the pass.

703~~~
To be honest, I think LVG thought he could get away with starting Fletcher today.  He realized that he had to make the change at half time because Fletcher was ineffective the entire first half.

704~~~
It's a sad day, but if there were any lingering hopes that Fletcher had something left, those hopes were dashed.

Great servant of the club, but he's done.

705~~~
Cant believe Van Gaal choose him without him showing adequate performances in training .. it could very well be a bad day for him at office . 

But the question really is , whether his current ceiling is the level that you want in your midfield .

706~~~
This is exactly the sort of assumption I find baffling. How do you know how he has performed in training?. Have you heard he has been poor in training?

707~~~
He's saying LvG wouldn't pick him unless he performed well in training, I think. 

Fletch was so off the pace though. Hard to watch.

708~~~
Aha, thanks, makes sense.
Hope we give Periera a run at some point for in place of Fletch

709~~~
Do you work for the coaching team? Or are you making shit up?
Why do our fans expect a high level performance from a player who hasn't featured regularly for several months, it seems a player isn't allowed to have a blip these days, if he does he's finished.

710~~~
Yep but it has been obvious for a while now (I suffer the same disease there was no way he was coming back being the same player) especially as his engine was one of his biggest attributes. It will be a mark of where we are when we finally ship out Fletch, Anderson and Evans. They wouldn't get anywhere near the Chelsea squad and that's where we need to get to.

711~~~
If you suffer from the disease then surely you know about Redgrave the olympic Rower?

712~~~
It's not comparable.

713~~~
Why not?

714~~~
Not much else to say than adios Fletch, tempo is way too quick for him in the PL.

715~~~
I think he can still do a job for us, I don’t believe he will start to many games but if we are in Europe next season we will need as many experienced players around as possible. Fans tend to write players off far too quickly these days.

716~~~
Because it isn't, the two sports are entirely different in their demands on the body and mind.

717~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> While I agree fans can be quick to write off players, that's not the case with Fletcher. He hasn't played well since 2010.

718~~~
Well im not the type to do that, but in Fletcher's case i just see him done at this level. He just isn't good anymore.

719~~~
His crappy 'form' goes all the way back to the Burnley game. He was hiding then, unable to get any control of the game.  And it is still clear he is finished.

720~~~
Stack it ended my football career Redgrave is in a different sport. If Fletcher had been a Pirlo then I would expected not much of a drop off but unfortunately for Fletcher he relied heavily on his engine and that has been weakened dramatically.

721~~~
What game are you watching mate. Slow back or sideways passss, passes that went straight to Villa players, losing the ball, constantly breaking up our attacks.

To be fair Evans and others were also dire.

722~~~
The fact LvG hauled him off. I know he did it with Paddy McNair, but he is a kid and an arm round him and reassurance that it was just an off day would have been enough. With Darren age is not on his side and it must have been awful for him.

723~~~
Funny how fans demand loyalty from players but when its other way around,then no space for sentiments etc.I believe that every player has some value,some on the pitch,some off the pitch.

724~~~
He's been a good/loyal servant and has done remarkably well to play again after his terrible illness. He is done here though and I think we should only play him if the entire midfield are injured. Even then though I'd rather see them take a chance on another U21/youth team player.

725~~~
I agree.

726~~~
Unfortunately Darren is only useful for cameo roles and that is sad. I was amazed the LvG thought he would last 90 minutes. If he cannot he will not be much use to any other PL team either. He is a lovely guy and yes he has been brave coming back from his illness, but I think Darren has some serious thinking to do about his future.

727~~~
I'm not saying he's going to be a regular starter, but you have to take into consideration the limited amount of games we have played this season, all going well that won't be the case next year. Having an experienced player who can come on as a sub to give a player a rest or to help the youth players in cup games can only be beneficial.

728~~~
TBH everytime I have seen him play this season, including when he was a starter at the start of the season, he has been poor.
I would rather Adreas Pereira was giving a chance ahead of him now (yes I know hes not a holding player) but Carrick/Blind can do that job.

729~~~
He's been coming off the bench lately and he just makes things worse. I get that he's experienced, but he doesn't offer anything anymore.

730~~~
That certainly did appear to be a policy  many in the matchday thread had adopted yesterday, whether he represented the primary source of the team's difficulties or not. Easier to target the rusty campaigner who used to be ill but he with least attacking responsibility, than the creative players who failed to perform or LVG himself.

I clearly remember matches from last season in which he was praised, it's hardly the norm to go from that point "retire from the sport". It might be that the new regime is incompatible with the sort of environment Fletch needs at this stage in his career, be it the intensity of the training or the scarcity of game time to keep things ticking over if you will. I think some people were being remarkably hasty with their judgements, leastwise with the limited evidence available.


Rowing makes greater demands of both, you mean?

731~~~
If it was me to decide, i wouldn't give him a new contract just so he could play a few cup games and because he is experienced. We need to build a competitive side and also be ruthless to players not good enough.

Good point about that, however that isn't an excuse for him not being good enough for this team.

732~~~
I like Fletcher and I have a lot of respect for him but I do think it's time he hung up the boots. I'm sure he would have some coaching role with us maybe with the youth team as he's a player who the young players could definitely learn a lot from and he would make a good coach. His performance yesterday was just awful, it's a shame because Fletcher was a good player before his illness.

733~~~
I haven't read any of the recent posts in here, but he is, quite obviously, no longer good enough.  If there are any posters arguing that, as I suspect there will be, then they are not good enough either!*



*Usual disclaimer that must be attached to every post about Fletch about how he (seems) a great guy and everything and I have nothing against him as a person and acknowledge he has been a good player for us for (some) of his 10-odd years here.

734~~~
When is his contract up?

735~~~
This summer <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

736~~~
I remember last season on here when I put his name forward on the list of players who needed to leave in the summer (along with a few others who are proving their worth this season admittedly) and most, except Pogue I think,  called it disrespectful lunacy. It isn't just this season, he has looked off the pace since his return I believe. 

He is now in liability territory sadly.

737~~~
Next appearance vs Yeovil in the FA Cup. Simple.

738~~~
If his contract is up in the summer it might be taken out of his hands. They might just not renew it.

739~~~
Very poor yday. In his defence wasn't really helped out much by Rooney/Mata

740~~~
He's not playing close to the standard required. He's been a loyal servant to club and has been through an extremely tough couple years, don't get me wrong, I love the guy and I'm sure he'd be invaluable asset in some sort of coaching role. Just can't afford to keep giving him minutes when we're trying to be competitive really.

741~~~
I wouldn't even give him that if it was for me. He has done nothing this season to deserve that.

I would reverse the course of the mistake Fergie made ahead of our FA Cup tie with City back then: basically play our most promising midfielder from our youth ranks and sit the veteran out on this one.

742~~~
Yeah, I would like to see Blind (coming back from injury) paired with Pereira in that game.

743~~~
What good could that serve? I'd rather one of our kids got a run out than him.

744~~~
Thought he was OK yesterday. Not his fault that the centre of the pitch was so congested, and he's never been a massively creative player. He still showed more urgency and effort to get the ball forward than some of our players.

745~~~
The reason he is still in the squad and playing is- in my opinion- mainly because of sentimental reasons. What else does he offer to this team? I don’t feel safe when he comes on the last 15 minutes. That might be harsh but that’s the way it is. Obviously he has a value for the team, but right now playing him against any EPL opposition is risky.*

746~~~
Think that's a given and rightly so. Football is a business and Fletcher is not at the standard required now.

747~~~
He just is not at the level that we need, could continue at a lower team or a smaller league.

748~~~
Well i dont know whats going on outside official matches,on training ground,in locker room,how other players see him and his role among that group,i can only guess but i wont.If they keep him around,then he must have some value to us if not on the field then off the field.

749~~~
I guess we both agree he should be kept off the field then.

750~~~
While you can obviously feel bad for him on a personal level - he became ill when had finally, relatively briefly, actually been United quality - he's also been paid a rather impressive salary for the past 3 years basically without doing his 'job'.

So United don't really 'owe' him anything: he's been handsomely rewarded by the club who have shown him far, far more loyalty than almost any other player I can think of. When you consider we got rid of players like Brown and O'Shea - who have contributed far more to our success in the first team than Fletcher over the years - but kept Darren despite his illness...makes you wonder why to be honest. What did Fletch do to inspire so much loyalty that so many others did not?

751~~~
No.

We should play a strong team and try win the FA Cup. Been too long.

752~~~
Was it so very brief?

For several years at least he was one of those unsung players whom Fergie could rely upon when facing top opposition like Arsenal or Chelsea. You also appear to be writing off last season as if those individual performances were a shambles from start to last, which doesn't square with the reaction on here IIRC.

Now maybe he doesn't start games for us much this season, but if he can secure enough minutes on the pitch to regain form then he can still be a calming force should we want someone to help us close out the game IMO [he seems to be a good organiser and possess some tactical awareness in that way].

753~~~
Because he's a human being and its the decent thing to do?

I don't see how you can have the gall to criticise a club for not being callous and petty in this day and age.

754~~~
I reckon on the whole, although of course not entirely his fault due to the illness, that he has been a poor player, by United standards anyway, for more time than he has been a good Manchester United player.

As far as loyalty from the club is concerned, he has gotten a great deal from the United. He's been with us more than 10 years, off the top of my head, I'd say he's had perhaps 2 good seasons, maybe 3, I don't know, and also spent a fair bit of time being quite some way off the requisite standard. When you consider the players that have left us in that time, he's been treated fantastically. If he were to join Hull or St. Mirren in January, he cannot leave feeling he's been done harshly here. As much as people hate the suggestion, I think it is clear that Fergie had felt some sort of particular loyalty towards him, certainly one that exceeded his talents.

755~~~
agree pretty much. if not for his illness I think he way well have progressed as a player. I think he will do well in a lower league.

756~~~
Apologies.  wrong choice of words from my side. What I meant was, LVG wouldn't pick someone up just for his reputation , without him showing adequate performances in training . <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

757~~~
Yes it was very brief.
He's been out for three years, had two seasons where he was decent, and prior to that I thought his real name was "fecking" Darren Fletcher they way other fans talked about him.

758~~~
Ah makes more sense, and I agree.

759~~~
I love Fletcher but LVG need to drop him out of the 18-man squad until he has shown some improvement or someone buy him.He didn't really offer anything when coming off the bench either so the "experienced" bit is clearly overrated.

760~~~
Fletcher confuses me, he was excellent pre-season but unlike players like Young and Valencia he has not taken that form into the league season. On our US tour Fletch was arguably our best player, yet now he seems unable to make even the simplest passes. You have to think its a confidence issue. I get what people are saying about the speed and pace of the game, but its one thing to lose mobility its another to lose the ability to hit a straight pass. Its odd too because from the outside it feels like LVG has tried to boost his confidence e.g. making him a team captain etc. Maybe something else is going on with him? Maybe he's worried about his contract situation?

761~~~
Was pish to be honest.

762~~~
He's done at the highest level. The sooner we accept that the better. We're not a charity organisation, this is high end sports and we just can't afford to have players who can contribute anything positive to our team.

763~~~
I think he knows his time is almost up. Gary Neville retired in the middle of the season and Giggs has talked about performances that are so bad that made him consider doing that. Fletcher knows the standards expected of him, and I think he realizes that unless he steps up that he's leaving soon. I feel sorry for him to be honest, but for the good of the team and himself, he needs to reconsider his playing days.

764~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2211746/darren-fletchers-future-looks-unlikely-to-be-at-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchest...ure-looks-unlikely-to-be-at-manchester-united</a>

765~~~
Usual outcome. He enters the pitch and suddenly team plays a bit shit.

766~~~
He's been a great servant to this club and its premature to declare him finished but can we stop pretending he's good enough to be getting minutes right now?

767~~~
I really have no idea why Van Gaal continues to persist with him.

768~~~
The only thing I can think of is that LVG wanted to give Carrick a rest and didnt really have anyone else to bring on. Still, we could have put on Rojo or someone and moved Jones into midfield perhaps, or just brought on another striker.

769~~~
Really don't understand this type of mentality. Our performance towards the end of the game wasn't Fletcher's fault. We were winning 3-0 at home. While it may not be pleasing for some supporters, it made sense for us to keep the ball.

770~~~
Finished. Absolutely baffled as to how he got on ahead of Pereira who, at 18 years of age, is already a superior player.

771~~~
If Herrera or Fellini were on the bench they would've come on not fletcher. He was brought on to give carrick a rest for Spurs game simply because we had nobody else.

772~~~
Great servant for the club and it's a shame his return has not lived up to how he was before his illness but he doesn't pick himself to play LVG does so if his trying his best that's all we can ask for from him.

773~~~
Difficult to judge today, we'd taken our foot off the gas and then removing our best CM and the movement of Falcao in quick succession really took our game down a few notches, it was not merely that Fletcher stepped on the pitch, I didn't really notice him lose the ball or get brushed off it easily as has been the case in most games this season.

774~~~
Championship player

775~~~
Who else do we have in the holding midfield role? He's probably our best backup to Carrick. Jones is the closest but not sure if we should be moving him around again.

776~~~
Keep the ball ? You mean like after Fletcher's feck up where he leaves only McNair against charging Newcastle player and De Gea must again do his 150% ?

I'm sorry but people saw enough already to start making conclusions. Now tell me we'll use him against Tottenham with a straight face.

777~~~
Probably did want to give Carrick a rest, so important in the midfield whilst Blind is out and we've two games in quick succession. As for Flecher, he was sloppy on the ball at times and almost gifted them a goal but for me it's not so much him coming on that's an irritant as much as it's Januzaj or Pereira not coming on and getting minutes.

778~~~
So LVG made some changes to help with the management of the squad during a congested period in the fixture calendar, introduced Fletcher at a time when were already 3-0 up and looking to see out the game, and this pretty much came to pass. 

I'm aware of one error which led to a save from De Gea but then we were also vulnerable to such in the first half, only Newcastle failed to be threatening/Jones didn't concede a penalty.

779~~~
It's like he's won a competition. We may as well just play with 10 men if we want to rest Carrick; or just play a random youth player. 

People may say it's disrespectful but please just put him out to pasture;  it's like watching Bruce Forsyth cracking jokes and people are only giving him a sympathy "heh".

780~~~
Barely put a foot wrong and he's being lambasted. At that stage of the game no one was doing much attacking. We were in a mode to see out the game. He helped in that and provided an option for defenders to pass to and helped keep possession.

781~~~
He made a pass which went out straight to throw-in, at that precise moment I really felt bad for him. He is completely finished at this level.

782~~~
Pretty much this.

No reason to give him shit, he's simply past it and he's played because our other mifield options are injured/can't play the holding role. I suppose that it would be Fellaini playing at CDM again if he wasn't ill.

783~~~
Dude, you can't use the same excuse every game.
What about against Villa, when he was on the pitch and we went behind and needed to score?
LvG took him off, as he was so bad. The problem is that LvG brought him back today and once again, a poor performance.

When was his last good performance? Does anybody know?

784~~~
He wasn't too bad today, still looked off the pace though. I'd hate it if he becomes a complete liability.

785~~~
fair enough.  love the fella. but I think his playing days for a Prem side are over.

786~~~
You're attributing our poor performance towards the end with Fletcher coming on. He completed around 97% of his passes, which is far more useful than you isolating one particular incident to disprove a point. Fwiw, I don't think he's good enough even as a squad player for us. Whenever he comes on, he doesn't really do much and is often bypassed. His strongest point is probably his pressing which says a lot about the decline he's endured.

787~~~
What match did you watch? Probably some match from 2009.

788~~~
I've not used that excuse ever before. In fact, that was my first post in this thread, and I don't rate Fletcher any more. He's patently past it. However, it's silly to blame our performance towards the end on him coming on the field.

789~~~
In the face of team that LVG is trying to build with quality depth and ability to win major trophies also in Europe, it's gonna be only harder for Darren to start even in this type of matches unless we'll see a progress like with Young which I'm not saying it's impossible... but it's really hard to see a light in the tunnel.

790~~~
Because he was passing it to Mata who had moved just as the pass was made. FFS.

791~~~
He was bad against Villa yes but he was fine today. As simple as that.

792~~~
Yeah right.

793~~~
It's hard to see Fletcher having much of a future with us but could people try to be fair and not biased against him?

794~~~
The game was pretty much a formality when he came on, and Newcastle were hardly pressing us, yet he still made a fair few mistakes even under no pressure. That is not good enough.

It is not like he is performing much better than our youth prospects. If we want to take risks, I would rather we atleast give some youngsters a chance. Pearson or Rothwell could have done as well.

795~~~
Think you need to watch that bit again. He was passing the ball back to Mata but there was a mixup between them.

796~~~
His only role when coming on really was to see us through the game so to be fair he's basically doing his job if you don't notice him. That said, the only time I remember seeing him was when he gave it away (twice) and dallied on the ball meaning De Gea had to make a save. That's as unbiased as I can be.

797~~~
LVG needs to stop tarnishing Fletcher's place in our history by still playing him - put a youngster instead. The guy just doesn't have it anymore, which is really sad to see.

798~~~
I agree that fletcher is past it, but the first part to your sentence is completely wrong. Why is LvG tarnishing Fletcher's place in history again? Any fan worth their salt knows what Fletcher used to bring to the team, and no amount of bad performances will take away the memories he once gave us. Unlucky for Fletcher he's been sick, battled through and come back. That in itself is a credit to the lad's determination, and I'm gutted for him that it isn't working out as of yet. Remember though, Fletcher still wants to play for United, so when he takes to the field the responsibility is in his own hands to play well. 

Perhaps LvG seen how well we were strolling today and seen this as a great chance to install some much needed confidence back into Darren's game?

799~~~
You are probably right but, people often only remember the most recent performances. I think he was a very good footballer before he got ill but, a lot just remember him as a destroyer/harrier only type. Now he can't even do that part well enough. 

Also, when we are strolling, it would be a great opportunity to give a younger player a chance if Fletcher is not in our long term plans.

800~~~
The sooner Blind comes back, hopefully the lesser we can see of him on the pitch. Wonderful servant but he just cannot run around coughing up the ball at the slightest hint of pressure while playing as a defensive midfielder.

801~~~
I feel sorry for him. He's obviously wants to do so well and cares about the club. He's a proud man so his performances must be hurting him or at least how much he has fallen off the scene but he will keep thinking he can turn this around and that he is a good game away from becoming the player he was but that's just not the case.

I can see him going to Celtic at the end of the season but his time is up here at least in a playing sense. Fantastic servant and a true pro so if he wants to retire then we should be doing everything to keep him on in some sort of role within the club.

802~~~
It's difficult to be too harsh when his career should be over after what he's been through, but his career IS over at this level.

803~~~
Yeah not a good cameo from Fletcher today. Still we have plenty of options in the midfield it is just Hererra and Blind are both out of contention currently. He won't get a look in when all of our options are back.

804~~~
Too many mistakes come from him these days. I'm sure he'll try and do a job for us every time we pick him but he must know that he's running out of time here. We're grateful but can't afford to let sentiment cloud our judgement. His bottom level is only get lower with time.

805~~~
He couldn't play a simple pass, he is just too slow + he has made a <b>massive mistake</b> against Ayoze in the 78th minute.

If he would have at least one decent game this season then i could a little bit understand if someone says "I don't understand this type of mentality"
But he was awful in every match this season....and that is a fact!!!!

806~~~
Too many are a bit apologetic with Fletcher, and you can see why. But he's just not very good now is he?

I look forward to Blind's return.

807~~~
Its a real shame. I still think our defeat in the 2009 final was down to us missing him in midfield, would have been the perfect player alongside Carrick.

Still i think its evident that we cant even call upon him and IMO is another one to let go - all apart of trimming the fat

808~~~
Can't put the fact we've gone to first gear down to Fletcher, it would have happened anyway. But then, he's hardly used this chance to show what he can do, which is probably because he doesn't have much to offer now. His game was always based on physical abilities and he's lost a lot of that. Not everyone can compensate through gaining other abilities, such as passing, vision, etc.

I don't see why people are complaining about Van Gaal bringing him on today, though. We wanted to give Carrick a breather, a needed a defensive minded midfield and we didn't have other choices. It was well worth it.

809~~~
I actually thought it was one of his better appearances this season, which probably says a lot about what I think of his others. He clearly only came on to rest Carrick and was the only option we have. If Blind, Herrera or Fellaini had been available I have no doubt it would have been them who came in. Fletch is finished, unfortunately.

810~~~
Aside from that one feckup he wasn't bad per se. We did however lose our intensity and tempo the moment Carrick came off for him and completely lacked the ability to recycle play quickly and get it to our forward players in space. A good part of that though was probably down to the planned tactic of suffocating the game and playing it at our own pace in preparation for Spurs.

He's done at this level though and he can't be more satisfied with the way the club has looked after him through his difficulties. Right now, replacing him with Strootman would make us so much stronger in terms of depth.

Carrick, Strootman, Blind, Di Maria, Herrera, Fellaini, Rooney and Mata.

What a difference that would be from a few years ago:

Carrick, Scholes (37), Giggs (38), Fletcher (Ill), Cleverley, Anderson,

811~~~
Re: Strootman
Have you actually watched Strootman recently?
He isn't particularly good since he came back from injury.
He has hardly played any games and is still recovering.
The last game I believe was Roma Vs Sassuolo.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/match/roma-vs-sassuolo/1836375/ratings" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en/match/roma-vs-sassuolo/1836375/ratings</a>

He scored an uninspiring 2/5 (= 4/10)
"A subdued return to the starting lineup for the Dutchman, who lacked the drive to compete"
At present, unless we get him on loan deal (like we had with Falcao, try before we buy).

Roma's best midfielder is probably Pjanic - that's the guy who is worth buying.

812~~~
I've been saying all winter thought that we shouldn't buy him in January so I'm working on the assumption he's working his way back from an 8 month lay off and will be back to his best by the end of the season - which is when we move for him.

813~~~
Didn't look good today, but for a 3rd string DM he's doing his job well enough. 

He looked sharp for most of the pre-season. He needs to get back to that level to play legit minutes here. 

If he wants to play more, I think he'd start for a few Prem teams lacking in anything adequate at DM. Karl Henry stars for QPR now. Burnley's players are mostly bad. There will be 3 new teams up needing Prem experience. Also a team like Sunderland or Newcastle who have a pretty good DM but could use more depth there.

814~~~
though i understand blind is not available but i think this is still no good to deploy fletcher into the no 6 role.  the responsibility to shield defenders and to coordinate the play is too big a job to him now i think.  the pressure could only make him to commit more errors.

i think fletch is still okay to come in for one of the other midfielders role though.  definitely there is less pressure to playing there and would have received more cover

815~~~
He was shocking but I'd rather he get minutes when we are 3-0 with a game in 2 days time than come on when we have a slender lead.

816~~~
Was a decent performance. His best of the season. By no means terrible. Standard redcafe response in this thread to a single bad error, late in the game. "OMG, he was shite!"

817~~~
I'm a bit surprised we don't have a young midfield prospect he's willing to try, it's not like we were a danger to concede 3 in the last 10 minutes.

818~~~
Hate to say this but I think he should be moved on, because when/if he players, he is probably going to cost us points. He doesn't offer anything and is taking up valuable minutes that Pierrera, Januzaj could be using imo.

Unfortunately I just knew he was going to have a mare up yesterday, and he pretty much gifted Newcastle a goal scoring opportunity out of nothing.

819~~~
Another unconvincing performance from him so far. Seems to have lost so much composure these days.

820~~~
Watching him is becoming embarassing almost. If he was a horse he'd be staring down the barrel of a gun.

821~~~
Not good at all today. Looks like he should be warming up for Yeovil.

822~~~
Another day, another rubbish performance.

823~~~
That's an understatement I've seen sunday league midfielders that are better

824~~~
If anyone thinks he was decent today, then they must have extremely low expectations. I love Fletcher and he's been a brilliant servant, but he's just not up to it anymore. There's no need for people to keep on defending his performances. No one is slagging him off as a person or saying that he hasn't been a brilliant servant, but he just isn't up to it anymore.

825~~~
Really poor, yet again.

826~~~
That is shocking from him again again again

He isn't the only one.....but he plays that level since the start of the season

827~~~
Retire now

828~~~
Not this again.

829~~~
surely he knows he's done now. might be his neville moment.

a shame, i like fletcher, but he's lost too much.

830~~~
Erm what? Did you read my post?

831~~~
What's wrong with that?

832~~~
I don't know how many times I've read that Fletcher's been a great servant, and I still don't understand how it's the case.
I agree with the rest of your post though. Nice guy, nothing bad can be said against him, but it's time for him to go down a level or two or retire.

833~~~
He was an instrumental part of a-lot of our recent success and has been at the club since he was a youngster. He always strikes me as a model professional and was a very good player in his prime. Of course he's been a great servant. 

I don't believe on keeping players based on sentiment and he definitely isn't up to it anymore. That was really the tone of my post. I would understand you picking out that point if the tone of my post was about he's been a great servant and we should give him games because of that - but I clearly said the opposite.

834~~~
I'm sure he sees the writing on the wall.  No way he could still believe he can still make it at this level. 

Time to move on.

835~~~
I love fletch and thank him for every effort that he has done.

But when Blind comes back and we hopefully sign Strootman he retires with grace and gets a great sendoff at the end of the season.

836~~~
He should do a gary neville.

837~~~
I would agree that he has been a great servant. Came through and stayed when the fans were against him and he was made a bit of a scapegoat. Persevered and broke into the first team, became a solid partner for Carrick in the middle for a few years until his illness.

Not really sure why it is being questioned - why would you say that he <i>hasn't</i> been a great servant?

Not excusing his performances this season of course - he is finished and needs to retire, that is similarly not in question.

838~~~
Was good making quite a few nice interceptions and lay offs for Yeovil. Not so good for Man Utd though.

839~~~
Well I'm not being funny but that's your problem, and if you don't understand how he's been a good servant to this club then it's not worth trying to explain it. 



Back to today, I would say that a performance like that should make it obvious to LVG that he shouldn't be playing any longer, but I'd have thought for sure he'd be the one to make way for Di Maria so who the feck knows.

840~~~
Okay, fair enough.

841~~~
He brings everyone around him down to his level. Sad to say but true.

842~~~
Physically he just isn't at the races at all now, his awareness of what's going on around him and his passing isn't near good enough either. A mere shadow of the player he once was sadly.

843~~~
I would just say he did nothing out of the ordinary. He had a manager who believed in him, was given a chance and played games for the club. A club where it's a no-brainer to stay at, if the manager favours you.

Nothing more or less. He's a nice guy on top of that. Great servant doesn't really come into it for me.

844~~~
Not good enough anymore, not much more to be said.

845~~~
Complete passenger today - except for the times he set up nice attacks for Yeovil. Think it's about time he conceded that he's never going to be a United player again. A great fighter no doubt, but sadly that's not quite enough. On current form I'd much rather see just about any youth player ahead of him.

846~~~
He's finished really. Had a really poor game.

847~~~
I cant see LvG keeping him past next summer. I think depromoting him as vice captain was the first indication of that, the rest has been how little hes played since the start of the season

848~~~
Usually the person holding in midfield or at the bottom of the diamond is just tasked with keeping passing moves ticking. Fletcher played the role the opposite way today. Instead of keeping moves ticking, he killed them dead looking for passes to players directly behind him

849~~~
I'm really, really sorry, but he is completely shot and finished now. He should never ever play for us again, as harsh as it sounds. Those Yeovil midfielders outplayed him today, there really is nothing more to say.

850~~~
The position he plays is a crucial one. Unfortunately, he cannot be trusted with the responsibility that comes with that position.

His United days are over. Thanks for the memories, Darren.

851~~~
He endured a lot of time where he was not first choice and potentially even out of favour, he showed loyalty and it was returned by SAF. I can't think of many players who do something "out of the ordinary" - by your logic here, Giggs and Scholes wouldn't be classified as 'great servants' either, they had a manager who believed in them and stayed at the club where it is a no brainer to stay.

I would suggest your definition is flawed.

852~~~
Yeah he's done, has struggled in every game he's played. He might want to keep playing so he should either go to a lower club or just retire, sadly the illness took too much out of him.

853~~~
Really looks like the end. It's a shame that his illness struck just as he was hitting his peak but the player he is now is of very little use to us.

854~~~
The time a very high ball came to him summed up his contribution IMO. Some of our more technical players would've at least tried to bring it down, but Fletcher just aimlessly headed it back into midfield.

855~~~
Awesome vision to pick out Herrera to earn himself an assist. Vision.

856~~~
What did he do today that Pearson couldn't have done?

857~~~
Irrelevant of past injuries , illness ect I can't honestly see fletcher starting again once blind is fit .
It's sad to say but an oil tanker can turn quicker .

858~~~
Perhaps it is flawed. I personally don't give a <i>huge </i>amount of credit to Scholes and Giggs for staying at United for so long. I praise them for being good enough, for having the work ethic to remain good enough, and for their conduct, amongst other things. Perhaps that actually <i>is </i>the criteria you, and others, have for being a great servant. In which case it's just a case of my definition being off.

And taking it back to Fletcher, I don't see his actions when he wasn't a first choice player as showing loyalty. But that's just me I guess.

859~~~
It's just sad to see what the injury robbed him of. I don't think he's as bad as he looked today at all and if he played a long run of games he'd be more comfortable but it's pretty obvious now that he's not really capable of playing at the level we need. I hope - if the rumours about him not getting a new deal when his expires at the end of the season - he can find a club where he can play and enjoy the last few years of his career in good health. He's a good lad, Fletch, and he deserves it.

860~~~
I still don't get how he looked so good in pre season. Granted playing friendlies against half fit teams isn't a proper barometer of quality, but even accounting for that, the drop since the season proper started has been shocking.

861~~~
Well then we appear to have reached an impasse. Either way, he definitely shouldn't be in the first team going forwards.

862~~~
Aye, it's strange. Just goes to show the huge drop-off in intensity in non-competitive games. I'll be taking pre-season form with an even bigger pinch of salt from now on.

863~~~
Pre season and reserve football.

864~~~
A passenger these days unfortunately. Thanks for your service Fletch, but you shouldn't be with us next year.

865~~~
Just can't win the 50/50's against even a League One side which was such a big part of his game, and his passing is terrible any time he tries anything but a safe sideways ball. It's a sad situation for him but he is completely done as a United player.

866~~~
He's finished, unfortunately

867~~~
Is he even SPL level?

868~~~
Almost certainly.

869~~~
Really poor and shouldn't start games for us anymore. He can come on in the last 10 mins but other than that he isn't up to it anymore unfortunately

870~~~
How does he keep getting appearances for us? Even with injuries, just play one of the kids instead or something.

871~~~
As far as I recall, Fletch & Scholes worked, Carrick & Fletch usually resulted in crap midfield performances.

872~~~
The Club will most likely let his contract run out before offering him some sort of role within the Club. I honestly think he would rather retire than play for someone else.

873~~~
Fletcher was better than Carrick until his illness which has really derailed his career. Fletcher at his best was awesome in getting up and down the pitch, winning tackles, stifling the oppositions and was handy for some goals. He had a lot of balls which I felt Carrick lacked then. Carrick has got better as he's got older where his composure on the ball and passing is his main role and the more all round game he had to do in his younger years was passed onto others.

874~~~
Sad times to see him struggling. Imagine the mental of strain knowing what was and what his inevitable faith his at United. He should retire and take a coaching role with the youth team(s), if it's an option of course.

875~~~
Some very good ones too. Most memorably when the two of them shat all over Inter, under Mourinho, in Milan.

876~~~
Aye Carrick and Fletch were a terrible partnership for the most part

877~~~
I feel really sorry for him.

878~~~
He wouldn't have been out of place playing for Yeovil. I don't get it, I understand physically he's not the same player but he's struggling to control and pass the ball. Maybe it's just a confidence issue.

879~~~

880~~~
Would be the best thing for him for him to move on if retiring isn't an option for him at the moment. The sad thing is, I don't think he's good enough for anyone in the premier league anymore, but all the best to him if he does leave.

881~~~
I feel sorry for him.

882~~~
Not good enough for West Brom either as far as I am concerned. He'll likely swap our bench for theirs.

883~~~
Let him leave. Regular football would do him good.

884~~~
Dunno, he is returning after long layoff and problems.

Only after a good regular stint will get to know.

885~~~
Let it go. He's been fit for more than a year now. He's done.

Even if what you say is correct, on what basis would WBA want to give him a regular stint in their team? He has looked out of his depth everytime he's stepped onto the pitch in a competitive game, regardless of opposition, for far too long.

886~~~
He has not been fit for over a year. First part was very stop start. Only after summer he has been and he has never played regularly and still LVG has him on the bench regularly due to training i assume.

Not the first time a player returning from long term Injury takes time to recover. And won't be the first time a player looking poor at a big club looks much better after moving.

He definitely isn't good enough for United anymore but if WBA want him and give him a good role then he should take it.

887~~~
We’ve let go Sheazy and Brown to Sunderland when they were still very very good. 

So even if we do love him so much, we must see what is the best for the club, and with Carrick and Blind he can’t compete

888~~~
If he wants to go - let him. He isn't good enough anymore.

889~~~
If he is open to the move at all we should let him go, and smuggle Anderson with him.

890~~~
I seem to recall him being available and playing a fair amount of times under Moyes last season too.

Of course, if WBA can promise him regular footy he should take it, I just see now way he plays ahead of Yacob, Mulumbu or Morrisson in there.

891~~~
Great servant to the club but his playing days are numbered here. If the desire to play on and the illness is under some form of control, then WBA would be a good move under Pulis. 

Should be welcomed back with open arms into a coaching capacity as soon as the career closes however.

Has he had a testimonial?

892~~~
It would be a good decision for both sides. He's been a really good player for us but it's obvious that he can't really compete in the midfield anymore. If he wants to we should do it.

893~~~
Please be true, add Anderson for free

894~~~
In the old days they would have take him out the back & shot him, but in these more enlightened times, he should be put out to pasture.

895~~~
Sad to say, but if the enquiry is true, then we should let him go. Surely he'll want to move as well, seems like the type of person that is too proud to sit on the bench with no real role.

896~~~
If he wants to go? Of course he doesn't want to leave United for West Brom, however he is not good enough anymore so selling him is the only logical solution.

897~~~
Its political correctness gone mad I tell you.

898~~~
Says the horse whisperer. Political correctness also removes the glue factory as an option.

899~~~
I can't see him doing anything for West Brom.

900~~~
He should go to Scotland, unless he has other strings to his bow.

901~~~
Hope he stays until the end of the season, would hate to see him down in the relegation zone. Come summer time hopefully he could get a decent move to Scotland or something.

902~~~
Feck's sake, surely this is all getting a bit much now? Yes, we get it, he's seemingly a nice guy who has had terrible luck with injuries. 'Would hate to see him in the relegation zone?'. It isn't  the Gaza strip down there, it is high level, highly paid, professional football. He'd be fortunate to land in the lower half of the PL.

903~~~
This. Darren Fletcher is no longer good enough for one of the biggest clubs in world football, but still getting a good salary playing regularly at a team fighting relegation in arguably the highest profile football league in the world is hardly Guantanamo. It's more than most footballers achieve in their careers, and Fletcher is stepping down to this nearing the end of his.

If I was Fletcher though I'd feck off to Celtic. The Scottish league is nowhere near the quality of the BPL and he'll be more important for them and his career will last longer up there.

904~~~
If he doesn't leave will he receive the same abuse Cleverley received when we thought he'd turned down Aston Villa?

905~~~
Just personal opinion, wouldn't like to see him scrapping away for them useless bastards. Would like to see him get a cosy move up to Scotland or something similar. All up to him though at the end of the day.

906~~~
No, although Cleverley was a pretty average youth player who never really did much for us. Fletcher was always respected for his work ethic, and will probably not see too much criticism if he decides to stay instead.

907~~~
No, it's much, much worse!<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

908~~~
Absolutely not. There is no emotional connection towards Cleverley like there is Fletcher. Cleverley is seen as a mediocre wage thief by a large portion of our fans. Fletcher has been here most of his life. I'd totally understand if he refused to leave. I wouldnt agree its the best thing for us, but I certainly wouldnt begrudge Darren Fletcher if he believes he's got something left in him.

909~~~
I very much doubt it as the circumstances are so different - he has contributed a lot in the past, his current inadequacies are due to illness and he comes across as very down to earth (never heard of the DF "brand"). The question is probably academic anyway - I think he is honest enough to realise he can no longer play for teams competing for the Premier League and I expect him to leave at the end of the season.

910~~~
Its a bit of a 'sticky' subject for me...

911~~~
Let Him Go, Let Him Go
Give him to Pulis and he'll see
Let Him Go, Let Him Go
He doesn't work in a midfield three

Watch his pass
Just go astray
Bring Craig Gardner on
His bowls always bother him anyway


...That's right, I'm bored.

912~~~
He's no longer a stable option.

913~~~
No, and quite rightly. Leaving United will be massive for him. I wouldn't begrudge him another six months to clarify in his own mind what he wants to do and where to go next. If he does leave this window then all the best to him.

In an ideal world he'd get to say goodbye to the supporters, but that was one of the luxuries of actually being good and winning titles.

914~~~
Its just hoof ball when he starts.

915~~~
He's not even good enough for Raith Rovers at the moment.

916~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

917~~~
Any update on the WBA enquiry?

918~~~
Only Daily Mail, but still, possible enquiry from Valencia:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2916774/Manchester-United-midfielder-Darren-Fletcher-surprise-target-Valencia.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...tml?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490</a>

919~~~
Seems a bit strange to me. If he's nowhere need good enough for us right now, he's not going to cut it for them either.

920~~~
SSN reporting interest from Valencia as well, from their " sources"

921~~~
Only let him go if they take Anderson as well.

922~~~
We could hide Anderson in his luggage.

923~~~
As if he'd fit.

924~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

925~~~
We could make him fit, there are ways.<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

926~~~
What's with Valencia wanting our out of favour players? First Cleverley, now Fletcher. I thought they had a great midfield at the moment with Perez, Parejo and Andre Gomes? It'd be weird for Fletcher to just swap our bench for theirs.

927~~~
Weather is nicer.

928~~~
I would of thought that Moyes would have been on the phone if he knew he was available.

929~~~
Would you say it is a slower pace over there? I don't think Darren can cope with PL pace anymore.

930~~~
He wouldnt get into the Valencia team. Its the same nonsense as the Cleverley story most likely. Valencia's CM is their strong point and they have 4 players all significantly better than he is. He should check out Villarreal down the road, thats more likely

931~~~
Wouldn't get into Villareal's midfield either.

He either needs to go to Scotland or the MLS/Australia or something that level.

932~~~
I mean theres a significant drop off in squad options from Valencia to their local rivals Villarreal. I'm sure he can compete with the likes of Pina as first backup at Villarreal instead of competing with Augusto for being 5th choice CM at Valencia

933~~~
The Telegraph is saying that West Ham want him as well. Seems pretty certain that he'll be leaving this month.

934~~~
Sky Sports say United rejected West Brom's offer to take him on loan for the rest of the season.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/9653356/transfer-centre-west-ham-enter-race-to-sign-manchester-uniteds-darren-fletcher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...ce-to-sign-manchester-uniteds-darren-fletcher</a>

935~~~
Hope so.

936~~~
Big Sam should have had a call from the boss. I mean Fergie for Fletcher: D Well I really can’t explain myself here. I would like to keep him at the club until he retires, I’m a massive fan of him, but few years ago Sheazy and Brown left the club because they weren’t good enough, so it’s probably better for him  to find the right club. This season at West Ham he will not have a lot of football, so it’s may not be the best club.

937~~~
Glad we said know, if they are too cheap to even pay a fee then screw it.

938~~~
I think he could more than do a job at a club who simply ask him to sit deep and use his experience to defend well, and when in possession simply 'water-carry'.

939~~~
TBH he doesn't even seem to be premier league quality anymore.  He misplaces too many passes and just looks for the closest to offload the ball.  Shame how that illness destroyed perhaps our best midfielder from 2007-2010.

940~~~
I'd start a 'Thank you Darren Fletcher' thread but it would decend into a farce and I'll be reprimanded for not knowing better.

941~~~

942~~~
West Brom manager Tony Pulis on interest in Darren Fletcher<b>: </b>"He is talking to three or four clubs. We showed an interest and he'll make a decision and we'll wait and see."

943~~~
Its the right move for him. As sad as it is that he hasn't been able to make it back to the level required at united, it will be good to see him playing week in week out at a lower level. Can only wish him all the luck in the world.

944~~~
<span style="font-size: 18px"><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2257267/a-tribute-to-darren-fletcher-manchester-uniteds-consummate-pro" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">A tribute to Darren Fletcher: Manchester United's consummate pro</a></span>

945~~~
TBH I think he would be best in Europe, perhaps Serie A.  I think he would struggle at any club in PL at this point.

946~~~
I'm not really sure his game would be anymore fitted for any of the other major leagues out there than the PL.

947~~~
He'll surely be on a pretty high wage, and surely isn't capable of playing every game anymore. So it seems surprising premier league clubs are that interested.

He was built on pure workrate, high energy and tackling, and he's not as good at those anymore, so unless there's a much reduced wage it seems hard to see.

948~~~
To be honest I don't really think he'll still cut the mustard at even a lower premier league level. Can't blame him if he wants to try it though, will be the right move for him and us.

949~~~
I think he will go , he needs to go to get the regular football he wants.
I do think he will struggle at even a lower placed PL team, if he does go good luck to him.

950~~~

951~~~
They're giving him three and a half years? That's nice.

952~~~
Good luck Darren, credit to the game but sadly just isn't good enough for us since illness. All the best.

(If reports are true of course).

953~~~
I wish him all the best. I hope it works out for him.

It's the right time for him to move on.

954~~~
All the best Fletch. Good servant to the club.

955~~~
I used to hate seeing him on the teamsheet when he was a youngster. Completely changed my view of him, I wish we had a prime Fletcher in the midfield right now. I hope the West Ham move works out for him.

956~~~
Good for him to get a PL move. Don't expect him to do much to be quite honest, but it's good someone is giving him a chance when it's obvious his career at United is over.

Absolute beast in 2009. That Milan game at OT was something else.

957~~~
All the best to him, if true. He leaves with one of the most inspirational and saddest stories, his rise,  when viewed against the ridicule he received from impatient fans, to one of the best midfielders and to have it all taken away by a terrible illness.

958~~~
Surely we can scrape £1.5 million for him, we seem crap at getting fair value for our players.

Anyway good luck to him, will be interesting to see how he does.

959~~~
the same with me! I was always furious with him at young age but he worked so hard to become one of world's best DM for a season or two, and I loved him since that, shame about his illness it ruined his career, he will never be the same player but wich him all the best wherever he goes. 

I guess he could be a good manager one day he has got great determination and lots of experience gained during his time out of the game..

960~~~
I really don't see him getting a game for West Ham tbh

961~~~
If Kevin Nolan can. Then Fletcher has a chance.

962~~~
Big Sam just confirmed on Sky that he's in talks with Fletcher's agent but is not sure the deal will get done.

963~~~
Wet Ham would be a pretty good move for him, I'm just not sure he can still hack the PL.
